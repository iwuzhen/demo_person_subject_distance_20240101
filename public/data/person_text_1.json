Known in adult life as Hertha Ayrton, born Phoebe Sarah Marks, she was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society for her work on electric arcs and ripple marks in sand and water./nHertha Ayrton was born Phoebe Sarah Marks in Portsea, Hampshire, England, on 28 April 1854. In her youth she went by the name Sarah. She was the third child of a Polish Jewish watchmaker named Levi Marks, an immigrant from Tsarist Poland; and Alice Theresa Moss, a seamstress, the daughter of Joseph Moss, a glass merchant of Portsea.[2][3] Her father died in 1861, leaving Sarah's mother with seven children and an eighth expected. Sarah then took up some of the responsibility for caring for the younger children./nAt the age of nine, Sarah was invited by her aunts, who ran a school in northwest London, to live with her cousins and be educated with them.[1] She was known to her peers and teachers as a fiery, occasionally crude personality.[4] Her cousins introduced Ayrton to science and mathematics. By age 16, she was working as a governess, but she had not renounced her ambitions.[5]/nGeorge Eliot supported Ayrton's application to Girton College, Cambridge. There, Ayrton studied mathematics and was coached by physicist Richard Glazebrook. She also constructed a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure meter), led the choral society, founded the Girton fire brigade, and, together with Charlotte Scott, formed a mathematical club.[1] In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos, but Cambridge did not grant her an academic degree because at the time it did not award full degrees to women. Ayrton then passed an external examination at the University of London, which awarded her a Bachelor of Science degree in 1881.[6][7]/nUpon her return to London, Ayrton earned money by teaching and embroidery, ran a club for working girls, and cared for her invalid sister.[1] She also put her mathematical skills to practical use \u2013 she taught at Notting Hill and Ealing High School, and was also active in devising and solving mathematical problems, many of which were published in \"Mathematical Questions and Their Solutions\" from the Educational Times. In 1884 Ayrton patented[8] a line-divider, an engineering drawing instrument for dividing a line into any number of equal parts and for enlarging and reducing figures.[2][1] The line-divider was her first major invention and, while its primary use was likely for artists for enlarging and diminishing, it was also useful to architects and engineers.[9] Ayrton's patent application was financially supported by Louisa Goldsmid and feminist Barbara Bodichon, who together advanced her enough money to take out patents; the invention was shown at the Exhibition of Women's Industries and received much press attention. Ayrton's 1884 patent was the first of many \u2013 from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air./nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes on electricity at Finsbury Technical College, delivered by Professor William Edward Ayrton, a pioneer in electrical engineering and physics education and a fellow of the Royal Society. On 6 May 1885 she married her former teacher, and thereafter assisted him with experiments in physics and electricity.[1] She also began her own investigation into the characteristics of the electric arc.[3]/nIn the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem.  In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for the Electrician, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE).[1] Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was Dorothy Smith in 1958.[1] She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901.[4] Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc.[3] By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of electrical engineering was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900.[2] Her success there led the British Association for the Advancement of Science to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees. In a history of housework in the British Isles, Caroline Davidson called Ayrton one of the rare \"female electrophiles\" who contributed to the advancement of electricity in ways that transformed women's labor within homes.[10]/nIn 1902, Ayrton published The Electric Arc, a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from the Electrician published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of electrical engineering began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the Royal Society. In the aftermath of the publication of The Electric Arc, Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer John Perry in 1902. Her application was turned down by the Council of the Royal Society, who decreed that married women were not eligible to be Fellows.[11][12] However, in 1904, she became the first woman to read a paper before the Royal Society when she was allowed to read her paper \"The Origin and Growth of Ripple Marks\" and this was later published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.[4][7][13] In 1906, she was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Hughes Medal \"for her experimental investigations on the electric arc, and also on sand ripples.\"[7] She was the fifth recipient of this prize, awarded annually since 1902, in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications, and as of 2018, one of only two women so honoured,[7] the other being Michele Dougherty in 2008.[14]/nAs a teenager, Ayrton became deeply involved in the women's suffrage movement, joining the WSPU in 1907 after attending a celebration with released prisoners.  In 1909 Ayrton opened the second day of the Knightsbridge \"Women's Exhibition and Sale of Work in the Colours\" which included new model bicycles painted in purple, white and green and raised from 50 stalls and tea etc. \u00a35,664 for the movement.[15] Ayrton was with the delegation that went with Emily Pankhurst to see the Prime Minister and met his private secretary instead on 18 November 1910 (Black Friday). Ayrton permitted Christabel Pankhurst to transfer sums to her bank account to avoid confiscation in 1912, and hosted Pankhurst in times of recovery from imprisonment and force feeding. One attempt to re-arrest Pankhurst on 29 April 1913 to continue her sentence was driven back by suffragettes picketing outside, but Pankhurst was eventually re-arrested outside Ayrton's home on her way to the funeral of Emily Davison (who was killed after running in front of the King's horse at the Derby).[15]/nAyrton was a close friend of the scientist Marie Curie and gave her daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Curie, mathematics lessons.[12] Although Curie usually chose to withhold her name from petitions, Ayrton managed to persuade her to sign a protest against the imprisonment of suffragettes through her daughter[clarification needed].[12]/nIt was through suffrage activism that she met Barbara Bodichon, a fellow suffragist and a co-founder of Cambridge's Girton College.[16] Bodichon helped to make it financially possible for Ayrton to attend Girton and went on to support her financially throughout her education and career, including bequeathing her estate to Ayrton.[17]/nAyrton delivered seven papers before the Royal Society between 1901 and 1926, the last posthumously.\n[18][19][20][21][22][23][24]\nShe also presented the results of her research before audiences at the British Association and the Physical Society. Ayrton's interest in vortices in water and air inspired the Ayrton fan, or flapper, used in the trenches in the First World War to dispel poison and foul gas. Ayrton fought for its acceptance which took a year from her offering it to the War Office to being used in the forces in 1916,[15] and organised its production, over 100,000 being used on the Western Front.[1][25]/nAyrton helped found the International Federation of University Women in 1919 and the National Union of Scientific Workers in 1920./nShe died of blood poisoning (resulting from an insect bite) on 26 August 1923 at New Cottage, North Lancing, Sussex.[1]/nHertha Ayrton was agnostic. In her teens she adopted the name \"Hertha\" after the eponymous heroine of a poem by Algernon Charles Swinburne that criticised organised religion.[26]/nIn 1885, Ayrton married the widower William Edward Ayrton, a physicist and electrical engineer who was supportive of her scientific endeavours. Ayrton honoured Barbara Bodichon by naming her first child, a daughter born in 1886, Barbara Bodichon Ayrton (1886\u20131950). The daughter was called \"Barbie\", and she later became a member of Parliament for the Labour Party.[4] Her daughter's son was the artist Michael Ayrton./nHertha and William Ayrton acted as guardians for artist and suffragette Ernestine Mills after the death of Mills' mother Emily \"Mynie\" Ernest Bell in 1893. (Her father, writer Thomas Evans Bell, had died in 1887.) They stayed close and in May 1915, Hertha Ayrton tested an 'anti-gas fan\u2019 in Mills' back garden in Kensington. It was later adopted as a device to clear poisonous chemical gases from British frontline trenches during the First World War. The story was transmuted into a scene in the 1924 novel The Call written by Ayrton's step-daughter Edith Zangwill, daughter of William and his first wife, doctor Matilda Chaplin Ayrton).[27][28][29]/nRecipients of the fellowship include geologist Dorothy Helen Rayer, who held it from 1936-1938.[45]/nAyrton, Hertha (1854\u20131923).

His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the Erlang formula, which became a foundational element of modern telecommunication network studies./nErlang was born at L\u00f8nborg, near Tarm, in Jutland.  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of Thomas Fincke on his mother's side.

His thinking went further by finding how many telephone operators were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most telephone exchanges then used human operators and cord boards to switch telephone calls by means of jack plugs.[2]/nOut of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.

A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he applied techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution./nIn a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J. L. Hubby in the journal Genetics,[4][5] Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979, he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term \"spandrel\" into evolutionary theory. From 1973 to 1998, he held an endowed chair in zoology and biology at Harvard University, and from 2003 until his death in 2021 he was a research professor there./nFrom a sociological perspective, Lewontin strongly opposed genetic determinism[6] and neodarwinism as expressed in the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology./nPreviously, as a member of Science for the People, he denounced the involvement of prominent scientists in Pentagon programs aimed at developing weapons for the Vietnam War. From the 1990s, he condemned the lobbying of GMOs by the \"genetic-industrial complex\"./nLewontin was born in New York City to parents descended from late 19th-century Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants. His father was a broker of textiles, and his mother a homemaker.[7] He attended Forest Hills High School and the \u00c9cole Libre des Hautes \u00c9tudes in New York. In 1951 he graduated from Harvard College with a BS degree in biology. In 1952, Lewontin received an MS degree in mathematical statistics, followed by a PhD degree in zoology in 1954,[8] both from Columbia University, where he was a student of Theodosius Dobzhansky./nHe held faculty positions at North Carolina State University, the University of Rochester, and the University of Chicago. In 1973 Lewontin was appointed as Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Biology at Harvard University, holding the position until 1998./nLewontin worked in both theoretical and experimental population genetics.  A hallmark of his work was an interest in new technology. In 1960, he and Ken-Ichi Kojima gave the equations for change of haplotype frequencies with interacting natural selection at two loci.[9]  Their paper gave a theoretical derivation of the equilibria expected, and also investigated the dynamics of the model by computer iteration. Lewontin later introduced the D' measure of linkage disequilibrium.[10]/nIn 1966, he and J. L. Hubby published a paper that studied the amount of heterozygosity in a population.[4]   They used protein gel electrophoresis to survey dozens of loci in the fruit fly Drosophila pseudoobscura, and reported that a large fraction of the loci were polymorphic, and that at the average locus there was about a 15% chance that the individual was heterozygous. (Harry Harris reported similar results for humans at about the same time.)[11] Previous work with gel electrophoresis had been reports of variation in single loci and did not give any sense of how common variation was./nLewontin and Hubby's paper also discussed the possible explanation of the high levels of variability by either balancing selection or neutral mutation. Martin Kreitman was later to do a pioneering survey of population-level variability in DNA sequences while a Ph.D. student in Lewontin's lab.[12]/nIn a landmark paper published in 1972, Lewontin identified that most of the variation (80\u201385%) within human populations is found within local geographic groups, and differences attributable to the \"race\" groups defined in his study are a minor part of human genetic variability (1\u201315%).[13] In a 2003 paper, A. W. F. Edwards criticized Lewontin's conclusion that race is an invalid taxonomic construct, terming it Lewontin's fallacy. He showed that the probability of racial misclassification of an individual based on variation in a single genetic locus is approximately 30%, but the misclassification probability becomes close to zero if enough loci are studied.[14] That is, it appears that a majority of genetic variation is found within groups only if a single locus is used, but the reverse is true if analyzing a multiplicity of loci. Edwards' paper was commented on by Jonathan Marks, who argued that \"the point of the theory of race was to discover large clusters of people that are principally homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, contrasting groups. Lewontin's analysis shows that such groups do not exist in the human species, and Edwards' critique does not contradict that interpretation.\"[15][16][17]/nAs of 2003, Lewontin was the Alexander Agassiz Research Professor at Harvard. He has worked with and had great influence on many philosophers of biology, including William C. Wimsatt, Elliott Sober, Philip Kitcher, Elisabeth Lloyd, Peter Godfrey-Smith, Sahotra Sarkar, and Robert Brandon, often inviting them to work in his lab./nSince 2013, Lewontin has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.[18]/nIn 1975, when E. O. Wilson's book Sociobiology proposed evolutionary explanations for human social behaviors, biologists including Lewontin, his Harvard colleagues Stephen Jay Gould and Ruth Hubbard responded negatively. Robert Trivers called these accusations \"coming from eminent biologists\" \"intellectually weak and lazy\".[19]/nLewontin and Gould introduced the term spandrel to evolutionary biology, inspired by the architectural term \"spandrel\", in an influential 1979 paper, \"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.\"  \"Spandrels\" were described as features of an organism that exist as a necessary consequence of other (perhaps adaptive) features, but do not directly improve fitness (and thus are not necessarily adaptive).[20] The relative frequency of spandrels versus adaptations continues to stir controversy in evolutionary biology./nLewontin was an early proponent of a hierarchy of levels of selection in his article, \"The Units of Selection\". He has been a major influence on philosophers of biology, notably William C. Wimsatt (who taught with Lewontin and Richard Levins at the University of Chicago), Robert Brandon and Elisabeth Lloyd (who studied with Lewontin as graduate students), Philip Kitcher, Elliott Sober, and Sahotra Sarkar.  Lewontin briefly argued for the historical nature of biological causality in \"Is Nature Probable or Capricious?\".[21]/nIn \"Organism and Environment\" in Scientia, and in more popular form in the last chapter of Biology as Ideology, Lewontin argued that while traditional Darwinism has portrayed the organism as a passive recipient of environmental influences, a correct understanding should emphasize the organism as an active constructor of its own environment. Niches are not pre-formed, empty receptacles into which organisms are inserted, but are defined and created by organisms. The organism-environment relationship is reciprocal and dialectical. M. W. Feldman and others[22] have developed Lewontin's conception in more detailed models under the term niche construction./nIn the adaptationist view of evolution, the organism is a function of both the organism and environment, while the environment is only a function of itself. The environment is seen as autonomous and unshaped by the organism. Lewontin instead believed in a constructivist view, in which the organism is a function of the organism and environment, with the environment being a function of the organism and environment as well. This means that the organism shapes the environment as the environment shapes the organism. The organism shapes the environment for future generations.[23]/nLewontin criticized traditional neo-Darwinian approaches to adaptation. In his article \"Adaptation\" in the Italian Enciclopedia Einaudi, and in a modified version for Scientific American, he emphasized the need to give an engineering characterization of adaptation separate from measurement of number of offspring, rather than simply assuming organs or organisms are at adaptive optima.[24] Lewontin said that his more general, technical criticism of adaptationism grew out of his recognition that the fallacies of sociobiology reflect fundamentally flawed assumptions of adaptiveness of all traits in much of the modern evolutionary synthesis./nLewontin accused neo-Darwinists of telling Just-So Stories when they try to show how natural selection explains such novelties as long-necked giraffes.[25]/nAlong with others, such as Gould, Lewontin was a persistent critic of some themes in neo-Darwinism. Specifically, he criticized proponents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins, who attempt to explain animal behaviour and social structures in terms of evolutionary advantage or strategy. He and others criticize this approach when applied to humans, as he sees it as genetic determinism. In his writing, Lewontin suggests a more nuanced view of evolution is needed, which requires a more careful understanding of the context of the whole organism as well as the environment.[26]/nSuch concerns about what he viewed as the oversimplification of genetics led Lewontin to be a frequent participant in debates, and an active life as a public intellectual. He lectured widely to promote his views on evolutionary biology and science. In the book Not in Our Genes (co-authored with Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin) and numerous articles, Lewontin questioned much of the claimed heritability of human behavioral traits, such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests.[citation needed]/nSome academics have criticized him for rejecting sociobiology for non-scientific reasons. Edward Wilson (1995) suggested that Lewontin's political beliefs affected his scientific view. Others, such as Kitcher (1985), countered that Lewontin's criticisms of sociobiology are genuine scientific concerns about the discipline. He wrote that attacking Lewontin's motives amounts to an ad hominem argument.[citation needed] Lewontin at times identified himself as Marxist, and asserted that his philosophical views have bolstered his scientific work (Levins and Lewontin 1985)./nLewontin has written on the economics of agribusiness. He has contended that hybrid corn was developed and propagated not because of its superior quality, but because it allowed agribusiness corporations to force farmers to buy new seed each year rather than plant seed produced by their previous crop of corn (Lewontin 1982). Lewontin testified in an unsuccessful suit in California challenging the state's financing of research to develop automatic tomato pickers. This favored the profits of agribusiness over the employment of farm workers (Lewontin 2000)./nAs of mid-2015, Lewontin and his wife Mary Jane (Christianson) lived on a farm in Brattleboro, Vermont. They had four sons. He was an atheist.[27]/nLewontin died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 4, 2021, at the age of 92.[3][28]", "1739664": "Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al \u1e24asan al-Karaj\u012b (Persian: \u0628\u0648\u0628\u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u06a9\u0631\u062c\u06cc; c. 953 \u2013 c. 1029) was a 10th-century Persian[2][3][4] mathematician and engineer who flourished at Baghdad.

However, since for example the product of a square and a cube would be expressed, in words rather than in numbers, as a square-cube, the numerical property of adding exponents was not clear.[12]/nHis work on algebra and polynomials gave the rules for arithmetic operations for adding, subtracting and multiplying polynomials; though he was restricted to dividing polynomials by monomials./nF. Woepcke was the first historian to realise the importance of al-Karaji's work and later historians mostly agree with his interpretation. He praised Al-Karaji for being the first who introduced the theory of algebraic calculus.[7][13]/nAl-Karaji gave the first formulation of the binomial coefficients and the first description of Pascal's triangle.[14][15][16] He is also credited with the discovery of the binomial theorem.[17]/nIn a now lost work known only from subsequent quotation by al-Samaw'al, Al-Karaji introduced the idea of argument by mathematical induction.[18] As Katz says/nAnother important idea introduced by al-Karaji and continued by al-Samaw'al and others was that of an inductive argument for dealing with certain arithmetic sequences. Thus al-Karaji used such an argument to prove the result on the sums of integral cubes already known to Aryabhata [...] Al-Karaji did not, however, state a general result for arbitrary n. He stated his theorem for the particular integer 10 [...] His proof, nevertheless, was clearly designed to be extendable to any other integer. [...] Al-Karaji's argument includes in essence the two basic components of a modern argument by induction, namely the truth of the statement for n = 1 (1 = 13) and the deriving of the truth for n = k from that of n = k - 1. Of course, this second component is not explicit since, in some sense, al-Karaji's argument is in reverse; this is, he starts from n = 10 and goes down to 1 rather than proceeding upward. Nevertheless, his argument in al-Fakhri is the earliest extant proof of the sum formula for integral cubes.[19]", "61737879": "Lucien Birg\u00e9 (born 1950 in France) is a French mathematician./nLucien Birg\u00e9 studied from 1970 to 1974 at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.

In its strongest form it demands a list of observable consequences and a formal demonstration that they are indeed consequences of the proposition claimed./nThe razor is humorously named after Isaac Newton, as it is inspired by Newtonian thought and is called a \"flaming laser sword\", because it is \"much sharper and more dangerous than Occam's Razor\".[6]/nAlder writes that the average scientist does not hold philosophy in high regard, considering it \"somewhere between sociology and literary criticism\".[6] He has strongly criticized what he sees as the disproportionate influence of Greek philosophy\u2014especially Platonism\u2014in modern philosophy. He contrasts the scientist's Popperian approach to the philosopher's Platonic approach, which he describes as pure reason. He illustrates this with the example of the irresistible force paradox, amongst others. According to Alder, the scientist's answer to the paradox \"What happens when an irresistible force is exerted on an immovable object\" is that the premise of the question is flawed: either the object is moved (and thus the object is movable), or it is not (thus the force is resistible):[6]/nEventually I concluded that language was bigger than the universe, that it was possible to talk about things in the same sentence which could not both be found in the real world. The real world might conceivably contain some object which had never so far been moved, and it might contain a force that had never successfully been resisted, but the question of whether the object was really immovable could only be known if all possible forces had been tried on it and left it unmoved. So the matter could be resolved by trying out the hitherto irresistible force on the hitherto immovable object to see what happened. Either the object would move or it wouldn't, which would tell us only that either the hitherto immovable object was not in fact immovable, or that the hitherto irresistible force was in fact resistible./nThat is, to the scientist, the question can be solved by experiment.

Although nominated as Bishop of Calcutta, the decision was rescinded at the last moment with George Cotton being appointed to the position. A gifted mathematician who worked on problems of geodesy and earth science, he was approached by the Surveyor General of India to examine the errors in surveys resulting from the attraction of the plumb-line to the mass of the Himalayan mountains.

The leisure allowed during his position in India allowed him to pursue mathematics[4] although he noted that it was difficult to work alone and led to long exchanges in the journals of learned societies in Britain.[7][8][9] When Bishop Wilson died in 1858, he was nominated for the position of Bishop. He was approved with the influence of Lord Shaftesbury on Lord Palmerston but it was shortly after decided in the wake of the 1857 uprising that no appointee known for missionary work should be appointed. The chosen appointee was instead Bishop Cotton. They held each other in high esteem.

An exception was made for Pratt and he was extended from October 1867 to March 1869 based on pleas from Bishop Cotton. When Pratt wished to resign in 1869, the Secretary of State extended his service to October 1872. After the death of Bishop Cotton in 1866, Pratt started a Hill Schools' Nomination Endowment Fund to help support Bishop Cotton's scheme of starting schools in the pleasant climate of the hills for the benefit of the children of poorer English residents in India who could not afford an education in England. Pratt married Hannah Maria Brown, daughter of George Francis Brown, a Bengal Civil Servant, at Bhagalpur on 6 March 1854. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866.[2] Pratt served as president of the Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded by Colesworthey Grant in 1861. He died from cholera when he was on a visit to Ghazipur, India, on 28 December 1871. At the instigation of Bishop Robert Milman, a memorial to Pratt was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta.[5][10]/nPratt was the author of Mathematical Principles of Mechanical Philosophy (1836), subsequently expanded and renamed On Attractions, Laplace's Functions and the Figure of the Earth (1860, 1861, and 1865). The final edition is a treatise of some 162 pages. The fundamental goal of the text is to supply an answer to the question as to whether the earth acquired its present form from originally being in a fluid state.[11] The book is organised in two parts, the first takes Newton's law of universal gravitation as starting point, calculates the resulting force exerted at a point by a total mass in forms ranging from sphere to spheroid and subsequently to an irregular mass consisting of nearly spherical layers approximating more and more to the case of the earth.  The second part is concerned with calculating the shape of the earth based first on the hypothesis of it being a fluid and then on geodetic principles. Part of his work was extensively used verbatim by Isaac Todhunter in his Treatise on Analytical Statics (1853).[12]/nEven as he travelled to India in 1838 aboard the Duke of Buccleuch he conducted experiments to examine currents in the ocean and measured temperatures at various depths.[13] While in India, Pratt was approached by Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India who had succeeded George Everest, to examine the gravitational anomaly caused by the Himalayas on the plumbline which resulted in errors in the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Pratt estimated the deviation of the plumbline that would be expected by the mass of the mountains (based on density estimated in 1772 at Mount Schiehallion in Scotland) but the observed deviations were much less.[14] He propounded a theory that the density of the mountains was less than that of the underlying substrate. It was also noticed that the deviations of the plumbline were greater at the foot of the mountain and reduced as one moved away from the mountain.[15] George Airy came up with the explanation that the roots of the mountain go deep into the earth. He compared it with a heap of logs in water and suggested that when a log juts higher above the water, a greater amount of it must be submerged. Pratt on the other hand suggested that there was a lower density under mountains below sea-level (actually refined later and termed the depth of compensation) and that this is offset by the mass above sea-level. Pratt's explanation assumes a variation in density whereas Airy assumes a constant crustal density.[16][17] Pratt found fault with Airy's idea as it assumed a thinner crust (10 miles) than that estimated by William Hopkins (800 to 1000 miles) and also that the crust is lighter. Pratt said that the crust cools from the solid interior and should therefore be denser. Airy did not defend his view but Samuel Haughton used the debate to claim that mathematics was a useless tool for speculation.[18] Pratt suggested that the crust would be depressed in the cooler parts of the world and suggested that the plumb deflection was caused by anomalous high density in the oceans south of the Himalayas.[10][19] Pratt also applied his knowledge of physics and mathematics to a number of applications in India on which he was consulted by engineers.[20] He examined arches,[21] the physics involved in the sudden movement of a mass of water such as in the Indus floods of 1858 and in the bore of the Hooghly river,[22] and computed the iron required for cantilever bridges.[23]/nPratt took a great interest in Hindu Astronomy and supported the translation of the Siddh\u0101nta Shiromani, aiding its publication by the authors Lancelot Wilkinson and Pandit Bapu Deva Sastri in 1863.[24] In response to a question from Professor Edward Byles Cowell on how H.T. Colebrooke came up with an age for the Vedas, he worked out calculations based on astronomical references, finding some errors in Colebrooke and came up with the suggestion that it could be from either around 1181 or 1229 BC.[25] Pratt however felt that both Indian and Arab astronomy had failed to build a mathematical or physical framework and that their only major achievement was limited to the prediction of eclipses and even these, he considered as imprecise.[26]/nIn 1849, Pratt and his brother wrote a memoir on their father.[27] In 1856, Pratt published a book entitled Scripture and Science not at Variance, which went through numerous editions; it was first written to counter a statement by the mathematician Baden Powell (father of the scouting pioneer) that \"all geology is contrary to Scripture\", and then went on to counter other scientific theories including that of Evolution that were thought to conflict with the Bible.[28] In 1865 he edited his father's manuscript Eclectic Notes, or Notes of Discussion on Religious Topics at the Meetings of the Eclectic Society, London, during the years 1798\u20131814. He also published a Paraphrase of the revelation of Saint John (1862).[29]/nA Pratt School for Girls was founded in his memory in Calcutta in 1876 by Bishop Milman.[30] This school is located on A.J.C.

He made fundamental contributions in many areas of mathematics and science, ranging from plasma physics to general relativity and from nonlinear analysis to asymptotic analysis.  His most celebrated contribution was in the theory of solitons.[4]/nHe was a student at the University of Chicago and at New York University, where he completed his Ph.D. under Richard Courant in 1952. He spent much of his career at Princeton University, as a research scientist at the Plasma Physics Laboratory starting in 1951, and then as a professor of astronomy (1961), founder and chair of the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics (1968), and professor of mathematics (1979). He retired from Princeton University in 1989 and joined the mathematics department of Rutgers University, holding the David Hilbert Chair of Mathematics./nApart from serious mathematical work, Kruskal was known for mathematical diversions. For example, he invented the Kruskal Count, a magical effect that has been known to perplex professional magicians because it was based not on sleight of hand but on a mathematical phenomenon./nMartin David Kruskal was born to a Jewish family[5] in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle. He was generally known as Martin to the world and David to his family. His father, Joseph B. Kruskal Sr., was a successful fur wholesaler. His mother, Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer, became a noted promoter of the art of origami during the early era of television and founded the Origami Center of America in New York City, which later became OrigamiUSA.[6] He was one of five children. His two brothers, both eminent mathematicians, were Joseph Kruskal (1928\u20132010; discoverer of multidimensional scaling, the Kruskal tree theorem, and Kruskal's algorithm) and William Kruskal (1919\u20132005; discoverer of the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test)./nMartin Kruskal's wife, Laura Kruskal, was a lecturer and writer about origami and originator of many new models.[7] They were married for 56 years. Martin Kruskal also invented several origami models including an envelope for sending secret messages. The envelope could be easily unfolded, but it could not then be easily refolded to conceal the deed.[8][failed verification] Their three children are Karen (an attorney[9]), Kerry (an author of children's books[10]), and Clyde, a computer scientist./nMartin Kruskal's scientific interests covered a wide range of topics in pure mathematics and applications of mathematics to the sciences. He had lifelong interests in many topics in partial differential equations and nonlinear analysis and developed fundamental ideas about asymptotic expansions, adiabatic invariants, and numerous related topics./nHis Ph.D. dissertation, written under the direction of Richard Courant and Bernard Friedman at New York University, was on the topic \"The Bridge Theorem For Minimal Surfaces\". He received his Ph.D. in 1952./nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, he worked largely on plasma physics, developing many ideas that are now fundamental in the field. His theory of adiabatic invariants was important in fusion research. Important concepts of plasma physics that bear his name include the Kruskal\u2013Shafranov instability and the Bernstein\u2013Greene\u2013Kruskal (BGK) modes. With I. B. Bernstein, E. A. Frieman, and R. M. Kulsrud, he developed the MHD (or magnetohydrodynamic[11]) Energy Principle. His interests extended to plasma astrophysics as well as laboratory plasmas./nIn 1960, Kruskal discovered the full classical spacetime structure of the simplest type of black hole in general relativity. A spherically symmetric spacetime can be described by the Schwarzschild solution, which was discovered in the early days of general relativity.  However, in its original form, this solution only describes the region exterior to the event horizon of the black hole. Kruskal (in parallel with George Szekeres) discovered the maximal analytic continuation of the Schwarzschild solution, which he exhibited elegantly using what are now called Kruskal\u2013Szekeres coordinates./nThis led Kruskal to the astonishing discovery that the interior of the black hole looks like a \"wormhole\" connecting two identical, asymptotically flat universes. This was the first real example of a wormhole solution in general relativity. The wormhole collapses to a singularity before any observer or signal can travel from one universe to the other. This is now believed to be the general fate of wormholes in general relativity. In the 1970s, when the thermal nature of black hole physics was discovered, the wormhole property of the Schwarzschild solution turned out to be an important ingredient. Nowadays, it is considered a fundamental clue in attempts to understand quantum gravity./nKruskal's most widely known work was the discovery in the 1960s of the integrability of certain nonlinear partial differential equations involving functions of one spatial variable as well as time. These developments began with a pioneering computer simulation by Kruskal and Norman Zabusky (with some assistance from Harry Dym) of a nonlinear equation known as the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation (KdV). The KdV equation is an asymptotic model of the propagation of nonlinear dispersive waves. But Kruskal and Zabusky made the startling discovery of a \"solitary wave\" solution of the KdV equation that propagates non-dispersively and even regains its shape after a collision with other such waves. Because of the particle-like properties of such a wave, they named it a \"soliton\", a term that caught on almost immediately./nThis work was partly motivated by the near-recurrence paradox that had been observed in a very early computer simulation[12] of a certain nonlinear lattice by Enrico Fermi, John Pasta, Stanislaw Ulam and Mary Tsingou at Los Alamos in 1955. Those authors had observed long-time nearly recurrent behavior of a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators, in contrast to the rapid thermalization that had been expected. Kruskal and Zabusky simulated the KdV equation, which Kruskal had obtained as a continuum limit of that one-dimensional chain, and found solitonic behavior, which is the opposite of thermalization. That turned out to be the heart of the phenomenon./nSolitary wave phenomena had been a 19th-century mystery dating back to work by John Scott Russell who, in 1834, observed what we now call a soliton, propagating in a canal, and chased it on horseback.[13] In spite of his observations of solitons in wave tank experiments, Scott Russell never recognized them as such, because of his focus on the \"great wave of translation,\" the largest amplitude solitary wave. His experimental observations, presented in his Report on Waves to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1844, were viewed with skepticism by George Airy and George Stokes because their linear water wave theories were unable to explain them.  Joseph Boussinesq (1871) and Lord Rayleigh (1876) published mathematical theories justifying Scott Russell's observations. In 1895, Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries formulated the KdV equation to describe shallow water waves (such as the waves in the canal observed by Russell), but the essential properties of this equation were not understood until the work of Kruskal and his collaborators in the 1960s./nSolitonic behavior suggested that the KdV equation must have conservation laws beyond the obvious conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum. A fourth conservation law was discovered by Gerald Whitham and a fifth one by Kruskal and Zabusky. Several new conservation laws were discovered by hand by Robert Miura, who also showed that many conservation laws existed for a related equation known as the Modified Korteweg\u2013de Vries (MKdV) equation.[14] With these conservation laws, Miura showed a connection (called the Miura transformation) between solutions of the KdV and MKdV equations. This was a clue that enabled Kruskal, with Clifford S. Gardner, John M. Greene, and Miura (GGKM),[15] to discover a general technique for exact solution of the KdV equation and understanding of its conservation laws. This was the inverse scattering method, a surprising and elegant method that demonstrates that the KdV equation admits an infinite number of Poisson-commuting conserved quantities and is completely integrable. This discovery gave the modern basis for understanding of the soliton phenomenon: the solitary wave is recreated in the outgoing state because this is the only way to satisfy all of the conservation laws. Soon after GGKM, Peter Lax famously interpreted the inverse scattering method in terms of isospectral deformations and Lax pairs./nThe inverse scattering method has had an astonishing variety of generalizations and applications in different areas of mathematics and physics. Kruskal himself pioneered some of the generalizations, such as the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities for the sine-Gordon equation. This led to the discovery of an inverse scattering method for that equation by M. J. Ablowitz, D. J. Kaup, A. C. Newell, and H. Segur (AKNS).[16] The sine-Gordon equation is a relativistic wave equation in 1+1 dimensions that also exhibits the soliton phenomenon and which became an important model of solvable relativistic field theory. In seminal work preceding AKNS, Zakharov and Shabat discovered an inverse scattering method for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation./nSolitons are now known to be ubiquitous in nature, from physics to biology. In 1986, Kruskal and Zabusky shared the Howard N. Potts Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute \"for contributions to mathematical physics and early creative combinations of analysis and computation, but most especially for seminal work in the properties of solitons\". In awarding the 2006 Steele Prize to Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura, the American Mathematical Society stated that before their work \"there was no general theory for the exact solution of any important class of nonlinear differential equations\". The AMS added, \"In applications of mathematics, solitons and their descendants (kinks, anti-kinks, instantons, and breathers) have entered and changed such diverse fields as nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and ocean, atmospheric, and planetary sciences. Nonlinearity has undergone a revolution: from a nuisance to be eliminated, to a new tool to be exploited.\"/nKruskal received the National Medal of Science in 1993 \"for his influence as a leader in nonlinear science for more than two decades as the principal architect of the theory of soliton solutions of nonlinear equations of evolution\"./nIn an article [17] surveying the state of mathematics at the turn of the millennium, the eminent mathematician Philip A. Griffiths wrote that the discovery of integrability of the KdV equation \"exhibited in the most beautiful way the unity of mathematics. It involved developments in computation, and in mathematical analysis, which is the traditional way to study differential equations. It turns out that one can understand the solutions to these differential equations through certain very elegant constructions in algebraic geometry. The solutions are also intimately related to representation theory, in that these equations turn out to have an infinite number of hidden symmetries. Finally, they relate back to problems in elementary geometry.\"/nIn the 1980s, Kruskal developed an acute interest in the Painlev\u00e9 equations. They frequently arise as symmetry reductions of soliton equations, and Kruskal was intrigued by the intimate relationship that appeared to exist between the properties characterizing these equations and completely integrable systems. Much of his subsequent research was driven by a desire to understand this relationship and to develop new direct and simple methods for studying the Painlev\u00e9  equations. Kruskal was rarely satisfied with the standard approaches to differential equations./nThe six Painlev\u00e9 equations have a characteristic property called the Painlev\u00e9 property: their solutions are single-valued around all singularities whose locations depend on the initial conditions. In Kruskal's opinion, since this property defines the Painlev\u00e9 equations, one should be able to start with this, without any additional unnecessary structures, to work out all the required information about their solutions. The first result was an asymptotic study of the Painlev\u00e9 equations with Nalini Joshi, unusual at the time in that it did not require the use of associated linear problems. His persistent questioning of classical results led to a direct and simple method, also developed with Joshi, to prove the Painlev\u00e9 property of the Painlev\u00e9 equations./nIn the later part of his career, one of Kruskal's chief interests was the theory of surreal numbers. Surreal numbers, which are defined constructively, have all the basic properties and operations of the real numbers. They include the real numbers alongside many types of infinities and infinitesimals. Kruskal contributed to the foundation of the theory, to defining surreal functions, and to analyzing their structure. He discovered a remarkable link between surreal numbers, asymptotics, and exponential asymptotics. A major open question, raised by Conway, Kruskal and Norton in the late 1970s, and investigated by Kruskal with great tenacity, is whether sufficiently well behaved surreal functions possess definite integrals. This question was answered negatively in the full generality, for which Conway et al. had hoped, by Costin, Friedman and Ehrlich in 2015. However, the analysis of Costin et al. shows that definite integrals do exist for a sufficiently broad class of surreal functions for which Kruskal's vision of asymptotic analysis, broadly conceived, goes through. At the time of his death, Kruskal was in the process of writing a book on surreal analysis with O. Costin./nKruskal coined the term asymptotology to describe the \"art of dealing with applied mathematical systems in limiting cases\".[18] He formulated seven Principles of Asymptotology: 1. The Principle of Simplification; 2. The Principle of Recursion; 3. The Principle of Interpretation; 4. The Principle of Wild Behaviour; 5. The Principle of Annihilation; 6. The Principle of Maximal Balance; 7. The Principle of Mathematical Nonsense./nThe term asymptotology is not so widely used as the term soliton. Asymptotic methods of various types have been successfully used since almost the birth of science itself. Nevertheless, Kruskal tried to show that asymptotology is a special branch of knowledge, intermediate, in some sense, between science and art. His proposal has been found to be very fruitful.[19][20][21]/nKruskal's honors and awards included:", "43027438": "Hilary Ann Priestley is a British mathematician.

The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this and crediting it to himself instead of Pythagoras which was the norm in Pythagorean society. However, the few ancient sources who describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus)[4][full citation needed] or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere.[citation needed] The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer./nLittle is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC, about a century after the time of Pythagoras. Metapontum in Magna Graecia is usually referred to as his birthplace,[5][6][7][8][9] although according to Iamblichus some claim Metapontum to be his birthplace, while others the nearby city of Croton.[10] Hippasus is recorded under the city of Sybaris in Iamblichus's list of each city's Pythagoreans.[11] He also states that Hippasus was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the Mathematici (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af) in opposition to the Acusmatici (\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af);[12] but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the Acusmatici in opposition to the Mathematici.[13]/nIamblichus says about the death of Hippasus:/nAccording to Iamblichus (ca. 245-325 AD, 1918 translation) in The life of Pythagoras, by Thomas Taylor[15]/nAristotle  speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of fire to be the cause of all things;[16] and Sextus Empiricus contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the arche to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number.[17] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius tells us that Hippasus believed that \"there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion.\"[6] According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings,[6] according to another he was the author of the Mystic Discourse, written to bring Pythagoras into disrepute.[18]/nA scholium on Plato's Phaedo notes him as an early experimenter in music theory, claiming that he made use of bronze disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.[19]/nHippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers, following which he was drowned at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is unclear./nPappus merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning.[20] Iamblichus gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular dodecahedron in the sphere.[21] In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself;[22] but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational.[23] Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the gods for impious behaviour.[21]/nThese stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain.[24] In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedra. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the golden ratio of the regular pentagon.[25]/nSome scholars in the early 20th century credited Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n\n, the square root of 2. Plato in his Theaetetus,[26] describes how Theodorus of Cyrene (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of \n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {3}}}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {5}}}\n\n, etc. up to \n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {17}}}\n\n, which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n\n.[27] Aristotle referred to the method for a proof of the irrationality of \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n\n,[28] and a full proof along these same lines is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of Euclid's Book\u00a0X,[29] which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient.[30] The method is a proof by contradiction, or reductio ad absurdum, which shows that if the diagonal of a square is assumed to be commensurable with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even.[30]/nIn the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard;[31] while one writer even has Pythagoras himself \"to his eternal shame\" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing \"that \n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}}\n\n is an irrational number\".[32]", "54397952": "Henk Joseph Maria (Henk) Lombaers (Doorn, 1920 \u2013 29 August 2007) was a Dutch mathematician, Professor at Delft University of Technology and a pioneer in the field of operations research in the Netherlands.[1]/nLombaers undertook teacher training, and earned a degree in mathematics.

It set a standard for the high-level teaching of mathematical analysis, especially complex analysis. This text was reviewed by William Fogg Osgood for the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society.[1][2] This led to its translation into English by Earle Raymond Hedrick published by Ginn and Company. Goursat also published texts on partial differential equations and hypergeometric series./nEdouard Goursat was born in Lanzac, Lot. He was a graduate of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he later taught and developed his Cours. At that time the topological foundations of complex analysis were still not clarified, with the Jordan curve theorem considered a challenge to mathematical rigour (as it would remain until L. E. J. Brouwer took in hand the approach from combinatorial topology). Goursat's work was considered by his contemporaries, including G. H. Hardy, to be exemplary in facing up to the difficulties inherent in stating the fundamental Cauchy integral theorem properly. For that reason it is sometimes called the Cauchy\u2013Goursat theorem./nGoursat, along with M\u00f6bius, Schl\u00e4fli, Cayley, Riemann, Clifford and others, was one of the 19th century mathematicians who envisioned and explored a geometry of more than three dimensions.[3]/nHe was the first to enumerate the finite groups generated by reflections in four-dimensional space, in 1889.[4] The Goursat tetrahedra are the fundamental domains which generate, by repeated reflections of their faces, uniform polyhedra and their honeycombs which fill three-dimensional space. Goursat recognized that the honeycombs are four-dimensional Euclidean polytopes./nHe derived a formula for the general displacement in four dimensions preserving the origin, which he recognized as a double rotation in two completely orthogonal planes.[5]/nGoursat was the first to note that the generalized Stokes theorem can be written in the simple form/nwhere \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n is a p-form in n-space and S is the p-dimensional boundary of the (p\u00a0+\u00a01)-dimensional region T. Goursat also used differential forms to state the Poincar\u00e9 lemma and its converse, namely, that if \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n is a p-form, then \n\n\n\nd\n\u03c9\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d\\omega =0}\n\n if and only if there is a (p\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)-form \n\n\n\n\u03b7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\eta }\n\n  with\n\n\n\n\nd\n\u03b7\n=\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d\\eta =\\omega }\n\n.

He was the institute's director until 1969.[8]/nIn 1964, Galtung led PRIO to establish the first academic journal devoted to Peace Studies: the Journal of Peace Research.[8] In the same year, he assisted in the founding of the International Peace Research Association.[9] In 1969, he left PRIO for a position as professor of peace and conflict research at the University of Oslo, a position he held until 1978.[8]/nHe was the director general of the International University Centre in Dubrovnik and helped to found and lead the World Future Studies Federation.[10][11] He has held visiting positions at other universities, including Santiago, Chile, the United Nations University in Geneva, and at Columbia, Princeton and the University of Hawaii.[12] In 2014, he was appointed as the first Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the International Islamic University Malaysia.[13]/nEconomist and fellow peace researcher Kenneth Boulding has said of Galtung that his \"output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human\".[14] He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[15]/nIn 1993, he co-founded TRANSCEND: A Peace Development Environment Network.[16][17] In 1987, he was given the Right Livelihood Award./nIn Galtung's 1969 paper, \"Violence, Peace and Peace Research,\"[18] he presents his theory of the Conflict Triangle, a framework used in the study of peace and conflict, with the purpose of defining the three key elements of violence that form this \"triangle.\" The theory is based on the principle that peace must be defined by widely accepted social goals, and that any state of peace is characterized by the absence of violence. When a conflict has features of all three areas of violence, the result is a more consolidated, static state of violence in a social system, which may include a conflict or a nation-state, whereas the absence of these three typologies of violence results in peace./nStructural Violence, also referred to as social injustice, is defined as injustice and inequality built into the structure of society, resulting in unequal power and, subsequently, imbalanced life chances. There is no requirement for a clear actor to be defined as committing the violence, rather it is embedded within the institutions of the society, where the power to decide the distribution of resources is uneven. Rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs. Structural violence is increased in situations where low income individuals also suffer in the rank dimensions of education, health, and power. This is due to an overall consolidation of factors in the social structure, resulting in a high correlation between social class and disempowerment. Structural violence can be recognized through its relative stability, having been built into the social structure. This can make structural violence difficult to ascertain, despite its often vast consequences. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of the most notable are listed below./nAkhil Gupta argued in 2012[19] that structural violence has been the key influence in the nature and distribution of extreme suffering in India, driven by the Indian state in its alleged corruption, overly bureaucratic standards of governance used to exclude the middle and working classes from the political system through a system of politicized poverty./nJacklyn Cock's 1989 paper[20] in the Review of African Political Economy applied Galtung's theory of structural violence, analysing the role of militarized society under the apartheid regime of South Africa in the development of patriarchal values that is a form of structural violence against women. Cock found that tacit misdirection of women in society by its leadership focused their energies toward the direct and indirect incorporation of the patriarchal regime in order to maintain the status quo./nMats Utas claimed[21] that even those youth in Liberia indirectly unaffected by direct violence in the civil war of 1989-1996 suffered from structural violence in the form of association with different blocs, leading to poverty, joblessness and marginalisation effects./nCultural violence is defined as any aspect of a culture that can be used to legitimise violence in its direct or structural form. Unlike direct and structural violence, then, cultural violence is a foundational principle for extended conflict. The existence of prevailing or prominent social norms make direct and structural violence seem natural or at least acceptable, and serves to explain how prominent beliefs can become so embedded in a given culture that they function as absolute and inevitable and are reproduced uncritically across generations. Galtung expanded on the concept of cultural violence in a 1990 paper[22] also published in the Journal of Peace Research. This concept has been applied in a limited number of cases, with most occurring after Galtung's follow up paper in 1990,[22] some of the most notable of which are listed below./nIn Ed Husain's 2007 book[23] The Islamist, seminal extremist literature such as Sayyid Qutb's Milestones is highlighted  as being particularly influential on many young Muslims in terms of defining their identity and life goals, in which the book embodies the principles outlined whereby there is a cultural imperative for violence built into the societal values or cultural values of Islam through such extremist literature./nGregory Phillips argues in his 2003 book, Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country,[24] that resistance to the Western medical sphere driven by previous atrocities committed against the Aboriginal community has led to a fierce resistance effort against modern medicine, addiction treatment and perhaps fuels a desire to seek out drugs and illicit substances as a starting point of addiction. Wide scale suspicion against medical practitioners and government representatives has become engendered in the Aboriginal community./nIn Enduring Violence: Ladina Women's Lives in Guatemala,[25] the 2011 book by Cecilia Menj\u00edvar, it is argued that the preexisting cultural conditions of mediania, or half and half, agriculture led to women facing large scale cultural violence due to high rents, low returns and high required investment with additionally harsh conditions due to the conflict in Guatemala. Given the patriarchal culture of Guatemala, any earnings would go to the partner of the working woman, leaving a large poverty gap enshrined in the demographic diversity of the country./nDirect Violence is characterised as having an actor that commits the violence, and is thus able to be traced back to persons as actors. Direct violence shows less stability, given it is subject to the preference sets of individuals, and thus is more easily recognised. Direct violence is the most visible, occurring physically or verbally, and the victim and the offender can be clearly identified. Direct violence is highly interdependent with structural and cultural violence: cultural and structural violence causes direct violence which on the other hand reinforces the former ones. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of which are listed below./nA 2011 paper[26] by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) demonstrated the widespread nature of child marriage in South Asia. The ICRW highlighted marriage before the age of 18 as a fundamental human rights violation, one that leads to early childbearing, with significantly higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates as well as higher infant mortality rates amongst women. The paper most directly presented evidence to show that child brides are at heightened risk of violence in the home./nIn Matthew Chandler's 2009 paper[27] on so-called \"non-violent\" techniques utilised by Hezbollah still include forms of Direct Violence, most notably the threat of violence toward Fouad Siniora's allies after his 2008 order to dismantle the Hezbollah telecommunications network in 2008, which led to the freezing of the order. Further, Hezbollah are argued to have used their operation of social services, in lieu of government operations, as a ransom for support as well as rewarding their fighters with guaranteed healthcare and support for their families. Chandler argues this is due to opposition within the group to harming Lebanese civilians, who they view as \"their own\", or exacerbating conflict through civil war./nIn 2005, Steven Wright made the case[28] for Peacekeeping efforts to be regarded as violence due to increasing use of techniques such as pre-interrogation treatment, and the use of non-lethal weapons such as tear gas for crowd dispersal and plastic bullets, which he terms \"torture-lite\", being increasingly common in peacekeeping manuals across a number of nation-states and supranational organisations./nGaltung focuses a section of the paper on the means of direct and structural violence, in particular, developing groups of factors that may be included as types of such forms and methods of maintaining and reinforcing the mechanisms of such violence. In terms of reinforcing factors, Galtung identifies six key areas:/nBeyond Galtung's initial paper and thesis, scholars have applied the Conflict Triangle to a broad array of conflicts, struggles and occupations since 1969, and retroactively./nGaltung's Conflict Triangle and Peace Research paper are widely cited as the foundational pieces of theory[29] within peace and conflict studies. However, they are not without criticism. Galtung uses very broad definitions of violence, conflict and peace, and applies the terms of mean both direct and indirect, negative and positive, and violence in which one cannot distinguish actors or victims, which serves to limit the direct application of the model itself./nGaltung uses a positivist approach,[30] in that he assumes that every rational tenet of the theory can be verified, serving to reject social processes beyond relationships and actions. This approach enforces a paradigm of clear-cut, currently testable propositions as the \u2018whole\u2019 of the system, and thus is often deemed reductionist. Galtung also wields an explicit normative orientation in the paper, in which there is a weighting toward evaluative statements that may show bias or simply opinion, or indeed a trend toward the institutions and concepts of peace in the West, which may serve to limit the applicability of the model more widely./nGaltung first conceptualized peacebuilding by calling for systems that would create sustainable peace. The peacebuilding structures needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution.[31] Galtung has held several significant positions in international research councils and has been an advisor to several international organisations. Since 2004, he has been a member of the Advisory Council of the Committee for a Democratic UN./nGaltung is strongly associated with the following concepts:/nIn 1973, Galtung criticised the \"structural fascism\" of the US and other Western countries that make war to secure materials and markets, stating: \"Such an economic system is called capitalism, and when it's spread in this way to other countries it's called imperialism\", and praised Fidel Castro's Cuba in 1972 for \"break[ing] free of imperialism's iron grip\". Galtung has stated that the US is a \"killer country\" guilty of \"neo-fascist state terrorism\" and compared the US to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.[32][33]/nIn an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will \"decline and fall\" by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book titled The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What? Successors, Regionalization or Globalization? US Fascism or US Blossoming?.[34][35]/nDuring his career, Galtung statements and views have drawn criticism including his criticism of Western countries during and after the Cold War and what his critics perceived as a positive attitude to the Soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China. A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published by the City Journal magazine[32] and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post[33] criticised Galtung's opinion of China during the rule of Mao Zedong. China, according to Galtung, was \"repressive in a certain liberal sense\", but he insisted \"the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'\u2014and it will take a long time before the West will be willing to view China as a master teacher in such subjects.\"[32] Calling Galtung a \"lifelong enemy of freedom\", Bawer said Galtung discouraged Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956, and criticized his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as \"persecuted elite personages\".[32]/nGaltung has recommended that people should read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fabricated antisemitic text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination.[36] In defending his claims that Jews control American media companies, Galtung cited an article published by National Vanguard, a neo-Nazi organization.[36] Galtung's rhetoric has been criticized by Terje Emberland, a historian at the Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities in Oslo, and \u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen, a University of Oslo historian known for his scholarship on conspiracy theories.[36] Asked by NRK about his controversial remarks, Galtung reiterated his recommendation that people should read The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.[36] Galtung rejects that he is anti-Semitic.[36]/nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz accused Galtung in May 2012 of antisemitism for (1) suggesting the possibility of a link between the 2011 Norway attacks and Israel's intelligence agency Mossad; (2) maintaining that \"six Jewish companies\" control 96% of world media; (3) identifying what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm Goldman Sachs and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion; and (4) theorizing, although not justified, antisemitism in post\u2013World War I Germany was a predictable consequence of German Jews holding influential positions.[37] As a result of such statements, TRANSCEND International, an organisation co-founded by Galtung, released a statement in May 2012 attempting to clarify his opinions.[38] On August 8, 2012, the World Peace Academy in Basel, Switzerland announced it was suspending Galtung from its organization, citing what it posited were his \"reckless and offensive statements to questions that are specifically sensitive for Jews.\"[39]\nGaltung said the claims were \"smearing and libel\",[40][41]/nGaltung has published more than a thousand articles and over a hundred books.[44]", "70585397": "Pamela Gail Coxson is an American applied mathematician specialized in disease modelling.

His thesis was entitled The Plateau Problem for Minimal Surfaces of Arbitrary Topological Structure[4] and his thesis advisor was Richard Courant.[5] According to Peter Lax, Shiffman was \"Courant's most brilliant student in America\". Shiffman gave a one-hour address at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society. He was an instructor at CCNY in 1939\u201342. In 1942 at NYU he joined a research project funded by the Office of Scientific Research and Development. From 1945 to 1948 he was an associate professor at NYU, where he influenced many graduate students, including Clifford Gardner, Joe Keller, Martin Kruskal, Peter Lax, Cathleen Morawetz, and Louis Nirenberg. In 1948 G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 hired Shiffman as a full professor at Stanford University.[1] Szeg\u0151 also brought to the Stanford mathematics department Donald C. Spencer, Albert Charles Schaeffer, Paul Garabedian, and Richard E. Bellman.[6] Shiffman and Bellman introduced a number of modern mathematics courses at Stanford.[7] Shiffman was the first to teach at Stanford a course on functional analysis.[1] Merrill M. Flood's 1952 introduction to non-Soviet mathematicians of Kantorovich's 1939 paper Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production[8] is due to Shiffman in 1949.[9]/nHis brilliant career came to a tragic halt in 1951, due to a schizophrenic breakdown. He recovered and continued his research and teaching until a second breakdown in 1956. With the support of his friends and a generous trustee of Stanford University, he was admitted to Chestnut Lodge, a prestigious psychiatric institute. After nine years of therapy he was transferred to Agnews State Hospital in California, where Max took advantage of a state law and sued in court to be released; he convinced a jury that he was mentally competent.[1]/nFrom 1965 to 1967 Shiffman held at Stanford a research appointment, mainly due to the efforts of Donald C. Spencer. At California State University, Hayward Shiffman was a full professor from 1967 to 1981, when he retired as professor emeritus.[1]/nMuch of Shiffman\u2019s work dealt with Plateau\u2019s problem. He showed that if a boundary curve spans two minimal surfaces that are relative minima, then it also spans one which is not a relative minimum. In one of his last publications he showed that a doubly connected minimal surface whose boundary consists of two circles on parallel planes intersects any other parallel plane in a circle. Shiffman also worked on problems of conformal mapping, and the differentiability and analyticity of solutions of double integral variational problems. ... Shiffman used variational methods to study the flow of fluids, incompressible and compressible. He proved a basic theorem about compressible flows around bodies with prescribed subsonic speed at infinity; he showed that such flows are smooth until the flow becomes sonic. The technical tool he used, altering the equation of state, is called \u201cshiffmanization\u201d by cognoscenti.[1]/nIn the summer of 1949 Shiffman gave a new proof of von Neumann's minimax theorem[10] with a generalization to concave-convex functions.[11] Maurice Sion generalized Shiffman's result to Sion's minimax theorem, published in 1958./nIn 1938 Bella Manel, a mathematics graduate student at NYU, married Max Shiffman. She received her PhD in 1939 with thesis advisor Richard Courant. Max and Bella Shiffman divorced in 1957,[12][13] after the birth of their two sons.

Logical simulation requires solid mathematical foundations. Namely these foundations were originally established by Shestakov./nShestakov set forth an algebraic logic model of electrical two-pole switches (later three- and four-pole switches) with series and parallel connections of schematic elements (resistors, capacitors, magnets, inductive coils, etc.). Resistance of these elements could take arbitrary values on the real-number line, and upon the two-element set {0, \u221e} this degenerates into the bivalent Boolean algebra of logic./nShestakov may be considered as a forerunner of combinatorial logic and its application (and, hence, Boolean algebra of logic as well) in electric engineering, the 'language' of which is broad enough to simulate non-electrical objects of any conceivable physical nature.

He is best known as the author of Sadratnamala, a treatise on astronomy and mathematics, composed in 1819. Sankara Varman is considered as the last notable figure in the long line of illustrious astronomers and mathematicians in the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics beginning with Madhava of Sangamagrama.  Sadratnamala was composed in the traditional style followed by  members of the Kerala school at a time when India had been introduced to the western style of mathematics and of writing books in mathematics. One of Varman's contribution to mathematics was his computation of the value of the mathematical constant \u03c0 correct to 17 decimal places./nVarman was born as a younger prince in the principality of Katattanad, in North Malabar, Kerala, in the year 1774. He had two elder brothers,  the eldest being Raja Udaya varma, the ruler of the principality, and second one being Rama Varma, the crown prince. Local people referred to Varman as Appu Thampuran. Katattanad principality was under the suzerainty of the Zamorin of Calicut. The family deity of Sankara Varman was Goddess Parvati installed in the temple of Lokamalayarkavu and he was also a devotee of Lord Krishna.[1]/nVarman completed the composition of Sadratnamala in 1819. He also wrote a Malayalam commentary on Sadratnamala. Two versions of the text of Sadratnamala and their commentaries have been discovered. A critical examination of the manuscripts suggests that both are written by Varman, one being a revision of the other.[1]/nDuring the invasion of Malabar by Tipu Sultan/Hyder Ali during 1766 - 1781, many people including members of royal families fled Malabar and took shelter in Travancore.  This brought the principality of Katattanad also into close contact with the Travancore Royal Family. Varman was especially attached to Maharaja Swati Tirunal (1813\u201347).[1]/nVarman was an astute astrologer. There is a legend that he predicted the time of his own death as being in 1839, the year in which he died.[1]/nVarman was a close acquaintance of C.M.

This work, which is a complete system of Hindu astronomy, is comprehended in two hundred and eleven verses of different measures, and abounds with fluxional forms and series, to be found in no work of foreign or other Indian countries.\" Whish was the first to bring to the notice of the western mathematical scholarship the achievements of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.[2]", "18746499": "Thomas Gerald Room FRS FAA (10 November 1902 \u2013 2 April 1986) was an Australian mathematician who is best known for Room squares. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.[1][2]/nThomas Room was born on 10 November 1902, near London, England. He studied mathematics in St John's College, Cambridge, and was a wrangler in 1923. He continued at Cambridge as a graduate student, and was elected as a fellow in 1925, but instead took a position at the University of Liverpool. He returned to Cambridge in 1927, at which time he completed his PhD, with a thesis supervised by H. F. Baker.[3][4] Room remained at Cambridge until 1935, when he moved to the University of Sydney, where he accepted the position of Chair of the Mathematics Department, a position he held until his retirement in 1968.[5]/nDuring World War II he worked for the Australian government, helping to decrypt Japanese communications. In January 1940, with the encouragement of the Australian Army, he, together with some colleagues at the University of Sydney, began to study Japanese codes. The others were the mathematician Richard Lyons and the classicists Arthur Dale Trendall and Athanasius Treweek. By this time Room had already begun learning Japanese under Margaret Ethel Lake (1883-?) at the University of Sydney. In May 1941 Room and Treweek attended a meeting at the Victoria Barracks in Melbourne with the Director of Naval Intelligence of the Royal Australian Navy, several Australian Army intelligence officers and Eric Nave, an expert Japanese cryptographer with the Royal Australian Navy. As a result it was agreed that Room's group, with the agreement of the University of Sydney, would move in August 1941 to work under Nave at the Special Intelligence Bureau in Melbourne. On 1 September 1941, Room was sent to the Far East Combined Bureau in Singapore to study the codebreaking techniques used there. After the outbreak of war they were working for FRUMEL (Fleet Radio Unit Melbourne), a joint American-Australian intelligence unit, but when Lieutenant Rudolph Fabian took over command of FRUMEL and particularly when, in October 1942, FRUMEL was placed under direct control of the US Navy, civilians such as the member of Room's group were found surplus to requirements and returned to their academic posts.[6][7]/nAfter the war, Room served as dean of the faculty of science at the University of Sydney from 1952 to 1956 and again from 1960 to 1965.[8] He also held visiting positions at the University of Washington in 1948, and the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University in 1957.[9][10][11] He retired from Sydney in 1968 but took short-term positions afterwards at Westfield College in London and the Open University before returning to Australia in 1974. He died on 2 April 1986./nRoom married Jessica Bannerman, whom he met in Sydney, in 1937; they had one son and two daughters.[9][12]/nRoom's PhD work concerned generalizations of the Schl\u00e4fli double six, a configuration formed by the 27 lines on a cubic algebraic surface.[1][4]/nIn 1938 he published the book The geometry of determinantal loci through the Cambridge University Press.[1] Nearly 500 pages long, the book combines methods of synthetic geometry and algebraic geometry to study higher-dimensional generalizations of quartic surfaces and cubic surfaces. It describes many infinite families of algebraic varieties, and individual varieties in these families, following a unifying principle that nearly all loci arising in algebraic geometry can be expressed as the solution to an equation involving the determinant of an appropriate matrix.[1][13]/nIn the postwar period, Room shifted the focus of his work to Clifford algebra and spinor groups.[1] Later, in the 1960s, he also began investigating finite geometry, and wrote a textbook on the foundations of geometry.[1]/nRoom invented Room squares in a brief note published in 1955.[14] A Room square is an n\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0n grid in which some of the cells are filled by sets of two of the numbers from 0 to n in such a way that each number appears once in each row or column and each two-element set occupies exactly one cell of the grid. Although Room squares had previously been studied by Robert Richard Anstice,[15] Anstice's work had become forgotten and Room squares were named after Room. In his initial work on the subject, Room showed that, for a Room square to exist, n must be odd and cannot equal 3 or 5. It was later shown by W. D. Wallis in 1973 that these are necessary and sufficient conditions: every other odd value of n has an associated Room square. The nonexistence of a Room square for n\u00a0=\u00a05 and its existence for n\u00a0=\u00a07 can both be explained in terms of configurations in projective geometry.[1]/nDespite retiring in 1968, Room remained active mathematically for several more years, and published the book Miniquaternion geometry: An introduction to the study of projective planes in 1971 with his student Philip B. Kirkpatrick.[1]/nIn 1941, Room won the Thomas Ranken Lyle Medal of the Australian National Research Council and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society.[1][16][17] He was one of the Foundation Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, chartered in 1954.[1][2] From 1960 to 1962, he served as president of the Australian Mathematical Society and he later became the first editor of its journal.[1]/nThe T.

Imastaser was also a gifted hymnologist and pedagogue.[1]/nHovhannes Imastaser was born around 1047 in the district of Gardman (village of Pib) of historical Armenia\u2019s eastern province of Utik, which today is located in Azerbaijan, north of Nagorno Karabakh.[2][3]\nThe most extensive historical account of Hovhannes Imastaser\u2019s life and work is in the 12-13th century Armenian historian Kirakos Gandzaketsi\u2019s \u201cHistory of Armenia.\u201d [4] There also exists a 13th-century anonymous biography of Hovhannes Imastaser, which is attributed sometimes to Kirakos Gandzaketsi./nHovhannes received his education in theology and science in Haghbat and Sanahin, two important monastic centers of Armenian medieval scholarship. Upon the completion of his studies, Hovhannes moved to medieval Armenia's capital city of Ani, where he taught philosophy, mathematics, music, cosmography and grammar. In Ani, Hovhannes received the ecclesiastical rank of sarkavag (deacon), and eventually rose to become a vardapet (archimandrite, Doctor of Theology) of the Armenian Apostolic Church. But it was the title sarkavag, however, that became attached to his name.[5]/nWhile Hovhannes Imastaser was recognized as a master of Armenian literature, his works acquired wider publicity only in the 19th century when they were published by Abbot Ghevont Alishan, a member of the Mekhitarist Congregation in Venice that is associated with Armenian Catholics. Imastaser's innovative approach to literature, for which he is often referred to as a key representative of Armenian literary renaissance, is fully demonstrated in his poem Ban Imastutian (Discourse on Wisdom). In the poem, written as a dialogue between the author and a blackbird, the bird symbolizes nature, which, per author, is the main inspiration behind art. In Imastaser's time, artistic inspiration was usually attributed to divine reasons.[6]/nAs a hymnologist, Imastaser wrote several important sharakans (hymns): Tagh Harutean (Ode to the Resurrection), Paitsaratsan Aisor (Brightened on This Day), Anskizbn Bann Astvatz (God, The Infinite Word), Anchareli Bann Astavatz (God, The Inexpressible Word). The latter two are acrostic compositions, each encompassing within their ten stanzas thirty six letters of the Armenian Alphabet. In them, Imastaser glorifies heroes and martyrs who sacrificed their lives defending Armenian homeland and their Christian faith. Imastaser also introduced another patriotic theme to Armenian literature and music: emigration. In his hymns Imastaser prays to God so that Armenians who left their country could find strength to return home.[7]/nHovhannes Imastaser also contributed to the standardization of the Armenian prayer book and Psalter./nHovhannes Imastaser's work in mathematics is represented by the volume Haghaks Ankiunavor Tvots (Concerning Polygonal Numbers). This work indicates a profound knowledge of all important ancient and medieval mathematicians, including Pythagoras, Euclid and Aristotle. Hovhannes Imastaser translated into Armenian the works of the following classical scholars: Philo of Alexandria, Dionysius the Areopagite, Gregory of Nyssa, Porphyry, and, as mentioned, Aristotle and Euclid.[8]/nIn 1084, Hovhannes Imastaser became involved in the project of developing so-called Minor Armenian Calendar, which included all 365 days plus one additional day. Eventually, his work on calendars led to the invention of a perpetual or eternal calendar.[9]/nOne of the most important citations of Hovhannes Imastaser reflects his understanding of the role of the empirical method in science. 150 years before Roger Bacon, Hovhannes Imastaser famously noted: \u201cWithout experimentation, no opinion can be considered probable and acceptable; only experiment produces confirmation and certainty.\u201d", "494745": "Petrus Apianus (April 16, 1495 \u2013 April 21, 1552),[1] also known as Peter Apian, Peter Bennewitz, and Peter Bienewitz, was a German humanist, known for his works in mathematics, astronomy and cartography.[2] His work on \"cosmography\", the field that dealt with the earth and its position in the universe, was presented in his most famous publications, Astronomicum Caesareum (1540) and Cosmographicus liber (1524).  His books were extremely influential in his time, with the numerous editions in multiple languages being published until 1609. The lunar crater Apianus and asteroid 19139\u00a0Apian are named in his honour.[2]/nApianus was born as Peter Bienewitz (or Bennewitz) in Leisnig in Saxony; his father, Martin, was a shoemaker. The family was relatively well off, belonging to the middle-class citizenry of Leisnig. Apianus was educated at the Latin school in Rochlitz. From 1516 to 1519 he studied at the University of Leipzig; during this time, he Latinized his name to Apianus (lat. apis means \"bee\"; \"Biene\" is the German word for bee)./nIn 1519, Apianus moved to Vienna and continued his studies at the University of Vienna, which was considered one of the leading universities in geography and mathematics at the time and where Georg Tannstetter taught. When the plague broke out in Vienna in 1521, he completed his studies with a BA and moved to Regensburg and then to Landshut. At Landshut, he produced his Cosmographicus liber (1524), a highly respected work on astronomy and navigation which was to see more than 40 reprints in four languages (Latin; French, 1544; Dutch, 1545; Spanish, 1548) and that remained popular until the end of the 16th century.[3] Later editions were produced by Gemma Frisius.[4]/nIn 1527, Peter Apianus was called to the University of Ingolstadt as a mathematician and printer. His print shop started small. Among the first books he printed were the writings of Johann Eck, Martin Luther's antagonist. This print shop was active between 1543 and 1540 and became well known for its high-quality editions of geographic and cartographic works.[citation needed] It is thought that he used stereotype printing techniques on woodblocks.[7] The printer's logo included the motto Industria superat vires in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin around the figure of a boy.[8]/nThrough his work, Apianus became a favourite of emperor Charles V, who had praised Cosmographicus liber at the Imperial Diet of 1530 and granted him a printing monopoly in 1532 and 1534. In 1535, the emperor made Apianus an armiger, i.e. granted him the right to display a coat of arms. In 1540, Apianus printed the Astronomicum Caesareum, dedicated to Charles V. Charles promised him a truly royal sum (3,000 golden guilders),[a] appointed him his court mathematician, and made him a Reichsritter (a Free Imperial Knight) and in 1544 even an Imperial Count Palatine. All this furthered Apianus's reputation as an eminent scientist. Astronomicum Caesareum is noted for its visual appeal. Printed and bound decoratively, with about 100 known copies,[10] it included several Volvelles that allowed users to calculate dates, the positions of constellations and so on.[11][12][13] Apianus noted that it took a month to produce some of the plates. Thirty-five octagonal paper cut instruments were included with woodcuts that are thought to have been made by Hans Brosamer (c. 1495 \u2013 1555) who may have trained under Lucas Cranach, Sr. in Wittemberg.[14] It also incorporated star and constellation names from the work of the Arab astronomer Azophi (Abu al-Husain al-Sufi AD 903\u2013986).[15] Apianus is also remembered for publishing the only known depiction of the Bedouin constellations in 1533. On this map Ursa Minor is an old woman and three maidens, Draco is four camels and Cepheus was illustrated as a shepherd with sheep and dog.[16]/nDespite many calls from other universities, including Leipzig, Padua, T\u00fcbingen, and Vienna, Apianus remained in Ingolstadt until his death. Although he neglected his teaching duties, the university evidently was proud to host such an esteemed scientist. Apianus's work included in mathematics\u2014in 1527 he published a variation of Pascal's triangle, and in 1534 a table of sines\u2014 as well as astronomy. In 1531, he observed Halley's Comet and noted that a comet's tail always point away from the sun.[17] Girolamo Fracastoro also detected this in 1531, but Apianus's publication was the first to also include graphics. He designed sundials, published manuals for astronomical instruments and crafted volvelles (\"Apian wheels\"), measuring instruments useful for calculating time and distance for astronomical and astrological applications.[18][19]/nApianus married the daughter of a councilman of Landshut, Katharina Mosner, in 1526. They would have fourteen children together, five girls and nine sons, one of whom was Philipp Apian (1531\u20131589), who, in addition to his own research, preserved the legacy of his father.[20]", "31394970": "Akad\u00e9miai D\u00edj (1993)/nMikl\u00f3s Simonovits (4 September 1943 in Budapest) is a Hungarian mathematician who currently works at the R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest and is a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

In 1932 the Krasnoselsky family moved to Berdiansk and in 1938 Mark entered the physico-mathematical faculty of Kyiv University, which was evacuated at the beginning of World War II to Kazakhstan where it became known as the Joint Ukrainian University./nHe graduated in 1942, in the middle of the war, served four years in the Soviet Army, became Candidate in Science in 1948, with a dissertation on self-adjoint extensions of operators with nondense domains, before getting the title of Doctor in Science in 1950, with a thesis on investigations in Nonlinear Functional analysis./nFrom 1946 till 1952, Mark was a Research Fellow at the Mathematical Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv. From 1952 till 1967, he was Professor at Voronezh State University. He then moved to Moscow as a Senior Scientific Fellow (1967\u201374) and then a Head of a Laboratory (1974\u201390) at the Institute of Control Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in Moscow. From 1990, he worked at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the same Academy./nHe died on February 13, 1997. Buried at Khovansky cemetery in Moscow.[1]/nWhen Mark was 18 he married Sarra Belotserkovskaya (10.09.1921\u201331.01.2009), they had 3 children (Veniamin, 1939; Aleksandra (Alla), 1945; Aleksandr (Sasha), 1955). Now there are 7 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren./nKrasnoselsky has authored or co-authored some three hundred papers and fourteen monographs. Nonlinear techniques are roughly classified into analytical, topological and variational methods. Mark Krasnoselsky has contributed to all three aspects in a significant way, as well as to their application to many types of integral, differential and functional equations coming from mechanics, engineering, and control theory./nKrasnoselsky was the first to investigate the functional analytical properties of fractional powers of operators, at first for self-adjoint operators and then for more general situations. His theorem on the interpolation of complete continuity of such fractional power operators has been a basic tool in the theory of partial differential equations. Of comparable importance in applications is his extensive collection of works on the theory of positive operators, in particular results in which spectral gaps were estimated. His work on integral operators and superposition operators has also found many theoretical and practical applications. A major reason for this was his desire to always find readily verifiable conditions and estimates for whatever functional properties were under consideration. This is perhaps best seen in his work on topological methods in nonlinear analysis which he developed into a universal method for finding answers to such qualitative problems such as evaluating the number of solutions, describing the structure of a solution set and conditions for the connectedness of this set, convergence of Galerkin type approximations, the bifurcation of solutions in nonlinear systems, and so on./nKrasnoselsky also presented many new general principles on solvability of a large variety of nonlinear equations, including one-sided estimates, cone stretching and contractions, fixed-point theorems for monotone operators and a combination of the Schauder fixed-point and contraction mapping theorems that was the genesis of condensing operators. He suggested a new general method for investigating degenerate extremals in variational problems and developed qualitative methods for studying critical and bifurcation parameter values based on restricted information of nonlinear equations. such as the properties of equations linearized at zero or at infinity, which have been very useful in determining the existence of bounded or periodic solutions./nAfter he moved to Moscow he turned his attention increasingly to discontinuous processes and operators, in connection firstly with nonlinear control systems and then with a mathematically rigorous formulation of hysteresis which encompasses most classical models of hysteresis and is now standard. He also became actively involved with the analysis of desynchronized systems and the justification of the harmonic balance method commonly used by engineers.", "43715838": "Hans Zantema (1956) is a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist, and professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen, known for his work on termination analysis.[1][2]/nBorn in Goingarijp, The Netherlands, Zantema received his PhD in algebraic number theory in 1983 at the University of Amsterdam under supervision of Hendrik Lenstra Jr. for the thesis, entitled \"Integer Valued Polynomials in Algebraic Number Theory.\"[3]/nAfter graduation Zantema spent a few years of employment in the industry before he switched to computer science: from 1987 to 2000 at Utrecht University and since 2000 at Eindhoven University of Technology./nSince 2007 he is a part-time full professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen.

He was a visiting professor at the University of Paris, at the Polish Academy of Sciences and at the Slovak Academy of Sciences./nSprindzuk's research deals with Diophantine approximation, Diophantine equations and transcendental numbers. While a first year undergraduate student, he published his first paper, in which he solved a problem of Aleksandr Khinchin, and wrote to Khinchin about the solution. Another important influence was the Leningrad number theorist Yuri Linnik, who was Sprindzuk's advisor for his Russian doctorate of sciences. In 1965 Sprindzuk proved a conjecture of Mahler, that almost all real numbers are S-numbers of Type 1 \u2014 Mahler had previously proved that almost all real numbers are S-numbers.[2] Sprindzuk generalized an important theorem proved by Wolfgang M. Schmidt.[3]/nIn the late sixties V. Sprindzuk began studying the theory of transcendental numbers and Diophantine equations. In 1969-71 he investigated the arithmetic properties of the Siegel hypergeometric E- functions with algebraic parameters and defined a wider class of E*-functions. His detailed studies of the Thue equation in algebraic number fields proved to be useful for the effective solution of a wide class of Diophantine equations and allowed him to study the possibility of effective approximations to algebraic numbers both in archimedean and non-archimedean domains. Sprindzuk's results are based on the connections between linear forms of logarithms in different norms. He observed that if a linear form is p-adically \"not too small\" then it cannot be too small in any other norm, be it archimedean or non-archimedean. A quantitative variant of this criterion led Sprindzuk to several effective results concerning the representation of numbers by binary forms, estimates for the magnitude of maximal prime factor of a binary form and the rational approximations to algebraic integers. He discovered in particular, a relation between the magnitude of the solutions of Diophantine equations and the number of classes of ideals, as well as some constructions of algebraic fields with the large class number.[4]/nHe was elected in 1969 a corresponding member and in 1986 a full member of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus. Beginning in 1970 he was on the editorial staff of Acta Arithmetica. In 1970 he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in Nice with talk New applications of analytic and p-adic methods in diophantine approximations.[5]/nThe theory of transcendental numbers, initiated by Liouville in 1844, has been enriched greatly in recent years.

At this time he was mainly known for chemical and medical interests.[4] It has been argued by Jean Jacquot that this group of experimental researchers, sponsored by Percy and Ralegh, represents the transitional moment from the still-magical theories of Giordano Bruno to real science.[5]/nHe may have been associated with Christopher Marlowe's study group on religion, branded atheists, but confusion is possible here with William Warner.[6]/nAfter Henry Percy's death, he was supported by Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, and then Sir Thomas Aylesbury.[1] Warner edited Harriot's Artis Analyticae Praxis in 1631.[7] He met Thomas Hobbes through Sir Charles Cavendish, who circulated Warner's works.[8]/nWarner was a friend of Robert Payne, chaplain to Cavendish;[9] and this connection is frequently used to associate Warner with the Welbeck Academy.[10] In 1634 Warner and Hobbes discussed refraction.[11] This acquaintance was later brought up against Hobbes in the Hobbes-Wallis controversy.[12]/nWith John Pell he computed the first table of antilogarithms in the 1630s.[13] John Aubrey, relying on Pell's testimony, states that Warner had claimed to have anticipated William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood, and that Harvey must have heard of it through a Mr Prothero. Pell also mentioned that Warner had been born without a left hand.[14]/nWarner was unpublished in his lifetime, but well known, in particular to Marin Mersenne who published some of his optical work in Universae geometriae (1646).

His theoretical studies into the oceanic tides not only \"solved practically all the remaining tidal problems which are soluble within the framework of classical hydrodynamics and analytical mathematics\" but laid the basis of a tidal prediction service developed with Arthur Doodson of great international importance./nProudman was born in the village of Unsworth, near Bury, Lancashire on 30 December 1888. He attended primary schools at Unsworth and Bold and from 1902 to 1907 he was a pupil-teacher at Farnworth primary school. He augmented his secondary schooling by having extra lessons before school officially started in the morning and also by attending evening classes at Widnes Technical School studying art, mathematics and physiography. He was awarded the Tate Technical Science entrance scholarship and entered the University of Liverpool in 1907. He graduated with first class honours in 1910 winning the Hudson prize for geometry and the Derby scholarship. With this and the award of an entrance exhibition, he had a second brilliant undergraduate career, studying pure and applied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge where he became a Wrangler with distinction graduating in 1912./nIt was his tutor Rev. E. W. Barnes who suggested that Proudman write to Horace Lamb at Manchester for a suitable topic of research. This started him on his studies of the dynamics of tides which was to become his main scientific interest. He returned to Liverpool as a lecturer in 1913, was appointed the first professor of applied mathematics in 1919./nIn 1916 Horace Lamb asked Proudman to assist him in preparing a report for the British Association on the state of research on ocean tides. This led Proudman to the idea of founding an institute for research into all aspects of tides. The idea was brought to fruition in 1919 with the financial aid of the Booth brothers, two Liverpool ship-owners. The Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute started its work with Proudman as Honorary Director and Arthur Doodson as Secretary and in a few years acquired a national and international reputation for its tidal prediction services as well as for fundamental research. In 1933 he transferred to the chair of oceanography to which he brought a change of emphasis from biological to physical oceanography. He held this post until his retirement in 1954./nIt is stated that from 1924 up to the 1950s the institute was responsible for predicting tides for two-thirds of the world. After several changes of name and status the institute (having amalgamated with the Liverpool Observatory in 1929) is now the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (see external links below)./nProudman used to say that his partnership with Doodson was so successful, because he liked to do the algebra while Doodson preferred the arithmetic, an understatement of their work which nevertheless indicated their complementary interests. In addition to his work in developing the departments of applied mathematics and oceanography, Proudman took a full part in University administration and acted as Pro-Vice-Chancellor during the war years 1940\u201346. Quoting the maxim that \"the quickest way to get a lot of things done is to do one thing at a time\" he was able to go straight to the heart of a problem, whether scientific or administrative, with an intuition which matched his intellectual ability./nProudman married Rubina Ormrod in 1916 and there were two sons and a daughter of their marriage (James, Nancy and Ian). After his first wife died in 1958, Proudman married Beryl Gould in 1961, who survived him. Proudman died on 26 June 1975./nProudman was a well-known figure in international scientific circles and acted as Secretary of the International Association of Physical Oceanography (now the International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans) for a number of years before becoming its president in 1951\u201354. His foreign distinctions included membership of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and the Alexander Agassiz Medal of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. The Adams prize of the University of Cambridge was awarded to Proudman in 1923 for an essay on tides, which proved to be a remarkable seed-bed of ideas from which there developed a series of papers, many of them jointly with Doodson, of theoretical and practical importance. He was awarded the CBE in the 1952 Birthday Honours. After his retirement the University of Liverpool conferred on him the honorary LLD degree.

He later dropped out of college to work for several dot com companies throughout the mid to late 1990s, the last being MojoNation, an ambitious but ill-fated project he worked on with Jim McCoy./nMojoNation allowed people to break up confidential files into encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces on computers also running the software. If someone wanted to download a copy of this encrypted file, they would have to download it simultaneously from many computers. This concept, Cohen thought, was perfect for a file sharing program, since programs like KaZaA take a long time to download a large file because the file is (usually) coming from one source (or \"peer\"). Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many sources, thus \nspeeding up the download time, especially for users with faster download than upload speeds. Thus, the more popular a file is, the faster a user will be able to download it, since many people will be downloading it at the same time, and these people will also be uploading the data to other users./nCohen says that he has Asperger syndrome[2] based on a self diagnosis.[3]/nIn April 2001, Cohen quit MojoNation and began work on BitTorrent.

He gave the first primitive recursive upper bound to van der Waerden's numbers V(C,N).[8] He extended Arrow's impossibility theorem on voting systems.[9]/nShelah's work has had a deep impact on model theory and set theory. The tools he developed for  his classification theory have been applied to a wide number of topics and problems in model theory and have led to great advances in stability theory and its uses in algebra and algebraic geometry as shown for example by Ehud Hrushovski and many others. Classification theory involves deep work developed in many dozens of  papers to completely solve the spectrum problem on classification of first order theories in terms of structure and number of nonisomorphic models, a huge tour de force. Following that he has extended the work far beyond first order theories, for example for abstract elementary classes.

Founded in 1934\u20131935, the Bourbaki group originally intended to prepare a new textbook in analysis. Over time the project became much more ambitious, growing into a large series of textbooks published under the Bourbaki name, meant to treat modern pure mathematics. The series is known collectively as the \u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique (Elements of Mathematics), the group's central work. Topics treated in the series include set theory, abstract algebra, topology, analysis, Lie groups and Lie algebras./nBourbaki was founded in response to the effects of the First World War which caused the death of a generation of French mathematicians; as a result, young university instructors were forced to use dated texts. While teaching at the University of Strasbourg, Henri Cartan complained to his colleague Andr\u00e9 Weil of the inadequacy of available course material, which prompted Weil to propose a meeting with others in Paris to collectively write a modern analysis textbook. The group's core founders were Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Weil; others participated briefly during the group's early years, and membership has changed gradually over time. Although former members openly discuss their past involvement with the group, Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret./nThe group's name derives from the 19th century French general Charles-Denis Bourbaki, who had a career of successful military campaigns before suffering a dramatic loss in the Franco-Prussian War.[3] The name was therefore familiar to early 20th-century French students. Weil remembered an ENS student prank in which an upperclassman posed as a professor and presented a \"theorem of Bourbaki\"; the name was later adopted./nThe Bourbaki group holds regular private conferences for the purpose of drafting and expanding the \u00c9l\u00e9ments. Topics are assigned to subcommittees, drafts are debated, and unanimous agreement is required before a text is deemed fit for publication. Although slow and labor-intensive, the process results in a work which meets the group's standards for rigour and generality. The group is also associated with the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, a regular series of lectures presented by members and non-members of the group, also published and disseminated as written documents. Bourbaki maintains an office at the ENS.[4]/nNicolas Bourbaki was influential in 20th-century mathematics, particularly during the middle of the century when volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments appeared frequently. The group is noted among mathematicians for its rigorous presentation and for introducing the notion of a mathematical structure, an idea related to the broader, interdisciplinary concept of structuralism.[5][6][7] Bourbaki's work informed the New Math, a trend in elementary math education during the 1960s. Although the group remains active, its influence is considered to have declined due to infrequent publication of new volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments. However, since 2012 the group has published four new (or significantly revised) volumes, the most recent in 2023 (treating spectral theory). Moreover, at least three further volumes are under preparation./nCharles-Denis Sauter Bourbaki was born on 22 April 1816 in Pau, Basses-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, now Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, France, to a family of Greek origin. He became a successful general during the era of Napoleon III, serving in the Crimean War and other conflicts. During the Franco-Prussian war however, Charles-Denis Bourbaki suffered a major defeat. At the time of the Siege of Metz, he was lured to Britain on false pretenses of a peace conference, and upon return to the continent he was tasked with lifting the Siege of Belfort, an effort which failed. Charles-Denis Bourbaki was forced to retreat with his army\u2014the Arm\u00e9e de l'Est\u2014across the Swiss border. The force was disarmed by the Swiss, and the general unsuccessfully attempted suicide. Charles-Denis Bourbaki later died on 27 September 1897, and the dramatic story of his defeat entered the French consciousness.[8][9]/nIn the early 20th century, the First World War affected Europeans of all professions and social classes, including mathematicians and male students who fought and died in the front. For example, the French mathematician Gaston Julia, a pioneer in the study of fractals, lost his nose during the war and wore a leather strap over the affected part of his face for the rest of his life. The deaths of ENS students resulted in a lost generation in the French mathematical community;[10] the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (c. 1900\u20131918, especially 1910\u20131916) and populations considered.[11][12] Furthermore, Bourbaki founder Andr\u00e9 Weil remarked in his memoir Apprenticeship of a Mathematician that France and Germany took different approaches with their intelligentsia during the war: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French culture of egalitarianism.[12]/nA succeeding generation of mathematics students attended the ENS during the 1920s, including Weil and others, the future founders of Bourbaki. During his time as a student, Weil recalled a prank in which an upperclassman, Raoul Husson\u00a0[fr], posed as a professor and gave a math lecture, ending with a prompt: \"Theorem of Bourbaki: you are to prove the following...\". Weil was also aware of a similar stunt around 1910[3] in which a student claimed to be from the fictional, impoverished nation of \"Poldevia\" and solicited the public for donations.[13][14] Weil had strong interests in languages and Indian culture, having learned Sanskrit and read the Bhagavad Gita.[15][16] After graduating from the ENS and obtaining his doctorate, Weil took a teaching stint at the Aligarh Muslim University in India. While there, Weil met the mathematician Damodar Kosambi, who was engaged in a power struggle with one of his colleagues. Weil suggested that Kosambi write an article with material attributed to one \"Bourbaki\", in order to show off his knowledge to the colleague.[17] Kosambi took the suggestion, attributing the material discussed in the article to \"the little-known Russian mathematician D. Bourbaki, who was poisoned during the Revolution.\" It was the first article in the mathematical literature with material attributed to the eponymous \"Bourbaki\".[18][19][20] Weil's stay in India was short-lived; he attempted to revamp the mathematics department at Aligarh, without success.[21] The university administration planned to fire Weil and promote his colleague Vijayaraghavan to the vacated position. However, Weil and Vijayaraghavan respected one another. Rather than play any role in the drama, Vijayaraghavan instead resigned, later informing Weil of the plan.[22] Weil returned to Europe to seek another teaching position. He ended up at the University of Strasbourg, joining his friend and colleague Henri Cartan.[23]/nDuring their time together at Strasbourg, Weil and Cartan regularly complained to each other regarding the inadequacy of available course material for calculus instruction. In his memoir Apprenticeship, Weil described his solution in the following terms: \"One winter day toward the end of 1934, I came upon a great idea that would put an end to these ceaseless interrogations by my comrade. 'We are five or six friends', I told him some time later, 'who are in charge of the same mathematics curriculum at various universities. Let us all come together and regulate these matters once and for all, and after this, I shall be delivered of these questions.' I was unaware of the fact that Bourbaki was born at that instant.\"[23] Cartan confirmed the account.[24]/nThe first, unofficial meeting of the Bourbaki collective took place at noon on Monday, 10 December 1934, at the Caf\u00e9 Grill-Room A. Capoulade, Paris, in the Latin Quarter.[25][26][27][28][b] Six mathematicians were present: Henri Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, Ren\u00e9 de Possel, and Andr\u00e9 Weil. Most of the group were based outside Paris and were in town to attend the Julia Seminar, a conference prepared with the help of Gaston Julia at which several future Bourbaki members and associates presented.[30][31][c] The group resolved to collectively write a treatise on analysis, for the purpose of standardizing calculus instruction in French universities. The project was especially meant to supersede the text of \u00c9douard Goursat, which the group found to be badly outdated, and to improve its treatment of Stokes' Theorem.[27][35][36][37] The founders were also motivated by a desire to incorporate ideas from the G\u00f6ttingen school, particularly from exponents Hilbert, Noether and B.L. van der Waerden. Further, in the aftermath of World War I, there was a certain nationalist impulse to save French mathematics from decline, especially in competition with Germany. As Dieudonn\u00e9 stated in an interview, \"Without meaning to boast, I can say that it was Bourbaki that saved French mathematics from extinction.\"[38]/nJean Delsarte was particularly favorable to the collective aspect of the proposed project, observing that such a working style could insulate the group's work against potential later individual claims of copyright.[35][39][d] As various topics were discussed, Delsarte also suggested that the work begin in the most abstract, axiomatic terms possible, treating all of mathematics prerequisite to analysis from scratch.[41][42] The group agreed to the idea, and this foundational area of the proposed work was referred to as the \"Abstract Packet\" (Paquet Abstrait).[43][44][45] Working titles were adopted: the group styled itself as the Committee for the Treatise on Analysis, and their proposed work was called the Treatise on Analysis (Trait\u00e9 d'analyse).[46][47] In all, the collective held ten preliminary biweekly meetings at A. Capoulade before its first official, founding conference in July 1935.[47][48] During this early period, Paul Dubreil, Jean Leray and Szolem Mandelbrojt joined and participated. Dubreil and Leray left the meetings before the following summer, and were respectively replaced by new participants Jean Coulomb and Charles Ehresmann.[46][49]/nThe group's official founding conference was held in Besse-en-Chandesse, from 10 to 17 July 1935.[50][51] At the time of the official founding, the membership consisted of the six attendees at the first lunch of 10 December 1934, together with Coulomb, Ehresmann and Mandelbrojt. On 16 July, the members took a walk to alleviate the boredom of unproductive proceedings. During the malaise, some decided to skinny-dip in the nearby Lac Pavin, repeatedly yelling \"Bourbaki!\"[52] At the close of the first official conference, the group renamed itself \"Bourbaki\", in reference to the general and prank as recalled by Weil and others.[45][e] During 1935, the group also resolved to establish the mathematical personhood of their collective pseudonym by getting an article published under its name.[50][54] A first name had to be decided; a full name was required for publication of any article. To this end, Ren\u00e9 de Possel's wife Eveline \"baptized\" the pseudonym with the first name of Nicolas, becoming Bourbaki's \"godmother\".[50][55][56][57] This allowed for the publication of a second article with material attributed to Bourbaki, this time under \"his\" own name.[58] Henri Cartan's father \u00c9lie Cartan, also a mathematician and supportive of the group, presented the article to the publishers, who accepted it.[54]/nAt the time of Bourbaki's founding, Ren\u00e9 de Possel and his wife Eveline were in the process of divorcing. Eveline remarried to Andr\u00e9 Weil in 1937, and de Possel left the Bourbaki collective some time later. This sequence of events has caused speculation that de Possel left the group because of the remarriage,[59] however this suggestion has also been criticized as possibly historically inaccurate, since de Possel is supposed to have remained active in Bourbaki for years after Andr\u00e9's marriage to Eveline.[60]/nBourbaki's work slowed significantly during the Second World War, though the group survived and later flourished. Some members of Bourbaki were Jewish and therefore forced to flee from certain parts of Europe at certain times. Weil, who was Jewish, spent the summer of 1939 in Finland with his wife Eveline, as guests of Lars Ahlfors. Due to their travel near the border, the couple were suspected as Soviet spies by Finnish authorities near the onset of the Winter War, and Andr\u00e9 was later arrested.[61] According to an anecdote, Weil was to have been executed but for the passing mention of his case to Rolf Nevanlinna, who asked that Weil's sentence be commuted.[62] However, the accuracy of this detail is dubious.[63] Weil reached the United States in 1941, later taking another teaching stint in S\u00e3o Paulo from 1945 to 1947 before settling at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958 and finally the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he spent the remainder of his career. Although Weil remained in touch with the Bourbaki collective and visited Europe and the group periodically following the war, his level of involvement with Bourbaki never returned to that at the time of founding./nSecond-generation Bourbaki member Laurent Schwartz was also Jewish and found pickup work as a math teacher in rural Vichy France. Moving from village to village, Schwartz planned his movements in order to evade capture by the Nazis.[64] On one occasion Schwartz found himself trapped overnight in a certain village, as his expected transportation home was unavailable. There were two inns in town: a comfortable, well-appointed one, and a very poor one with no heating and bad beds. Schwartz's instinct told him to stay at the poor inn; overnight, the Nazis raided the good inn, leaving the poor inn unchecked.[65]/nMeanwhile, Jean Delsarte, a Catholic, was mobilized in 1939 as the captain of an audio reconnaissance battery. He was forced to lead the unit's retreat from the northeastern part of France toward the south. While passing near the Swiss border, Delsarte overheard a soldier say \"We are the army of Bourbaki\";[66][67] the 19th-century general's retreat was known to the French. Delsarte had coincidentally led a retreat similar to that of the collective's namesake./nFollowing the war, Bourbaki had solidified the plan of its work and settled into a productive routine. Bourbaki regularly published volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments during the 1950s and 1960s, and enjoyed its greatest influence during this period.[68][69] Over time the founding members gradually left the group, slowly being replaced with younger newcomers including Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck. Serre, Grothendieck and Laurent Schwartz were awarded the Fields Medal during the postwar period, in 1954, 1966 and 1950 respectively. Later members Alain Connes and Jean-Christophe Yoccoz also received the Fields Medal, in 1982 and 1994 respectively.[70]/nThe later practice of accepting scientific awards contrasted with some of the founders' views.[71] During the 1930s, Weil and Delsarte petitioned against a French national scientific \"medal system\" proposed by the Nobel physics laureate Jean Perrin. Weil and Delsarte felt that the institution of such a system would increase unconstructive pettiness and jealousy in the scientific community.[72] Despite this, the Bourbaki group had previously successfully petitioned Perrin for a government grant to support its normal operations.[73] Like the founders, Grothendieck was also averse to awards, albeit for pacifist reasons. Although Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966, he declined to attend the ceremony in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet government.[74] In 1988, Grothendieck rejected the Crafoord Prize outright, citing no personal need to accept prize money, lack of recent relevant output, and general distrust of the scientific community.[75]/nBorn to Jewish anarchist parentage, Grothendieck survived the Holocaust and advanced rapidly in the French mathematical community, despite poor education during the war.[76] Grothendieck's teachers included Bourbaki's founders, and so he joined the group. During Grothendieck's membership, Bourbaki reached an impasse concerning its foundational approach. Grothendieck advocated for a reformulation of the group's work using category theory as its theoretical basis, as opposed to set theory. The proposal was ultimately rejected[77][78][79] in part because the group had already committed itself to a rigid track of sequential presentation, with multiple already-published volumes. Following this, Grothendieck left Bourbaki \"in anger\".[37][64][80] Biographers of the collective have described Bourbaki's unwillingness to start over in terms of category theory as a missed opportunity.[64][81][82] However, Bourbaki has in 2023 announced that a book on category theory is currently under preparation (see below the last paragraph of this section)./nDuring the founding period, the group chose the Parisian publisher Hermann to issue installments of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments. Hermann was led by Enrique Freymann, a friend of the founders willing to publish the group's project, despite financial risk. During the 1970s, Bourbaki entered a protracted legal battle with Hermann over matters of copyright and royalty payment. Although the Bourbaki group won the suit and retained collective copyright of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, the dispute slowed the group's productivity.[83][84] Former member Pierre Cartier described the lawsuit as a pyrrhic victory, saying: \"As usual in legal battles, both parties lost and the lawyer got rich.\"[64] Later editions of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments were published by Masson, and modern editions are published by Springer.[85] From the 1980s through the 2000s, Bourbaki published very infrequently, with the result that in 1998 Le Monde pronounced the collective \"dead\".[86]/nHowever, in 2012 Bourbaki resumed the publication of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments with a revised chapter 8 of algebra, the first 4 chapters of a new book on algebraic topology, and two volumes on spectral theory (the first of which is an expanded and revised version of the edition of 1967 while the latter consist of three new chapters). Moreover, the text of the two latest volumes announces that books on category theory and modular forms are currently under preparation (in addition to the latter part of the book on algebraic topology).[87][88]/nBourbaki holds periodic conferences for the purpose of expanding the \u00c9l\u00e9ments; these conferences are the central activity of the group's working life. Subcommittees are assigned to write drafts on specific material, and the drafts are later presented, vigorously debated, and re-drafted at the conferences. Unanimous agreement is required before any material is deemed acceptable for publication.[90][91][92] A given piece of material may require six or more drafts over a period of several years, and some drafts are never developed into completed work.[91][93] Bourbaki's writing process has therefore been described as \"Sisyphean\".[92] Although the method is slow, it yields a final product which satisfies the group's standards for mathematical rigour, one of Bourbaki's main priorities in the treatise. Bourbaki's emphasis on rigour was a reaction to the style of Henri Poincar\u00e9, who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical intuition at the cost of thorough presentation.[f] During the project's early years, Dieudonn\u00e9 served as the group's scribe, authoring several final drafts which were ultimately published. For this purpose, Dieudonn\u00e9 adopted an impersonal writing style which was not his own, but which was used to craft material acceptable to the entire group.[94][95] Dieudonn\u00e9 reserved his personal style for his own work; like all members of Bourbaki, Dieudonn\u00e9 also published material under his own name,[96] including the nine-volume \u00c9l\u00e9ments d'analyse, a work explicitly focused on analysis and of a piece with Bourbaki's initial intentions./nMost of the final drafts of Bourbaki's \u00c9l\u00e9ments carefully avoided using illustrations, favoring a formal presentation based only in text and formulas. An exception to this was the treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras (especially in chapters 4\u20136), which did make use of diagrams and illustrations. The inclusion of illustration in this part of the work was due to Armand Borel. Borel was minority-Swiss in a majority-French collective, and self-deprecated as \"the Swiss peasant\", explaining that visual learning was important to the Swiss national character.[64][97] When asked about the dearth of illustration in the work, former member Pierre Cartier replied:/nThe Bourbaki were Puritans, and Puritans are strongly opposed to pictorial representations of truths of their faith. The number of Protestants and Jews in the Bourbaki group was overwhelming. And you know that the French Protestants especially are very close to Jews in spirit./nThe conferences have historically been held at quiet rural areas.[98] These locations contrast with the lively, sometimes heated debates which have occurred. Laurent Schwartz reported an episode in which Weil slapped Cartan on the head with a draft. The hotel's proprietor saw the incident and assumed that the group would split up, but according to Schwartz, \"peace was restored within ten minutes.\"[99] The historical, confrontational style of debate within Bourbaki has been partly attributed to Weil, who believed that new ideas have a better chance of being born in confrontation than in an orderly discussion.[91][99] Schwartz related another illustrative incident: Dieudonn\u00e9 was adamant that topological vector spaces must appear in the work before integration, and whenever anyone suggested that the order be reversed, he would loudly threaten his resignation. This became an in-joke among the group; Roger Godement's wife Sonia attended a conference, aware of the idea, and asked for proof. As Sonia arrived at a meeting, a member suggested that integration must appear before topological vector spaces, which triggered Dieudonn\u00e9's usual reaction.[99]/nDespite the historical culture of heated argument, Bourbaki thrived during the middle of the twentieth century. Bourbaki's ability to sustain such a collective, critical approach has been described as \"something unusual\",[100] surprising even its own members. In founder Henri Cartan's words, \"That a final product can be obtained at all is a kind of miracle that none of us can explain.\"[101][102] It has been suggested that the group survived because its members believed strongly in the importance of their collective project, despite personal differences.[91][103] When the group overcame difficulties or developed an idea that they liked, they would sometimes say l'esprit a souffl\u00e9 (\"the spirit breathes\").[91][104] Historian Liliane Beaulieu noted that the \"spirit\"\u2014which might be an avatar, the group mentality in action, or Bourbaki \"himself\"\u2014was part of an internal culture and mythology which the group used to form its identity and perform work.[105]/nHumor has been an important aspect of the group's culture, beginning with Weil's memories of the student pranks involving \"Bourbaki\" and \"Poldevia\". For example, in 1939 the group released a wedding announcement for the marriage of \"Betti Bourbaki\" (daughter of Nicolas) to one \"H. P\u00e9tard\" (H. \"Firecrackers\" or \"Hector P\u00e9tard\"), a \"lion hunter\".[106] Hector P\u00e9tard was itself a pseudonym, but not one originally coined by the Bourbaki members. The P\u00e9tard moniker was originated by Ralph P. Boas, Frank Smithies and other Princeton mathematicians who were aware of the Bourbaki project; inspired by them, the Princeton mathematicians published an article on the \"mathematics of lion hunting\". After meeting Boas and Smithies, Weil composed the wedding announcement, which contained several mathematical puns.[107] Bourbaki's internal newsletter La Tribu has sometimes been issued with humorous subtitles to describe a given conference, such as \"The Extraordinary Congress of Old Fogies\" (where anyone older than 30 was considered a fogy) or \"The Congress of the Motorization of the Trotting Ass\" (an expression used to describe the routine unfolding of a mathematical proof, or process).[108][109]/nDuring the 1940s\u20131950s,[110][111] the American Mathematical Society received applications for individual membership from Bourbaki. They were rebuffed by J.R. Kline who understood the entity to be a collective, inviting them to re-apply for institutional membership. In response, Bourbaki floated a rumor that Ralph Boas was not a real person, but a collective pseudonym of the editors of Mathematical Reviews with which Boas had been affiliated. The reason for targeting Boas was because he had known the group in its earlier days when they were less strict with secrecy, and he'd described them as a collective in an article for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.[112] In November 1968, a mock obituary of Nicolas Bourbaki was released during one of the seminars.[113][114]/nThe group developed some variants of the word \"Bourbaki\" for internal use. The noun \"Bourbaki\" might refer to the group proper or to an individual member, e.g. \"Andr\u00e9 Weil was a Bourbaki.\" \"Bourbakist\" is sometimes used to refer to members[37] but also denotes associates, supporters, and enthusiasts.[115][116] To \"bourbakize\" meant to take a poor existing text and to improve it through an editing process.[93]/nBourbaki's culture of humor has been described as an important factor in the group's social cohesion and capacity to survive, smoothing over tensions of heated debate.[117] As of 2024, a Twitter account registered to \"Betty_Bourbaki\" provides regular updates on the group's activity.[118]/nBourbaki's work includes a series of textbooks, a series of printed lecture notes, journal articles, and an internal newsletter. The textbook series \u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique (Elements of mathematics) is the group's central work. The S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki is a lecture series held regularly under the group's auspices, and the talks given are also published as lecture notes. Journal articles have been published with authorship attributed to Bourbaki, and the group publishes an internal newsletter La Tribu (The Tribe) which is distributed to current and former members.[119][120]/nThe content of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments is divided into books\u2014major topics of discussion, volumes\u2014individual, physical books, and chapters, together with certain summaries of results, historical notes, and other details. The volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments have had a complex publication history. Material has been revised for new editions, published chronologically out of order of its intended logical sequence, grouped together and partitioned differently in later volumes, and translated into English. For example, the second book on Algebra was originally released in eight French volumes: the first in 1942 being chapter 1 alone, and the last in 1980 being chapter 10 alone. This presentation was later condensed into five volumes with chapters 1\u20133 in the first volume, chapters 4\u20137 in the second, and chapters 8\u201310 each remaining the third through fifth volumes of that portion of the work.[119] The English edition of Bourbaki's Algebra consists of translations of the three volumes consisting of chapters 1\u20133, 4\u20137 and 8, with chapters 9 and 10 unavailable in English as of 2024./nWhen Bourbaki's founders began working on the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, they originally conceived of it as a \"treatise on analysis\", the proposed work having a working title of the same name (Trait\u00e9 d'analyse). The opening part was to comprehensively deal with the foundations of mathematics prior to analysis, and was referred to as the \"Abstract Packet\". Over time, the members developed this proposed \"opening section\" of the work to the point that it would instead run for several volumes and comprise a major part of the work, covering set theory, abstract algebra, and topology. Once the project's scope expanded far beyond its original purpose, the working title Trait\u00e9 d'analyse was dropped in favor of \u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique.[45] The unusual, singular \"Mathematic\" was meant to connote Bourbaki's belief in the unity of mathematics.[121][122][123]  The first six books of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, representing the first half of the work, are numbered sequentially and ordered logically, with a given statement being established only on the basis of earlier results.[124]  This first half of the work bore the subtitle Les structures fondamentales de l\u2019analyse (Fundamental Structures of Analysis),[119][125][126] covering established mathematics (algebra, analysis) in the group's style.  The second half of the work consists of unnumbered books treating modern areas of research (Lie groups, commutative algebra), each presupposing the first half as a shared foundation but without dependence on each other.  This second half of the work, consisting of newer research topics, does not have a corresponding subtitle./nThe volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments published by Hermann were indexed by chronology of publication and referred to as fascicules: installments in a large work. Some volumes did not consist of the normal definitions, proofs, and exercises in a math textbook, but contained only summaries of results for a given topic, stated without proof. These volumes were referred to as Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats, with the result that fascicule may refer to a volume of Hermann's edition, or to one of the \"summary\" sections of the work (e.g. Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats is translated as \"Summary of Results\" rather than \"Installment of Results\", referring to the content rather than a specific volume).[g] The first volume of Bourbaki's \u00c9l\u00e9ments to be published was the Summary of Results in the Theory of Sets, in 1939.[64][119][129] Similarly one of the work's later books, Differential and Analytic Manifolds, consisted only of two volumes of summaries of results, with no chapters of content having been published./nLater installments of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments appeared infrequently during the 1980s and 1990s. A volume of Commutative Algebra (chapters 8\u20139) was published in 1983, and no other volumes were issued until the appearance of the same book's tenth chapter in 1998. During the 2010s, Bourbaki increased its productivity. A re-written and expanded version of the eighth chapter of Algebra appeared in 2012, the first four chapters of a new book treating Algebraic Topology was published in 2016, and the first two chapters of a revised and expanded edition of Spectral Theory was issued in 2019 while the remaining three (completely new) chapters appeared in 2023./nThe S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki has been held regularly since 1948, and lectures are presented by non-members and members of the collective. As of 2024 the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki has run to over a thousand recorded lectures in its written incarnation, denoted chronologically by simple numbers.[138] At the time of a June 1999 lecture given by Jean-Pierre Serre on the topic of Lie groups, the total lectures given in the series numbered 864, corresponding to roughly 10,000 pages of printed material.[139]/nSeveral journal articles have appeared in the mathematical literature with material or authorship attributed to Bourbaki; unlike the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, they were typically written by individual members[119] and not crafted through the usual process of group consensus. Despite this, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9's essay \"The Architecture of Mathematics\" has become known as Bourbaki's manifesto.[140][141] Dieudonn\u00e9 addressed the issue of overspecialization in mathematics, to which he opposed the inherent unity of mathematic (as opposed to mathematics) and proposed mathematical structures as useful tools which can be applied to several subjects, showing their common features.[142] To illustrate the idea, Dieudonn\u00e9 described three different systems in arithmetic and geometry and showed that all could be described as examples of a group, a specific kind of (algebraic) structure.[143] Dieudonn\u00e9 described the axiomatic method as \"the 'Taylor system' for mathematics\" in the sense that it could be used to solve problems efficiently.[144][i] Such a procedure would entail identifying relevant structures and applying established knowledge about the given structure to the specific problem at hand.[144]/nLa Tribu is Bourbaki's internal newsletter, distributed to current and former members. The newsletter usually documents recent conferences and activity in a humorous, informal way, sometimes including poetry.[145] Member Pierre Samuel wrote the newsletter's narrative sections for several years.[146] Early editions of La Tribu and related documents have been made publicly available by Bourbaki.[33]/nHistorian Liliane Beaulieu examined La Tribu and Bourbaki's other writings, describing the group's humor and private language as an \"art of memory\" which is specific to the group and its chosen methods of operation.[147] Because of the group's secrecy and informal organization, individual memories are sometimes recorded in a fragmentary way, and may not have significance to other members.[148] On the other hand, the predominantly French, ENS background of the members, together with stories of the group's early period and successes, create a shared culture and mythology which is drawn upon for group identity. La Tribu usually lists the members present at a conference, together with any visitors, family members or other friends in attendance. Humorous descriptions of location or local \"props\" (cars, bicycles, binoculars, etc.) can also serve as mnemonic devices.[108]/nAs of 2000, Bourbaki has had \"about forty\" members.[149] Historically the group has numbered about ten[150] to twelve[64] members at any given point, although it was briefly (and officially) limited to nine members at the time of founding.[47] Bourbaki's membership has been described in terms of generations:/nBourbaki was always a very small group of mathematicians, typically numbering about twelve people.  Its first generation was that of the founding fathers, those who created the group in 1934: Weil, Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, de Possel, and Dieudonn\u00e9.  Others joined the group, and others left its ranks, so that some years later there were about twelve members, and that number remained roughly constant.  Laurent Schwartz was the only mathematician to join Bourbaki during the war, so his is considered an intermediate generation.  After the war, a number of members joined: Jean-Pierre Serre, Pierre Samuel, Jean-Louis Koszul, Jacques Dixmier, Roger Godement, and Sammy Eilenberg.  These people constituted the second generation of Bourbaki.  In the 1950s, the third generation of mathematicians joined Bourbaki.  These people included Alexandre Grothendieck, Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat, Serge Lang, the American mathematician John Tate, Pierre Cartier, and the Swiss mathematician Armand Borel.[64][151]/nAfter the first three generations there were roughly twenty later members, not including current participants. Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret, a practice meant to ensure that its output is presented as a collective, unified effort under the Bourbaki pseudonym, not attributable to any one author (e.g. for purposes of copyright or royalty payment). This secrecy is also intended to deter unwanted attention which could disrupt normal operations. However, former members freely discuss Bourbaki's internal practices upon departure.[64][152]/nProspective members are invited to conferences and styled as guinea pigs, a process meant to vet the newcomer's mathematical ability.[64][153] In the event of agreement between the group and the prospect, the prospect eventually becomes a full member.[j] The group is supposed to have an age limit: active members are expected to retire at (or about) 50 years of age.[64][92] At a 1956 conference, Cartan read a letter from Weil which proposed a \"gradual disappearance\" of the founding members, forcing younger members to assume full responsibility for Bourbaki's operations.[37][158] This rule is supposed to have resulted in a complete change of personnel by 1958.[55] However, historian Liliane Beaulieu has been critical of the claim. She reported never having found written affirmation of the rule,[159] and has indicated that there have been exceptions.[160] The age limit is thought to express the founders' intent that the project should continue indefinitely, operated by people at their best mathematical ability\u2014in the mathematical community, there is a widespread belief that mathematicians produce their best work while young.[158][161] Among full members there is no official hierarchy; all operate as equals, having the ability to interrupt conference proceedings at any point, or to challenge any material presented. However, Andr\u00e9 Weil has been described as \"first among equals\" during the founding period, and was given some deference.[162] On the other hand, the group has also poked fun at the idea that older members should be afforded greater respect.[163]/nBourbaki conferences have also been attended by members' family, friends, visiting mathematicians, and other non-members of the group.[k] Bourbaki is not known ever to have had any female members.[92][150]/nBourbaki was influential in 20th century mathematics and had some interdisciplinary impact on the humanities and the arts, although the extent of the latter influence is a matter of dispute. The group has been praised and criticized for its method of presentation, its working style, and its choice of mathematical topics./nBourbaki introduced several mathematical notations which have remained in use. Weil took the letter \u00d8 of the Norwegian alphabet and used it to denote the empty set, \n\n\n\n\u2205\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varnothing }\n\n.[173] This notation first appeared in the Summary of Results on the Theory of Sets,[174] and remains in use. The words injective, surjective and bijective were introduced to refer to functions which satisfy certain properties.[175][176] Bourbaki used simple language for certain geometric objects, naming them pav\u00e9s (paving stones) and boules (balls) as opposed to \"parallelotopes\" or \"hyperspheroids\".[177] Similarly in its treatment of topological vector spaces, Bourbaki defined a barrel as a set which is convex, balanced, absorbing, and closed.[178] The group were proud of this definition, believing that the shape of a wine barrel typified the mathematical object's properties.[179][180] Bourbaki also employed a \"dangerous bend\" symbol \u2621 in the margins of its text to indicate an especially difficult piece of material. Bourbaki enjoyed its greatest influence during the 1950s and 1960s, when installments of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments were published frequently./nBourbaki had some interdisciplinary influence on other fields, including anthropology and psychology. This influence was in the context of structuralism, a school of thought in the humanities which stresses the relationships between objects over the objects themselves, pursued in various fields by other French intellectuals. In 1943, Andr\u00e9 Weil met the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss in New York, where the two undertook a brief collaboration. At L\u00e9vi-Strauss' request, Weil wrote a brief appendix describing marriage rules for four classes of people within Australian aboriginal society, using a mathematical model based on group theory.[5][181] The result was published as an appendix in L\u00e9vi-Strauss' Elementary Structures of Kinship, a work examining family structures and the incest taboo in human cultures.[182] In 1952, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Jean Piaget participated in an interdisciplinary conference on mathematical and mental structures. Dieudonn\u00e9 described mathematical \"mother structures\" in terms of Bourbaki's project: composition, neighborhood, and order.[183] Piaget then gave a talk on children's mental processes, and considered that the psychological concepts he had just described were very similar to the mathematical ones just described by Dieudonn\u00e9.[184][185] According to Piaget, the two were \"impressed with each other\".[186] The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan liked Bourbaki's collaborative working style and proposed a similar collective group in psychology, an idea which did not materialize.[187]/nBourbaki was also cited by post-structuralist philosophers. In their joint work Anti-Oedipus, Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari presented a criticism of capitalism. The authors cited Bourbaki's use of the axiomatic method (with the purpose of establishing truth) as a distinct counter-example to management processes which instead seek economic efficiency. The authors said of Bourbaki's axiomatics that \"they do not form a Taylor system\", inverting the phrase used by Dieudonn\u00e9 in \"The Architecture of Mathematics\".[144][188] In The Postmodern Condition, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard criticized the \"legitimation of knowledge\", the process by which statements become accepted as valid. As an example, Lyotard cited Bourbaki as a group which produces knowledge within a given system of rules.[189][190] Lyotard contrasted Bourbaki's hierarchical, \"structuralist\" mathematics with the catastrophe theory of Ren\u00e9 Thom and the fractals of Benoit Mandelbrot,[s] expressing preference for the latter \"postmodern science\" which problematized mathematics with \"fracta, catastrophes, and pragmatic paradoxes\".[189][190]/nAlthough biographer Amir Aczel stressed Bourbaki's influence on other disciplines during the mid-20th century, Maurice Mashaal moderated the claims of Bourbaki's influence in the following terms:/nWhile Bourbaki's structures were often mentioned in social science conferences and publications of the era, it seems that they didn't play a real role in the development of these disciplines.  David Aubin, a science historian who analyzed Bourbaki's role in the structuralist movement in France, believes Bourbaki's role was that of a \"cultural connector\".[192]  According to Aubin, while Bourbaki didn't have any mission outside of mathematics, the group represented a sort of link between the various cultural movements of the time.  Bourbaki provided a simple and relatively precise definition of concepts and structures, which philosophers and social scientists believed was fundamental within their disciplines and in bridges among different areas of knowledge.  Despite the superficial nature of these links, the various schools of structuralist thinking, including Bourbaki, were able to support each other.  So, it is not a coincidence that these schools suffered a simultaneous decline in the late 1960s./nThe impact of \"structuralism\" on mathematics itself was also criticized. The mathematical historian Leo Corry argued that Bourbaki's use of mathematical structures was unimportant within the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, having been established in Theory of Sets and cited infrequently afterwards.[197][198][199][200] Corry described the \"structural\" view of mathematics promoted by Bourbaki as an \"image of knowledge\"\u2014a conception about a scientific discipline\u2014as opposed to an item in the discipline's \"body of knowledge\", which refers to the actual scientific results in the discipline itself.[198]/nBourbaki also had some influence in the arts. The literary collective Oulipo was founded on 24 November 1960 under circumstances similar to Bourbaki's founding, with the members initially meeting in a restaurant. Although several members of Oulipo were mathematicians, the group's purpose was to create experimental literature by playing with language. Oulipo frequently employed mathematically-based constrained writing techniques, such as the S+7 method. Oulipo member Raymond Queneau attended a Bourbaki conference in 1962.[185][201]/nIn 2016, an anonymous group of economists collaboratively wrote a note alleging academic misconduct by the authors and editor of a paper published in the American Economic Review.[202][203] The note was published under the name Nicolas Bearbaki in homage to Nicolas Bourbaki.[204]/nIn 2018, the American musical duo Twenty One Pilots released a concept album named Trench. The album's conceptual framework was the mythical city of \"Dema\" ruled by nine \"bishops\"; one of the bishops was named \"Nico\", short for Nicolas Bourbaki.  Another of the bishops was named Andre, which may refer to Andr\u00e9 Weil.  Following the album's release, there was a spike in internet searches for \"Nicolas Bourbaki\".[37][v]/nBourbaki's work has been praised by some mathematicians. In a book review, Emil Artin described the \u00c9l\u00e9ments in broad, positive terms:/nOur time is witnessing the creation of a monumental work: an exposition of the whole of present day mathematics. Moreover this exposition is done in such a way that the common bond between the various branches of mathematics become clearly visible, that the framework which supports the whole structure is not apt to become obsolete in a very short time, and that it can easily absorb new ideas./nAmong the volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, Bourbaki's work on Lie Groups and Lie Algebras has been identified as \"excellent\",[193] having become a standard reference on the topic. In particular, former member Armand Borel described the volume with chapters 4\u20136 as \"one of the most successful books by Bourbaki\".[206] The success of this part of the work has been attributed to the fact that the books were composed while leading experts on the topic were Bourbaki members.[64][207]/nJean-Pierre Bourguignon expressed appreciation for the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, saying that he'd learned a large amount of material at its lectures, and referred to its printed lecture notes regularly.[208] He also praised the \u00c9l\u00e9ments for containing \"some superb and very clever proofs\".[209]/nBourbaki has also been criticized by several mathematicians\u2014including its own former members\u2014for a variety of reasons. Criticisms have included the choice of presentation of certain topics within the \u00c9l\u00e9ments at the expense of others,[w] dislike of the method of presentation for given topics, dislike of the group's working style, and a perceived elitist mentality around Bourbaki's project and its books, especially during the collective's most productive years in the 1950s and 1960s./nBourbaki's deliberations on the \u00c9l\u00e9ments resulted in the inclusion of some topics, while others were not treated. When asked in a 1997 interview about topics left out of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments, former member Pierre Cartier replied:/nThere is essentially no analysis beyond the foundations: nothing about partial differential equations, nothing about probability. There is also nothing about combinatorics, nothing about algebraic topology,[x] nothing about concrete geometry. And Bourbaki never seriously considered logic. Dieudonn\u00e9 himself was very vocal against logic.  Anything connected with mathematical physics is totally absent from Bourbaki's text./nAlthough Bourbaki had resolved to treat mathematics from its foundations, the group's eventual solution in terms of set theory was attended by several problems. Bourbaki's members were mathematicians as opposed to logicians, and therefore the collective had a limited interest in mathematical logic.[93] As Bourbaki's members themselves said of the book on set theory, it was written \"with pain and without pleasure, but we had to do it.\"[212] Dieudonn\u00e9 personally remarked elsewhere that ninety-five percent of mathematicians \"don't care a fig\" for mathematical logic.[213] In response, logician Adrian Mathias harshly criticized Bourbaki's foundational framework, noting that it did not take G\u00f6del's results into account.[214][215]/nBourbaki also influenced the New Math, a failed[216] reform in Western mathematics education at the elementary and secondary levels, which stressed abstraction over concrete examples. During the mid-20th century, reform in basic math education was spurred by a perceived need to create a mathematically literate workforce for the modern economy, and also to compete with the Soviet Union. In France, this led to the Lichnerowicz Commission of 1967, headed by Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz and including some (then-current and former) Bourbaki members. Although Bourbaki members had previously (and individually) reformed math instruction at the university level, they had less direct involvement with implementation of the New Math at the primary and secondary levels. New Math reforms resulted in instructional material which was incomprehensible to both students and teachers, failing to meet the cognitive needs of younger students. The attempted reform was harshly criticized by Dieudonn\u00e9 and also by brief founding Bourbaki participant Jean Leray.[217] Apart from French mathematicians, the French reforms also met with harsh criticism from Soviet-born mathematician Vladimir Arnold, who argued that in his time as a student and teacher in Moscow, the teaching of mathematics was firmly rooted in analysis and geometry, and interweaved with problems from classical mechanics; hence, the French reforms cannot be a legitimate attempt to emulate Soviet scientific education. In 1997, while speaking to a conference on mathematical teaching in Paris, he commented on Bourbaki by stating: \"genuine mathematicians do not gang up, but the weak need gangs in order to survive.\" and suggested that Bourbaki's bonding over \"super-abstractness\" was similar to groups of mathematicians in the 19th century who had bonded over anti-Semitism.[218]/nDieudonn\u00e9 later regretted that Bourbaki's success had contributed to a snobbery for pure mathematics in France, at the expense of applied mathematics. In an interview, he said: \"It is possible to say that there was no serious applied mathematics in France for forty years after Poincar\u00e9. There was even a snobbery for pure math. When one noticed a talented student, one would tell him 'You should do pure math.' On the other hand, one would advise a mediocre student to do applied math while thinking, \"It's all that he can do! ... The truth is actually the reverse. You can't do good work in applied math until you can do good work in pure math.\"[219] Claude Chevalley confirmed an elitist culture within Bourbaki, describing it as \"an absolute certainty of our superiority over other mathematicians.\"[93] Alexander Grothendieck also confirmed an elitist mentality within Bourbaki.[79] Some mathematicians, especially geometers and applied mathematicians, found Bourbaki's influence to be stifling.[220] Benoit Mandelbrot's decision to emigrate to the United States in 1958 was motivated in part by a desire to escape Bourbaki's influence in France.[221]/nSeveral related criticisms of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments have concerned its target audience and the intent of its presentation. Volumes of the \u00c9l\u00e9ments begin with a note to the reader which says that the series \"takes up mathematics at the beginning, and gives complete proofs\" and that \"the method of exposition we have chosen is axiomatic and abstract, and normally proceeds from the general to the particular.\"[222] Despite the opening language, Bourbaki's intended audience are not absolute beginners in mathematics, but rather undergraduates, graduate students, and professors who are familiar with mathematical concepts.[223] Claude Chevalley said that the \u00c9l\u00e9ments are \"useless for a beginner\",[224] and Pierre Cartier clarified that \"The misunderstanding was that it should be a textbook for everybody. That was the big disaster.\"[64]/nThe work is divided into two halves. While the first half\u2014the Structures fondamentales de l\u2019analyse\u2014treats established subjects, the second half deals with modern research areas like commutative algebra and spectral theory. This divide in the work is related to a historical change in the intent of the treatise. The \u00c9l\u00e9ments' content consists of theorems, proofs, exercises and related commentary, common material in math textbooks. Despite this presentation, the first half was not written as original research but rather as a reorganized presentation of established knowledge. In this sense, the \u00c9l\u00e9ments' first half was more akin to an encyclopedia than a textbook series. As Cartier remarked, \"The misunderstanding was that many people thought it should be taught the way it was written in the books. You can think of the first books of Bourbaki as an encyclopedia of mathematics... If you consider it as a textbook, it's a disaster.\"[64]/nThe strict, ordered presentation of material in the \u00c9l\u00e9ments' first half was meant to form the basis for any further additions. However, developments in modern mathematical research have proven difficult to adapt in terms of Bourbaki's organizational scheme. This difficulty has been attributed to the fluid, dynamic nature of ongoing research which, being new, is not settled or fully understood.[193][225] Bourbaki's style has been described as a particular scientific paradigm which has been superseded in a paradigm shift. For example, Ian Stewart cited Vaughan Jones' novel work in knot theory as an example of topology which was done without dependence on Bourbaki's system.[226] Bourbaki's influence has declined over time;[226] this decline has been partly attributed to the absence of certain modern topics\u2014such as category theory\u2014from the treatise.[81][82]/nAlthough multiple criticisms have pointed to shortcomings in the collective's project, one has also pointed to its strength: Bourbaki was a \"victim of its own success\"[193] in the sense that it accomplished what it set out to do, achieving its original goal of presenting a thorough treatise on modern mathematics.[227][228][229] These factors prompted biographer Maurice Mashaal to conclude his treatment of Bourbaki in the following terms:/nSuch an enterprise deserves admiration for its breadth, for its enthusiasm and selflessness, for its strongly collective character.  Despite some mistakes, Bourbaki did add a little to 'the honor of the human spirit'.  In an era when sports and money are such great idols of civilization, this is no small virtue./nOther collective mathematical pseudonyms", "28020193": "Ermil A.

King Christian V of Denmark appointed Bartholin as his physician with a substantial salary and freed the farm from taxation as recompense for the loss.

Jean Pecquet had previously noted the lymphatic system in animals in 1651, and Pecquet's discovery of the thoracic duct and its entry into the veins made him the first person to describe the correct route of the lymphatic fluid into the blood.[3] Shortly after the publication of Pecquet's and Bartholin's findings, a similar discovery of the human lymphatic system was published by Olof Rudbeck in 1653, although Rudbeck had presented his findings at the court of Queen Christina of Sweden in April\u2013May 1652, before Bartholin, but delayed in writing about it until 1653 (after Bartholin).

Biss carried two counties, McLean and Champaign.[55]/nHaving not sought reelection in the 2018 Illinois Senate election (instead running for governor), Biss was succeeded in the Illinois Senate by Laura Fine on January 6, 2019.[56]/nOn September 18, 2018, Biss announced in an email to supporters that he had accepted the position of executive director of the nonprofit Rust Belt Rising, which aims to train and support Democratic candidates in the Great Lakes states.[57]/nOn August 15, 2019, Biss endorsed Elizabeth Warren for president.[58][59] In January 2020, Biss was selected to be on Warren's slate of 101 potential Illinois delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention,[60][61] but Warren suspended her campaign on March 5, before the presidential primary in Illinois on March 17.[62]/nOn September 16, 2020, Biss announced the launch of a campaign for mayor of Evanston, Illinois.[63][64][65][66] On October 28, 2020, the incumbent mayor, Steve Hagerty, announced that he would not be seeking reelection.[67]/nBiss' mayoral campaign received many prominent endorsements. In December 2020, his campaign rolled out a list of 100 endorsements, including those of nine Evanston aldermen, as well as United States congresswoman Jan Schakowsky; state senator Laura Fine; state representatives Kelly Cassidy, Robyn Gabel, Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz; and Cook County commissioner Larry Suffredin.[68] The Democratic Party of Evanston gave Biss its endorsement,[69][70] as did Northside Democracy for America,[71] the Organization for Positive Action and Leadership (OPAL),[72] and the Community Alliance for Better Government (CABG).[73] Biss was also endorsed by incumbent mayor Stephen Hagerty, and former mayors Elizabeth Tisdahl and Jay Lytle.[74] On February 18, 2021, Biss' former gubernatorial primary opponent J.B. Pritzker, now the governor of Illinois, endorsed his candidacy for mayor.[75]/nBiss had a vast financial advantage over his two opponents. In the first three months after announcing his candidacy, he had received in excess of $100,000 in contributions. By that point, opponent Lori Keenan had only raised $3,000 and opponent Sebastian Nalls  had only raised $1,000.[74]/nBiss won a landslide victory in the consolidated primary on February 23, 2021, forgoing the need for a runoff by receiving an outright majority of the vote.[76] Biss won all but one of the city's 50 voting precincts.[77]/nAhead of the April 6 Evanston municipal general election, mayor-elect Biss criticized the group Evanston Together LLC for distributing mailers which inaccurately implied that several candidates for municipal office had outright supported switching the city from a council-manager government to a strong mayor government. Biss also remarked that, while a shift in the city's form of government would not be a priority to him, he is not opposed to exploring the idea if it would remedy issues in the city.[78]/nIn March 2021, after Evanston passed a measure establishing the first expenditure of the city's first-in-the-nation municipal fund offering reparations to black residents, mayor-elect Biss released a statement in support of the approved measure.[79] Biss also gave outgoing mayor Steve Hagerty input on the members he recommended to the city's Reparations Committee.[80]/nOn May 10, 2021, Biss took office as mayor.[81]", "101891": "Gian-Carlo Rota (April 27, 1932 \u2013 April 18, 1999) was an Italian-American mathematician and philosopher.

His series of ten papers on the \"Foundations of Combinatorics\" in the 1960s is credited with making it a respectable branch of modern mathematics.[5] He said that the one combinatorial idea he would like to be remembered for is the correspondence between combinatorial problems and problems of the location of the zeroes of polynomials.[8] He worked on the theory of incidence algebras (which generalize the 19th-century theory of M\u00f6bius inversion) and popularized their study among combinatorialists, set the umbral calculus on a rigorous foundation, unified the theory of Sheffer sequences and polynomial sequences of binomial type, and worked on fundamental problems in probability theory.

In 1962, he was promoted to Professor of Probability theory and analysis, and from 1966 to his retirement in 1997 was Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics.[2] Among his doctorate students were Gijsbert de Leve (1964), Laurens de Haan (1970), Fred Steutel (1971), Wim Vervaat (1972), August Balkema (1973), Frits G\u00f6bel (1974), Arie Hordijk (1974), Aegle Hoekstra (1983), Peter de Jong (1988) and Leo Klein Haneveld (1996).[1]", "2756109": "Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt (Latin), Pierre Pelerin de Maricourt (French), or Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt[1] (fl. 1269), was a French mathematician, physicist, and writer who conducted experiments on magnetism and wrote the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets. His work is particularly noted for containing the earliest detailed discussion of freely pivoting compass needles, a fundamental component of the dry compass soon to appear in medieval navigation.[2][3][4] He also wrote a treatise on the construction and use of a universal astrolabe./nPeregrinus' text on the magnet is entitled in many of the manuscripts of it Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt, militem, de magnete (\"Letter of Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt to Sygerus of Foucaucourt, Soldier, on the Magnet\") but it is more commonly known by its short title, Epistola de magnete (\"Letter on the Magnet\"). The letter is addressed to an otherwise unknown Picard countryman named Sygerus (Sigerus, Ysaerus) of Foucaucourt, possibly a friend and neighbor of the author; Foucaucourt borders on the home area of Peregrinus around Maricourt, in the present-day department of the Somme, near P\u00e9ronne./nIn only one of the 39 surviving manuscript copies the letter also bears the closing legend Actum in castris in obsidione Luceri\u00e6 anno domini 1269\u00ba 8\u00ba die augusti (\"Done in camp during the siege of Lucera, August 8, 1269\"), which might indicate that Peregrinus was in the army of Charles, duke of Anjou and king of Sicily, who in 1269 laid siege to the city of Lucera. However, given that only one manuscript attests this, the evidence is weak.[5] There is no indication of why Peter received the sobriquet Peregrinus (or \"pilgrim\"), but it suggests that he may have been either a pilgrim at one point or a crusader; and the attack on Lucera of 1269 had been sanctioned as a crusade by the Pope. So Petrus Peregrinus may have served in that army./n\"You must realize, dearest friend,\" Peregrinus writes, \"that while the investigator in this subject must understand nature and not be ignorant of the celestial motions, he must also be very diligent in the use of his own hands, so that through the operation of this stone he may show wonderful effects.\"[6]/nIn his letter of 1269,[7] Peregrinus explains how to identify the poles of the compasses. He also describes the laws of magnetic attraction and repulsion. The letters also contain a description of an experiment with a repaired magnet, as well as a number of compasses, one of which \"you will be able to direct your steps to cities and islands and to any place whatever in the world.\" Indeed, the increasing perfection of magnetic compasses during the thirteenth century allowed navigators such as Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi to strike out on voyages to unknown lands./nThe Epistola de magnete is divided into two parts. Part One (10 chapters): This is a section that serves as a model of inductive reasoning based on definite experiences, and setting forth the fundamental laws of magnetism. He did not discover these laws, but presented them in logical order. Part One discusses the physical (but not the occult) properties of the lodestone and provides the first extant written account of the polarity of magnets. He was thus the first to use the word \"pole\" in this context. He provides methods for determining the north and south poles of a magnet, and he describes the effects magnets have upon one another, showing that like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. He also treats the attraction of iron by lodestones, the magnetization of iron by lodestones, and the ability to reverse the polarity in such an induced magnet. Peregrinus attributed the Earth's magnetism to the action of celestial poles, rather than to the terrestrial poles of the planet itself.[8]/nPart Two (three chapters): This section describes three devices that utilize the properties of magnets. He treats the practical applications of magnets, describing the \"wet\" floating compass as an instrument, and a \"dry\" pivoted compass in some detail. He also attempts to prove that with the help of magnets it is possible to realize perpetual motion (see History of perpetual motion machines). His device is a toothed wheel which passes near a lodestone so that the teeth are alternately attracted by one pole and repelled by the other./nThe Nova Compositio Astrolabii Particularis (found in only 4 manuscripts) describes the construction and use a universal astrolabe which could be used at a variety of latitudes without changing the plates. Unlike al-Zarq\u0101l\u012b's more famous universal astrolabe in which vertical halves the heavens were projected onto a plane through the poles, this one had both the northern and southern hemispheres projected onto a plane through the equator (which was also the limit of projection). There are no known surviving astrolabes based on this treatise. The use of such an astrolabe is very complicated, and since it is probable that most sophisticated users were not frequent travelers, they were more likely happier with the traditional (and simpler) stereographic planispheric astrolabe./nThe literature often mentions that Peregrinus was praised by Roger Bacon, who called him a \"perfect mathematician\" and one who valued experience over argument. But the association of the praise with Peregrinus appears only in a marginal gloss to Bacon's Opus tertium and only in one of the five manuscripts used in the critical edition, which leads us to conclude that it was a later comment added by someone else. That Bacon's praise was for Peregrinus is open to serious debate.[9]/nThe influence of Peregrinus' astrolabe was virtually nil. His reputation derives mainly from his work on magnetism. The De magnete became a very popular work from the Middle Ages onwards, as witnessed by the large number of manuscript copies./nThe first printed edition of it was issued at Augsburg, in 1558, by Achilles Gasser.[10] In 1562, Jean Taisner published from the press of Johann Birkmann of Cologne a work entitled Opusculum perpetua memoria dignissimum, de natura magnetis et ejus effectibus, Item de motu continuo.[11] This is considered a piece of plagiarism, as Taisnier presents, as though his own, the Epistola de magnete of Peregrinus and a treatise on the fall of bodies by Gianbattista Benedetti./nWilliam Gilbert acknowledged his debt to Peregrinus and incorporated this thirteenth-century scientist's experiments on magnetism into his own treatise, called De magnete.[12]/nThe Epistola de magnete was later issued by Guillaume Libri (Histoire des sciences math\u00e9matiques en Italie, vol 2 [Paris, 1838], pp.\u00a0487\u2013505), but, based on only one manuscript, this edition was full of defects; corrected editions were published by Timoteo Bertelli (in Bulletino di bibliografia e di storia delle scienze matematiche e fisiche pubblicata da B.

In 1832, under the leadership of Everest, the longitudinal series of the \"triangle\" survey was completed from Sironj in Central India to Calcutta in Bengal./nWhile still working on mapping Calcutta, Bengal, Everest had begun his search for a mathematician, and soon enough, John Tytler, a professor of Mathematics at the Hindu College, now known as the Presidency College, recommended his 19-year-old pupil, Radhanath Sikdar./nRadhanath, a student of the college since 1824, was one of the first two Indians to read Isaac Newton's Principia and by 1832; he had studied Euclid's Elements, Thomas Jephson's Fluxion and Analytical Geometry and Astronomy by Windhouse. Taking inspiration from these prestigious papers, he devised a new method to draw a common tangent to two circles, when he was just a teenager. There was little doubt about Radhanath's proficiency in his subject, and he secured the job at the GTS on 19 December 1831 as a \"computer\" at a salary of thirty rupees per month./nSoon he was sent to Sironj near Dehradun. Even as seven other Bengali \u2018computers\u2019 worked alongside him, Radhanath soon showed his superior skills in mathematics and became Everest\u2019s favourite colleague. So much so, that he once stopped his transfer to another department. Radhanath\u2019s job was to carry geodetic surveys\u2014the study of the earth\u2019s geometric shape orientation in space and gravitational field. He did not just use the established methods but invented his own to accurately measure these factors./nGeorge Everest retired in 1843 and was succeeded by Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh. Eight years later, in 1851, Radhanath was promoted to the position of Chief Computer and transferred to Calcutta. Here, he was also a superintendent for the Meteorological Department./nAt the order of Colonel Waugh, Radhanath started measuring the height of mountains. The brilliant mathematician, who had perhaps never seen Mount Everest, discovered in 1852 that Kangchenjunga, which was considered to be the tallest in the world, wasn\u2019t really so. Compiling data about Mount Everest from six observations, he eventually came to the conclusion that it was the tallest in the world./nIt was during the computations of the northeastern observations that Radhanath had calculated the height of Peak XV at exactly 29,000\u00a0ft (8839 m), but Waugh added an arbitrary two feet because he was afraid that the Sikdar\u2019s figure would be considered a rounded number rather than an accurate one. He officially announced this finding in March 1856, and this remained the height of Mount Everest till an Indian survey re-calculated it to be 29,029\u00a0ft or 8848 m in 1955./nTechnological advancements, data from the thousands of climbers, and the discovery of different routes to the summit all have led to a more accurate calculation of the height of Mount Everest\u2014a peak that grows at the rate of 4\u00a0mm every year and whose summit is slowly moving northeastwards each passing year./nIt appears that while Everest and Waugh both extolled him for his exceptional mathematical abilities, his relations with the colonial administration were far from cordial. Two specific instances are on record./nIn 1851 a Survey Manual (eds. Capt. H. L. Thullier and Capt. F. Smyth) was published by the Survey Department. The preface to the Manual mentions that the more technical and mathematical chapters of the Manual were written by Babu Radhanath Sikdar. The Manual proved to be immensely useful to surveyors.  However, the third edition, published in 1875 (i.e., after Sikdar's death) did not contain that preface, so that Sikdar's memorable contribution was de-recognized. The incident was condemned by a section of British surveyors. The paper Friend of India in 1876 called it 'robbery of the dead'.[4]/nIt is also on record that Sikdar was fined a sum of 200 rupees in 1843 for having vehemently protested against the unlawful exploitation of survey department workers by the Magistrate Vansittart. The incident was reported in detail in The Bengal Spectator edited by Ramgopal Ghosh.[4]/nIn 1854, Sikdar along with his Derozian friend Peary Chand Mitra started the Bengali journal Masik Patrika, for education and empowerment of women.  He used to write in a simple and uncluttered style that was rather atypical for the age./nSikdar had retired from service in 1862, and was later appointed as teacher of mathematics at the General Assembly's Institution (now Scottish Church College).[5][6]/nHe died on 17 May 1870 at Chandernagore and was interred at the Sacred Heart Cemetery./nIn recognition of Sikdar's mathematical genius, German Philosophical Society's Bavaria branch of Natural Science made Radhanath Sikdar a Corresponding Member in 1864, two years after his retirement.[7]/nThe Department of Posts, Government of India, launched a postal stamp on 27 June 2004, commemorating the establishment of the Great Trigonometric Survey in Chennai, India on 10 April 1802.

He is also the co-inventor in Europe[1] of Gaussian elimination (1690)./nRolle was born in Ambert, Basse-Auvergne. Rolle, the son of a shopkeeper, received only an elementary education. He married early and as a young man struggled to support his family on the meager wages of a transcriber for notaries and attorney. In spite of his financial problems and minimal education, Rolle studied algebra and Diophantine analysis (a branch of number theory) on his own. He moved from Ambert to Paris in 1675./nRolle's fortune changed dramatically in 1682 when he published an elegant solution of a difficult, unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis. The public recognition of his achievement led to a patronage under minister Louvois, a job as an elementary mathematics teacher, and eventually to a short-termed administrative post in the Ministry of War. In 1685 he joined the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in a very low-level position for which he received no regular salary until 1699. Rolle was promoted to a salaried position in the academy, a pensionnaire g\u00e9ometre,. This was a distinguished post because of the 70\u00a0members of the academy, only 20 were paid.[2] He had then already been given a pension by Jean-Baptiste Colbert after he solved one of Jacques Ozanam's problems. He remained there until he died of apoplexy in 1719./nWhile Rolle's forte was always Diophantine analysis, his most important work was a book on the algebra of equations, called Trait\u00e9 d'alg\u00e8bre, published in 1690. In that book Rolle firmly established the notation for the nth root of a real number, and proved a polynomial version of the theorem that today bears his name. (Rolle's theorem was named by Giusto Bellavitis in 1846.)/nRolle was one of the most vocal early antagonists of calculus \u2013 ironically so, because Rolle's theorem is essential for basic proofs in calculus. He strove intently to demonstrate that it gave erroneous results and was based on unsound reasoning. He quarreled so vehemently on the subject that the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was forced to intervene on several occasions./nAmong his several achievements, Rolle helped advance the currently accepted size order for negative numbers. Descartes, for example, viewed  \u20132 as smaller than  \u20135. Rolle preceded most of his contemporaries by adopting the current convention in 1691./nRolle died in Paris. No contemporary portrait of him is known./nRolle was an early critic of infinitesimal calculus, arguing that it was inaccurate, based upon unsound reasoning, and was a collection of ingenious fallacies,[3] but later changed his opinion.[3]/nIn 1690, Rolle published Trait\u00e9 d'Algebre. It contains the first published description in Europe of the Gaussian elimination algorithm, which Rolle called the method of substitution [4] Some examples of the method had previously appeared in algebra books, and Isaac Newton had previously described the method in his lecture notes, but Newton's lesson was not published until 1707. Rolle's statement of the method seems not to have been noticed insofar as the lesson for Gaussian elimination that was taught in 18th- and 19th-century algebra textbooks owes more to Newton than to Rolle./nRolle is best known for Rolle's theorem in differential calculus. Rolle had used the result in 1690, and he proved it (by the standards of the time) in 1691. Given his animosity to infinitesimals it is fitting that the result was couched in terms of algebra rather than analysis.[2] Only in the 18th century was the theorem interpreted as a fundamental result in differential calculus. Indeed, it is needed to prove both the mean value theorem and the existence of Taylor series. As the importance of the theorem grew, so did the interest in identifying the origin, and it was finally named Rolle's theorem in the 19th century. Barrow-Green remarks that the theorem might well have been named for someone else had not a few copies of Rolle's 1691 publication survived./nIn a criticism of infinitesimal calculus that predated George Berkeley's, Rolle presented a series of papers at the French academy, alleging that the use of the methods of infinitesimal calculus leads to errors. Specifically, he presented an explicit algebraic curve, and alleged that some of its local minima are missed when one applies the methods of infinitesimal calculus. Pierre Varignon responded by pointing out that Rolle had misrepresented the curve, and that the alleged local minima are in fact singular points with a vertical tangent.[5]", "48500345": "Argelia Velez-Rodriguez (born 1936) is a Cuban-American mathematician and educator.

Science article Archived 2012-10-14 at the Wayback Machine./nCaginalp's PhD in Applied Mathematics at Cornell University (with thesis advisor Professor Michael Fisher) focused on surface free energy. Previous results by David Ruelle, Fisher, and Elliot Lieb in the 1960s had established that the free energy of a large system can be written as a product of the volume times a term \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{\\infty }}\n\n (free energy per unit volume) that is independent of the size of the system, plus smaller terms.

This was more difficult since the \n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{\\infty }}\n\n proofs relied on discarding terms that were proportional to the surface./nA key result of Caginalp's thesis [1,2,3] is the proof that the free energy, F, of a lattice system occupying a region \n\n\n\n\u03a9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Omega }\n\n with volume \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\Omega |}\n\n and surface area \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u2202\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\partial \\Omega |}\n\n can be written as/nF\n(\n\u03a9\n)\n=\n\n|\n\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\nf\n\n\u221e\n\n\n+\n\n|\n\n\u2202\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\nf\n\nx\n\n\n+\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F(\\Omega )=|\\Omega |f_{\\infty }+|\\partial \\Omega |f_{x}+...}/nwith \n\n\n\n\nf\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{x}}\n\n is the surface free energy (independent of \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\Omega |}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u2202\n\u03a9\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\partial \\Omega |}\n\n )./nShortly after his PhD, Caginalp joined the Mathematical Physics group of James Glimm (2002 National Medal of Science recipient) at The Rockefeller University. In addition to working on mathematical statistical mechanics, he also proved existence theorems on nonlinear hyperbolic differential equations describing fluid flow. These papers were published in the Annals of Physics and the Journal of Differential Equations./nIn 1980, Caginalp was the first recipient of the Zeev Nehari position established at Carnegie-Mellon University's Mathematical Sciences Department. At that time he began working on free boundary problems, e.g., problems in which there is an interface between two phases that must be determined as part of the solution to the problem. His original paper on this topic is the second most cited paper in a leading journal, Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis, during the subsequent quarter century./nHe had published over fifty papers on the phase field equations in mathematics, physics and materials journals. The focus of research in the mathematics and physics communities changed considerably during this period, and this perspective is widely used to derive macroscopic equations from a microscopic setting, as well as performing computations on dendritic growth and other phenomena./nIn the mathematics community during the previous century, the interface between two phases was generally studied via the Stefan model, in which temperature played a dual role, as the sign of the temperature determined the phase, so the interface is defined as the set of points at which the temperature is zero. Physically, however, the temperature at the interface was known to be proportional to the curvature, thereby preventing the temperature from fulfilling its dual role of the Stefan model. This suggested that an additional variable would be needed for a complete description of the interface. In the physics literature, the idea of an \"order parameter\" and mean field theory had been used by Landau in the 1940s to describe the region near the critical point (i.e., the region in which the liquid and solid phases become indistinguishable). However, the calculation of exact exponents in statistical mechanics showed that mean field theory was not reliable./nThere was speculation in the physics community that such a theory could be used to describe an ordinary phase transition. However, the fact that the order parameter could not produce the correct exponents in critical phenomena for which it was invented led to skepticism that it could produce results for normal phase transitions./nThe justification for an order parameter or mean field approach had been that the correlation length between atoms approaches infinity near the critical point. For an ordinary phase transition, the correlation length is typically just a few atomic lengths. Furthermore, in critical phenomena one is often trying to calculate the critical exponents, which should be independent of the details of the system (often called \"universality\"). In a typical interface problem, one is trying to calculate the interface position essentially exactly, so that one cannot \"hide behind universality\"./nIn 1980 there seemed to be ample reason to be skeptical of the idea that an order parameter could be used to describe a moving interface between two phases of a material. Beyond the physical justifications, there remained issues related to the dynamics of an interface and the mathematics of the equations. For example, if one uses an order parameter, \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n, together with the temperature variable, T, in a system of parabolic equations, will an initial transition layer in \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n, describing the interface remain as such? One expects that will vary from -1 to +1 as one moves from the solid to the liquid and that the transition will be made on a spatial scale of \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n, the physical thickness of the interface. The interface in the phase field system is then described by the level set of points on which \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n vanishes./nThe simplest model [4] can be written as a pair \n\n\n\n(\n\u03d5\n,\nT\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (\\phi ,T)}\n\n that satisfies the equations/nC\n\nP\n\n\n\nT\n\nt\n\n\n+\n\n\nl\n2\n\n\n\u03d5\n=\nK\n\u0394\nT\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b5\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b5\n\n2\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03d5\n+\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n(\n\u03d5\n\u2212\n\n\u03d5\n\n3\n\n\n)\n+\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n[\ns\n\n]\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n3\n\u03c3\n\n\n\n(\nT\n\u2212\n\nT\n\nE\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{array}{lcl}C_{P}T_{t}+{\\frac {l}{2}}\\phi =K\\Delta T\\\\\\alpha \\varepsilon ^{2}\\phi _{t}=\\varepsilon ^{2}\\Delta \\phi +{\\frac {1}{2}}(\\phi -\\phi ^{3})+{\\frac {\\varepsilon [s]_{E}}{3\\sigma }}(T-T_{E})\\end{array}}}/nwhere \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nP\n\n\n,\nl\n,\n\u03b1\n,\n\u03c3\n,\n[\ns\n\n]\n\nE\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{P},l,\\alpha ,\\sigma ,[s]_{E}}\n\n are physically measurable constants, and \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n is the interface thickness./nWith the interface described as the level set of points where the phase variable vanishes, the model allows the interface to be identified without tracking, and is valid even if there are self-intersections./nUsing the phase field idea to model solidification so that the physical parameters could be identified was originally undertaken in [4]./nA number of papers in collaboration with Weiqing Xie* and James Jones [5,6] have extended the modeling to alloy solid-liquid interfaces./nInitiated during the 1980s, these include the following./nThe earliest qualitative computations were done in collaboration with J.T. Lin in 1987./nAs phase field models became a useful tool in materials science, the need for even better convergence (from the phase field to the sharp interface problems) became apparent. This led to the development of phase field models of second order, meaning that as the interface thickness, \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n, becomes small, the difference in the interface of the phase field model and the interface of the related sharp interface model become second order in interface thickness, i.e., \n\n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon ^{2}}\n\n. In collaboration with Dr. Christof Eck, Dr. Emre Esenturk* and Profs. Xinfu Chen and Caginalp developed a new phase field model and proved that it was indeed second order [10, 11,12]. Numerical computations confirmed these results./nThe philosophical perspective of the renormalization group (RG) initiated by Ken Wilson in the 1970s is that in a system with large degrees of freedom, one should be able to repeatedly average and adjust, or renormalize, at each step without changing the essential feature that one is trying to compute. In the 1990s Nigel Goldenfeld and collaborators began to investigate the possibility of using this idea for the Barenblatt equation. Caginalp further developed these ideas so that one can calculate the decay (in space and time) of solutions to a heat equation with nonlinearity [13] that satisfies a dimensional condition. The methods were also applied to interface problems and systems of parabolic differential equations with Huseyin Merdan*./nCaginalp has been a leader in the newly developing field of Quantitative Behavioral Finance. The work has three main facets: (1) statistical time series modeling, (2) mathematical modeling using differential equations, and (3) laboratory experiments; comparison with models and world markets. His research is influenced by decades of experience as an individual investor and trader./nThe efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) has been the dominant theory for financial markets for the past half century. It stipulates that asset prices are essentially random fluctuations about their fundamental value. As empirical evidence, its proponents cite market data that appears to be \"white noise\". Behavioral finance has challenged this perspective, citing large market upheavals such as the high-tech bubble and bust of 1998-2003, etc. The difficulty in establishing the key ideas of behavioral finance and economics has been the presence of \"noise\" in the market. Caginalp and others have made substantial progress toward this surmounting this key difficulty. An early study by Caginalp and Constantine in 1995 showed that using the ratio of two clone closed-end funds, one can remove the noise associated with valuation. They showed that today's price is not likely to be yesterday's price (as indicated by EMH), or a pure continuation of the change during the previous time interval, but is halfway between those prices./nSubsequent work with Ahmet Duran* [14] examined the data involving large deviations between the price and net asset value of closed end funds, finding strong evidence that there is a subsequent movement in the opposite direction (suggesting overreaction). More surprisingly, there is a precursor to the deviation, which is usually a result of large changes in price in the absence of significant changes in value./nDr. Vladimira Ilieva and Mark DeSantis* focused on large scale data studies that effectively subtracted out the changes due to the net asset value of closed end funds [15]. Thus one could establish significant coefficients for price trend. The work with DeSantis was particularly noteworthy in two respects: (a) by standardizing the data, it became possible to compare the impact of price trend versus changes in money supply, for example; (b) the impact of the price trend was shown to be nonlinear, so that a small uptrend has a positive impact on prices (demonstrating underreaction), while a large uptrend has a negative influence. The measure of large or small is based upon the frequency of occurrence (measure in standard deviations). Using exchange traded funds (ETFs), they also showed (together with Akin Sayrak) that the concept of resistance\u2014whereby a stock has retreats as it nears a yearly high\u2014has strong statistical support [16]./nThe research shows the importance of two key ideas: (i) By compensating for much of the change in valuation, one can reduce the noise that obscures many behavioral and other influence on price dynamics; (ii) By examining nonlinearity (e.g., in the price trend effect) one can uncover influences that would be statistically insignificant upon examining only linear terms./nThe asset flow differential approach involves understanding asset market dynamics./n(I) Unlike the EMH, the model developed by Caginalp and collaborators since 1990 involves ingredients that were marginalized by the classical efficient market hypothesis: while price change depends on supply and demand for the asset (e.g., stock) the latter can depend on a variety of motivations and strategies, such as the recent price trend. Unlike the classical theories, there is no assumption of infinite arbitrage, which says that any small deviation from the true value (that is universally accepted since all participants have the same information) is quickly exploited by an (essentially) infinite capital managed by \"informed\" investors. Among the consequences of this theory is that equilibrium is not a unique price, but depends on the price history and strategies of the traders./nClassical models of price dynamics are all built on the idea that there is infinite arbitrage capital. The Caginalp asset flow model introduced an important new concept of liquidity, L, or excess cash that is defined to be the total cash in the system divided by the total number of shares./n(II) In subsequent years, these asset flow equations were generalized to include distinct groups with differing assessments of value, and distinct strategies and resources. For example, one group may be focused on trend (momentum) while another emphasizes value, and attempts to buy the stock when it is undervalued./n(III) In collaboration with Duran these equations were studied in terms of optimization of parameters, rendering them a useful tool for practical implementation./n(IV) More recently, David Swigon, DeSantis and Caginalp studied the stability of the asset flow equations and showed that instabilities, for example, flash crashes could occur as a result of traders utilizing momentum strategies together with shorter time scales [17, 18]./nIn recent years, there has been related work that is sometimes called \"evolutionary finance\"./nIn the 1980s asset market experiments pioneered by Vernon Smith (2002 Economics Nobel Laureate) and collaborators provided a new tool to study microeconomics and finance. In particular these posed a challenge to classical economics by showing that participants when participants traded (with real money) an asset with a well defined value the price would soar well above the fundamental value that is defined by the experimenters. Repetition of this experiment under various conditions showed the robustness of the phenomenon. By designing new experiments, Profs. Caginalp, Smith and David Porter largely resolved this paradox through the framework of the asset flow equations. In particular, the bubble size (and more generally, the asset price) was highly correlated by the excess cash in the system, and momentum was also shown to be a factor [19]. In classical economics there would be just one quantity, namely the share price that has units of dollars per share. The experiments showed that this is distinct from the fundamental value per share. The liquidity, L, introduced by Caginalp and collaborators, is a third quantity that also has these units [20]. The temporal evolution of prices involves a complex relationship among these three variables, together with quantities reflecting the motivations of the traders that may involve price trend and other factors. Other studies have shown quantitatively that motivations in the experimental traders are similar to those in world markets./n\u2217\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ast }\n\n - PhD student of Caginalp", "71143046": "William Stephen Childress is an American applied mathematician, author and professor emeritus at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

According to an autobiography which he dictated to German authorities, he moved to Moscow in 1926, studying and eventually (in 1932) graduating from the German department of the faculty for literary translation at the Institute for New Languages. He described himself as having been fascinated with languages from an early age, and, in addition to his native Ukrainian and Russian, spoke German and some English.[1]/nStarting in 1933, Sadowski began work as a translator, working to translate the works of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin into Russian. The process was arduous, taking six years rather than the one year initially expected.[1] He finished his work in 1939, and additionally translated other works from German into Russian, including The Youth of King Henry IV (German: Die Jugend des K\u00f6nigs Henri Quatre; Russian: \u042e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043d\u0440\u0438\u0445\u0430 IV, romanized:\u00a0Yunost korolya Genrikha IV) by Heinrich Mann.

Soviet historiography claimed Sadowski died at the Battle of Smolensk in 1942.[2] His \"death\" was followed by high praise from Soviet and East German writers following the World War II, among them Wilhelm Levick, who wrote in 1970, \"The last time he was seen was in the Smolensk Oblast, when at night, half-dressed, he ran out of a burning house during a sudden attack by the Nazis. The attack was repulsed ... In his field bag, they found a soldier's certificate, an unfinished letter to his wife, and the same invariable volume of H\u00f6lderlin.\"[3] Johannes R.

Instead, he defected to German forces on January 25, 1942. Following his defection, Sadowski was transferred to Oryol, where he began working for the Rech newspaper under the leadership of Mikhail Oktan.[5] Sadowski was one of seven employees of Rech, along with Oktan, Vladimir Samarin, and individuals named Azbukin, Bogomolov, Petrov, and Sofronova. Sadowski's work, translation of German war reports, was among the most significant of content in Rech, making up over half of the content, though he remained anonymous in his translation.[2]/nSadowski was described by German reports as \"politically and culturally very savvy, an intelligent young Russian humanist,\" but also as \"lazy,\" a characterisation that would later be restated by Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 organisations in the United States. Sadowski was never interned in a prisoner-of-war camp, instead going directly from surrendering to working at Rech on February 19, 1942.[2]/nIn July 1943, Oryol was recaptured by Soviet forces. Sadowski, along with the rest of Rech, evacuated \u2013 first to Bryansk, then Babruysk in what is now eastern Belarus. In Babruysk, Sadowski was contacted by Alfred Rosenberg, who sought him out as part of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce occupied with collecting information about the Soviet Union. Sadowski first moved to Minsk, and then to Upper Silesia. In Upper Silesia, he was recruited for the Weltdienst press service, with his knowledge of communism and antisemitism being noted. At some point near the war's end, Sadowski evacuated to Frankfurt.[2]/nAfter the war, Sadowski remained in the American occupation zone in Germany, where he participated in chess tournaments in displaced persons camps.

In August 1949, he left Germany for the United States aboard the General Heinzelman, being described in documentation as a \"translator/teacher\". Following his emigration, he lived in Washington, D.C.. He was issued a Social Security number in 1952.[2]/nIn the United States, Sadowski became a mathematician, joining the American Mathematical Society in 1964 and moving to Florida in the early 1960s.

He was a member of a community of Scythian monks concentrated in Tomis (present-day Constan\u021ba, Romania), the major city of Scythia Minor. Dionysius is best known as the inventor of Anno Domini (AD) dating, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the (Christianised) Julian calendar. Almost all churches adopted his computus for the dates of Easter./nFrom around the year 500 until his death, Dionysius lived in Rome. He translated 401 Church canons from Greek into Latin, including the Apostolic Canons and the decrees of the First Council of Nicaea, First Council of Constantinople, Council of Chalcedon, and Council of Sardica, and a collection of the decretals of the popes from Siricius to Anastasius II. These Collectiones canonum Dionysianae had great authority in the West, and they continue to guide church administrations. Dionysius also wrote a treatise on elementary mathematics./nThe author of a continuation of Dionysius's Computus, writing in 616, described Dionysius as a \"most learned abbot of the city of Rome\", and the Venerable Bede accorded him the honorific abbas (which could be applied to any monk, especially a senior and respected monk, and does not necessarily imply that Dionysius ever headed a monastery; indeed, Dionysius's friend Cassiodorus stated in Institutiones that he was still a monk late in life)./nAccording to his friend and fellow-student, Cassiodorus, Dionysius, although by birth a \"Scythian\", was in character a true Roman, most learned in both tongues (by which he meant Greek and Latin).[3] He was also a thorough catholic Christian and an accomplished Scripturist.[4] The use of such an ambiguous, dated term as \"Scythian\" raises the suspicion that his contemporaries had difficulties classifying him, either from lack of knowledge about him personally or about his native land, Scythia Minor.[5]:\u200a127\u200a By the 6th century, the term \"Scythian\" could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply someone from the north-east of the Greco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean. The term had a widely encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes.[5]:\u200a127\u200a Even for the \"Scythian monk\" Joannes Maxentius, friend and companion of Dionysius, the two monks are \"Scythian\" by virtue of their geographical origin relative to Rome, just as Faustus of Riez is a \"Gaul\".[5]:\u200a127/nThe dubious assertion, based on a single Syriac source, that the Eastern-Roman rebel general Vitalian, to whom Dionysius seems to have been related, was of Gothic extraction was the basis for labelling, without any further evidence, all of the Scythian monks, Dionysius included, as \"Goths\".[5]:\u200a128\u200a In Greek and Latin sources, Vitalian is sometimes labelled with the same ambiguous term \"Scytha\"; he is presented as commanding \"Hunnic\", \"Gothic\", \"Scythian\", \"Bessian\" soldiers, but this information says more about the general's military endeavours, and bears little relevance to clarifying his origins. Furthermore, since none of the Scythian monks expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritual, with the Arian Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Dionysius is questionable.[5]:\u200a130\u200a Vitalian seems to have been of local Latinised Thracian stock, born in Scythia Minor or in Moesia; his father bore a Latin name, Patriciolus, while two of his sons had Thracian names and one a Gothic name.[5]:\u200a129\u200a By the time of the flourishing of the Scythian monks, the provinces from the Lower Danube, long since Latinised, were already a centre for the production of Latin-speaking theologians. Most likely Dionysius was also of local Thraco-Roman origin (romanized Geto\u2013Dacian), like Vitalian's family to whom he was related, and the rest of the Scythian monks and other Thraco-Roman personalities of the era (Justin I, Justinian, Flavius Aetius, etc.).[5]:\u200a130\u2013131/nDionysius translated standard works from Greek into Latin, principally the \"Life of St. Pachomius\", the \"Instruction of St. Proclus of Constantinople\" for the Armenians, the \"De opificio hominis\" of St. Gregory of Nyssa, and the history of the discovery of the head of St. John the Baptist (written by Archimandrite Markellos). The translation of St. Cyril of Alexandria's synodical letter against Nestorius, and some other works long attributed to Dionysius are now acknowledged to be earlier and are assigned to Marius Mercator./nOf great importance were the contributions of Dionysius to the tradition of canon law. His several collections embrace:/nDionysius is best known as the inventor of Anno Domini dating, which is used to number the years of both the Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar. He used it to identify the several Easters in his Easter table, but did not use it to date any historical event. When he devised his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year; he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of Probus Junior\", which he also stated was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\". How he arrived at that number is unknown, but there is evidence of the system he applied. He invented a new system of numbering years to replace the Diocletian years that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.[6] It has been suggested that he arranged the numbers so that leap years would be exactly divisible by four, and that his new table would begin one \"Victorian cycle\" (see below), i.e. 532 years, after his new epoch./nEvidence exists that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world.  At the time, some believed that the Second Coming and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The current Anno Mundi calendar commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the Greek Septuagint.  It was believed that, based on the Anno Mundi calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.[7][8] Anno Mundi 6000 (c. 500) was thus equated with the second coming of Christ and the end of the world.[9]/nIn 525, Dionysius prepared a table of 95 future dates of Easter (532\u2013626) and a set of rules (\"argumenta\") explaining their calculation (computus).[10] This followed a request by Pope John I, possibly influenced by the fact that the then current Victorian table gave an Easter date for 526 (19 April) which was the 22nd day of the moon. In a previous embarrassment, this table had given Saturday, 24 April as the date of the Greek Easter in 482.[11] Note well that only the first nine arguments are by Dionysius \u2013 arguments 10 to 16 as well as the second paragraphs of 3 and 4 and the third paragraph of 9 are later interpolations.[12] Arguments 11 and 12 imply that these were interpolated in the year 675, shortly before Bede. Dionysius also introduced his table and arguments via a letter to a bishop Petronius (also written in 525) and added another explanatory letter (written in 526). These works in volume 67 of the 217-volume Patrologia Latina also include a letter from Bishop Proterius of Alexandria to Pope Leo (written before 457). Though not named by Dionysius, this collection was recently called his Liber de Paschate (Book on Easter) by Audette./nDionysius ignored the existing table used by the Patriarchate of Rome, which was prepared in 457 by Victorius of Aquitaine, complaining that it did not obey Alexandrian principles, without actually acknowledging their existence. To be sure that his own table was correct, he simply extended a table prepared in Alexandria that had circulated in the west in Latin, but was never used in the west to determine the date of Easter (however, a variant of it was used in the Byzantine Empire, in Greek). The Latin table was prepared by a subordinate of Bishop Cyril of Alexandria shortly before Cyril's death in 444. It covered a period of 95 years or five decennovenal (19-year) cycles with years dated in the Diocletian Era, whose first year was 285 (the modern historical year in progress at Easter). Diocletian years were advantageous because their division by 19 yielded a remainder equal to the year of the decennovenal cycle (1\u201319)./nUltimately, Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table, meanwhile extended from the years 532\u2013626 to the years 532\u2013721,[13] must have been adopted at Rome and also have arrived in Britain and Ireland,[14] where, however in both cases certainly not before the second quarter of the seventh century,[15] Victorius of Aquitaine's lunar limits 16\u201322 were gradually replaced with Dionysius\u2019 lunar limits 15\u201321; only then the discord between the churches of Rome and Alexandria regarding the correct date for the celebration of Easter came to an end, and only from then both these authoritative churches used identical tables and hence observed Easter on the same day./nThe Greek tables had begun with the new moon which fell (on 29 August) the day before the starting date of their chronology, which was 30 August 284.   The epact thus calculated was carried over unchanged by Dionysius into his tables together with a number from one to seven, calculated annually, called by the Greeks the \"day of the [planetary] gods\" and in the west the \"concurrent\". This number the Greeks used for calculating the day of the week for any date in the Alexandrian civil calendar (a late form of the Egyptian solar calendar which included a final leap day every four years), which involved no more than simple arithmetic because the twelve months ran consecutively and all had thirty days. These two variables were understood neither by Dionysius nor by the other western computists, who were used to working with the age of the moon on 1 January and the Sunday letters to determine the Sundays. This is why the tables took so long to gain acceptance, but the values were eventually assimilated into the theory, the concurrent as the weekday of 24 March and the epact as the age of the moon on 22 March.[16]/nDionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table owes its strong structure to his distant predecessor Anatolius, who invented the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, which is an application of the Metonic cycle in the Julian calendar.[17] Its lunar cycle is the nearby variant of Theophilus' 19-year lunar cycle proposed by Annianus and adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria in the first half of the fifth century.[18] The Metonic structure of this so-called classical Alexandrian 19-year lunar cycle contained in Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table is reflected by the structure of its 19-year periodic sequence of epacts.[19]/nThe epact, since it originally marked the new moon, was zero in all first decennovenal years. The Latin word nulla meaning no/none was used because no Roman numeral for zero existed. To determine the decennovenal year, the Dionysian year plus one was divided by 19. If the result was zero (to be replaced by 19), it was represented by the Latin word nvlla,[20] also meaning nothing. Both \"zeros\" continued to be used by (among others) Bede, by whose extension of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Easter table to a great Easter cycle all future Julian calendar dates of Easter Sunday were fixed unambiguously at last. However, in medieval Europe one had to wait as late as the second millennium to see the number zero itself come into use, although it had come into being around the year 600 in India./nDionysius copied the last decennovenal cycle of the Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with numbered Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle \u00d7 cycle of leap years \u00d7 days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years.[21]/nMost of the British Church accepted the Dionysian tables after the Synod of Whitby in 664, which agreed that the old British method (the insular latercus) should be dropped in favour of the Roman one. Quite a few individual churches and monasteries refused to accept them, the last holdout finally accepting them during the early 10th century. After the first Frankish adaptation of Bede's The Reckoning of Time was published (by 771),[22] the Church of the Franks (France) accepted them during the late 8th century under the tutelage of Alcuin, after he arrived from Britain./nEver since the 2nd century, some bishoprics in the eastern Roman Empire had counted years from the birth of Christ, but there was no agreement on the correct epoch \u2013 Clement of Alexandria (c.\u2009190) and Eusebius of Caesarea (c.\u2009320) wrote about these attempts. Because Dionysius did not place the Incarnation in an explicit year, competent scholars have deduced both AD\u00a01 and 1\u00a0BC. The reason for his omission may be simply that the starting date was computationally convenient, or that he did not believe that the date of the Nativity could be pinpointed exactly. Ambiguities arise from the fact that eras may be either elapsed or current years, there are discrepancies in the lists of consuls, and there is disagreement as to whether the Incarnation should be reckoned from the Annunciation or the Nativity. Most scholars have selected 1\u00a0BC (historians do not use a year zero), arguing that because the anniversary of the Incarnation was 25 March, which was near Easter, a year that was 525 years \"since the Incarnation\" implied that 525 whole years were completed near that Easter. Consequently, one year since the Incarnation would have meant 25 March AD 1, meaning that Dionysius placed the Incarnation on 25 March 1\u00a0BC. Because the birth of Jesus was nine calendar months later, Dionysius implied, but never stated, that Jesus was born 25 December 1\u00a0BC. Only one scholar, Georges Declerq (Declerq, 2002), thinks that Dionysius placed the Incarnation and Nativity in AD\u00a01, basing his conclusion on the structure of Dionysius's Easter tables. In either case, Dionysius ignored his predecessors, who usually placed the Nativity in the year we now label 2\u00a0BC. In his 1605 thesis, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga was the first to suggest that Christ was actually born around 4 BC,[23] deriving this from the chronology of Herod the Great, his son Philip the Tetrarch, and the daughter of Augustus, Julia.[24] Having read Suslyga's work,[25] Kepler noted that Christ was born during the reign of King Herod the Great (2:1\u201318), whose death he placed in 4\u00a0BC. Kepler chose this year because Josephus stated that a lunar eclipse occurred shortly before Herod's death.[26] John Pratt of the International Planetarium Society proposed the 29 December 1 BC eclipse as another eclipse.[27] According to Josephus, Herod died in the year 4 or 3\u00a0BC.[27][28]/nAlthough Dionysius stated that the First Council of Nicaea in 325 sanctioned his method of dating Easter, that is only generally true. There was no formal canon \u2013 the Council echoed Canon 1 of the first Council of Arles (314) which had decreed that the Christian Passover be celebrated uno die et uno tempore per omnem orbem (on one day and at one time through all the world) \u2013 but added that all \"celebrate Pascha at the same time as\" the churches of Alexandria and Rome./nA synodal letter to the church of Alexandria states:/nAll our eastern brothers who up till now have not been in agreement with the Romans or you or with all those who from the beginning have done as you do, will henceforth celebrate Pascha at the same time as you./nAnd the letter of the Emperor Constantine to bishops who had not attended the council states:/nIt was judged good and proper, all questions and contradictions being left aside, that the eastern brothers follow the example of the Romans and Alexandrians and all the others so that everyone should let their prayers rise to heaven on one single day of holy Pascha./nDionysius' method had actually been used by the Church of Alexandria (but not by the Church of Rome) at least as early as 311, and probably began during the first decade of the 4th century, its dates naturally being given in the Alexandrian calendar.[29] Thus Dionysius did not develop a new method of dating Easter. The most that he may have done was convert its arguments from the Alexandrian calendar into the Julian calendar. The resulting Julian date for Easter was the Sunday following the first Luna XIV (the 14th day of the moon) that occurred on or after the XII Kalendas Aprilis (21 March) (12 days before the first of April, inclusive). The 14th day of the moon, Nisan 14, was the date that paschal lambs were slain (in late afternoon) until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 prevented their continuing sacrifice, as well as the day when all leavened bread crumbs had to be collected and burned, hence Nisan 14 was the day of preparation for Passover (Lev 23:5). Alexandria may have chosen it because it was the day that Christ was crucified according to the Gospel of John (18:28, 19:14), in direct contradiction to the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 26:17, Mark 14:12, and Luke 22:7), who state that he was crucified after he ate the Seder, his Last Supper. Then and now, the Seder was eaten after sundown at the beginning of Nisan 15. Because Dionysius's method of computing Easter used dates in the Julian calendar, it is also called the Julian Easter. This Easter is still used by all Orthodox churches, even those which have regularized the rest of their calendars with the West. The Gregorian Easter still uses the same definition, but relative to its own solar and lunar dates.", "34049712": "Otto Albin Frostman (3 January 1907 \u2013 29 December 1977) was a Swedish mathematician, known for his work in potential theory and complex analysis./nFrostman earned his Ph.D. in 1935 at Lund University under the Hungarian-born mathematician Marcel Riesz, the younger brother of Frigyes Riesz.

This committee performed admittedly the most productive work among the European committees. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz and S\u00e1ndor Mikola, as they found the changes necessary, had worked out the workable methods and curriculum of mathematics teaching. They declared that certain elements that are obtained indirectly belong to mathematics as well and they have to be confirmed in the student. The learning of mathematics has to be completed by immediate experience and lots of measuring. They also emphasized the need for mental calculation and the practice of estimating. According to their theory the students have to be encouraged to tend to know reality. They considered inevitable for the teachers to intend to form clear ideas. Finally, their brave initiatives were successful: in November 1909 R\u00e1tz and Mikola were officially permitted to teach mathematics in the Lutheran Gymnasium as they found it desirable in accordance with the reform endeavours.[9]/nFrom the beginning he was an active participant in a worldwide effort of science and mathematics teaching education reform; from 1909 he gets official full liberty in improving educational methods in his own high school; he becomes Officier d'Acad\u00e9mie award at a 1910 Paris congress. The objectives of this reform were the recognition of cultural and humane values of science education, besides tangible pragmatic values. According to the objectives, mathematics has important involuntarily acquirable subconscious elements that need to be enhanced in students. The teachers strived to deliver clearly articulated concepts at the voluntary, conscious level, but more importantly, learning of mathematics has to be tightly woven together with direct experience and practice, emphasizing mental calculations and practicing estimations, allowing students to acquire a subconscious knowledge of reality from experience with quantitative relations./nEugene Wigner was asked in the late 1970s \"Do you remember R\u00e1tz?\", to which he answered: \"There he is!\", and pointed to a picture of R\u00e1tz on his office wall./nDuring the years 1912\u20131920 Eugene Wigner was taught by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz and in his acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize (in 1963), Dr. Eugene Wigner said:[9]/n... there were many superb teachers at the Lutheran gymnasium.

He was one of the founders of the Kharkov Mathematical Society. This society is one of the early mathematics societies in Russia and was founded in 1879.[1][2]/nAndreev was born in Moscow in a merchant family specialized in fur trading. When he was young, their business went into decline, and the family had to endure severe hardship. During that time, he also lost one eye in an accident that had delayed his studies \u2013 he entered gymnasium only in 1860, at the age of 12. However, he rapidly progressed, especially in mathematics, and by the age of 14 started giving private lessons to earn money for his subsistence. In 1867, Andreev enrolled to the Mathematics Department of the Moscow University. As the fourth year he wrote an essay \"On the tables of mortality\" which was awarded gold medal by the faculty and published in the Scientific Memoirs of the Moscow University, thereby becoming his first scientific work. Andreev graduated in 1871 but remained at the faculty and within two years obtained a Master Diploma.[1][2]/nAround that time, by recommendation of one of his teachers, Andreev was invited for PhD studies to the University of Kharkiv. He accepted and from January 1874 began teaching university courses there. In February 1875, he defended his PhD \"On a geometric formation of planar curves\" and was promoted to a full-time lecturer. At the end of 1876, Andreev was sent for practice to Europe for one and half years. He spent that time mostly in Berlin and Paris, where he prepared his habilitation work \"On the geometric correspondences, as applied to the problem of constructing curves\". He defended that work in Moscow in February 1879 and was soon appointed as full professor of the Kharkiv University, as well as of Kharkiv Technology Institute.[1][2]/nIn 1884, he was elected as a correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and in the summer of that year reported his work \"On Poncelet polygons\" at a conference in La Rochelle, France. In 1898 Andreev returned to Moscow, to assume a post of professor at the Department of Mathematics of Moscow University. Simultaneously, he became director of Alexander School of Business (at Basman), which post he held until 1907, and spent much time working for secondary education system. At Moscow University, Andreev became the first dean elect of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty (from 1905 to 1911), where he introduced the standard lecture cycle system.  In 1911, he had to resign as a dean and stop lecturing due to a throat tumor, which he had operated in 1913 in Europe. He then resumed teaching at Moscow University until 1917, when other health problems urged him to abandon most activities and moved to the health resorts of Crimea. He died near Sevastopol in October 1921.[1][2]", "8457942": "John Dee (13 July 1527 \u2013 1608 or 1609) was an English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, teacher, occultist, and alchemist.[4] He was the court astronomer for, and advisor to, Elizabeth I, and spent much of his time on alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy. As an antiquarian, he had one of the largest libraries in England at the time. As a political advisor, he advocated the foundation of English colonies in the New World to form a \"British Empire\", a term he is credited with coining.[5]/nDee eventually left Elizabeth's service and went on a quest for additional knowledge in the deeper realms of the occult and supernatural. He aligned himself with several individuals who may have been charlatans, travelled through Europe and was accused of spying for the English crown. Upon his return to England, he found his home and library vandalised. He eventually returned to the Queen's service, but was turned away when she was succeeded by James I. He died in poverty in London and his gravesite is unknown./nDee was born in Tower Ward, London, to Rowland Dee, of Welsh descent, and Johanna, daughter of William Wild.[4][6][7][8][9][10] His surname \"Dee\" reflects the Welsh du (black). His grandfather was Bedo Ddu of Nant-y-groes, Pilleth, Radnorshire; John retained his connection with the locality. His father Roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to Henry VIII. John Dee claimed descent from Rhodri the Great, 9th century ruler of Gwynedd, and constructed a pedigree accordingly. His family had arrived in London with Henry Tudor's coronation as Henry VII.[7]/nDee attended Chelmsford Chantry School (now King Edward VI Grammar School) from 1535 to 1542.[11] He entered St John's College, Cambridge in November 1542, aged 15, graduating BA in 1545 or early 1546.[12][13] His abilities recognised, he became an original fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge on its foundation by Henry VIII in 1546.[14] At Trinity, the clever stage effects he produced for a production of Aristophanes' Peace earned him lasting repute as a magician. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in Europe, studying at Louvain (1548) and Brussels and lecturing in Paris on Euclid. He studied under Gemma Frisius and became friends with the cartographers Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius. Dee also met, worked and learnt from other continental mathematicians, such as Federico Commandino in Italy.[15] He returned to England with a major collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met Gerolamo Cardano in London, with whom he investigated a purported perpetual motion machine and a gem supposed to have magical properties.[16]/nRector at Upton-upon-Severn from 1553, Dee was offered a readership in mathematics at Oxford University in 1554, which he declined, citing as offensive English universities' emphasis on rhetoric and grammar (which, together with logic, formed the academic trivium) over philosophy and science (the more advanced quadrivium, composed of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy). He was busy with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court.[17] In 1555, Dee joined the Worshipful Company of Mercers, as his father had, through its system of patrimony.[18]/nIn that same year Dee was arrested and charged with the crime of \"calculating\", because he had cast horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth. The charges were raised to treason against Mary.[17][19] Dee appeared in the Star Chamber and exonerated himself, but was turned over to the Catholic bishop Edmund Bonner for religious examination. His strong, lifelong penchant for secrecy may have worsened matters. The episode was the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that dogged Dee throughout his life. Clearing his name yet again, he soon became a close associate of Bonner.[17]/nDee presented Queen Mary in 1556 with a visionary plan for preserving old books, manuscripts and records and founding a national library, but it was not taken up.[17] Instead, he expanded his personal library in Mortlake, acquiring books and manuscripts in England and on the Continent. Dee's library, a centre of learning outside the universities, became the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.[20]/nWhen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne in 1558, Dee became her astrological and scientific advisor. He chose her coronation date and even became a Protestant.[10][21][22] From the 1550s to the 1570s, he served as an advisor to England's voyages of discovery, providing technical aid in navigation and political support to create a \"British Empire\", a term he was the first to use.[23] Dee wrote in October 1574 to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley seeking patronage. He claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the Welsh Marches and of valuable manuscripts kept at Wigmore Castle, knowing that the Lord Treasurer's ancestors came from the area.[24]/nIn 1564, Dee wrote the Hermetic work Monas Hieroglyphica (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\"), an exhaustive Cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. Having dedicated it to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in an effort to gain patronage, Dee attempted to present it to him at the time of his ascension to the throne of Hungary. The work was esteemed by many of Dee's contemporaries, but cannot be interpreted today in the absence of the secret oral tradition of that era.[25]/nHis 1570 \"Mathematical Preface\" to Henry Billingsley's English translation of Euclid's Elements argued for the importance of mathematics as an influence on the other arts and sciences.[26] Intended for an audience outside the universities, it proved to be Dee's most widely influential and frequently reprinted work.[27]/nIn 1577, Dee published General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation, a work setting out his vision of a maritime empire and asserting English territorial claims on the New World. Dee was acquainted with Humphrey Gilbert and close to Sir Philip Sidney and his circle.[23]/nBy the early 1580s, Dee was discontented with his progress in learning the secrets of nature and his diminishing influence and recognition in court circles. Failure of his ideas concerning a proposed calendar revision,[28] colonial establishment and ambivalent results for voyages of exploration in North America had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end. He subsequently began to turn energetically towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge. He sought to contact spirits through the use of a \"scryer\" or crystal-gazer, which he thought would act as an intermediary between himself and the angels.[29]/nDee's first attempts with several scryers were unsatisfactory, but in 1582 he met Edward Kelley (then calling himself Edward Talbot) who impressed him greatly with his abilities.[30] Dee took Kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits.[30] These \"spiritual conferences\" or \"actions\" were conducted with intense Christian piety, always after periods of purification, prayer and fasting.[30] Dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind. The character of Kelley is harder to assess: some conclude that he acted with cynicism, but delusion or self-deception cannot be ruled out.[31] Kelley's \"output\" is remarkable for its volume, intricacy and vividness. Dee records in his journals that angels dictated several books to him this way, through Kelley, some in a special angelic or Enochian language.[32][33]/nIn 1583, Dee met the impoverished yet popular Polish nobleman Albert \u0141aski, who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him back to Poland.[19] With some prompting by the \"angels\" (again through Kelley) and by dint of his worsening status at court, Dee decided to do so. He, Kelley and their families left in September 1583, but \u0141aski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country.[34] Dee and Kelley began a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee detailed in his diaries and almanacs.[32][33] They had audiences with Emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle and King Stephen B\u00e1thory of Poland, whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The Bathory meeting took place at the Niepo\u0142omice Castle (near Krak\u00f3w, then capital of Poland) and was later analysed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieli\u0144ski, Roman \u017belewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar \u0141ysiak).[citation needed] While Dee was generally seen as a man of deep knowledge, he was mistrusted for his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I, for whom some thought (and still do) that Dee was a spy. The Polish king, a devout Catholic and cautious of supernatural mediators, began their meeting(s) by affirming that prophetic revelations must match the teachings of Christ, the mission of the Holy Catholic Church, and the approval of the Pope./nIn 1587, at a spiritual conference in Bohemia, Kelley told Dee that the angel Uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions, including their wives. By this time, Kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and was more sought-after than Dee in this regard: it was a line of work that had prospects for serious and long-term financial gain, especially among the royal families of central Europe. Dee, however, was more interested in communicating with angels, who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics, optics, astrology, science and navigation. Perhaps Kelley in fact wished to end Dee's dependence on him as a diviner at their increasingly lengthy, frequent spiritual conferences.[34] The order for wife-sharing caused Dee anguish, but he apparently did not doubt it was genuine and they apparently shared wives. However, Dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards. He returned to England in 1589, while Kelley went on to be the alchemist to Emperor Rudolf II.[34][35] Nine months later, on 28 February 1588, a son was born to Dee's wife, whom Dee baptised Theodorus Trebonianus Dee and raised as his own./nDee returned to Mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalised, his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen.[20][34] Furthermore, he found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made England still less hospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy. He sought support from Elizabeth, who hoped he could persuade Kelley to return and ease England's economic burdens through alchemy.[b] She finally appointed Dee Warden of Christ's College, Manchester, in 1595.[36]/nThis former College of Priests had been re-established as a Protestant institution by Royal Charter in 1578.[31] However, he could not exert much control over its fellows, who despised or cheated him.[17] Early in his tenure, he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children, but took little interest in the case, although he allowed those involved to consult his still extensive library.[17]/nDee left Manchester in 1605 to return to London,[37] but remained Warden until his death.[38] By that time, Elizabeth was dead and James I gave him no support. Dee spent his final years in poverty at Mortlake, forced to sell off various possessions to support himself and his daughter, Katherine, who cared for him until his death in Mortlake late in 1608 or early in 1609 aged 81.[37] Both the parish registers and Dee's gravestone are missing.[17][39] In 2013 a memorial plaque to Dee was placed on the south wall of the present church.[40]/nDee was married three times and had eight children. He married his first wife, Katherine Constable in 1565. They had no children, and she died in 1574. He married his second wife, whose name is unknown, in 1575. She died in 1576, again with no children.[41]/nIn 1578, when he was 51, he married the 23-year-old Jane Fromond (1555\u20131604), who had her own connection with the Elizabethan court as a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth FitzGerald, Countess of Lincoln until she married Dee. They had 7 or 8 children, namely: Arthur Dee (1579\u20131651), Michael Dee (died 1594), Rowland Dee, Katherine Dee, Madinia Dee, Frances Dee, Margaret Dee and, possibly, Theodore Dee (1588\u20131601).[42]/nDee referred to Thomas Jones, who is the likely loose inspiration for Welsh folkloric outlaw Twm Si\u00f4n Cati, as his cousin; the pair corresponded, and Jones visited Dee several times.[43]/nFrom 1577 to 1601, Dee kept a sporadic diary (also referred to as his almanac), from which most of what we know of his life in that time has been gleaned.[18] In 1587, Kelley informed Dee of the angel's wish that they share wives. Theodore Dee, born nine months later, could have been fathered by Kelley, and not Dee.[18]/nJane died in Manchester of bubonic plague and was buried in the Manchester Cathedral burial grounds in March 1604.[44] Michael, born in Prague, died on his father's birthday in 1594. Theodore, born in T\u0159ebo\u0148, died in Manchester in 1601. His sons Arthur and Rowland survived him, as did his daughter Katherine, \"his companion to the end\".[42] No records exist for his youngest daughters Madinia (sometimes Madima), Frances and Margaret after 1604, so it is widely assumed they died in the epidemic that took their mother. (Dee had by this time ceased to keep a diary.)[17]/nWhile Arthur was a student at the Westminster School, Dee wrote to his headmaster echoing the normal worries of boarding-school parents.[citation needed] Arthur was an apprentice in much of his father's alchemical and scientific work and in fact often his diviner until Kelley appeared. He went on to become an alchemist and Hermetic author, whose works were published by Elias Ashmole.[17]/nThe antiquary John Aubrey[c] describes Dee as \"tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and a slit.... A very fair, clear sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man.\"[39]/nDee was an intense Christian, but his religiosity was influenced by Hermetic and Platonic-Pythagorean doctrines pervasive in the Renaissance.[45] He believed that numbers were the basis of all things and key to knowledge.[10] From Hermeticism he drew a belief that man had the potential for divine power that could be exercised through mathematics.[27] His goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients.[10]/nFrom 1570 Dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of England and establishment of colonies in the New World.[4] His manuscript Brytannicae reipublicae synopsis (1570) outlined the state of the Elizabethan Realm[46] and was concerned with trade, ethics and national strength.[4]/nHis 1576 General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate for the establishment of English colonies abroad.[47] In a symbolic frontispiece, Dee included a figure of Britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I to protect her nation by strengthening her navy.[48] Dee used Geoffrey's inclusion of Ireland in King Arthur's conquests to argue that Arthur had established a \"British empire\" abroad.[49] He argued that the establishment of new colonies would benefit England economically, with said colonies being protected by a strong navy.[50][51] Dee has been credited with coining the term British Empire,[52] but Humphrey Llwyd has also been credited with the first use in his Commentarioli Britannicae Descriptionis Fragmentum, published eight years earlier in 1568.[53]/nDee posited a formal claim to North America on the back of a map drawn in 1577\u20131580;[54] he noted that \"circa 1494 Mr. Robert Thorn his father, and Mr. Eliot of Bristow, discovered Newfound Land.\"[55] In his Title Royal of 1580, he invented a claim that Madog ab Owain Gwynedd had discovered America, intending thereby to boost England's claim to the New World over that of Spain's.[56] He also asserted that Brutus of Britain and King Arthur, as well as Madog, had conquered lands in the Americas, so that their heir, Elizabeth I of England, had a prior claim there.[23][57]/nSome ten years after Dee's death, the antiquarian Robert Cotton bought land round Dee's house and began digging for papers and artifacts. He found several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these to the scholar M\u00e9ric Casaubon, who published them in 1659, with a long introduction critical of their author, as A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.[32] As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was popular. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is mainly responsible for the image, prevalent for the next two-and-a-half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic.[45]/nAbout the time the True and Faithful Relation was published, members of the Rosicrucian movement claimed Dee as one of their number.[58] There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed in Dee's lifetime, and no evidence he ever belonged to any secret fraternity.[30] His reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists, writers of horror stories and latter-day magicians. The accretion of fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they were. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to tell him how he might heal the deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England.[59] Queen Elizabeth I used him several times as her court astronomer, not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but as a deeply religious and learned, trustworthy man.[citation needed]/nA revaluation of Dee's character and significance came in the 20th century, largely through the work of the historians Charlotte Fell Smith and Dame Frances Yates. Both brought into focus the parallel roles of magic, science and religion in the Elizabethan Renaissance. Fell Smith writes: \"There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand.\"[17] Through this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book collector, a devoted Christian (albeit at a confusing time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day.[45][60] His Mortlake library was the largest in the country before it was vandalised, and created at enormous, sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was seen as one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of De Thou. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of colonisation of North America, envisioning a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.[23]/nDee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator and owned an important collection of maps, globes and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments and special navigational techniques for use in polar regions. Dee served as an advisor to English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation.[17][23] He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than Francis Bacon, though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere of the reign of James I.[61] Although Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics differs much from ours,[27][59][62] its promotion outside the universities was an enduring achievement. For most of his writings, Dee chose English, rather than Latin, to make them accessible to the public. His \"Mathematical Preface\" to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was popular and influential among the \"mechanicians\": a growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface includes demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training.[27]/nIn the 20th century, the Municipal Borough of Richmond (now the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames) honoured John Dee by naming a street near Mortlake \"Dee Road\".[63]/nDee was a friend of Tycho Brahe and familiar with the work (translated into English by his ward and assistant, Thomas Digges) of Nicolaus Copernicus.[17] Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, although he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform. In 1583, he was asked to advise the Queen on the new Gregorian calendar promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII from October 1582. He advised that England accept it, albeit with seven specific amendments. The first was that the adjustment should not be the ten days that would restore the calendar to the time of the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, but by eleven, which would restore it to the birth of Christ. Another proposal of Dee's was to align the civil and liturgical years and have them both start on 1 January. Perhaps predictably, England chose to spurn suggestions that had papist origins, despite any merit they may have had.[10]/nDee has often been associated with the Voynich manuscript.[30][64] Wilfrid Michael Voynich, who bought the manuscript in 1912, suggested that Dee may have owned it and sold it to Rudolph II. Dee's contacts with Rudolph were less extensive than had been thought, however, and Dee's diaries show no evidence of a sale. However, he was known to have owned a copy of the Book of Soyga, another enciphered book.[65]/nThe British Museum holds several items once allegedly owned by Dee and associated with the spiritual conferences:[66]/nIn December 2004, both a shew stone (used for divining) formerly belonging to Dee and a mid-17th-century explanation of its use written by Nicholas Culpeper were stolen from the Science Museum in London, but recovered shortly afterwards.[69]/nTo 21st-century eyes, Dee's activities straddle magic and modern science, but to apply a hard and fast distinction between these two realms or epistemological world views is anachronistic.[70][71] He was invited to lecture on Euclidean geometry at the University of Paris while still in his early twenties. He was an ardent promoter of mathematics, a respected astronomer and a leading expert in navigation, who trained many who would conduct England's voyages of discovery./nMeanwhile, he immersed himself in sorcery, astrology and Hermetic philosophy. Much effort in his last 30 years went into trying to commune with angels, so as to learn the universal language of creation and achieve a pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind.[72] A student of the Renaissance Neo-Platonism of Marsilio Ficino, he drew no distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations of Hermetic magic, angel summoning and divination: all his activities were part of his quest for a transcendent understanding of divine forms underlying the visible world: Dee's \"pure verities\"./nDee amassed one of England's biggest libraries.[73] His scholarly status also took him into Elizabethan politics as an adviser and tutor to Elizabeth I and through relations with her ministers Francis Walsingham and William Cecil. He tutored and patronised Sir Philip Sidney; his uncle Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester; Edward Dyer; and Sir Christopher Hatton./nDee was a popular figure in literary works by his contemporaries and he has continued to feature in popular culture, particularly in fiction or fantasy set during his lifetime or dealing with magic or the occult./nEdmund Spenser may be referring to Dee in The Faerie Queene (1596).[3] William Shakespeare may have modelled the character of Prospero in The Tempest (1610\u20131611) on Dee.[30]/nDee is the subject of Henry Gillard Glindoni's painting John Dee performing an experiment before Queen Elizabeth I.[74]/nDee is a major character in John Crowley's four-volume novel, \u00c6gypt, the first volume of which, The Solitudes, was published in 1987.[75]/nJohn Dee is one of the main antagonists in the book series The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Michael Scott. In the series, John Dee has gained immortality from the Dark Elders, his mentors./nThe film Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) has two scenes in which Queen Elizabeth consults Dr. Dee, played by David Threlfall.[citation needed]/nPhil Rickman casts Dee as the main detective, investigating the disappearance of the bones of King Arthur during the reign of Elizabeth I in the historical mystery The Bones of Avalon (2010).[76] The play Burn Your Bookes (2010) by Richard Byrne examines the relations between Dee, Edward Kelley and Edward Dyer.[77]/nThe opera Dr Dee: An English Opera (2011) by Damon Albarn, explores Dee's life and work.[78][79][80]", "35458775": "Ronald William Henry Turnbull Hudson (16 July 1876 \u2013 20 September 1904) was a British mathematician./nRonald W.H.T.

Hudson's life was cut short when he died in a mountaineering accident at the age of 28, but his posthumously-published book Kummer's Quartic Surface allows mathematicians today access to his work.[1]/nHe was the son of W.H.H.

He was born to a poor family in the Kingdom of Naples, and studied judicial astrology, a subject he defended in his Oratio de Inventoribus et Astrologiae Laudibus (1508).  Judicial astrology concerned the fate of man (astrologia judiciaria; mundane astrology) as influenced by the stars.  His most famous work is the Tractatus Astrologicus. Later in life he was named a bishop of the Catholic Church./nGaurico's reputation was such that he served as an \"astrological consultant\" to Catherine de' Medici.  Gaurico had predicted the accession to the papacy of Catherine's great-uncle Giovanni de Medici (when he was 14 \u2013 who later became Leo X) and predicted Catherine's uncle Giulio de Medici involvement in important political struggles and numerous descendants.  Giulio de Medici later was to become Pope Clement VII, who involved with disputes with both Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Henry VIII of England./nGiovanni II Bentivoglio, ruler of Bologna, consulted him about his destiny.  Displeased with Gaurico's prophecy, Bentivoglio subjected Gaurico to the torture of mancuerda, the effects of which he suffered for the rest of his life, and exiled the astrologer.  When Bologna fell to Pope Julius II, Gaurico returned to general favor.[2]/nGaurico became famous after predicting the ascension of Alessandro Farnese, a prediction that came true with Farnese's ascension as Paul III.  Gaurico foretold also the sickness and death of this Pontiff, who died on November 20, 1549, the day said to have been indicated by Gaurico.  Paul III obviously did not wait for his death in order to verify Gaurico's prediction.  Paul III, who encouraged astrologers to come to Rome and work under his protection, made Gaurico his unofficial astrologer, and he was made a Papal Table Companion, knighted, and appointed bishop of Giffoni (Salerno province), and thus described as Episcopus Geophonensis, in 1539.  Paul III made Gaurico bishop of Civitate (San Severo), in Capitanata, in southern Italy, in 1545.  Four years after the death of Paul III, Gaurico abandoned these duties and settled in Rome./nThe Tractatus Astrologicus contained the natal charts of popes and cardinals, kings and nobles, scholars, musicians and artists.  Gaurico systematically examined each natal chart, compared it to the life of the person in question, and in the case of living subjects, predicted the outcome of their lives and careers.  Gaurico also attempted to calculate the exact date of Jesus' crucifixion, and the number of hours between it and the resurrection.  Allegedly, both he and Nostradamus were responsible for predicting the death of Henry II of France in a tournament in 1559./nAllegedly, Catherine de' Medici had wished to know Henry's destiny as the Apparent Heir of France. Allegedly, Gaurico replied that the Heir would exert his royal power, which would first marked by a duel, and finally by another duel that would put a stop to his reign and his life. Allegedly, he also explained in detail the kind of wound that would result in the death of Henry II during this duel./nAllegedly, the danger of this duel was considered impossible because of the social condition of the Prince, and Gaurico was not believed. Allegedly, Gaurico insisted on his statements, printed in France in 1552, that is, seven years before the well-known joust in which Henry II would find his death.  He is also said to have sent a letter to the King repeating with full details his prediction and advising him to avoid any single combat in closed field, especially around the time when he had reached 41 years of age, since a wound on his head, at this age, could produce his blindness or his death.  Allegedly, the letter did not deter Henry./nOn July 1, 1559, during a match to celebrate the Peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis with his longtime enemies, the Habsburgs of Austria and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth of Valois to King Philip II of Spain, during the final joust, King Henry's eye was pierced by a sliver that penetrated the brain, from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the King's Scottish Guard. He suffered terribly, and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon Ambroise Par\u00e9, died on July 10, 1559, and was buried in a cadaver tomb in Saint Denis Basilica./nIn fact, the one known horoscope of Henri II by Gaurico is literally quoted in the Dictionnaire of Pierre Bayle. There is no question of a duel. Gaurico promises the best successes to Henri II and adds that he shall live up to the age of 69 year, 10 month and 12 days, provided that he passes the years 56, 63 and 64 of his age.[3]/nIn regard to the birth of Martin Luther, Gaurico found a connection between this date (November 10, 1483, according to the reckoning of the Gregorian Calendar) and a \"grand conjunction,\" that is, a meeting of the planets Jupiter and Saturn.  Grand conjunctions were meant to predict extensive changes in the secular and religious power structures.  Because the \u201cgrand conjunction\u201d of 1484 took place in the sign of Scorpio, an astrological sign that stood for radical, revolutionary events as well as for epidemics and widespread death, this indicated to Gaurico that dramatic changes would occur in all social spheres \u2013such as would result from the Reformation.[4]/nGaurico has been identified by the historian Paola Zambelli as the author of an anonymous 1512 pamphlet that predicted a universal deluge to take place in 1524 as a result of a conjunction of the superior planets in the watery sign of Pisces.[5]/nGaurico was widely renowned as an astrologer, and his Tractatus Astrologicus (1552) also contained charts of the foundation of various buildings and cities.  Pope Paul III thus used Gaurico to determine the most auspicious time at which the cornerstone of a new building in the neighborhood of St Peter's Basilica should be laid.  It is said that Gaurico arrived at the scene in great pomp.  An assistant, the astrologer Vincentius Campanatius of Bologna, was commanded to inspect the sky with an astrolabe and cry out in a loud voice the best time when the moment to lay the first marble slab arrived.[6]/nGaurico ran a school of astrology at Ferrara.  One of his pupils was Julius Caesar Scaliger.  As a scholar, Gaurico edited George of Trebizon's translation of Ptolemy's Almagest, a work Gaurico dedicated to Pope Nicholas V, who had commissioned the work.

Following her inaugural 2002 workshop in Regensburg, which lent its name to the series, subsequent workshops were held in Amsterdam in 2004, Durham in 2008, and Berlin in 2014.[3]/nOne of Brack-Bernsen's most important contributions to the field of the history of the exact sciences was her identification of a method used by Babylonian astronomers for predicting the time between the rising and setting of the moon and sun, called the lunar six, that are preserved on tablet TU 11. [4] The lunar six are a group of six time interval measurements used in Babylonian astronomy,[5] consisting of four intervals measured around the full moon in the middle of the Babylonian lunar month, and two measured around the new moon. The four values measured in the middle of the month, often called the lunar four, include \u0160U2 (moonset to sunrise), NA (sunrise to moonset), ME (moonrise to sunset), and GE6 (sunset to moonrise). \u0160U2 and NA can be seen as measuring the same quantity \u2014 if the moon sets first, the interval is labelled \u0160U2, while if the sunset comes first it is called NA.[6] ME and GE6 are both measured on the eastern horizon, while \u0160U2 and NA are both measured on the western horizon.[7] At the beginning of the month, the interval NA measures the time from sunset to moonset, and on the day when the moon is seen for the last time the interval KUR measures moonrise to sunset. While much of Babylonian astronomy is rooted in the observation of these phenomena, astronomers developed ways of predicting values for the lunar six to both aid and supplement observational records./nBrack-Bernsen  identified a process for predicting lunar six values based on the Saros cycle. Babylonian astronomers were able to measure the daily retardation of the setting of the full moon by combining lunar six values \u0160U2 + NA for the full moon, and daily retardation of the rising moon by combining lunar six values ME + GE6. These values repeat after one full Saros cycle (223 months), but the Saros cycle is on average 1/3 of a day longer than a whole day (see below for further discussion on the varying length of this time period). So using a formula based on the old value for a lunar six variable from one Saros cycle previous plus one third of one of these values for the daily retardation of the setting or rising of the moon, astronomers were able to predict the lunar six values for a new month./nNAn = NAn-223 - 1/3(\u0160U2 + NA)n-223/n\u0160Un = \u0160Un-223 + 1/3(\u0160U2 + NA)n-223/nMEn = MEn-223 + 1/3(ME+GE6)n-223/nWhere n = the current/goal month and n-223 = one Saros cycle earlier./nBrack-Bernsen identified and outlined this method in TU 11, and its use is bolstered by the inclusion in Goal-Year texts of lunar six values from one Saros period earlier.\nHowever, the daily retardation of a new moon cannot be measured directly due to the lack of visibility around conjunction (except in the event of an eclipse). To compensate for this, Babylonian astronomers took measurement of the daily retardation of a full moon six months prior, which is a fairly accurate measurement for this hard-to-see value./nNAn = NAn-223 - 1/3(\u0160U2 + NA)n-229/nBrack-Bernsen uncovered a method for predicting these lunar six values that had been lost to modern researchers but that informed the development of their lunar astronomical systems and observational programs. Lunar six values were integral in the development of Babylonian lunar theory. Values of the lunar six seem to have played a role in establishing the contribution of lunar anomaly to the Babylonian lunar theory System A. The length of the Saros cycle is established as 223 synodic months, which corresponds to 6585 days + 6 to 11 hours. The variability in the number of hours is caused by the combination of lunar and solar anomaly and the fact that the Saros cycle does not equate to a whole number anomalistic months, and, therefore, does not indicate an exact return of lunar velocity. However, lunar anomaly, while important for a lunar theory, is not directly observable and its effects are intertwined with the effects of solar anomaly. This is where lunar six data becomes valuable \u2014 because these intervals are measured just before and after the full moon and on both horizons, their combination ends up cancelling out all contributing factors except lunar anomaly.[7] In particular, the lunar four measured around the full moon \u2014 ME, \u0160U2, GE6, and NA \u2014 combine to allow for the approximation of the effect of lunar anomaly./nThe sum of these lunar four values provides approximately the same period and roughly the same magnitude and variation of what we find in the column designated \u03a6 in System A lunar ephemerides.[8] We can therefore view column \u03a6 as a representation of lunar anomaly, drawing from observations of the lunar four and with solar anomaly assumed to be at its maximum. Originally, this column was understood to just represent the excess in the length of the Saros cycle over 6585 days, but it turns out that it becomes one of the four necessary inputs into system (along with zodiacal position at syzygy (column B), lunar node, and some original syzygy) upon which the data in the other columns depend. In fact, column \u03a6 is the first column listed in a System A ephemeris after the date, perhaps indicating its importance to the system./nThis interpretation of column  \u03a6 and the importance of the lunar six intervals was proposed by Brack-Bernsen, and was bolstered by the discovery of 7th century BCE tablets recording lunar six data by Huber and Steele, [6]   implying enough time to calculate cycles of lunar six data. Despite the prevalence of lunar four data in the development of Lunar theory System A, however, System B Lunar theory uses a simpler zigzag model of lunar anomaly that does not seem to rely on lunar four or lunar six measurements.

He wrote influential works on economics, mathematics, physics, astrology, astronomy, philosophy, and theology; was Bishop of Lisieux, a translator, a counselor of King Charles V of France, and one of the most original thinkers of 14th-century Europe.[7]/nNicole Oresme was born c.\u20091320\u20131325 in the village of Allemagnes (today's Fleury-sur-Orne) in the vicinity of Caen, Normandy, in the diocese of Bayeux. Practically nothing is known concerning his family. The fact that Oresme attended the royally sponsored and subsidised College of Navarre, an institution for students too poor to pay their expenses while studying at the University of Paris, makes it probable that he came from a peasant family.[8]/nOresme studied the \"arts\" in Paris, together with Jean Buridan (the so-called founder of the French school of natural philosophy), Albert of Saxony and perhaps Marsilius of Inghen, and there received the Magister Artium. He was already a regent master in arts by 1342, during the crisis over William of Ockham's natural philosophy.[9]/nIn 1348, he was a student of theology in Paris./nIn 1356, he received his doctorate and in the same year he became grand master (grand-ma\u00eetre) of the College of Navarre./nIn 1364, he was appointed dean of the Cathedral of Rouen.  Around 1369, he began a series of translations of Aristotelian works at the request of Charles V, who granted him a pension in 1371 and, with royal support, was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1377. In 1382, he died in Lisieux.[10]/nIn his Livre du ciel et du monde Oresme discussed a range of evidence for and against the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis.[11] From astronomical considerations, he maintained that if the Earth were moving and not the celestial spheres, all the movements that we see in the heavens that are computed by the astronomers would appear exactly the same as if the spheres were rotating around the Earth. He rejected the physical argument that if the Earth were moving the air would be left behind causing a great wind from east to west.  In his view the Earth, Water, and Air would all share the same motion.[12]  As to the scriptural passage that speaks of the motion of the Sun, he concludes that \"this passage conforms to the customary usage of popular speech\" and is not to be taken literally.[13] He also noted that it would be more economical for the small Earth to rotate on its axis than the immense sphere of the stars.[14]  Nonetheless, he concluded that none of these arguments were conclusive and \"everyone maintains, and I think myself, that the heavens do move and not the Earth.\"[15]/nIn his mathematical work, Oresme developed the notion of incommensurate fractions, fractions that could not be expressed as powers of one another, and made probabilistic, statistical arguments as to their relative frequency.[16] From this, he argued that it was very probable that the length of the day and the year were incommensurate (irrational), as indeed were the periods of the motions of the moon and the planets.  From this, he noted that planetary conjunctions and oppositions would never recur in quite exactly the same way. Oresme maintained that this disproves the claims of astrologers who, thinking \"they know with punctual exactness the motions, aspects, conjunctions and oppositions\u2026 [judge] rashly and erroneously about future events.\"[17]/nOresme's critique of astrology in his Livre de divinacions treats it as having six parts.[18] The first, essentially astronomy, the movements of heavenly bodies, he considers good science but not precisely knowable.\nThe second part deals with the influences of the heavenly bodies on earthly events at all scales. Oresme does not deny such influence, but states, in line with a commonly held opinion,[19] that it could either be that arrangements of heavenly bodies signify events, purely symbolically, or that they actually cause such events, deterministically. Mediaevalist Chauncey Wood remarks that this major elision \"makes it very difficult to determine who believed what about astrology\".[19]/nThe third part concerns predictiveness, covering events at three different scales: great events such as plagues, famines, floods and wars; weather, winds and storms; and medicine, with influences on the humours, the four Aristotelian fluids of the body. Oresme criticizes all of these as misdirected, though he accepts that prediction is a legitimate area of study, and argues that the effect on the weather is less well known than the effect on great events. He observes that sailors and farmers are better at predicting weather than astrologers, and specifically attacks the astrological basis of prediction, noting correctly that the zodiac has moved relative to the fixed stars (because of precession of the equinoxes) since the zodiac was first described in ancient times.[19]\nThese first three parts are what Oresme considers the physical influences of the stars and planets (including sun and moon) on the earth, and while he offers critiques of them, he accepts that effects exist. The last three parts are what Oresme considers to concern (good or bad) fortune. They are interrogations, meaning asking the stars when to do things such as business deals; elections, meaning choosing the best time to do things such as getting married or fighting a war and nativities, meaning the natal astrology with birth charts that forms much of modern astrological practice. Oresme classifies interrogations and elections as \"totally false\" arts, but his critique of nativities is more measured. He denies that any path is predetermined by the heavenly bodies, because humans have free will, but he accepts that the heavenly bodies can influence behaviour and habitual mood, via the combination of humours in each person. Overall, Oresme's skepticism is strongly shaped by his understanding of the scope of astrology. He accepts things a modern skeptic would reject, and rejects some things \u2014 such as the knowability of planetary movements, and effects on weather \u2014 that are accepted by modern science.[20]/nIn discussing the propagation of light and sound, Oresme adopted the common medieval doctrine of the multiplication of species,[21] as it had been developed by optical writers such as Alhacen, Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, John Pecham, and Witelo.[22]  Oresme maintained that these species were immaterial, but corporeal (i.e., three-dimensional) entities.[23]/nOresme's most important contributions to mathematics are contained in Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, he distinguished the intensio (the degree of heat at each point) and the extensio (as the length of the heated rod). These two terms were often replaced by latitudo and longitudo. For the sake of clarity, Oresme conceived the idea of visualizing these concepts by plane figures, approaching what we would now call rectangular coordinates. The intensity of the quality was represented by a length or latitudo proportional to the intensity erected perpendicular to the base at a given point on the base line, which represents the longitudo. Oresme proposed that the geometrical form of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a characteristic of the quality itself. Oresme defined a uniform quality as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other quality as difform. Uniformly varying qualities are represented by a straight line inclined to the axis of the longitude, while he described many cases of nonuniformly varying qualities. Oresme extended this doctrine to figures of three dimensions. He considered this analysis applicable to many different qualities such as hotness, whiteness, and sweetness. Significantly for later developments, Oresme applied this concept to the analysis of local motion where the latitudo or intensity represented the speed, the longitudo represented the time, and the area of the figure represented the distance travelled.[24]/nHe shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point, on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is, then, the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition, the theorem of the latitudo uniformiter difformis became the law of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion; thus Oresme published what was taught over two centuries prior to Galileo's making it famous.[2][25]  Diagrams of the velocity of an accelerating object against time in On the Latitude of Forms by Oresme[26] have been cited to credit Oresme with the discovery of \"proto bar charts\".[27][28]/nIn De configurationibus Oresme introduces the concept of curvature as a measure of departure from straightness, for circles he has the curvature as being inversely proportional to radius and attempts to extend this to other curves as a continuously varying magnitude.[29]/nSignificantly, Oresme developed the first proof of the divergence of the harmonic series.[30] His proof, requiring less advanced mathematics than current \"standard\" tests for divergence (for example, the integral test), begins by noting that for any n that is a power of 2, there are n/2 \u2212 1 terms in the series between 1/(n/2) and 1/n.  Each of these terms is at least 1/n,  and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2.  For instance, there is one term 1/2, then two terms 1/3 + 1/4 that together sum to at least 1/2, then four terms 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 that also sum to at least 1/2, and so on.  Thus the series must be greater than the series 1\u00a0+\u00a01/2\u00a0+\u00a01/2\u00a0+ 1/2\u00a0+\u00a0..., which does not have a finite limit. This proves that the harmonic series must be divergent.  This argument shows that the sum of the first n terms grows at least as fast as \n\n\n\n(\n1\n\n/\n\n2\n)\n\nlog\n\n2\n\n\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (1/2)\\log _{2}n}\n\n. (See also Harmonic series)/nOresme was the first mathematician to prove this fact, and (after his proof was lost) it was not proven again until the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli.[31]/nHe also worked on fractional powers, and the notion of probability over infinite sequences, ideas which would not be further developed for the next three and five centuries, respectively.[16]:\u200a142\u20133/nOresme, like many of his contemporaries such as John Buridan and Albert of Saxony, shaped and critiqued Aristotle's and Averroes's theories of motion to their own liking.[32] Taking inspiration from the theories of forma fluens and fluxus formae, Oresme would suggest his own descriptions for change and motion in his commentary of Physics. Forma fluens is described by William of Ockham as \"Every thing that is moved is moved by a mover,\" and fluxus formae as \"Every motion is produced by a mover.\"[33] Buridan and Albert of Saxony each subscribed to the classic interpretation of flux being an innate part of an object, but Oresme differs from his contemporaries in this aspect.[32] Oresme agrees with fluxus formae in that motion is attributed to an object, but that an object is \u201cset into\u201d motion, rather than \u201cgiven\u201d motion, denying a distinction between a motionless object and an object in motion. To Oresme, an object moves, but it is not a moving object.[32] Once an object begins movement through the three dimensions it has a new \u201cmodus rei\u201d or \u201cway of being,\u201d which should only be described through the perspective of the moving object, rather than a distinct point.[32] This line of thought coincides with Oresme's challenge to the structure of the universe. Oresme's description of motion was not popular, although it was thorough.[34] A Richard Brinkley is thought to be an inspiration for the modus-rei description, but this is uncertain.[34]/nOresme provided the first modern vernacular translations of Aristotle's moral works that are still extant today. Between 1371 and 1377 he translated Aristotle's Ethics, Politics and Economics (the last of which is nowadays considered to be pseudo-Aristotelian) into Middle French. He also extensively commented on these texts, thereby expressing some of his political views. Like his predecessors Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government.[35] His criterion for good government is the common good. A king (by definition good) takes care of the common good, whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty.[36] Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua, whom he occasionally quotes, Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive: only the multitude of reasonable, wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince, changing the law and passing judgement.[37] Oresme, however, categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good.[38] Unlike earlier commentators, however, Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king's will.[39] It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity.[40] Oresme favours moderate kingship,[41] thereby negating contemporary absolutist thought, usually promoted by adherents of Roman law.[42] Furthermore, Oresme doesn't comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred, as promoted by \u00c9vrart de Tr\u00e9maugon in his Songe du vergier or Jean Golein in his Trait\u00e9 du sacre.[43] Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt, tyrannical and oligarchical, he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.[44]/nIt has traditionally been thought that Oresme's Aristotelian translations had a major influence on King Charles V's politics: Charles' laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme, as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the king's council in the early 1370s.[45] Oresme may have conveyed Marsilian and conciliarist thought to Jean Gerson and Christine de Pizan.[46]/nWith his Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money (De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum), one of the earliest manuscripts devoted to an economic matter, Oresme brings an interesting insight on the medieval conception of money. Oresme's viewpoints of theoretical architecture are outlined in Part 3 and 4 of his work from De moneta, which he completed between 1356 and 1360. His belief is that humans have a natural right to own property; this property belongs to the individual and community.[47] In Part 4, Oresme provides a solution to a political problem as to how a monarch can be held accountable to put the common good before any private affairs. Though the monarchy rightfully has claims on all money given an emergency, Oresme states that any ruler that goes through this is a \u201cTyrant dominating slaves\u201d. Oresme was one of the first medieval theorists that did not accept the right of the monarch to have claims on all money as well as \u201chis subjects\u2019 right to own private property.\u201d/nOresme was known to be a well rounded psychologist. He practiced the technique of \u201cinner senses\u201d and studied the perception of the world. Oresme contributed to 19th and 20th century psychology in the fields of cognitive psychology, perception psychology, psychology of consciousness, and psychophysics. Oresme discovered the psychology of unconscious and came up with the theory of unconscious conclusion of perception. He developed many ideas beyond quality, quantity, categories and terms which were labeled \u201ctheory of cognition\u201d.[48]/nOresme's economic thought remained well regarded centuries after his death. In a 1920 Essay on Medieval Economic Teaching, Irish economist George O'Brien summed up the favorable academic consensus over Oresme's Treatise on the origin, nature, law, and alterations of money:/nThe merits of this work have excited the unanimous admiration of all who have studied it. Roscher says that it contains 'a theory of money, elaborated in the fourteenth century, which remains perfectly correct to-day, under the test of the principles applied in the nineteenth century, and that with a brevity, a precision, a clarity, and a simplicity of language which is a striking proof of the superior genius of its author.' According to Brants, 'the treatise of Oresme is one of the first to be devoted ex professo to an economic subject, and it expresses many ideas which are very just, more just than those which held the field for a long period after him, under the name of mercantilism, and more just than those which allowed of the reduction of money as if it were nothing more than a counter of exchange.' 'Oresme's treatise on money,' says Macleod, 'may be justly said to stand at the head of modern economic literature. This treatise laid the foundations of monetary science, which are now accepted by all sound economists.' 'Oresme's completely secular and naturalistic method of treating one of the most important problems of political economy,' says Espinas, 'is a signal of the approaching end of the Middle Ages and the dawn of the Renaissance.' Dr. Cunningham adds his tribute of praise: 'The conceptions of national wealth and national power were ruling ideas in economic matters for several centuries, and Oresme appears to be the earliest of the economic writers by whom they were explicitly adopted as the very basis of his argument\u2026. A large number of points of economic doctrine in regard to coinage are discussed with much judgment and clearness.' Endemann alone is inclined to quarrel with the pre-eminence of Oresme; but on this question, he is in a minority of one.[49]", "46468863": "Jos\u00e9 Nathan Kutz is the Robert Bolles and Yasuko Endo Professor within the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in Seattle.

He was a collector of antiquities and an orientalist. He surveyed southern India, making use of local interpreters and scholars to study religion, oral histories, inscriptions and other evidence, initially out of personal interest, and later as a surveyor. He was ordered to survey the Mysore region shortly after the British victory over Tipu Sultan in 1799 and produced the first maps of the region along with illustrations of the landscape and notes on archaeological landmarks. His collections consisting of thousands of manuscripts, inscriptions, translations, coins and paintings, which were acquired after his death by the India Office Library and are an important source for the study of Indian history. He was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815.[3]/nColonel Colin Mackenzie was born in Stornoway on Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, the second son of merchant Murdoch Mackenzie (who was the first postmaster of the town) and Barbara around 1753 or 1754. Little is known of his early life but he is thought to have started his work as a Comptroller of the Customs at Stornoway from 1778 to 1783, possibly through the influence of his father's association with the Mackenzie Earls of Seaforth. In his youth he had an interest in mathematics possibly fostered by his schoolmaster, a freemason, Alexander Anderson.[4] Lord Kenneth Mackenzie (last Earl of Seaforth) and Francis (fifth Lord Napier) sought his help in preparing a biography of John Napier and his work on logarithms. When Lord Napier died in 1773, Kenneth Mackenzie helped Colin to obtain commission with the British East India Company to join the Madras Army. When he arrived in Madras on 2 September 1783 he was thirty and was never to return home again.[5] He joined as a Cadet in the Infantry division but was transferred in 1786 as a Cadet of Engineers.[6]/nArriving in India he first met the daughter of Lord Francis Napier, Hester (d. 1819). Hester was married to Samuel Johnston who worked as a civil servant at Madurai (their son Alexander Johnston later became a judge in Sri Lanka, founded the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie). Hester introduced Mackenzie to some Brahmins to obtain information on Hindu mathematical traditions as part of the biographical memoir on John Napier and the history of logarithms. The biography project appears to have been subsequently dropped but Colin continued to take an interest in antiquities.[1][5]/nFor the first thirteen years in India, he was busy with military duties. He began in Coimbatore and Dindigul around 1783 followed by engineering duties in Madras, Nellore and Guntur and during the campaign against Mysore from 1790 to 1792. In 1793 he saw action in the Siege of Pondicherry. He was posted as a commanding engineer to Ceylon and returned in 1796.[5] He rose in rank starting from a second lieutenant on 16 May 1783, first lieutenant on 6 March 1789; and captain 16 August 1793. Major by 1 Jan 1806 rising on to become a colonel on 12 August 1819.[7] It was after his return from Ceylon that he was able to follow his interest in antiquities.[8]/nIn 1799, Mackenzie was part of the British force in the Battle of Seringapatam, where Tipu Sultan, Maharaja of Mysore was defeated. After the defeat of Tipu, he led the Mysore survey between 1799 and 1810 and one of the aims was to establish the boundaries of the state as well as the territories ceded by the Nizam. The survey consisted of interpreters, a team of draftsmen and illustrators who collected material on the natural history, geography, architecture, history, customs, and folk tales of the region./nWhen he began the survey, he was concerned that he had no linguistic skills and was more appalled by the lack of British competence in south Indian languages. Around the same time, the trigonometric survey was proposed by William Lambton but there was little collaboration between the two during the Mysore survey.[9] Mackenzie was told that his survey was not to be \"mere military or geographical information, but that your enquiries are to be extended to a statistical account of the whole country.\" However he was not provided enough resources for this grand plan. He wrote to Barry Close that he would not \"descend to the minutiae\" of measuring cultivated and uncultivated land but would instead focus on that which was of political and military importance. He pointed out that enquiries into revenues created uneasiness. One of his chief interpreters was a man named Kavelli Venkata Boria (IAST k\u0101vel\u012b ve\u1e43ke\u1e6d\u0101 boraiy\u0101\u1e25, there are variations in spelling) who Mackenzie first met in 1796, shortly after his return from Ceylon. He found Boria capable of dealing with all sects and considered him as \"the first step of my introduction into the portal of Indian knowledge.\" Boria knew Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Sankskrit. In 1797, Mackenzie visited Mudgeri and found the ruins of a Jain temple. He wrote an extensive note on the Jains based on interviews through his translator \"Cavelly Boria\".[10] Boria died in 1803[11] and Mackenzie took in his brother Venkata Lechmiah (IAST lak\u1e63maiyy\u0101, also spelt Lakshmaiah or Lakshmayya). Another of Mackenzie's assistant was Dhurmiah (IAST dharmay\u0101\u1e25), a Jain pandit (scholar) from Maleyur, then in Mysore State. Dhurmiah, with his ability to read Hale Kannada (old Kannada) inscriptions contributed greatly to the study of the inscriptions in the region. Dhurmiah provided Mackenzie with Jain insights into the history of India but some ideas were considered too unreliable such as the idea that the Jains had fled from Mecca. Dhurmiah's son may also have been on Mackenzie's staff. Another orientalist, Mark Wilks interviewed Dhurmiah and wrote on the Jains in his 1817 Historical Sketches of the South of India.[12]/nStating the aims of his survey, he wrote from the perspective of a historian in a letter to Major Merwick Shawe in 1805:[13]/nThe elucidation of the History of the several Governments that have rapidly succeeded in this Stage will I conceived be very interesting, as by the Inscriptions, Grants & other Documents that came into my hands, a regular Progress is traced up to the first Mahomedan invasion in the 13th Century & even beyond it to the 8th but more obscurely; & in several instances still further, these consist not merely of a dry Chain of uninteresting facts but are connected by various illustrations of the genious & manner of the People, their Several Systems of Government & of Religion, & of the predominant causes that influence their Sentiments & opinions to this day; lights are derived on the Tenures of lands, the origin & variety of the several classes, and the genius and Spirit of the Government prevalent generally in the South for centuries from Several Documents illustrating claims & pretension not foreign to modern discussions; ... confirming the utility of this undertaking to the existing Government from a knowledge of Institutions that influence so considerable a part of the Population of the Empire./nAmong Mackenzie's vast collection of illustrations is a set of 85 sketches made at Amaravati. He appears to have first visited the site in 1798 and conducted more systematic studies between 1816 and 1820 after he became a Surveyor General and three copies of these documents were made. One was deposited at the Library of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, another at Madras and one in the British Library at London. Only the London copy survives. Sketches of the site were made by John Newman, draftsman for Mackenzie from 1810 to 1818. About 132 stones were found by Mackenzie but these are no longer traceable. Mackenzie believed that the site was related to the Jain religion and had no idea of Buddhism in India. The stones from Amaravati were brought to Masulipatam but many were not taken to ship but deposited into a mound that came to be known as \"Robertson's Mound\" after Francis W. Robertson who was Assistant Collector at Masulipatnam from 1814 to 1817. Most of these were subsequently moved to the Madras Museum along with Sir Walter Elliot's collections from Amaravati. About 79 stones depicted in the Mackenzie drawings are unaccounted for and are not traceable to collections in museums.[14]/nMackenzie spent two years (1811-1812/13) in Java, during the period of British occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. On 18 November 1812, while in Java, he married Petronella Jacomina Bartels at a local Lutheran Church. Petronella was born in Ceylon and was of Dutch ancestry.[4] In 1814, Stamford Raffles having heard of Mackenzie's work in India, wanted him to survey Java and report on its monuments. Since Mackenzie had then moved back to India, the team was led by H. C. Cornelius (who had accompanied Mackenzie earlier) who was also responsible for the work involved in removing the debris from the buried ruins of Borobodur.[15] His report on the survey of Java included many watercolours illustrating life during that period. These were published in three volumes. The first was titled Antiquities & Costume(s) of Java, 1812-13 and includes drawings and sketches some of which were made use of by Raffles in his History of Java. The second volume bore the title A Collection of Monuments, Images, Sculptures &c. illustrative of The Ancient History, Religion & Institutions of the Island of Java and of the Adjacent Isles: Taken under the immediate Inspection & Direction of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Mackenzie in the course of a Tour & of different Excursions through the Island of Java in the years 1811-1812 & 1813 and included numerous sketches and a few watercolours. The third volume Views, Plans and Maps on the Island of Java carried some pencil drawn maps.[16]/nIn 1757, the East India Company under Lord Clive had appointed James Rennell as Surveyor General for Bengal. Colin Mackenzie was appointed Surveyor General of Madras Presidency in 1810 but these posts were abolished in 1815.[17]\nAfter his returning to India, in June 1815, he was invested as a Companion of the Bath. He returned to continue surveys of eastern India from the Krishna to Cape Comorin.[7] On 26 May 1815 he was appointed Surveyor General of India with his headquarters at Fort William in Calcutta but he was allowed to stay on in Madras to help reorganize the surveys. He stayed there till May 1817 during which period he worked on planning surveys and examining earlier surveys. He appointed Benjamin Swain Ward (1786-1835) to survey Travancore, Lieutenant Peter Eyre Conner (born 5 August 1789, died 29-April-1821 at Hyderabad) (Sometimes given only as Lt. Connor[18]) for Coorg (then written as Codugu or Koorg), Francis Mountford (1790-1824) to Guntur and James Garling (1784-1820) to the Nizam's territories. By 1816 Garling had used a triangulation system similar to that of Lambton to work out the position of the ruins of Bijapur and was moving northwards. While Garling's work was appreciated by the surveyors of Bombay, he was rebuked by Mackenzie whose orders restricted him to the Nizam's territory.[19] The government in an attempt to hasten his move to Calcutta sent the yacht, HC Phoenix to transport him and his family from Madras on 24 June 1816. The captain, Criddle, was ordered to take him to survey the Pulicat and Armegon Shoals before taking him to Calcutta. Mackenzie however set about to his work and did not board the yacht. The government then wrote that he should use the survey ship Sophia which was to bring Sir John Malcolm to Madras in May 1817. He finally set sail to Calcutta on 17 July 1817 aboard Sophia.[6] When Mackenzie moved from Madras to Calcutta, Lechmiah was retained.[6]/nHe died on 8 May 1821 at his home in Calcutta, India, and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery. His widow, Petronella, offered the collections to the Bengal Government at a tentative price of Rs 20,000. The law firm Palmer and co. did an assessment of the collections and arrived at a figure of Rs 100,000 as a 'reasonable reimbursement' and the Bengal Government acquired the collections. In 1823 Petronella married Lt. Robert Page Fulcher at the Cape of Good Hope.[4] Fulcher was a fellow traveller on the ship to England and her original plan was to move to Stornoway to live with Colin's sister. Mackenzie's Will left 5% to Lechmiah.[1] Much of his collection of documents, manuscripts, artifacts, and artworks is now in the British Museum and the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library, though part of it remains in the Government Museum in Madras.[6] Samuel and Hester Johnston's son, Sir Alexander Johnston, wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie.[7]/nAfter Mackenzie's death, Lechmiah continued to help Horace Hayman Wilson in cataloguing the collections. He applied to the Madras division of the Asiatic Society to continue work on the collections made by his master. This was rejected on the grounds that no oriental could handle the managerial and critical work. James Prinsep declared that \"..The qualifications of Cavelly Venkata for such an office, judging of them by his 'abstract,' or indeed of any native, could hardly be pronounced equal to such a task...\".[20] Lechmiah was the only Indian admitted to the Madras Literary Society which was founded in 1817 and in 1833, Lechmiah founded a parallel Madras Hindu Literary Society as a means of continuing his work.[21] Sir Alexander Johnston supported this venture which also got the support of Captain Henry Harkness (author of a book on Indian scripts[22]) and George Norton (a radical Advocate-General who was against government support for Christian missionaries[23] support for but this organization did not survive long.[24][25][26] A missionary in Madras, William Taylor was chosen for the job. Taylor has been described as a poor scholar (with a defective knowledge of the Devanagari script[27]) if not a deranged antiquarian by Dirks (1993).[28][29] Lechmiah received a monthly pension of 300 rupees and was given a grant of a Shotrium (or Shrotrium[30]), land given as a reward for Civil officers. Three other brothers Ramaswamy (Ramasawmy), Narasimhalu (Naraseemoloo) and Sitayya (Seetiah) also worked for Mackenzie but the latter two were mainly as minor assistants. Ramaswamy later published extensively in English. His works included a book on the cities of the Deccan (Descriptive and Historical Sketches of Cities and Places in the Dekkan...), a biography of Deccan poets (1829), a cookbook translated in 1836 from a Telugu book written by Saraswati Bai (Pakasastra, otherwise Called Soopasastra, or the Modern Culinary Receipts of the Hindoos[31]), a book on caste in 1837.[26][32]/nStudies of the maps made by Mackenzie's survey are considered to have the potential to highlight interesting archaeological sites as well as provide information on the organization and structure of poligar chiefdoms which were dismantled after British takeover.[33]", "3999": "Benoit B.[n 1] Mandelbrot[n 2] (20 November 1924\u00a0\u2013 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born French-American mathematician and polymath with broad interests in the practical sciences, especially regarding what he labeled as \"the art of roughness\" of physical phenomena and \"the uncontrolled element in life\".[6][7][8] He referred to himself as a \"fractalist\"[9] and is recognized for his contribution to the field of fractal geometry, which included coining the word \"fractal\", as well as developing a theory of \"roughness and self-similarity\" in nature.[10]/nIn 1936, at the age of 11, Mandelbrot and his family emigrated from Warsaw, Poland, to France. After World War II ended, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and in the United States and receiving a master's degree in aeronautics from the California Institute of Technology. He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having dual French and American citizenship. In 1958, he began a 35-year career at IBM, where he became an IBM Fellow, and periodically took leaves of absence to teach at Harvard University.  At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences./nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the Mandelbrot set in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\", or \"chaotic\", such as clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".[11] His math- and geometry-centered research included contributions to such fields as statistical physics, meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology, anatomy, taxonomy, neurology, linguistics, information technology, computer graphics, economics, geology, medicine, physical cosmology, engineering, chaos theory, econophysics, metallurgy, and the social sciences.[12]/nToward the end of his career, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Yale University, where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure.[13]\nMandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France, Institute for Advanced Study and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During his career, he received over 15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals, along with winning numerous awards. His autobiography, The Fractalist:  Memoir of a Scientific Maverick, was published posthumously in 2012./nBenedykt Mandelbrot[15] was born in a Lithuanian Jewish family, in Warsaw during the Second Polish Republic.[16] His father made his living trading clothing; his mother was a dental surgeon. During his first two school years, he was tutored privately by an uncle who despised rote learning: \"Most of my time was spent playing chess, reading maps and learning how to open my eyes to everything around me.\"[17] In 1936, when he was 11, the family emigrated from Poland to France. The move, World War II, and the influence of his father's brother, the mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (who had moved to Paris around 1920), further prevented a standard education. \"The fact that my parents, as economic and political refugees, joined Szolem in France saved our lives,\" he writes.[9]:\u200a17\u200a[18]/nMandelbrot attended the Lyc\u00e9e Rollin (now the Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour) in Paris until the start of World War II, when his family moved to Tulle, France. He was helped by Rabbi David Feuerwerker, the Rabbi of Brive-la-Gaillarde, to continue his studies.[9]:\u200a62\u201363\u200a[19] Much of France was occupied by the Nazis at the time, and Mandelbrot recalls this period:/nOur constant fear was that a sufficiently determined foe might report us to an authority and we would be sent to our deaths. This happened to a close friend from Paris, Zina Morhange, a physician in a nearby county seat. Simply to eliminate the competition, another physician denounced her\u00a0... We escaped this fate. Who knows why?[9]:\u200a49/nIn 1944, Mandelbrot returned to Paris, studied at the Lyc\u00e9e du Parc in Lyon, and in 1945 to 1947 attended the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, where he studied under Gaston Julia and Paul L\u00e9vy. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at California Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's degree in aeronautics.[2] Returning to France, he obtained his PhD degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Paris in 1952.[17]/nFrom 1949 to 1958, Mandelbrot was a staff member at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During this time he spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he was sponsored by John von Neumann. In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to Geneva, Switzerland (to collaborate with Jean Piaget at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology) and later to the Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France.[20] In 1958 the couple moved to the United States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.[20] He remained at IBM for 35 years, becoming an IBM Fellow, and later Fellow Emeritus.[17]/nFrom 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in mathematics but in applied fields such as information theory, economics, and fluid dynamics./nMandelbrot saw financial markets as an example of \"wild randomness\", characterized by concentration and long-range dependence. He developed several original approaches for modelling financial fluctuations.[21] In his early work, he found that the price changes in financial markets did not follow a Gaussian distribution, but rather L\u00e9vy stable distributions having infinite variance. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a L\u00e9vy stable distribution with parameter \u03b1 equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution. \"Stable\" distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random variable follows the same distribution but with a larger scale parameter.[22] The latter work from the early 60s was done with daily data of cotton prices from 1900, long before he introduced the word 'fractal'. In later years, after the concept of fractals had matured, the study of financial markets in the context of fractals became possible only after the availability of high frequency data in finance. In the late 1980s, Mandelbrot used intra-daily tick data supplied by Olsen & Associates in Zurich[23][24] to apply fractal theory to market microstructure. This cooperation led to the publication of the first comprehensive papers on scaling law in finance.[25][26] This law shows similar properties at different time scales, confirming Mandelbrot's insight of the fractal nature of market microstructure. Mandelbrot's own research in this area is presented in his books Fractals and Scaling in Finance[27] and The (Mis)behavior of Markets.[28]/nAs a visiting professor at Harvard University, Mandelbrot began to study mathematical objects called Julia sets that were invariant under certain transformations of the complex plane. Building on previous work by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou, Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the Mandelbrot set which was introduced by him in 1979./nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term fractal to describe these structures and first published his ideas in the French book Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension, later translated in 1977 as Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension.[29] According to computer scientist and physicist Stephen Wolfram, the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics ... to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".[11] Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research, he was no longer a \"wandering scientist\", and later called him \"the father of fractals\":/nMandelbrot ended up doing a great piece of science and identifying a much stronger and more fundamental idea\u2014put simply, that there are some geometric shapes, which he called \"fractals\", that are equally \"rough\" at all scales. No matter how close you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.[11]/nWolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, \"in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesque broccoli are two examples from nature.\"[11] He points out an unexpected conclusion:/nOne might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. But it was not. In fact, it rose to prominence only over the past 30 or so years\u2014almost entirely through the efforts of one man, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.[11]/nMandelbrot used the term \"fractal\" as it derived from the Latin word \"fractus\", defined as broken or shattered glass. Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphics computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s psychedelic art with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist Johannes Kepler, who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.[30]/nMandelbrot, however, never felt he was inventing a new idea. He described his feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C. Clarke:/nExploring this set I certainly never had the feeling of invention. I never had the feeling that my imagination was rich enough to invent all those extraordinary things on discovering them. They were there, even though nobody had seen them before. It's marvelous, a very simple formula explains all these very complicated things. So the goal of science is starting with a mess, and explaining it with a simple formula, a kind of dream of science.[31]/nAccording to Clarke, \"the Mandelbrot set is indeed one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics. Who could have dreamed that such an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally infinite complexity?\" Clarke also notes an \"odd coincidence\":/nthe name Mandelbrot, and the word \"mandala\"\u2014for a religious symbol\u2014which I'm sure is a pure coincidence, but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas.[31]/nIn 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in The Fractal Geometry of Nature.[32] This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"program artifacts\"./nMandelbrot left IBM in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end pure research in his division.[33] He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale, and obtained his first tenured post in 1999, at the age of 75.[34] At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences./nMandelbrot created the first-ever \"theory of roughness\", and he saw \"roughness\" in the shapes of mountains, coastlines and river basins; the structures of plants, blood vessels and lungs; the clustering of galaxies. His personal quest was to create some mathematical formula to measure the overall \"roughness\" of such objects in nature.[9]:\u200axi\u200a He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature:/nCan geometry deliver what the Greek root of its name [geo-] seemed to promise\u2014truthful measurement, not only of cultivated fields along the Nile River but also of untamed Earth?[9]:\u200axii/nIn his paper \"How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension\", published in Science in 1967, Mandelbrot discusses self-similar curves that have Hausdorff dimension that are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. The paper is one of Mandelbrot's first publications on the topic of fractals.[35][36]/nMandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for describing many \"rough\" phenomena in the real world. He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"[9]:\u200a296\u200a Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in The Fractal Geometry of Nature had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:/nThe form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer ... bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling ... and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.[9]:\u200a292/nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and stock market prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional Euclidean geometry:/nClouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to The Fractal Geometry of Nature/nMandelbrot has been called an artist, and a visionary[37] and a maverick.[38] His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made The Fractal Geometry of Nature accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics./nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of Olbers' paradox (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the stars in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like Cantor dust), it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.[39]/nMandelbrot's awards include the Wolf Prize for Physics in 1993, the Lewis Fry Richardson Prize of the European Geophysical Society in 2000, the Japan Prize in 2003,[40] and the Einstein Lectureship of the American Mathematical Society in 2006./nThe small asteroid 27500 Mandelbrot was named in his honor. In November 1990, he was made a Chevalier in France's Legion of Honour. In December 2005, Mandelbrot was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.[41] Mandelbrot was promoted to an Officer of the Legion of Honour in January 2006.[42] An honorary degree from Johns Hopkins University was bestowed on Mandelbrot in the May 2010 commencement exercises.[43]/nA partial list of awards received by Mandelbrot:[44]/nMandelbrot died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 85 in a hospice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 14 October 2010.[1][50] Reacting to news of his death, mathematician Heinz-Otto Peitgen said: \"[I]f we talk about impact inside mathematics, and applications in the sciences, he is one of the most important figures of the last fifty years.\"[1]/nChris Anderson, TED conference curator, described Mandelbrot as \"an icon who changed how we see the world\".[51] Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France at the time of Mandelbrot's death, said Mandelbrot had \"a powerful, original mind that never shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions\u00a0[... h]is work, developed entirely outside mainstream research, led to modern information theory.\"[52] Mandelbrot's obituary in The Economist points out his fame as \"celebrity beyond the academy\" and lauds him as the \"father of fractal geometry\".[53]/nBest-selling essayist-author Nassim Nicholas Taleb has remarked that Mandelbrot's book The (Mis)Behavior of Markets is in his opinion \"The deepest and most realistic finance book ever published\".[10]", "34869154": "Zygmunt Wilhelm Birnbaum (18 October 1903 \u2013 15 December 2000), often known as Bill Birnbaum, was a Polish-American mathematician and statistician who contributed to functional analysis, nonparametric testing and estimation, probability inequalities, survival distributions, competing risks, and reliability theory./nAfter first earning a law degree and briefly practicing law, Birnbaum obtained his PhD in 1929 at the University of Lw\u00f3w under the supervision of Hugo Steinhaus, and was associated with the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics.

His earliest mathematical work was on conic sections; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines), establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.[8][9]/nLike his contemporary Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum in 1647./nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism.[10] Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pens\u00e9es, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascal's wager, known in the original as the Discourse on the Machine,[11][12] a fideistic probabilistic argument for God's existence. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids./nThroughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.[13]/nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, which is in France's Auvergne region, by the Massif Central. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.[14] His father, \u00c9tienne Pascal (1588\u20131651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte./nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife,[2] \u00c9tienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became a key member of the family. \u00c9tienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science./nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the Mystic Hexagram, Essai pour les coniques (Essay on Conics) and sent it \u2014 his first serious work of mathematics \u2014 to P\u00e8re Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line)./nPascal's work was so precocious that Ren\u00e9 Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"[15]/nIn France at that time offices and positions could be\u2014and were\u2014bought and sold. In 1631, \u00c9tienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres.[16] The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris, but in 1638 Cardinal Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly \u00c9tienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.[citation needed]/nLike so many others, \u00c9tienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that \u00c9tienne was pardoned. In time, \u00c9tienne was back in good graces with the Cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen\u2014a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos./nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.[17]/nAlthough these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.[18] He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.[19]/nPascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.\"[20] However, Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace./nIn 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9, he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities.[21] The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pens\u00e9es) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus.[22]/nPascal's Trait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique, written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal's triangle.[23][24] The triangle can also be represented:/nHe defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (m\u00a0+\u00a01)th row and (n\u00a0+\u00a01)th column tmn. Then tmn\u00a0=\u00a0tm\u20131,n\u00a0+\u00a0tm,n\u20131, for m\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... and n\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... The boundary conditions are tm,\u22121\u00a0=\u00a00, t\u22121,n\u00a0=\u00a00 for m\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... and n\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... The generator t00\u00a0=\u00a01. Pascal concluded with the proof,/nIn the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction.[23] In 1654, he proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p = 0, 1, 2, ..., k.[25]/nThat same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics./nIn 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.[citation needed]/nPascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by John Wallis and Antoine de Lalouv\u00e8re) were judged to be adequate.[26] While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren's proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis's Tractus Duo, giving Wren priority for the first published proof./nPascal contributed to several fields in physics, most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascal's law (an important principle of hydrostatics). He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.[27]/nHis work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment./nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum, i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space, rather than a vacuum. \"Nature abhors a vacuum.\" This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance, moved by another substance.[28] Furthermore, light passed through the glass tube, suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space./nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by R\u00e9cit de la grande exp\u00e9rience de l'\u00e9quilibre des liqueurs (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648./nThe Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de D\u00f4me mountain, 4,790 feet (1,460\u00a0m) tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it.[29] On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin P\u00e9rier, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by P\u00e9rier, reads:/nThe weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-D\u00f4me was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work.../n...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3+1\u20442 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time.../nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-D\u00f4me, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...[30]/nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines. He found with both experiments that an ascent of 7 fathoms lowers the mercury by half a line.[note 1] Note: Pascal used pouce and ligne for \"inch\" and \"line\", and toise for \"fathom\".[31]/nIn a reply to \u00c9tienne No\u00ebl, who believed in the plenum, Pascal wrote, echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"[32]/nBlaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.[33]/nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France, Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"[34] However treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors./nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year./nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648\u201354). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him./nSuddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.[35]/nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"[36]\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\"[37] With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty./nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.[38]/nOn the 23 of November, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.[39] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.[40]\nHis belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters./nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists./nBeginning in 1656\u201357, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments./nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau./nIt is in the Provincial Letters that Pascal made his oft-quoted apology for writing a long letter, as he had not had time to write a shorter one.\nFrom Letter XVI, as translated by Thomas M'Crie:\n'Reverend fathers, my letters were not wont either to be so prolix, or to follow so closely on\none another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter is\na very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.'/nCharles Perrault wrote of the Letters: \"Everything is there\u2014purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agr\u00e9ment not to be found anywhere else.\"[41]/nPascal is arguably best known as a philosopher, considered by some the second greatest French mind behind Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes.[42] However, he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology, empiricism, preferring fideism./nHe cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\".[43]/nPascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up\u2014first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true./nPascal also used De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes./nIn De l'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths./nMan is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed./nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pens\u00e9es (\"Thoughts\") is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language.[44] Will Durant hailed the Pens\u00e9es as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".[45]/nThe Pens\u00e9es was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chr\u00e9tienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pens\u00e9es de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic./nOne of the Apologie's main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God./nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\"[46]/nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, \u00c9crit sur la signature du formulaire (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the carrosses \u00e0 cinq sols, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation: The carriages had a fixed route, fixed price, and left even if there were no passengers.[47] It is widely considered that the idea of public transportation was well ahead of time. The lines were not commercially successful, and the last one closed by 1675.[48]/nIn 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont.[46]/nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two.[49] The headaches which affected Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.[citation needed]/nOne of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, France \u2013 Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal \u2013 is named after him. \u00c9tablissement scolaire fran\u00e7ais Blaise-Pascal in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after Pascal./nThe 1969 Eric Rohmer film My Night at Maud's is based on the work of Pascal. Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, Blaise Pascal, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971.[50] Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, Sea of Faith, presented by Don Cupitt.

Man is not the ultimate measure of man. Man becomes truly man only by passing beyond himself.

In particular, for a compact complex manifold \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n, an element of the Dolbeault cohomology group \n\n\n\n\nH\n\n1\n,\n1\n\n\n(\nX\n,\n\nR\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H^{1,1}(X,\\mathbb {R} )}\n\n is called pseudo-effective if it is represented by a closed positive (1,1)-current (where \"positive\" means \"nonnegative\" in this phrase), or big if it is represented by a strictly positive (1,1)-current; these definitions generalize the corresponding notions for holomorphic line bundles on projective varieties. Demailly's regularization theorem says, in particular, that any big class can be represented by a K\u00e4hler current with analytic singularities.[5]/nSuch analytic results have had many applications to algebraic geometry. In particular, Boucksom, Demailly, P\u0103un, and Peternell showed that a smooth complex projective variety \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n is uniruled if and only if its canonical bundle \n\n\n\n\nK\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K_{X}}\n\n is not pseudo-effective.[6]/nFor a singular metric on a line bundle, Nadel, Demailly, and Yum-Tong Siu developed the concept of the multiplier ideal, which describes where the metric is most singular. There is an analog of the Kodaira vanishing theorem for such a metric, on compact or noncompact complex manifolds.[7] This led to the first effective criteria for a line bundle on a complex projective variety \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n of any dimension \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n to be very ample, that is, to have enough global sections to give an embedding of \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n into projective space. For example, Demailly showed in 1993 that \n\n\n\n2\n\nK\n\nX\n\n\n+\n12\n\nn\n\nn\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2K_{X}+12n^{n}L}\n\n is very ample for any ample line bundle L, where addition denotes the tensor product of line bundles. The method has inspired later improvements in the direction of the Fujita conjecture.[8]/nDemailly used the technique of jet differentials introduced by Green and Phillip Griffiths to prove Kobayashi hyperbolicity for various projective varieties. For example, Demailly and El Goul showed that a very general complex surface \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n of degree at least 21 in projective space \n\n\n\n\n\nC\nP\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {CP} ^{3}}\n\n is hyperbolic; equivalently, every holomorphic map \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\u2192\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} \\to X}\n\n is constant.[9] For any variety \n\n\n\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X}\n\n of general type, Demailly showed that every holomorphic map \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\u2192\nX\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} \\to X}\n\n satisfies some (in fact, many) algebraic differential equations.[10]/nDemailly received the CNRS Bronze Medal in 1981,[2] the Prix Mergier-Bourdeix\u00a0[fr] from the French Academy of Sciences in 1994,[2][11] the Humboldt Prize in 1996,[2] the Simion Stoilow Prize from the Romanian Academy of Sciences in 2006,[2] the Stefan Bergman Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 2015,[2][4] and the Heinz Hopf Prize from ETH in 2021.[12]/nDemailly was elected a correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences in 1994 and then became a permanent member in 2007.[2][13] He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994 and a plenary speaker in 2006.[14]/nDemailly died on 17 March 2022.[15]", "58462234": "Toby Stephen Gee (born 2 January 1980) is a British mathematician working in number theory and arithmetic aspects of the Langlands Program.

The Art consists of a set of general principles and combinatorial operations. It is illustrated with diagrams./nA prolific writer, he is also known for his literary works written in Balearic Catalan, which he composed to make his Art accessible to a wider audience. In addition to Catalan and Latin, he also probably wrote in Arabic (although no texts in Arabic survive). His books were translated into Occitan, French, and Castilian during his lifetime.[4]/nAlthough his work did not enjoy huge success during his lifetime, he has had a rich and continuing reception. In the early modern period his name became associated with alchemical works.[5] More recently he has been recognized as a precursor of the modern liberal voting franchise, 450 years before Borda and Condorcet had proposed the idea and also the computer and a pioneer of computation theory.[2][6][7]/nLlull was born in  Palma into a wealthy family of Barcelona patricians who had come to the Kingdom of Majorca in 1229 with the conquering armies of James I of Aragon. James I had conquered the formerly Almohad-ruled Majorca as part of a larger move to integrate the territories of the  Balearic Islands (now part of Spain) into the Crown of Aragon. Llull was born there a few years later, in 1232 or 1233. Muslims still constituted a large part of the population of Majorca and Jews were present in cultural and economic affairs.[8]/nIn 1257 Llull married Blanca Picany\u00a0[ca], with whom he had two children, Domingo and Magdalena.[9][10] Although he formed a family, he lived what he would later call the licentious and worldly life of a troubadour./nIn 1263 Llull experienced a series of visions. He narrates the event in his autobiography Vita coaetanea (\"A Contemporary Life\"):/nRamon, while still a young man and Seneschal to the King of Majorca, was very given to composing worthless songs and poems and to doing other licentious things. One night he was sitting beside his bed, about to compose and write in his vulgar tongue a song to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love; and as he began to write this song, he looked to his right and saw our Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross, as if suspended in mid-air.[11]/nThe vision came to Llull five times in all and inspired in him three intentions: to give up his soul for the sake of God\u2019s love and honor, to convert the Saracens (i.e., Arabs and/or Muslims) to Christianity, and write the best book in the world against the errors of the unbelievers.[12]/nFollowing his visions he sold his possessions on the model of Saint  Francis of Assisi and set out on pilgrimages to the shrines of Saint Mary of Rocamadour, Saint James, and other places, never to come back to his family and profession. When he returned to Majorca he purchased a Muslim slave in order to learn Arabic from him.[13] For the next nine years, until 1274, he engaged in study and contemplation in relative solitude. He read extensively in both Latin and Arabic, learning both Christian and Muslim theological and philosophical thought.[14]/nIn 1270 Llull founded the hermitage of the Holy Trinity in Mallorca, known as Miramar. [15]/nBetween 1271 and 1274 Llull wrote his first works, a compendium of the Muslim thinker Al-Ghazali's logic and the Llibre de contemplaci\u00f3 en D\u00e9u (Book on the Contemplation of God), a lengthy guide to finding truth through contemplation./nIn 1274, while staying at a hermitage on Puig de Randa, the form of the great book Llull was to write was finally given to him through divine revelation: a complex system that he named his Art, which would become the motivation behind most of his life's efforts./nLlull urged the study of Arabic and other languages in Europe,[16] in order to convert Muslims and schismatic Christians.[17] He travelled through Europe to meet popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare future missionaries.[18] In 1276 a language school for Franciscan missionaries was founded at Miramar, funded by the King of Majorca.[19]/nAbout 1291 he went to Tunis, preached to the Saracens, disputed with them in philosophy, and after another brief sojourn in Paris, returned to the East as a missionary.[20] Llull travelled to Tunis a second time in about 1304, and wrote numerous letters to the king of Tunis, but little else is known about this part of his life.[21][22]/nHe returned in 1308, reporting that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force. He finally achieved his goal of linguistic education at major universities in 1311 when the Council of Vienne ordered the creation of chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean (Aramaic) at the universities of Bologna, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca as well as at the Papal Court.[21]/nLlull called for the expulsion of Jews who were unwilling to convert to Christianity, and influenced later European monarchs to expel Jews in practice.[23]/nIn 1314, at the age of 82, Llull traveled again to Tunis, possibly prompted by the correspondence between King James II of Aragon and al-Lihyani, the Hafsid caliph, indicating that the caliph wished to convert to Christianity. Whereas Llull had been met with difficulties during his previous visits to North Africa, he was allowed to operate this time without interference from the authorities due to the improved relations between Tunis and Aragon.[24]/nHis last work is dated December 1315 in Tunis. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. He probably died sometime between then and March 1316, either in Tunis, on the ship on the return voyage, or in Majorca upon his return.[25] Llull's tomb, created in 1448, is in the Franciscan church in Palma, Majorca.[26]/nLlull\u2019s Art (in Latin Ars) is at the center of his thought and undergirds his entire corpus. It is a system of universal logic based on a set of general principles activated in a combinatorial process. It can be used to prove statements about God and Creation (e.g., God is a Trinity). Often the Art formulates these statements as questions and answers (e.g., Q: Is there a Trinity in God? A: Yes.). It works cumulatively through an iterative process; statements about God's nature must be proved for each of His essential attributes in order to prove the statement true for God (i.e., Goodness is threefold, Greatness is threefold, Eternity is threefold, Power is threefold, etc.)./nWhat sets Llull's system apart is its unusual use of letters and diagrams, giving it an algebraic or algorithmic character. He developed the Art over the course of many decades, writing new books to explain each new version. The Art's trajectory can be divided into two main phases, although each phase contains numerous variations. The first is sometimes called the Quaternary Phase (1274 - 1290) and the second the Ternary Phase (1290 - 1308). This terminology was coined by Anthony Bonner.[27]/nThe two main works of the Quaternary Phase are the Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem (ca. 1274) and the Ars demonstrativa (ca. 1283).[28] The Ars demonstrativa has twelve main figures. A set of sixteen principles, or 'dignities' (divine attributes) comprise the general foundation for the system's operation. These are contained in the first figure (Figure A) and assigned letters (B through R). The rest of the figures enable the user to take these principles and elaborate to demonstrate the truth of statements. Figure T is important because it contains \"relational principles\"(i.e. minority, majority, equality), also assigned letters. The Art then lists combinations of letters as a sort of visual aid for the process of working through every possible combination of principles. Figure S displays the Augustinian powers of the soul (will, intellect, and memory) and their acts (willing, understanding, remembering). Figure S was eliminated from the Art after 1290. Even in subsequent versions of the Art Llull maintained that the powers of the soul needed to be in alignment for a proper operation of the Art. This differentiates Llull's system from Aristotelian logic. Because classical logic did not take the powers of the soul into account it was ill-equipped to handle theological issues, in Llull's view./nLlull inaugurated the Ternary Phase with two works written in 1290: the Ars inventiva veritatis and the Art amativa.[27] The culmination of this phase came in 1308 with a finalized version of the Art called the Ars generalis ultima. In the same year Llull wrote an abbreviated version called the Ars brevis. In these works Llull revised the Art to have only four main figures. He reduced the number of divine principles in the first figure to nine (goodness, greatness, eternity, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth, glory). Figure T also now has nine relational principles (difference, concordance, contrariety, beginning, middle, end, majority, equality, minority), reduced from fifteen. Llull kept the combinatorial aspect of the process./nLlull introduced an aspect of the system called the \"correlatives\" just before the final transition to the Ternary Phase. The correlatives first appear in a work called the Lectura super figuras Artis demonstrativae (c.1285-7) and came to undergird his formulation of the nature of being.[29] The doctrine of correlatives stipulates that everything, at the level of being, has a threefold structure: agent, patient, act. For example, the divine principle \"goodness\" consists of \"that which does good\" (agent), \"that which receives good\" (patient), and \"to do good\" (act). Llull developed a system of Latin suffixes to express the correlatives, i.e. bonitas (goodness); bonificans, bonificatus, bonificare. This became the basis for proving that the divine principles are distinct yet equivalent in God (each principle has the same underlying threefold structure, yet retains its own unique correlatives). This supports the combinatorial operation of the Art (i.e., this means that in God goodness is greatness and greatness is goodness, goodness is eternity and eternity is goodness, etc.), the Lullian proof of the Trinity (each divine principle has the three correlatives and together the principles comprise the Godhead, therefore the Godhead is threefold) and the Incarnation (the active and passive correlatives are equivalent to matter and form, and the trinitarian unfolding of being occurs on all levels of reality).[30]/nIt has been pointed out that the Art's combinatorial mechanics bear a resemblance to zairja, a device used by medieval Arab astrologers.[31][32] The Art's reliance on divine attributes also has a certain similarity to the contemplation of the ninety-nine Names of God in the Muslim tradition.[33] Llull's familiarity with the Islamic intellectual tradition is evidenced by the fact that his first work (1271-2) was a compendium of Al-Ghazali's logic.[34]/nFrom early in his career Llull composed dialogues to enact the procedure of the Art.[35] This is linked to the missionary aspect of the Art. Llull conceived it as an instrument to convert all peoples of the world to Christianity and experimented with more popular genres to make it easier to understand. His earliest and most well known dialogue is the Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men, written in Catalan the 1270s and later translated into Latin. It is framed as a meeting of three wise men (a Muslim, a Jew, and a Christian) and a Gentile in the woods. They learn about the Lullian method when they encounter a set of trees with leaves inscribed with Lullian principles. Lady Intelligence appears and informs them of the properties of the trees and the rules for implementing the leaves. The wise men use the trees to prove their respective Articles of Faith to the Gentile (although some of the Islamic tenets cannot be proved with the Lullian procedure) and in the end the Gentile is converted to Christianity. Llull also composed many other dialogues. Later in his career when he became concerned with heretical activity in the Arts Faculty of the University of Paris, he wrote \"disputations\" with philosophers as interlocutors.[36][37] He also created a character for himself and he stars in many of these dialogues as the Christian wise man (for instance: Liber de quaestione valde alta et profunda, composed in 1311)./nLlull structured many of his works around trees. In some, like the Book of the Gentile and the Three Wise Men, the \"leaves\" of the trees stand for the combinatorial elements (principles) of the Art. In other works a series of trees shows how the Art generates all (\"encyclopedic\") knowledge. The Tree of Science (1295-6) comprises sixteen trees ranging from earthly and moral to divine and pedagogical.[38] Each tree is divided into seven parts (roots, trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits). The roots always consist of the Lullian divine principles and from there the tree grows into the differentiated aspects of its respective category of reality.[39]/nLlull also wrote narrative prose drawing on the literary traditions of his time (epic, romance) to express the Art. These works were intended to communicate the potentially complex operations of the Art to a lay audience. Blanquerna (c.1276-83) is his most well known novel. Felix (1287-9) is also notable, although it was not widely circulated during his lifetime and was only available in Catalan. It is formulated as a sort of Bildungsroman in which Felix, the main character, begins on a journey at the instigation of his father who has written the \"Book of Wonders\". The book is divided into ten chapters (echoing the encyclopedic range of the Tree of Science) as Felix gains knowledge: God, angels, heavens, elements, plans, minerals, animals, man, Paradise, and Hell. It turns out to be a metafiction, as Felix's journey ends at a monastery where he relates the \"Book of Wonders\" now embellished and fused with the account of his own adventures.[40]/nAccording to Llull's autobiographical Vita, his Art was not received well at the University of Paris when he first presented it there in the 1280s. This experience supposedly is what led him to revise the Art (creating the tertiary version). Llull's Art was never adopted by mainstream academia of the thirteenth and early-fourteenth centuries, but it did accrue quite a bit of interest. A significant number of Lullian manuscripts were collected by the Carthusian monks of Paris at Vauvert and by several theologians who donated their manuscripts to the Sorbonne Library. One disciple, Thomas Le My\u00e9sier, went so far as to create elaborate compilations of Llull's works, including a manuscript dedicated to the queen of France.[41]/nIn the 1360s the inquisitor Nicholas Eymerich condemned Lullism in Aragon. He obtained a papal bull in 1376 to prohibit Lullian teaching, although it proved ineffective. In Paris Jean Gerson also issued a series of polemical writings against Lullism. There was an official document issued to prohibit the Lullian Art from being taught in the Faculty of Theology.[42]/nLlull's most significant early modern proponent was Nicholas of Cusa. He collected many works by Llull and adapted many aspects of Lullian thought for his own mystical theology.[43] There was also growing interest in Lullism in Catalonia, Italy, and France. Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples published eight of Llull's books in 1499, 1505, and 1516. Lef\u00e8vre was therefore responsible for the first significant circulation of Llull's work in print outside of Catalonia.[44] It is thought that the influence of Lullian works in Renaissance Italy (coinciding with the rise of neoplatonism) contributed to a development in metaphysics, from a static Artistotelian notion of being to reality as a dynamic process.[45] In Northern and Central Europe Lullism was adopted by Lutherans and Calvinists interested in promoting programs of theological humanism. Gottfried Leibniz was exposed to these currents during his years in Mainz, and Llull's Art clearly informed his De Arte Combinatoria.[46]/nThere is a significant body of alchemical treatises falsely attributed to Llull. The two fundamental works of the corpus are the Testamentum and the Liber de secretis naturae seu de quinta essentia which both date to the fourteenth century.[47] Occultists such as Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Giordano Bruno were inspired by these works.[48] Despite Llull's growing identification with alchemy and Neoplatonic mysticism, others (such as Giulio Pace and Johann Heinrich Alsted) were still interested in the Lullian Art as a universal logic, even in the seventeenth century when Descartes and Ramus proposed competing systems.[49]/nNumerous alchemical works have been attributed to Llull, but all of them are apocryphal.[50] Since the 19th century, historical criticism has been well established as to the pseudepigraphic nature of the entire corpus, which in total exceeds one hundred works.[51] Until the 1980s, historians of science thought that the oldest and most important texts were forgeries from the late 14th and early 15th centuries, with later additions. At the end of the 20th century, Professor Michela Pereira revealed an earlier textual matrix, dated around 1332, which has no pseudepigraphic intent in its genesis.[52] It is an original production by an unknown personage, whom Pereira calls magister Testamenti in reference to his most emblematic treatise. His original works would tentatively be the Testamentum, Vademecum (Codicillus); Liber lapidarii (=Lapidarius abbreviatus); Liber de intentione alchimistarum; Scientia de sensibilibus (=Ars intelectiva; Ars m\u00e1gica); Tratatu de aquis medicinalius (=De secretis naturae early versions); De lapide maiori (=Apertorium); Questionario; Liber experimentorum and an early version of the Compendium animae transmutationis metallorum (=Compendium super lapidum; Lapidarium). To this primordial nucleus other writings would have been added in the course of time./nHis contribution completely changed the way of analysing this germinal group of treatises, since for the first time it was revealed to us with concrete data that we were not dealing with conscious forgeries, but with original works, which transmit the ideas, the personality and the biographical data of a real alchemist. After compiling information about this personage based on what he explains, both in his Testamentum and in the other writings he cites as his own, he has been identified with a man called Raymundus de Terminis (cat. Ramon de T\u00e8rmens).[53] He would have been a Mallorcan who exercised the office of eques or miles, trained as a magister in artibus or in legibus. These types of people usually occupied administrative, mercantile jurisdiction, diplomatic or public order posts. He also had a knowledge of medicine, especially related to surgery, having trained in Montpellier. His activity is documented on the island of Corfu and in Albanian towns. He was a dancer in Berat and Vlor\u00eb, or in commercial operations for Robert I of Naples and Philip I of Taranto in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas./nAmong his best known works is the Liber de secretis natura sive de quinta essentia. Ramon de T\u00e9rmens himself was the author of several early versions or strata of this work from 1330-1332. However, the best known format, since it was the only one printed until now, is a pseudepigraphic recension dated around 1360-1380 and produced in a Catalan milieu, where some forgers endorsed the work to Ramon Llull.[54]/nMeanwhile, in Spain, the Cardinal Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros, Archbishop of Toledo, had taken up Lullism for his project of reform. Cisneros mobilized various intellectuals and editors, founding chairs at universities and publishing Llull's works.[55] Founded in 1633, the Pontifical College of La Sapiencia on Majorca became the epicenter for teaching Lullism. The Franciscans from La Sapiencia were the ones to seek Llull's canonization at Rome in the seventeenth century. These efforts were renewed in the eighteenth century, but never succeeded.[56] Llull was beatified in 1847 by Pope Pius IX. His feast day was assigned to 30 June and is celebrated by the Third Order of St. Francis.[57]/nLlull is now recognized by scholars as significant in both the history of Catalan literature as well as intellectual history. From 1906 to 1950 the Comissi\u00f3 Editora Lul\u00b7liana led a project to edit Llull's works written in Catalan. This series was called the Obres de Ramon Llull (ORL). In 1957 the Raimundus-Lullus-Institut was founded in Freiburg, Germany to begin the work of editing Llull's Latin works. This series is called the Raimundi Lulli Opera Latina (ROL) and is still ongoing.[58] In 1990 the work on the Catalan texts was restarted with the Nova Edici\u00f3 de les Obres de Ramon Llull (NEORL).[59] In the world of English-language scholarship the work of Frances Yates on memory systems (The Art of Memory, published 1966) brought new interest to Ramon Llull as a figure in the history of cognitive systems./nLlull has appeared in the art and literature of the last century, especially in the genres of surrealism, philosophical fantasy, and metafiction. Salvador Dal\u00ed's alchemical thought was influenced by Ramon Llull and Dal\u00ed incorporated the diagrams from the Lullian Art into his work called Alchimie des Philosophes.[60] In 1937 Jorge Luis Borges wrote a snippet called \"Ramon Llull' s Thinking Machine\" proposing the Lullian Art as a device to produce poetry.[61]\nOther notable references to Ramon Llull are: Aldous Huxley's short story \"The Death of Lully\", a fictionalized account aftermath of Llull's stoning in Tunis, set aboard the Genoese ship that returned him to Mallorca.[62] Paul Auster refers to Llull (as Raymond Lull) in his memoir The Invention of Solitude in the second part, The Book of Memory. Llull is also a major character in The Box of Delights, a children's novel by poet John Masefield./nLlull's Art is sometimes recognized as a precursor to computer science and computation theory.[63]\nWith the discovery in 2001 of his lost manuscripts, Ars notandi, Ars eleccionis, and Alia ars eleccionis, together known as Ars Magna (what today would be called a logical system to discover some sort of truth),[64] Llull is also given credit for creating an electoral system now known as the Borda count and Condorcet criterion, which Jean-Charles de Borda and Nicolas de Condorcet independently proposed centuries later.[65]", "45617206": "Ruel Vance Churchill (12 December 1899, Akron, Indiana \u2013 31 October 1987, Ann Arbor, Michigan) was an American mathematician known for writing three widely used textbooks on applied mathematics.[1]/nIn 1922 Churchill received his undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago.

His father, Nikolai Anderson, was professor in Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Kazan.[2] His older brothers were the folklorist Walter Anderson and the astrophysicist Wilhelm Anderson.[3]/nOskar Anderson graduated from Kazan Gymnasium with a gold medal in 1906. After studying mathematics for one year at the University of Kazan, he moved to St. Petersburg to study economics at the Polytechnic Institute.[4][5] From 1907 to 1915, he was Aleksandr Chuprov's student and assistant. In 1912 he married Margarethe Natalie von Hindenburg-Hirtenberg,[1] a granddaughter of Wilhelm Paul von Hindenburg-Hirtenberg\u00a0[ru][6] who was commemorated in \"The Funeral of 'The Universal Man'\" in Dostoyevsky's A Writer's Diary, and started lecturing at a commercial school in St. Petersburg while also studying for a law degree at the University of Saint Petersburg, graduating in 1914.[1]/nIn 1918 he took on a professorship in Kiev but he was forced to flee Russia in 1920 due to the Russian Revolution, first taking a post in Budapest (Hungary) before becoming a professor at the University of Economics at Varna (Bulgaria) in 1924./nAnderson was one of the charter members of the Econometric Society,[7] whose members also elected him to be a fellow of the society in 1933.[8][7] In the same year he also received a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation.[9]/nSupported by the foundation, in 1935 he established and became director of the Statistical Institute for Economic Research at the University of Sofia.[10] For the remainder of the decade he also served the League of Nations as an associate member of its Committee of Statistical Experts.[11]/nIn 1942 he joined the Kiel Institute for the World Economy as head of the Department of Eastern Studies and also took up a full professorship of statistics at the University of Kiel,[1] where he was joined by his brother Walter after the end of the second world war.

He was raised in Billingham, County Durham, where he attended Stockton Secondary School, and went to St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1942. He won the Drury Prize in 1943 for his work in Mathematical Tripos.[3][4]/nAfter graduation, with the Second World War still on-going, Stewartson began employment with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. During his time there he studied compressible fluid flow problems. After the war he returned to Cambridge and received the Mayhew Prize in 1946. He resumed research under the guidance of Leslie Howarth on boundary layer theory. His research led to his first publication, \"Correlated incompressible and compressible boundary layers\", which was published by the Royal Society in 1949. He received his doctorate the same year and became a lecturer at Bristol University in 1950. In 1953 he went to the United States to become a lecturer at the California Institute of Technology for a year before returning to Bristol University. In 1958 he was awarded a chair at the University of Durham. After finding Durham University too conservative, he moved to University College, London in 1964. In his time there, he studied rotating fluid flows, shear layers, magnetohydrodynamics, triple-deck theory, and Reynolds number. He played major role in the founding of Institute of Mathematics and its Applications along with James Lighthill.[5] In his career he authored 186 papers.[3][4]/nNatural convection boundary-layers along horizontal plate also known as the indirect convection was first explained by Stewartson in 1958.[6]/nStewartson was known as a passionate rower and enjoyed theatre and opera. In 1950, he married Jean Forrester; they had three children. In 1965, he became a member of the Royal Society. In 1974, he suffered a heart attack which he recovered from, before suffering a subsequent one in 1983 which hospitalized him.[7] Two weeks later he had a third heart attack which proved fatal.[3][4]", "4163": "Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS[7] (18 May 1872 \u2013 2 February 1970) was a British mathematician, philosopher, and public intellectual. He had a considerable influence on mathematics, linguistics, cognitive science, and various areas of analytic philosophy.[8][9]/nHe was one of the early 20th century's most prominent logicians[9] and a founder of analytic philosophy, along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, his friend and colleague G. E. Moore, and his student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein. Russell with Moore led the British \"revolt against idealism\".[b] Together with his former teacher A. N. Whitehead, Russell wrote Principia Mathematica, a milestone in the development of classical logic and a major attempt to reduce the whole of mathematics to logic (see Logicism). Russell's article \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\".[11]/nRussell was a pacifist who championed anti-imperialism and chaired the India League.[12][13][14]  He went to prison for his pacifism during World War I,[15] but also saw the war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany as a necessary \"lesser of two evils\". In the wake of World War II, he welcomed American global hegemony in favour of either Soviet hegemony or no (or ineffective) world leadership, even if it were to come at the cost of using their nuclear weapons.[16] He would later criticise Stalinist totalitarianism, condemn the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, and become an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.[17]/nIn 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\".[18][19] He was also the recipient of the De Morgan Medal (1932), Sylvester Medal (1934), Kalinga Prize (1957), and Jerusalem Prize (1963)./nBertrand Arthur William Russell was born at Ravenscroft, a country house in Trellech, Monmouthshire,[a] on 18 May 1872, into an influential and liberal family of the British aristocracy.[20][21] His parents, Viscount and Viscountess Amberley, were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor,[22][23] the biologist Douglas Spalding. Both were early advocates of birth control at a time when this was considered scandalous.[24] Lord Amberley was a deist, and even asked the philosopher John Stuart Mill to act as Russell's secular godfather.[25] Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life./nHis paternal grandfather, Lord John Russell, later 1st Earl Russell (1792\u20131878), had twice been prime minister in the 1840s and 1860s.[26] A member of Parliament since the early 1810s, he met with Napoleon Bonaparte in Elba.[27] The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the Tudor dynasty (see: Duke of Bedford). They established themselves as one of the leading Whig families and participated in every great political event from the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536\u20131540 to the Glorious Revolution in 1688\u20131689 and the Great Reform Act in 1832.[26][28]/nLady Amberley was the daughter of Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley.[17] Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother,[29] one of the campaigners for education of women.[30]/nRussell had two siblings: brother Frank (nearly seven years older), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874, Russell's mother died of diphtheria, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of bronchitis after a long period of depression.[citation needed] Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of staunchly Victorian paternal grandparents, who lived at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. His grandfather, former Prime Minister Earl Russell, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the Countess Russell (n\u00e9e Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.[17][24]/nThe Countess was from a Scottish Presbyterian family and successfully petitioned the Court of Chancery to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting Darwinism and supporting Irish Home Rule), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. Her favourite Bible verse, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil\",[31] became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings./nRussell's adolescence was lonely and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests in \"nature and books and (later) mathematics saved me from complete despondency;\"[32] only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.[33] He was educated at home by a series of tutors.[34] When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of Euclid, which he described in his autobiography as \"one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love\".[35][36]/nDuring these formative years he also discovered the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Russell wrote: \"I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy.\"[37] Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of Christian religious dogma, which he found unconvincing.[38] At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's Autobiography, he abandoned the \"First Cause\" argument and became an atheist.[39][40]/nHe travelled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, Edward FitzGerald, and with FitzGerald's family he visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and climbed the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.[41]/nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and began his studies there in 1890,[42] taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.[43][44]/nRussell was 17 years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of Alys Pearsall Smith, an American Quaker five years older, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia.[45][46] He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family. They knew him primarily as \"Lord John's grandson\" and enjoyed showing him off.[47]/nHe soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while cycling, that he no longer loved her.[48] She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell,[49] and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.[50]/nDuring his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson.[51] Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S. Eliot.[52]/nRussell began his published work in 1896 with German Social Democracy, a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the London School of Economics.[53] He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.[54]/nHe now started an intensive study of the foundations of mathematics at Trinity. In 1897, he wrote An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (submitted at the Fellowship Examination of Trinity College) which discussed the Cayley\u2013Klein metrics used for non-Euclidean geometry.[55] He attended the First International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900 where he met Giuseppe Peano and Alessandro Padoa. The Italians had responded to Georg Cantor, making a science of set theory; they gave Russell their literature including the Formulario mathematico. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon Russell's paradox. In 1903 he published The Principles of Mathematics, a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of logicism, that mathematics and logic are one and the same.[56]/nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing Whitehead's wife's acute suffering in an angina attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the Buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"[57]/nIn 1905, he wrote the essay \"On Denoting\", which was published in the philosophical journal Mind. Russell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908.[7][17] The three-volume Principia Mathematica, written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier The Principles of Mathematics, soon made Russell world-famous in his field. Russell's first political activity was as  the Independent Liberal candidate in the 1907 by-election for the Wimbledon constituency, where he was not elected.[58]/nIn 1910, he became a University of Cambridge lecturer at Trinity College, where he had studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was \"anti-clerical\", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student Ludwig Wittgenstein, who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in 1922.[59] Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of World War I. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp at the end of the conflict./nDuring World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities. In 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914.[61] He later described this, in Free Thought and Official Propaganda, as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression. Russell championed the case of Eric Chappelow, a poet jailed and abused as a conscientious objector.[62] Russell played a significant part in the Leeds Convention in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand \"anti-war socialists\" gather; many being delegates from the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement.[63] The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour Members of Parliament (MPs), including Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, as well as former Liberal MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor Arnold Lupton. After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, \"to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody\".[64][65]/nHis conviction in 1916 resulted in Russell being fined \u00a3100 (equivalent to \u00a36,000 in 2021), which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped \"Confiscated by Cambridge Police\"./nA later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the United States to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in Brixton Prison (see Bertrand Russell's political views) in 1918 (he was prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act[66])[67] He later said of his imprisonment:/nI found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, \"Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy\"... and began the work for \"The Analysis of Mind\". I was rather interested in my fellow-prisoners, who seemed to me in no way morally inferior to the rest of the population, though they were on the whole slightly below the usual level of intelligence as was shown by their having been caught.[68]/nWhile he was reading Strachey's Eminent Victorians chapter about Gordon he laughed out loud in his cell prompting the warder to intervene and reminding him that \"prison was a place of punishment\".[69]/nRussell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer in 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.[70]/nIn 1924, Russell again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been an MP and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\".[71]/nIn 1941, G. H. Hardy wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled Bertrand Russell and Trinity \u2013 published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by C. D. Broad\u2014in which he gave an authoritative account of Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation./nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an \"unusual application\" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered with Russell's resignation, since the 'world of learning' knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the Tarner Lectures on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best-received books according to Hardy: The Analysis of Matter, published in 1927.[72] In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:/nI wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet.... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him./nIn August 1920, Russell travelled to Soviet Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution.[73] He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled \"Soviet Russia\u20141920\", for the magazine The Nation.[74][75] He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an \"impish cruelty\" in him and comparing him to \"an opinionated professor\". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He subsequently wrote a book, The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism,[76] about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the Soviet regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he had heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure that these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.[citation needed]/nRussell's lover Dora Black, a British author, feminist and socialist campaigner, visited Soviet Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.[76]/nThe following year, Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited Peking (as Beijing was then known outside of China) to lecture on philosophy for a year.[34] He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as then being on a new path.[77] Other scholars present in China at the time included John Dewey[78] and Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Nobel-laureate poet.[34] Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with pneumonia, and incorrect reports of his death were published in the Japanese press.[78] When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading \"Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists\".[79][80] Apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully.[citation needed][81][82]/nDora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell, born on 16 November 1921, and Katharine Jane Russell (later Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics, and education to the layman./nFrom 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and Cornwall, spending summers in Porthcurno.[83] In the 1922 and 1923 general elections Russell stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Chelsea constituency, but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was unsuccessful on both occasions./nAfter the birth of his two children, he became interested in education, especially early childhood education. He was not satisfied with the old traditional education and thought that progressive education also had some flaws;[84] as a result, together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near Harting, West Sussex. During this time, he published On Education, Especially in Early Childhood. On 8 July 1930, Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.[85][86]/nIn 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later Barry Stevens), who became a well-known Gestalt therapist and writer in later years.[87] They developed an intense relationship, and in Fox's words: \"...\u00a0for three years we were very close.\"[88] Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School.[89] From 1927 to 1932 Russell wrote 34 letters to Fox.[90] Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell./nRussell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.[86] They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an Oxford undergraduate named Patricia (\"Peter\") Spence, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the Liberal Democrat party.[17]/nRussell returned in 1937 to the London School of Economics to lecture on the science of power.[53] During the 1930s, Russell became a friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon, then President of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian independence.[14] Russell chaired the India League from 1932 to 1939.[91]/nRussell's political views changed over time, mostly about war. He opposed rearmament against Nazi Germany. In 1937, he wrote in a personal letter: \"If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister.\"[92] In 1940, he changed his appeasement view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare called \"relative political pacifism\": \"War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.\"[93][94]/nBefore World War II, Russell taught at the University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy.[95] He was appointed professor at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him \"morally unfit\" to teach at the college because of his opinions, especially those relating to sexual morality, detailed in Marriage and Morals (1929). The matter was however taken to the New York Supreme Court by Jean Kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY.[95][96] Many intellectuals, led by John Dewey, protested at his treatment.[97] Albert Einstein's oft-quoted aphorism that \"great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to Morris Raphael Cohen, a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment.[98] Dewey and Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in The Bertrand Russell Case. Russell soon joined the Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of A History of Western Philosophy. His relationship with the eccentric Albert C. Barnes soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.[99]/nRussell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly The Brains Trust and for the Third Programme, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in Trondheim, Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an aeroplane crash in Hommelvik in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.[100][101] A History of Western Philosophy (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life./nIn 1942, Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles. In an inquiry on dialectical materialism, launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher Wolfgang Paalen in his journal DYN, Russell said: \"I think the metaphysics of both Hegel and Marx plain nonsense\u2014Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than Mary Baker Eddy's. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.\"[102]/nIn 1943, Russell expressed support for Zionism: \"I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to Jews to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture\".[103]/nIn a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atomic bombs on both sides.[104][105] At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a first strike in a war with the USSR, including Nigel Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.[100]/nJust after the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did.[106] In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that the USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practised in the Soviet Union.[107] After it became known that the USSR had carried out its nuclear bomb tests, Russell declared his position advocating the total abolition of atomic weapons.[106]/nIn 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural Reith Lectures[108]\u2014what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled Authority and the Individual,[109] explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to Words and Things by Ernest Gellner, which was highly critical of the later thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy. Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind, which caused Russell to respond via The Times. The result was a month-long correspondence in The Times between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.[110]/nIn the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the Order of Merit,[111] and the following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.[17][34] When he was given the Order of Merit, George VI was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, \"You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted\".[112] Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply \"That's right, just like your brother\" immediately came to mind./nIn 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a CIA-funded anti-communist organisation committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the Cold War.[113] Russell was one of the best-known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956.[114]/nIn 1952, Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy.[citation needed] Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother). Russell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious mental illness, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.[citation needed]/nIn 1962 Russell played a public role in the Cuban Missile Crisis: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.[115][116] Russell sent this telegram to President Kennedy:/nYOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.[117]/nAccording to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's assassination, Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included Michael Foot MP, Caroline Benn, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\" Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the Warren Commission Report was published, setting forth 16 Questions on the Assassination and equating the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late 19th-century France, in which the state convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.[118]/nBertrand Russell was opposed to war from a young age; his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic./nHe later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in Free Thought and Official Propaganda, where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously \"bad\", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:/nThe opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them. But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.[119]/nRussell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the Vietnam War. The 1955 Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.[120] In October 1960 \"The Committee of 100\" was formed with a declaration by Russell and Michael Scott, entitled \"Act or Perish\", which called for a \"movement of nonviolent resistance to nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction\".[121] In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in Brixton Prison for a \"breach of the peace\" after taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to \"good behaviour\", to which Russell replied: \"No, I won't.\"[122][123]/nIn 1966\u20131967, Russell worked with Jean-Paul Sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period./nEarly in his life Russell supported eugenicist policies. He proposed in 1894 that the state issue certificates of health to prospective parents and withhold public benefits from those considered unfit.[124] In 1929 he wrote that people deemed \"mentally defective\" and \"feebleminded\" should be sexually sterilised because they \"are apt to have enormous numbers of illegitimate children, all, as a rule, wholly useless to the community.\"[125] Russell was also an advocate of population control:[126][127]/nThe nations which at present increase rapidly should be encouraged to adopt the methods by which, in the West, the increase of population has been checked. Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation. There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion, the other is nationalism. I think it is the duty of all to proclaim that opposition to the spread of birth is appalling depth of misery and degradation, and that within another fifty years or so. I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer. War, as I remarked a moment ago, has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could be spread throughout the whole world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full./nOn 20 November 1948, in a public speech at Westminster School, addressing a gathering arranged by the New Commonwealth, Russell shocked some observers by suggesting that a preemptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union was justified. Russell argued that war between the United States and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, so it would be a humanitarian gesture to get it over with quickly and have the United States in the dominant position. Currently, Russell argued, humanity could survive such a war, whereas a full nuclear war after both sides had manufactured large stockpiles of more destructive weapons was likely to result in the extinction of the human race. Russell later relented from this stance, instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers./nIn 1956, immediately before and during the Suez Crisis, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the Suez Canal area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the Hungarian Revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which Michael Polanyi had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had entered Budapest.[128]/nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in The Observer, proposing a cessation of all nuclear weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles.[129]/nRussell was asked by The New Republic, a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear weapons testing and flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs, with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the Oder-Neisse line as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing Arab nationalism, and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the People's Republic of China, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.[129]/nHe was in contact with Lionel Rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film Good Times, Wonderful Times in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the New Left. In early 1963, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the Vietnam War, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-genocidal. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the Jerusalem Prize, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.[130] In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the Arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.[131] In October 1965 he tore up his Labour Party card because he suspected Harold Wilson's Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.[17]/nIn June 1955, Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in Penrhyndeudraeth, Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.[132]/nRussell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. He made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war Hindi film Aman, by Mohan Kumar, which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.[133]/nOn 23 November 1969, he wrote to The Times newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in Czechoslovakia was \"highly alarming\". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The following month, he protested to Alexei Kosygin over the expulsion of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Union of Writers./nOn 31 January 1970, Russell issued a statement condemning \"Israel's aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the War of Attrition, which he compared to German bombing raids in the Battle of Britain and the US bombing of Vietnam. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-Six-Day War borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in Cairo on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.[134]/nRussell died of influenza, just after 8\u00a0pm on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth, aged 97.[135] His body was cremated in Colwyn Bay on 5 February 1970 with five people present.[136] In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony but one minute's silence; his ashes were later scattered over the Welsh mountains.[137] Although he was born in Monmouthshire, and died in Penrhyndeudraeth in Wales, Russell identified as English.[138][139][140] Later in 1970, on 23 October, his will was published showing he had left an estate valued at \u00a369,423 (equivalent to \u00a31.1\u00a0million in 2021).[137] In 1980, a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher A. J. Ayer. It consists of a bust of Russell in Red Lion Square in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.[141]/nLady Katharine Jane Tait, Russell's daughter, founded the Bertrand Russell Society in 1974 to preserve and understand his work. It publishes the Bertrand Russell Society Bulletin, holds meetings and awards prizes for scholarship, including the Bertrand Russell Society Award.[142][143] She also authored several essays about her father; as well as a book, My Father, Bertrand Russell, which was published in 1975.[144] All members receive Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies./nFor the sesquicentennial of his birth, in May 2022, McMaster University's Bertrand Russell Archive, the university's largest and most heavily used research collection, organised both a physical and virtual exhibition on Russell's anti-nuclear stance in the post-war era, Scientists for Peace: the Russell-Einstein Manifesto and the Pugwash Conference, which included the earliest version of the Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto.[145] The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation held a commemoration at Conway Hall in Red Lion Square, London, on 18 May, the anniversary of his birth.[146] For its part, on the same day, La Estrella de Panam\u00e1 published a biographical sketch by Francisco D\u00edaz Montilla, who commented that \"[if he] had to characterize Russell's work in one sentence [he] would say: criticism and rejection of dogmatism.\"[147]/nBangladesh's first leader, Mujibur Rahman, named his youngest son Sheikh Russel in honour of Bertrand Russell./nRussell first married Alys Whitall Smith (died 1951) in 1894. The marriage was dissolved in 1921 with no issue. His second marriage was to Dora Winifred Black MBE (died 1986), daughter of Sir Frederick Black, in 1921. This was dissolved in 1935, having produced two children:/nRussell's third marriage was to Patricia Helen Spence (died 2004) in 1936, with the marriage producing one child:/nRussell's third marriage ended in divorce in 1952. He married Edith Finch in the same year. Finch survived Russell, dying in 1978.[148]/nRussell held throughout his life the following styles and honours:/nRussell is generally credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy. He was deeply impressed by Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except aesthetics. He was particularly prolific in the fields of metaphysics, logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, ethics and epistemology. When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".[149]/nOn ethics, Russell wrote that he was a utilitarian in his youth, yet he later distanced himself from this view.[150]/nFor the advancement of science and protection of liberty of expression, Russell advocated The Will to Doubt, the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:/nNone of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.\nEvery man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men's attitude is tentative and full of doubt.[119]/nRussell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic or an atheist: he found it difficult to determine which term to adopt, saying:/nTherefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line.[151]/nFor most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the British Humanist Association and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.[152]/nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. He was a prominent campaigner against Western intervention into the Vietnam War in the 1960s, writing essays, books, attending demonstrations, and even organising the Russell Tribunal in 1966 alongside other prominent philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, which fed into his 1967 book War Crimes in Vietnam.[153]/nRussell argued for a \"scientific society\", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.[154] He suggested the establishment of a \"single supreme world government\" able to enforce peace,[155] claiming that \"the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation\".[156] He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.[157][158] As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.[159] Russell also expressed support for guild socialism, and commented positively on several socialist thinkers and activists.[160] According to Jean Bricmont and Normand Baillargeon, \"Russell was both a liberal and a socialist, a combination that was perfectly comprehensible in his time, but which has become almost unthinkable today. He was a liberal in that he opposed concentrations of power in all its manifestations, military, governmental, or religious, as well as the superstitious or nationalist ideas that usually serve as its justification. But he was also a socialist, even as an extension of his liberalism, because he was equally opposed to the concentrations of power stemming from the private ownership of the major means of production, which therefore needed to be put under social control (which does not mean state control).\"[161]/nRussell was an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A. E. Dyson's 1958 letter to The Times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.[162]/nHe expressed sympathy and support for the Palestinian people and was strongly critical of Israel's actions. He wrote in 1960 that, \"I think it was a mistake to establish a Jewish State in Palestine, but it would be a still greater mistake to try to get rid of it now that it exists.\"[163] In his final written document, read aloud in Cairo three days after his death on 31 January 1970, he condemned Israel as an aggressive imperialist power, which \"wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. Every new conquest becomes the new basis of the proposed negotiation from strength, which ignores the injustice of the previous aggression.\" In regards to the Palestinian people and refugees, he wrote that, \"No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate? A permanent just settlement of the refugees in their homeland is an essential ingredient of any genuine settlement in the Middle East.\"[164]/nRussell advocated \u2013 and was one of the first people in the UK to suggest[165] \u2013 a universal basic income.[166] In his 1918 book Roads to Freedom, Russell wrote that \"Anarchism has the advantage as regards liberty, Socialism as regards the inducement to work.\u00a0 Can we not find a method of combining these two advantages?\u00a0It seems to me that we can. [...] Stated in more familiar terms, the plan we are advocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income \u2013 as much larger as might be warranted by the total amount of commodities produced \u2013 should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful...When education is finished, no one should be compelled to work, and those who choose not to work should receive a bare livelihood and be left completely free.\"[167]/nIn \"Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday\" (\"Postscript\" in his Autobiography), Russell wrote: \"I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken\".[168]/nRussell was a champion of freedom of opinion and an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination. In 1928, he wrote: \"The fundamental argument for freedom of opinion is the doubtfulness of all our belief... when the State intervenes to ensure the indoctrination of some doctrine, it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favour of that doctrine ... It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions make it impossible to make a living\".[169] In 1957, he wrote: \"'Free thought' means thinking freely ... to be worthy of the name freethinker he must be free of two things: the force of tradition and the tyranny of his own passions.\"[170]/nRussell has presented ideas on the possible means of control of education in case of scientific dictatorship governments, of the kind of this excerpt taken from chapter II \"General Effects of Scientific Technique\" of \"The Impact of Science on society\":[171]/nThis subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship. Anaxagoras maintained that snow is black, but no one believed him. The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark grey. Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen. As yet there is only one country which has succeeded in creating this politician's paradise. The social effects of scientific technique have already been many and important, and are likely to be even more noteworthy in the future. Some of these effects depend upon the political and economic character of the country concerned; others are inevitable, whatever this character may be./nHe pushed his visionary scenarios even further into details, in the chapter III \"Scientific Technique in an Oligarchy\" of the same book,[172] stating as an example:/nIn future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship. Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will tell them that they are so./nBelow are selected Russell's works in English, sorted by year of first publication:/nRussell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles.[203][204] Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors, ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Hobhouse, allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of conscientious objectors.[205]/nHis works can be found in anthologies and collections, including The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, which McMaster University began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes,[206] and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications.

His publications covered many areas including neighbouring group effects, reactive intermediates, sulfamic acids and halogenation.

Following a campaign on his behalf, he became a member of University College Cork's governing board from 1967 to 1973. During this time, he helped to fund many key physical developments. Scott was pivotal in the appointment of professors Joe Cunningham (of physical chemistry) and Brian Hathaway (of inorganic chemistry). He taught not only in his own field of organic chemistry, but also in the wider scientific world.[2]/nIn the Cork area, Scott ran a series of major international conferences. The first, sponsored by The Royal Society of Chemistry in July 1964, was on organic reaction mechanisms; it attracted over 600 international devotees of industry and academia.

He graduated from ETH Zurich with a Masters in Theoretical Physics in 1992 and continued studying in Zurich for a PhD in Mathematics, which he obtained in 1997. In 1998, Batchelor joined United Medical and Dental School, which later became part of King's College London (KCL), to work on the application of mathematical principles to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Guy's Hospital. He rapidly made an impact by employing concepts from differential geometry to study folding and curvature in the developing human brain.[1] In 2005 he moved to the Centre for Medical Image Computing at University College London, and was appointed a Senior Lecturer in the Imaging Sciences Division at KCL in 2006./nHe gained a reputation for an ability to get to the heart of the issue and to draw in knowledge from other areas. A good example of this came during his work on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In trying to quantify the shapes of fibre tracts seen in DTI, he found measures that focussed on shape, not brain size.[2][3] Furthermore, these measures were inspired from such varied fields as torsion and polymer structure analysis and even the orbits of asteroids. In 2002, the choice of which diffusion gradient directions to acquire in diffusion tensor imaging was the subject of debate in the literature, with various empirical approaches having been proposed. At its core, this was a problem that combined the geometry related to the equal distribution of points on a hemisphere (the diffusion directions) and the diffusion-attenuated signal in MRI. Batchelor showed why direction schemes based on icosahedral shapes are optimal, and provided proof that the noise propagation in these icosahedral direction schemes was closely related to the best that could ever be done by acquiring an infinite number of directions./nThere was also the issue of how to manipulate the tensor data from DTI.  In one of his most highly cited papers,[4] Batchelor provided a rigorous framework that showed how to measure the geodesic distance between tensors (always maintaining an ellipsoid shape), how to average them, how to perform interpolation and rotation and he devised a metric called the geodesic anisotropy \u2013 an alternative to the commonly used fractional anisotropy measure./nAnother key insight came from considering the key problem of how to correct non-rigid liver motion in MRI. Batchelor had the insight that this highly non-linear process could nonetheless be expressed concisely and in a general form using matrices.[5] This has opened the field of non-rigid motion correction in MRI (e.g.[6])./nBatchelor was a committed teacher and was always willing to patiently assist his colleagues and students with tutorials in mathematics. He recognised the need for education within the medical imaging academic community and in 2007 he organised a highly successful \"Maths for Medical Imaging\" summer school, which has since formed the basis of an ongoing component of the King's College Medical Physics MSc./nHis scope of research extended further including the visionary aim of producing diffusion tensor reconstructions of the beating heart. He and his group were the first to present 3D fibre images of the in-vivo heart of humans.[7] Compressed sensing also attracted his interest more recently.

He was latterly known as the person who broke the American diplomatic O-2 cypher, a variant of the M-138-A strip cipher during 1943.[2] Rohrbach wrote a report on the breaking of the strip cypher when he was captured by TICOM, the allied effort to roundup and seize captured German intelligence people and material.[3]/nHans Rohrbach was a son of journalist Paul Rohrbach and his wife Clara (n\u00e9e M\u00fcller), who were married in Berlin in 1897. There was always confusion around Rohrbachs' name; one source gives his full name as Hans Joachim Albert Rohrbach, while the mathematician Bernhard Neumann believed this full name to be Hans Wolfgang Rohrbach, and was sure his middle initial was a 'W'./nRohrbach entered the Gymnasium (school) at Berlin-Friedenau in the autumn of 1909 and studied there until Autumn 1917. He then entered the Fichte Gymnasium in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. After having successfully passed the school leaving exam in 1921, he entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy for two years. In 1923, as a head of the Berlin student organization Mathematisch-Physikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft (Mathematics and Physics Working Group), he went with his father to the United States. The visit, which Rohrbach called his propaganda visit, was a tour of American universities to raise money for impoverished Berlin students. Germany's economy, which was undergoing a period of hyperinflation, was making life extremely difficult for students, who had to take employment to supplement their income./nIn the autumn of 1924 Rohrbach resumed his studies at the University of Berlin and studied there until 1929. In the late 1920s he started work on his PhD thesis, titled Die Charaktere der bin\u00e4ren Kongruenzgruppen mod p2 (The characters of the binary congruence groups mod p2), advised by Issai Schur. He submitted it and was awarded his doctorate on 25 July 1932.[1]/nWhile studying at Berlin University, Rohrbach met fellow student Rose Gadebusch (born 1905),[1] who studied mathematics starting in 1925. Gadebusch took a major role in the Mathematisch-Physikalische Arbeitsgemeinschaft. After graduation she took a position at the Women's Gymnasium. Rohrbach married her sometime around 1932.[1]/nIn 1936, Rohrbach was appointed senior assistant at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1937, he undertook his habilitation there with a thesis paper titled Ein Beitrag zur additiven Zahlentheorie nebst einer Anwendung auf eine Gruppentheoretische Frage (A contribution to additive number theory together with an application on a group theoretical question).[4]/nOn 1 April 1938 he was appointed as a senior assistant at the Mathematical Institute of the German University of Prague. In 1941 he was promoted to extraordinary professor and in 1942 he became an ordinary professor. He also served as Director of the Mathematical Institute there.[1][5]/nRohrbach was a member of the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (the party's original paramilitary wing, later superseded by the SS), but was considered not fully reliable due to his friendship with Jewish colleagues.[6]/nAfter the war ended, Rohrbach was not allowed to teach for a number of reasons. However, he held an appointment as Visiting Professor in the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Science at the University of Mainz, 1946\u20131951. From 1951 to 1957 he was Extraordinary Professor in the Faculty of Science at Mainz, and was later dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, 1954\u20131958. He was then Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics between 1957 and 1969. While undertaking all these roles, he was appointed Director of the Department of Mathematics at Mainz, a position he held from 1958 until 1970.[4]/nBetween 24 November 1966 and 1967 he was Rector of the University of Mainz.[4] Between July 1967 \u2013 1977, he was a director of advisory center for student life issues at the University of Mainz. He was also an editor of Crelle's Journal, 1952\u20131977, assisting Helmut Hasse.[1] He held this chair until he retired as professor emeritus in 1977./nHans Rohrbachs time was split between work with an academic focus, and work involving the military. During his time of doctorate in the very early 1930s, he published several solutions to mathematical problems that were set by the Jahresbericht (Annual Report) of the German Mathematical Society.[1] In 1931, he published a solution to Problem 66, in 1932 a solution followed to Problem 84 and Problem 89 was also solved in 1932.[1]/nIn 1937, Rohrbach introduced a mathematical puzzle, which was a variation of James Joseph Sylvester's stamp puzzle:/nIn 1937, he formulated in his paper Ein Beitrag zur additiven Zahlentheorie (A contribution to the additive number theory) a related problem, which he considered much more difficult:/nHere are some examples from Mactutor, which have been copied verbatim to ensure mathematical accuracy:/nWithin the paper, Rohrbach find asymptotic bounds for n with h fixed and k large. This is a problem many mathematicians have looked at but have not been solved yet./nIt was while Rohrbach was at the Mathematical Institute of the German University of Prague, starting in 1933 as a senior assistant.  In 1944, he wrote a report, of which this is an exert:/nThe work undertaken by Rohrbach was related to the computational problems associated with the manufacture and flight of V-weapons. The research and prototyping experimental work was undertaken at the village of Peenem\u00fcnde.  The scientists detailed in Rohrbach report above were Dr Gerhard Gentzen, Dr Franz Krammer and Dr Paul Armsen./nThe other major area that Hans Rohrbach contributed to the German war effort was as working as Cryptanalyst  in the Mathematical and Cryptological Section of the special section of unit Z (The cryptanalysts) in the Reich Foreign Office (German: Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt) known as Pers Z S.[7][8][9]/nHe was awarded the War Service Cross 2nd Class (KVK II) in September 1944, for his work on the solution of the U.S. Diplomatic Strip System O-2./nRohrbach had originally broken the cipher in 1943 after working on it for more than a year. The cipher was used by the US state department for diplomatic traffic, and the US Navy from 1940 to 1944. Rohrbach and his team used Hollerith punched card machinery and also built a special decoding machine called Automaton to aid cryptanalysis of the cipher. The Americans who made up the TICOM Team that investigated Pers Z S, ordered Rohrbach to write a report on 6 August 1945, in the form of homework to describe the process. The report was formulated as TICOM document I-89.[10]/nThis is the introduction to the report:/nHere is how Hans Rohrbach split his work between academia and the military:[1]/nWhile working at the Mathematical Institute Rohrbach managed to have several mathematicians join his group in Prague, to undertake and assist in war work.[1] Friedrich Bauer wrote about Hans Rohrbach[11]/nOne of the people that Rohrbach saved was the mathematician Ernst Max Mohr from execution. On 12 May 1944 Mohr was arrested by the Gestapo along with his wife, at the B\u00e9ranek Hotel in Prague. On 24 October 1944, his case was heard before the People's Court, the accusation was to listen to enemy foes, to denigrate Hitler and for expressing defeatism. He is said to have described the war as already lost, the destruction of the Jews as a mistake.  His work was important for the war, especially the Luftwaffe. He was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to death, but intervention by Rohrbach and Alexander Nikuradse resulted in his death sentence being suspended for six months; he was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, later on 18 December 1944 to the Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison where he continued to undertake Mathematical calculations for the V-weapon programs. He survived the war.[1]/nRohrbach's assistants Franz Krammer and Paul Armsen were also rescued by Rohrbach. Krammer had been rescued in May 1944 in, he wrote,/nArmsen was appointed by Rohrbach first as his assistant, later as a special lecturer.[citation needed]/nRohrbach and his wife became missionary Christians after the war. Rohrbach became president of the Studentenmission in Deutschland an organization setup to spread Christian values in schools and universities.[1] He published a number of books which espoused his Christian values.

The terms of the polynomial could be computed using modular exponentiation. DARPA was satisfied with the hash function, and also allowed Purdy to publish it in Communications of the ACM. It was well received around the world, and DEC eventually used it in their OpenVMS operating system. A DEC report said they chose it because it was very secure and because the existing standard DES could not be exported, which meant that an alternative was needed.[4][5] OpenVMS[6] uses a 64-bit version, based on a 64-bit prime, the same size as the one in the paper./nWhile at Texas A&M, Purdy made an empirical observation about distances between points on two lines.

In the 1950s, Nash discovered and proved the Nash embedding theorems by solving a system of nonlinear partial differential equations arising in Riemannian geometry. This work, also introducing a preliminary form of the Nash\u2013Moser theorem, was later recognized by the American Mathematical Society with the Leroy P.

His father and namesake, John Forbes Nash Sr., was an electrical engineer for the Appalachian Electric Power Company. His mother, Margaret Virginia (n\u00e9e Martin) Nash, had been a schoolteacher before she was married. He was baptized in the Episcopal Church.[8] He had a younger sister, Martha (born November 16, 1930).[9]/nNash attended kindergarten and public school, and he learned from books provided by his parents and grandparents.[9] Nash's parents pursued opportunities to supplement their son's education, and arranged for him to take advanced mathematics courses at a local community college (Bluefield College) during his final year of high school. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology (which later became Carnegie Mellon University) through a full benefit of the George Westinghouse Scholarship, initially majoring in chemical engineering. He switched to a chemistry major and eventually, at the advice of his teacher John Lighton Synge, to mathematics.  After graduating in 1948, with both a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics, Nash accepted a fellowship to Princeton University, where he pursued further graduate studies in mathematics and sciences.[9]/nNash's adviser and former Carnegie professor Richard Duffin wrote a letter of recommendation for Nash's entrance to Princeton stating, \"He is a mathematical genius.\"[10][11] Nash was also accepted at Harvard University. However, the chairman of the mathematics department at Princeton, Solomon Lefschetz, offered him the John S. Kennedy fellowship, convincing Nash that Princeton valued him more.[12] Further, he considered Princeton more favorably because of its proximity to his family in Bluefield.[9] At Princeton, he began work on his equilibrium theory, later known as the Nash equilibrium.[13]/nNash did not publish extensively, although many of his papers are considered landmarks in their fields.[14] As a graduate student at Princeton, he made foundational contributions to game theory and real algebraic geometry. As a postdoctoral fellow at MIT, Nash turned to differential geometry. Although the results of Nash's work on differential geometry are phrased in a geometrical language, the work is almost entirely to do with the mathematical analysis of partial differential equations.[15] After proving his two isometric embedding theorems, Nash turned to research dealing directly with partial differential equations, where he discovered and proved the De Giorgi\u2013Nash theorem, thereby resolving one form of Hilbert's nineteenth problem./nIn 2011, the National Security Agency declassified letters written by Nash in the 1950s, in which he had proposed a new encryption\u2013decryption machine.[16] The letters show that Nash had anticipated many concepts of modern cryptography, which are based on computational hardness.[17]/nNash earned a PhD in 1950 with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.[18][19] The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. A version of his thesis was published a year later in the Annals of Mathematics.[20] In the early 1950s, Nash carried out research on a number of related concepts in game theory, including the theory of cooperative games.[21] For his work, Nash was one of the recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994./nIn 1949, while still a graduate student, Nash found a new result in the mathematical field of real algebraic geometry.[22] He announced his theorem in a contributed paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1950, although he had not yet worked out the details of its proof.[23] Nash's theorem was finalized by October 1951, when Nash submitted his work to the Annals of Mathematics.[24] It had been well-known since the 1930s that every closed smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to the zero set of some collection of smooth functions on Euclidean space. In his work, Nash proved that those smooth functions can be taken to be polynomials.[25] This was widely regarded as a surprising result,[22] since the class of smooth functions and smooth manifolds is usually far more flexible than the class of polynomials. Nash's proof introduced the concepts now known as Nash function and Nash manifold, which have since been widely studied in real algebraic geometry.[25][26] Nash's theorem itself was famously applied by Michael Artin and Barry Mazur to the study of dynamical systems, by combining Nash's polynomial approximation together with B\u00e9zout's theorem.[27][28]/nDuring his postdoctoral position at MIT, Nash was eager to find high-profile mathematical problems to study.[29] From Warren Ambrose, a differential geometer, he learned about the conjecture that any Riemannian manifold is isometric to a submanifold of Euclidean space. Nash's results proving the conjecture are now known as the Nash embedding theorems, the second of which Mikhael Gromov has called \"one of the main achievements of mathematics of the twentieth century\".[30]/nNash's first embedding theorem was found in 1953.[29] He found that any Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space by a continuously differentiable mapping.[31] Nash's construction allows the codimension of the embedding to be very small, with the effect that in many cases it is logically impossible that a highly-differentiable isometric embedding exists. (Based on Nash's techniques, Nicolaas Kuiper soon found even smaller codimensions, with the improved result often known as the Nash\u2013Kuiper theorem.) As such, Nash's embeddings are limited to the setting of low differentiability. For this reason, Nash's result is somewhat outside the mainstream in the field of differential geometry, where high differentiability is significant in much of the usual analysis.[32][33]/nHowever, the logic of Nash's work has been found to be useful in many other contexts in mathematical analysis. Starting with work of Camillo De Lellis and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00e9kelyhidi, the ideas of Nash's proof were applied for various constructions of turbulent solutions of the Euler equations in fluid mechanics.[34][35] In the 1970s, Mikhael Gromov developed Nash's ideas into the general framework of convex integration,[33] which has been (among other uses) applied by Stefan M\u00fcller and Vladim\u00edr \u0160ver\u00e1k to construct counterexamples to generalized forms of Hilbert's nineteenth problem in the calculus of variations.[36]/nNash found the construction of smoothly differentiable isometric embeddings to be unexpectedly difficult.[29] However, after around a year and a half of intensive work, his efforts succeeded, thereby proving the second Nash embedding theorem.[37] The ideas involved in proving this second theorem are largely separate from those used in proving the first. The fundamental aspect of the proof is an implicit function theorem for isometric embeddings. The usual formulations of the implicit function theorem are inapplicable, for technical reasons related to the loss of regularity phenomena. Nash's resolution of this issue, given by deforming an isometric embedding by an ordinary differential equation along which extra regularity is continually injected, is regarded as a fundamentally novel technique in mathematical analysis.[38] Nash's paper was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in 1999, where his \"most original idea\" in the resolution of the loss of regularity issue was cited as \"one of the great achievements in mathematical analysis in this century\".[15] According to Gromov:[30]/nYou must be a novice in analysis or a genius like Nash to believe anything like that can be ever true and/or to have a single nontrivial application./nDue to J\u00fcrgen Moser's extension of Nash's ideas for application to other problems (notably in celestial mechanics), the resulting implicit function theorem is known as the Nash\u2013Moser theorem. It has been extended and generalized by a number of other authors, among them Gromov, Richard Hamilton, Lars H\u00f6rmander, Jacob Schwartz, and Eduard Zehnder.[33][38] Nash himself analyzed the problem in the context of analytic functions.[39] Schwartz later commented that Nash's ideas were \"not just novel, but very mysterious,\" and that it was very hard to \"get to the bottom of it.\"[29] According to Gromov:[30]/nNash was solving classical mathematical problems, difficult problems, something that nobody else was able to do, not even to imagine how to do it. ...\u00a0 what Nash discovered in the course of his constructions of isometric embeddings is far from 'classical'\u00a0\u2013 it is something that brings about a dramatic alteration of our understanding of the basic logic of analysis and differential geometry. Judging from the classical perspective, what Nash has achieved in his papers is as impossible as the story of his life\u00a0... [H]is work on isometric immersions\u00a0... opened a new world of mathematics that stretches in front of our eyes in yet unknown directions and still waits to be explored./nWhile spending time at the Courant Institute in New York City, Louis Nirenberg informed Nash of a well-known conjecture in the field of elliptic partial differential equations.[40] In 1938, Charles Morrey had proved a fundamental elliptic regularity result for functions of two independent variables, but analogous results for functions of more than two variables had proved elusive. After extensive discussions with Nirenberg and Lars H\u00f6rmander, Nash was able to extend Morrey's results, not only to functions of more than two variables, but also to the context of parabolic partial differential equations.[41] In his work, as in Morrey's, uniform control over the continuity of the solutions to such equations is achieved, without assuming any level of differentiability on the coefficients of the equation. The Nash inequality was a particular result found in the course of his work (the proof of which Nash attributed to Elias Stein), which has been found useful in other contexts.[42][43][44][45]/nSoon after, Nash learned from Paul Garabedian, recently returned from Italy, that the then-unknown Ennio De Giorgi had found nearly identical results for elliptic partial differential equations.[40] De Giorgi and Nash's methods had little to do with one another, although Nash's were somewhat more powerful in applying to both elliptic and parabolic equations. A few years later, inspired by De Giorgi's method, J\u00fcrgen Moser found a different approach to the same results, and the resulting body of work is now known as the De Giorgi\u2013Nash theorem or the De Giorgi\u2013Nash\u2013Moser theory (which is distinct from the Nash\u2013Moser theorem). De Giorgi and Moser's methods became particularly influential over the next several years, through their developments in the works of Olga Ladyzhenskaya, James Serrin, and Neil Trudinger, among others.[46][47] Their work, based primarily on the judicious choice of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations, is in strong contrast to Nash's work, which is based on analysis of the heat kernel. Nash's approach to the De Giorgi\u2013Nash theory was later revisited by Eugene Fabes and Daniel Stroock, initiating the re-derivation and extension of the results originally obtained from De Giorgi and Moser's techniques.[42][48]/nFrom the fact that minimizers to many functionals in the calculus of variations solve elliptic partial differential equations, Hilbert's nineteenth problem (on the smoothness of these minimizers), conjectured almost sixty years prior, was directly amenable to the De Giorgi\u2013Nash theory. Nash received instant recognition for his work, with Peter Lax describing it as a \"stroke of genius\".[40] Nash would later speculate that had it not been for De Giorgi's simultaneous discovery, he would have been a recipient of the prestigious Fields Medal in 1958.[9] Although the medal committee's reasoning is not fully known, and was not purely based on questions of mathematical merit,[49] archival research has shown that Nash placed third in the committee's vote for the medal, after the two mathematicians (Klaus Roth and Ren\u00e9 Thom) who were awarded the medal that year.[50]/nAlthough Nash's mental illness first began to manifest in the form of paranoia, his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash thought that all men who wore red ties were part of a communist conspiracy against him. He mailed letters to embassies in Washington, D.C., declaring that they were establishing a government.[4][51] Nash's psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an American Mathematical Society lecture at Columbia University in early 1959. Originally intended to present proof of the Riemann hypothesis, the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong.[52]/nIn April 1959, Nash was admitted to McLean Hospital for one month. Based on his paranoid, persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and increasing asociality, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.[53][54] In 1961, Nash was admitted to the New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton.[55] Over the next nine years, he spent intervals of time in psychiatric hospitals, where he received both antipsychotic medications and insulin shock therapy.[54][56]/nAlthough he sometimes took prescribed medication, Nash later wrote that he did so only under pressure. According to Nash, the film A Beautiful Mind inaccurately implied he was taking atypical antipsychotics. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter who was worried about the film encouraging people with mental illness to stop taking their medication.[57]/nNash did not take any medication after 1970, nor was he committed to a hospital ever again.[58] Nash recovered gradually.[59]  Encouraged by his then former wife, de Lard\u00e9, Nash lived at home and spent his time in the Princeton mathematics department where his eccentricities were accepted even when his mental condition was poor. De Lard\u00e9 credits his recovery to maintaining \"a quiet life\" with social support.[4]/nNash dated the start of what he termed \"mental disturbances\" to the early months of 1959, when his wife was pregnant. He described a process of change \"from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as 'schizophrenic' or 'paranoid schizophrenic'\".[9] For Nash, this included seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function of some kind, of having supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, along with a feeling of being persecuted and searching for signs representing divine revelation.[60] During his psychotic phase, Nash also referred to himself in the third person as \"Johann von Nassau\".[61] Nash suggested his delusional thinking was related to his unhappiness, his desire to be recognized, and his characteristic way of thinking, saying, \"I wouldn't have had good scientific ideas if I had thought more normally.\" He also said, \"If I felt completely pressureless I don't think I would have gone in this pattern\".[62]/nNash reported that he started hearing voices in 1964, then later engaged in a process of consciously rejecting them.[63]  He only renounced his \"dream-like delusional hypotheses\" after a prolonged period of involuntary commitment in mental hospitals\u2014\"enforced rationality\". Upon doing so, he was temporarily able to return to productive work as a mathematician. By the late 1960s, he relapsed.[64]  Eventually, he \"intellectually rejected\" his \"delusionally influenced\" and \"politically oriented\" thinking as a waste of effort.[9]  In 1995, he said that he did not realize his full potential due to nearly 30 years of mental illness.[65]/nNash wrote in 1994:/nI spent times of the order of five to eight months in hospitals in New Jersey, always on an involuntary basis and always attempting a legal argument for release. And it did happen that when I had been long enough hospitalized that I would finally renounce my delusional hypotheses and revert to thinking of myself as a human of more conventional circumstances and return to mathematical research. In these interludes of, as it were, enforced rationality, I did succeed in doing some respectable mathematical research. Thus there came about the research for \"Le probl\u00e8me de Cauchy pour les \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles d'un fluide g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\"; the idea that Prof. [Heisuke] Hironaka called \"the Nash blowing-up transformation\"; and those of \"Arc Structure of Singularities\" and \"Analyticity of Solutions of Implicit Function Problems with Analytic Data\"./nBut after my return to the dream-like delusional hypotheses in the later 60s I became a person of delusionally influenced thinking but of relatively moderate behavior and thus tended to avoid hospitalization and the direct attention of psychiatrists./nThus further time passed. Then gradually I began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation. This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of politically oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of intellectual effort. So at the present time I seem to be thinking rationally again in the style that is characteristic of scientists.[9]/nIn 1978, Nash was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize for his discovery of non-cooperative equilibria, now called Nash Equilibria. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize in 1999./nIn 1994, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (along with John Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten) for his game theory work as a Princeton graduate student.[66] In the late 1980s, Nash had begun to use email to gradually link with working mathematicians who realized that he was the John Nash and that his new work had value. They formed part of the nucleus of a group that contacted the Bank of Sweden's Nobel award committee and were able to vouch for Nash's mental health and ability to receive the award.[67]/nNash's later work involved ventures in advanced game theory, including partial agency, which show that, as in his early career, he preferred to select his own path and problems. Between 1945 and 1996, he published 23 scientific papers./nNash has suggested hypotheses on mental illness. He has compared not thinking in an acceptable manner, or being \"insane\" and not fitting into a usual social function, to being \"on strike\" from an economic point of view. He advanced views in evolutionary psychology about the potential benefits of apparently nonstandard behaviors or roles.[68]/nNash criticized Keynesian ideas of monetary economics which allowed for a central bank to implement monetary policies.[69] He proposed a standard of \"Ideal Money\" pegged to an \"industrial consumption price index\" which was more stable than \"bad money.\" He noted that his thinking on money and the function of monetary authority paralleled that of economist Friedrich Hayek.[70][69]/nNash received an honorary degree, Doctor of Science and Technology, from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999, an honorary degree in economics from the University of Naples Federico II in 2003,[71] an honorary doctorate in economics from the University of Antwerp in 2007, an honorary doctorate of science from the City University of Hong Kong in 2011,[1] and was keynote speaker at a conference on game theory.[72] Nash also received honorary doctorates from two West Virginia colleges: the University of Charleston in 2003 and West Virginia University Tech in 2006. He was a prolific guest speaker at a number of events, such as the Warwick Economics Summit in 2005, at the University of Warwick./nNash was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2006[73] and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.[74]/nOn May 19, 2015, a few days before his death, Nash, along with Louis Nirenberg, was awarded the 2015 Abel Prize by King Harald V of Norway at a ceremony in Oslo.[75]/nIn 1951, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) hired Nash as a C. L. E. Moore instructor in the mathematics faculty. About a year later, Nash began a relationship with Eleanor Stier, a nurse he met while admitted as a patient. They had a son, John David Stier,[1] but Nash left Stier when she told him of her pregnancy.[76] The film based on Nash's life, A Beautiful Mind, was criticized during the run-up to the 2002 Oscars for omitting this aspect of his life. He was said to have abandoned her based on her social status, which he thought to have been beneath his.[77]/nIn Santa Monica, California, in 1954, while in his twenties, Nash was arrested for indecent exposure in a sting operation targeting gay men.[78] Although the charges were dropped, he was stripped of his top-secret security clearance and fired from RAND Corporation, where he had worked as a consultant.[79]/nNot long after breaking up with Stier, Nash met Alicia Lard\u00e9 Lopez-Harrison, a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador. Lard\u00e9 graduated from MIT, having majored in physics.[9] They married in February 1957. Although Nash was an atheist,[80] the ceremony was performed in an Episcopal church.[81] In 1958, Nash was appointed to a tenured position at MIT, and his first signs of mental illness soon became evident. He resigned his position at MIT in the spring of 1959.[9] His son, John Charles Martin Nash, was born a few months later. The child was not named for a year[1] because Alicia felt that Nash should have a say in choosing the name. Due to the stress of dealing with his illness, Nash and Lard\u00e9 divorced in 1963. After his final hospital discharge in 1970, Nash lived in Lard\u00e9's house as a boarder. This stability seemed to help him, and he learned how to consciously discard his paranoid delusions.[82] Princeton allowed him to audit classes. He continued to work on mathematics and was eventually allowed to teach again. In the 1990s, Lard\u00e9 and Nash resumed their relationship, remarrying in 2001. John Charles Martin Nash earned a PhD in mathematics from Rutgers University and was diagnosed with schizophrenia as an adult.[81]/nOn May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike in Monroe Township, New Jersey while returning home from receiving the Abel Prize in Norway.[83][84] At the time of his death, Nash was a longtime resident of New Jersey. He was survived by two sons, John Charles Martin Nash, who lived with his parents at the time of their death, and elder child John Stier.[85]/nFollowing his death, obituaries appeared in scientific and popular media throughout the world. In addition to their obituary for Nash,[86] The New York Times published an article containing quotes from Nash that had been assembled from media and other published sources. The quotes consisted of Nash's reflections on his life and achievements.[87]/nAt Princeton in the 1970s, Nash became known as \"The Phantom of Fine Hall\"[88] (Princeton's mathematics center), a shadowy figure who would scribble arcane equations on blackboards in the middle of the night./nHe is referred to in a novel set at Princeton, The Mind-Body Problem, 1983, by Rebecca Goldstein.[4]/nSylvia Nasar's biography of Nash, A Beautiful Mind, was published in 1998. A film by the same name was released in 2001, directed by Ron Howard with Russell Crowe playing Nash; it won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. For his performance as Nash, Crowe won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama at the 59th Golden Globe Awards and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor at the 55th British Academy Film Awards. Crowe was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Nash at the 74th Academy Awards./nFour of Nash's game-theoretic papers (Nash\u00a01950a, 1950b, 1951, 1953) and three of his pure mathematics papers (Nash\u00a01952b, 1956, 1958) were collected in the following:", "73666737": "Tilemann Stella (c. 1525-1589) was a German mathematician.[1][2]/nTilemann was born as Tilemann Stoltz in 1525 in Siegen.[3] He studied at the Latin school in Siegen before attending the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, the University of Marburg, and the University of Cologne.[3] He was taught by mathematicians such as Johannes Dryander and Erasmus Reinhold.[1] Stella became a close student of Philipp Melanchthon, who entrusted him with creating cartographic representations for biblical studies. He created maps of the Holy Land, Exodus route, and Germany, with plans for further maps that were never completed.[1]/nIn 1552, John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg started funding his work.[1] He began mapping Mecklenburg and made a celestial globe in 1555.[1] In 1560, he was employed as a court mathematician and librarian in Schwerin.[1] He documented his travels with Duke Johann Albrecht and created further maps in Mecklenburg, including planning and supervising the construction of a canal between D\u00f6mitz and Wismar.[1] He also charted Mansfeld and Luxembourg for the Counts of Mansfeld and created maps for Duke Wolfgang von Pfalz-Zweibr\u00fccken.[1]/nFollowing Duke Johann Albrecht's death in 1576, Stella's connection with Mecklenburg weakened, and he worked for the courts of Saxony and Brandenburg-Ansbach.[1] Around 1582, he entered the service of Duke John I of Palatinate-Zweibr\u00fccken, becoming the head of the court library and planning a canal between the Rhine and Saar.

He participated in Napoleon's expedition into Egypt (1798 to 1801) and was a member of the mathematics section of the Institut d'\u00c9gypte. Malus became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in 1810. In 1810 the Royal Society of London awarded him the Rumford Medal./nHis mathematical work was almost entirely concerned with the study of light. He studied geometric systems called ray systems, closely connected to Julius Pl\u00fccker's line geometry. He conducted experiments to verify Christiaan Huygens's theories of light and rewrote the theory in analytical form. His discovery of the polarization of light by reflection was published in 1809 and his theory of double refraction of light in crystals, in 1810./nMalus attempted to identify the relationship between the polarising angle of reflection that he had discovered, and the refractive index of the reflecting material. While he deduced the correct relation for water, he was unable to do so for glasses due to the low quality of materials available to him (the refractive index of most glasses available at that time varied between the surface and the interior of the glass). It was not until 1815 that Sir David Brewster was able to experiment with higher quality glasses and correctly formulate what is known as Brewster's law. This law was later explained theoretically by Augustin Fresnel, as a special case of his Fresnel equations./nMalus is probably best remembered for Malus's law, giving the resultant intensity, when a polariser is placed in the path of an incident beam. A follower of Laplace, both his statement of the Malus's law and his earlier works on polarisation and birefringence were formulated using the corpuscular theory of light.[1]/nHis name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower./nIn 1810, Malus, while engaged on the theory of double refraction, casually examined through a doubly refracting prism of quartz the sunlight reflected from the windows of the Luxembourg palace. He was surprised to find that the two rays alternately disappeared as the prism was rotated through successive right angles, in other words, that the reflected light had acquired properties exactly corresponding to those of the rays transmitted through Iceland spar./nHe named this phenomenon polarization, and thought it could not be explained by wave theory of light. Instead, he explained it by stating that light-corpuscules have polarity (like magnetic poles).[2]/nMalus mathematically analyzed the properties of a system of continuous light rays in three dimensions. He found the equation of caustic surfaces and the Malus theorem: Rays of light that are emitted from a point source, after which they have been reflected on a surface, are all normal to a common surface, but after the second refraction they no longer have this property. If the perpendicular surface is identified with a wave front, it is obvious that this result is false, which Malus did not realize because he adhered to Newton's theory of light emission, and Malus's theorem was not proved until 1824 by W.

Domninus is said to have corrupted the doctrines of Plato by mixing up with them his private opinions.

The Manual of Introductory Arithmetic was a concise and well arranged overview of the theory of numbers. It covered numbers, proportions and means.

Bulmer-Thomas believe that it was written, at least in part, by Domninus, but Heath casts some doubt on the authorship by stating that if it wasn't written by Domninus then it at least comes from the same period as him.[3]  Domninus may have also written a work entitled Elements of Arithmetic as referred to near the end of his Manual of Introductory Arithmetic, although whether or not he ever wrote this book is unknown.", "7409868": "Mary Celine Fasenmyer, RSM (October 4, 1906, Crown, Pennsylvania \u2013 December 27, 1996, Erie, Pennsylvania) was an American mathematician and Catholic religious sister.

It gave Trinity \"a fresh impetus in its career and usefulness\".[2] Another source described him as 'clever but very lazy'.[3]/nMacDonnell was said to have had 'an excellent dry sense of humour', demonstrated on one occasion when showing a lady around the impressive Trinity College Library, Dublin. She, clasping her hands together, exclaimed, 'Oh Mr. Provost, pray Mr. Provost, have you read all these books?', to which he replied, 'in time my dear lady, in time'. On another occasion, after the plates had been cleared between the courses of a dinner he was hosting, his butler quietly placed a sugar cube on his bald head. Engaging his guests on a serious subject, his parrot would by then have flown into the dining room and seated itself on the Provost's head to eat the sugar cube, as the Provost continued with his philosophical musings, giving the impression of being completely unfazed./nMacDonnell had inherited Knocklyon House near Dalkey, but after his mother died there the previous year, in 1837 he leased it out and bought a plot of land by the sea front at Dalkey, where he built a new country retreat, Sorrento Cottage, now owned by The Edge of the Irish rock band U2. Named after Sorrento on the Bay of Naples, the allure of Sorrento Terrace is its situation and the view across Killiney Bay to the Wicklow Mountains, the Great Sugar Loaf taking the place of Mount Vesuvius./nIn the early 1840s, MacDonnell devised a plan for the construction of 22 houses right into the corner near the boundaries of the cottage, a huge undertaking at the time that was stalled almost immediately due to the Great Famine \u2013 the family having decided to help those around them rather than themselves. In 1845, the family had built the first and largest of the terrace residences, 'Sorrento House', and then MacDonnell leased the rest of the land to his son, Hercules Henry Graves MacDonnell, who from the 1850s built the remaining houses at a price of \u00a31,000 each. The family stipulated that each house had to adhere strictly to the design of architects Frederick Darley and Nathaniel Montgomery. The houses today are known as 'millionaire's row', famous for being the most expensive row of houses in Ireland.[4]/nIn 1810, Richard MacDonnell married Jane Graves, daughter of the Very Rev. Richard Graves, and sister of Robert James Graves. They were the parents of fourteen children, including Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell and Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell.

Thrasyllus was an astrologer and a personal friend of the Roman emperor Tiberius,[4] as mentioned in the Annals by Tacitus and The Twelve Caesars by Suetonius./nThrasyllus[6] was a Greek Egyptian from unknown origins, as his family and ancestors were contemporaries that lived under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. He originally was either from Mendes or Alexandria. Thrasyllus is often mentioned in various secondary sources as coming from Alexandria (as mentioned in the Oxford Classical Dictionary) as no primary source confirms his origins./nThrasyllus encountered Tiberius during the period of Tiberius' voluntary exile on the Greek island of Rhodes, some time between 1 BC and 4 AD.[1] Thrasyllus became the intimate and celebrated servant of Tiberius, and Tiberius developed an interest in Stoicism and astrology from Thrasyllus.[1]/nHe predicted that Tiberius would be recalled to Rome and officially named the successor to Augustus. When Tiberius returned to Rome, Thrasyllus accompanied him and remained close to him.[7] During the reign of the emperor Tiberius, Thrasyllus served as his skilled Court Astrologer both in Rome and, later, in Capri.[4] As Tiberius held Thrasyllus in the highest honor, he rewarded him for his friendship by giving Roman citizenship to him and his family.[1]/nThe daughter-in-law of Tiberius, his niece Livilla, reportedly consulted Thrasyllus during her affair with Sejanus, Tiberius' chief minister. Thrasyllus persuaded Tiberius to leave Rome for Capri while clandestinely supporting Sejanus. The grandson-in-law of Thrasyllus, Naevius Sutorius Macro, carried out orders that destroyed Sejanus, whether with Thrasyllus\u2019 knowledge is unknown. He remained on Capri with Tiberius, advising the Emperor on his relationship with the various claimants to his succession. Thrasyllus was an ally[8] who favored Tiberius\u2019 great-nephew Caligula, who was having an affair with his granddaughter, Ennia Thrasylla.[2]/nIn 36 AD, Thrasyllus is said to have made Tiberius believe he would survive another ten years.[8] With this false prediction, Thrasyllus saved the lives of a number of Roman nobles who would be suspected in falsely plotting against Tiberius. Tiberius, believing in Thrasyllus, was confident that he would outlive any plotters, and so failed to act against them. Thrasyllus predeceased Tiberius, so did not live to see the realization of his prediction that Caligula would succeed Tiberius./nThrasyllus by profession was a grammarian (i.e. literary scholar).[4] He edited the written works of Plato and Democritus. According to the Encyclopaedia Judaica, he wrote that the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt took place in 1690 BC. The sections include, Dedumose I, Ipuwer Papyrus and Shiphrah./nHe was the author of an astrological text titled Pinax or Table,[4] which is lost but has been summarized in later sources, such as: CCAG - Catalogue of the Codices of the Greek astrologers (8/3: 99\u2013101) which borrows the astrological notions found in Nechepso/Petosiris (see article on Hellenistic astrology) and in Hermes Trismegistus, an early pseudepigraphical source of astrology. Pinax was known and cited by the later following astrological writers: Vettius Valens, Porphyry and Hephaistio.[4]/nThrasyllus may have married a member of the royal family of Commagene (whose name is sometimes given as \"Aka\"), though this has been questioned recently.[9] He had two known children:/nThrasyllus is a character in the novel series, written by Robert Graves, I, Claudius and Claudius the God. Thrasyllus' predictions are always correct, and his prophecies are equally far-reaching.  Thrasyllus predicts Jesus of Nazareth's crucifixion and that his religion shall overtake the Roman Pagan Religion.  Similarly towards the end of his life it is explained that his final prophecy was misinterpreted by Tiberius.  Thrasyllus states that \"Tiberius Claudius will be emperor in 10 years,\" leading Tiberius to brashly criticize and mock Caligula, whereas his prophecy is correct as Claudius' name is \"Tiberius Claudius\"./nIn the TV miniseries adaptation of the novels, Thrasyllus was played by Kevin Stoney, who had previously played him in the 1968 ITV series The Caesars./nIn contrast, Thrasyllus and his descendants are presented as power-hungry charlatans in the novel series Romanike.[13]", "9572607": "H.

He received a PhD in applied mathematics from Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.[1]/nHe later went on to work on the design of the ENIAC computer while at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.[2][3]/nLubkin afterwards joined the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory to work with other ENIAC designers on the design of the EDVAC computer's programming system,[4][5][6] It has been claimed that the \"Operating Manual for the EDVAC\", which was authored by Lubkin, was \"the bible of the computer industry in the late 1940s and early 1950s\".[7]/nAfter that he joined the design team who went on to build the first UNIVAC computer.[8][9]/nIn the 1940s, Reeves Instrument Corporation hired Lubkin to lead a project designing their first digital computer. Reeves later decided to build analogue computers instead (which ultimately resulted in the Reeves Electronic Analog Computer series of machines), and Lubkin left the company for a job in the digital computer division of the National Bureau of Standards (the US government organization later renamed the National Institute of Standards and Technology).[8]/nThe bureau essentially hired Lubkin to replicate his design for the EDVAC, and this would go on to become the bureau's SEAC computer.[10]/nWithin a few months, Lubkin left the bureau, and started his own company with Murray Pfefferman, who had been part of the SEAC design team, with Lubkin as president. This was the Electronic Computer Corporation. The company was established in Brooklyn, New York, as that is where Lubkin's extended family lived. Even as a fledgling enterprise, the company was able to hire several very experienced engineers who had a pedigree in large corporations like the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation (creator of the ENIAC), as prominent Jewish scientists and engineers were losing their security clearance (and consequently, their defense sector jobs) as a result of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which sometimes equated Jewish heritage with Communist sympathies. Other notable employees included Evelyn Berezin.[11]/nThe main product of this company was a \"low cost\" (for the time) digital computer named the ELECOM 100.[8] This was a vacuum tube computer with a drum memory. It was also the first computer in history that operated with magnetic tape data storage, which was a separate peripheral. While smaller than some other room-sized computers, the ELECOM 100 was still not small by modern standards. The machine measured 10 feet wide by 6 feet high by 2 feet deep, not including the desk the operator would need to sit at, plus space for other sundry peripherals.[12] The ELECOM 100 was successfully tested for use at Ballistic Research Laboratory, though there is no evidence BRL ever actually purchased any. There was a unit known to be at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, but is unknown who else the ELECOM's early users were, and how many were made.[13] In 1955, it was reported that there were a total of three units in operation.[14]/nA subsequent model named the ELECOM 120 was developed. This was essentially the ELECOM 100 (which worked on an octal system) modified for decimal operation, and given expanded memory capacity.[13] In 1955 it was reported that there were five ELECOM 120s in operation; users included Griffiss Air Force Base, Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division and Shell Development Laboratories (now called Shell Development Emeryville).[14] An ELECOM 50 machine also existed, though this was a purpose-built accounting machine,[12] and an ELECOM 125.[14][15][note 1][16]/nThe ELECOM computers were reasonably successful in the market. In 1953, the Electronic Computer Corporation was acquired by the Underwood Typewriter Company, though Lubkin would stay on as Technical Director of their Electronic Computer Division. In interviews he spoke of pressure to produce cheaper and cheaper machines, and spoke of belief that the future of computing was in less-expensive, purpose-built machines for industry, and not in general purpose computing.[17]/nHowever the Electronic Computer Corporation suffered as a division within the financially ailing typewriter company. Underwood eventually realized it did not have the financial strength to produce the inventory needed to sell the (individually expensive) ELECOM machines, even those that it was already under contract to produce. There was an outstanding order for ELECOM machines from Standard Oil that the chairman of Underwood had to back out of.[18] In 1957 Underwood would get out of the computer business entirely, closing its computer division, after which Lubkin left.[9]/nLubkin would go on to work as a designer and consultant for computer projects with New York University, Curtiss-Wright, and Republic Aviation.[1]/nIn 1962, he founded a company of his own called Digital Electronics Inc., and was named chairman of the board.[1] The company set out to focus on \"custom-designed data conversion equipment, educational training devices, and a proprietary line of pulse and digital test equipment.\"[19] Lubkin would apply for and receive several patents for the company,[20] though he and the company would wind up becoming embroiled in litigation with some of his cofounders.[21]/nSamuel Lubkin had one son, Yale Jay Lubkin (husband to science journalist Gloria Lubkin from 1953 to 1968), with whom he worked at Digital Electronics Inc.

He was a native of Soli, Cilicia, but moved to Athens as a young man, where he became a pupil of the Stoic philosopher Cleanthes. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, Chrysippus became the third head of the Stoic school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of Cleanthes' mentor Zeno of Citium, the founder and first head of the school, which earned him the title of the Second Founder of Stoicism.[3]/nChrysippus excelled in logic, the theory of knowledge, ethics, and physics. He created an original system of propositional logic in order to better understand the workings of the universe and role of humanity within it. He adhered to a fatalistic view of fate, but nevertheless sought a role for personal agency in thought and action. Ethics, he thought, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of extirpating the unruly passions which depress and crush the soul. He initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential philosophical movements for centuries in the Greek and Roman world. The linguistic orientation of Chrysippus' work made it difficult for its students even within the Stoic school.[4]/nOf his several written works, none have survived except as fragments.[b] Recently, segments of some of his works were discovered among the Herculaneum papyri.[c]/nChrysippus was the son of Apollonius of Tarsus, and he was born at Soli, Cilicia.[7] He was slight in stature,[8] and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner.[9] While still young, he lost his substantial inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury.[10][d] Chrysippus moved to Athens, where he became the disciple of Cleanthes, who was then the head (scholarch) of the Stoic school.[12][e] He is believed to have attended the courses of Arcesilaus and his successor Lacydes, in the Platonic Academy.[14]/nChrysippus threw himself eagerly into the study of the Stoic system. His reputation for learning among his contemporaries was considerable.[9] He was noted for intellectual audacity and self-confidence and his reliance on his own ability was shown, among other things, in the request he is supposed to have made to Cleanthes: \"Give me the principles, and I will find the proofs myself.\"[9] He succeeded Cleanthes as head of the Stoic school when Cleanthes died, in around 230 BC./nChrysippus was a prolific writer. He is said to rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day[15] and he composed more than 705 works.[16] His desire to be comprehensive meant that he would take both sides of an argument[14] and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others.[17] He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came to be seen as a preeminent authority for the school.[18]/nHe died during the 143rd Olympiad (208\u2013204 BC) at the age of 73.[2] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius gives two different accounts of his death.[19] In the first account, Chrysippus was seized with dizziness having drunk undiluted wine at a feast, and died soon after. In the second account, he was watching a donkey eat some figs and cried out: \"Now give the donkey a drink of pure wine to wash down the figs\", whereupon he died in a fit of laughter. His nephew Aristocreon erected a statue in his honour in the Kerameikos.[20] Chrysippus was succeeded as head of the Stoic school by his pupil Zeno of Tarsus.[21]/nOf his written works, none survived except as fragments quoted in the works of later authors like Cicero, Seneca, Galen, Plutarch, and others. Recently, segments from Logical Questions and On Providence were discovered among the Herculaneum papyri.[6] A third work by Chrysippus may also be among them.[6]/nChrysippus had a long and successful career of resisting the attacks of the Academy[22] and hoped not simply to defend Stoicism against the assaults of the past, but also against all possible attack in the future. He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism.[22] He elaborated the physical doctrines of the Stoics and their theory of knowledge[18] and he created much of their formal logic.[23] In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what it was. It was said that \"without Chrysippus, there would have been no Stoa\".[f]/nChrysippus wrote much on the subject of logic and created a system of propositional logic. Aristotle's term logic had been concerned with the interrelations of terms such as \"Socrates\" or \"man\" (\"all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal\"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned with the interrelations of propositions such as \"it is day\" (\"if it is day, it is light: but it is day: so it is light\").[25][26] Though the earlier Megarian dialecticians \u2013\u00a0Diodorus Cronus and Philo\u00a0\u2013 had worked in this field and the pupils of Aristotle \u2013\u00a0Theophrastus and Eudemus\u00a0\u2013 had investigated hypothetical syllogisms,[27] it was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic.[27][28]/nChrysippus defined a proposition as \"that which is capable of being denied or affirmed as it is in itself\" and gave examples of propositions such as \"it is day\" and \"Dion is walking.\"[29][30] He distinguished between simple and non-simple propositions, which in modern terminology are known as atomic and molecular propositions.[27] A simple proposition is an elementary statement such as \"it is day.\"[31] Simple propositions are linked together to form non-simple propositions by the use of logical connectives. Chrysippus enumerated five kinds of molecular propositions according to the connective used:[31]/nThus several types of molecular propositions, familiar to modern logic, were listed by Chrysippus, including the conjunction, the disjunction, and the conditional,[32] and Chrysippus studied their criteria of truth closely.[32]/nThe first logicians to debate conditional statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus refers to a debate between Diodorus and Philo.[33] Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as \"if it is day, then I am talking,\" is true unless it is day and I fall silent.[34] But Diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion\u00a0\u2013 thus, because the proposition \"if it is day, then I am talking\" can be false, it is invalid.[33] However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as \"if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists.\"[34] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible:[g] to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent.[36] This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.[36]/nChrysippus developed a syllogistic or system of deduction in which he made use of five types of basic arguments or argument forms called indemonstrable syllogisms,[37] which played the role of axioms, and four inference rules, called themata by means of which complex syllogisms could be reduced to these axioms.[38][39] The forms of the five indemonstrables were:[40][41]/nOf the four inference rules (themata, \u03b8\u03ad\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1),[43] only two survived. One, the so-called first thema, was a rule of antilogism. The other, the third thema, was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be reduced to simple syllogisms.[44][45]  The purpose of Stoic syllogistic was not merely to create a formal system. It was also understood as the study of the operations of reason, the divine reason (logos) which governs the universe, of which human beings are a part.[46] The goal was to find valid rules of inference and forms of proof to help people find their way in life.[27]/nAccording to Sextus Empiricus, Chrysippus held that dogs use disjunctive syllogism, such as when using scent to pick which path to run down. This was in contrast to a tradition since Aristotle, who saw reasoning (and reasoning deductively) as man's defining aspect.[47]/nChrysippus analyzed speech and the handling of names and terms.[18] He also devoted much effort in refuting fallacies and paradoxes.[18] According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Chrysippus wrote twelve works in 23 books on the Liar paradox; seven works in 17 books on amphiboly; and another nine works in 26 books on other conundrums.[48] In all, 28 works or 66 books were given over to puzzles or paradoxes.[48]\nChrysippus is the first Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the category somehow disposed is attested.[49] In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use of the other two Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something).[50] It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.[50]/nChrysippus came to be renowned as one of the foremost logicians of ancient Greece. When Clement of Alexandria wanted to mention one who was master among logicians, as Homer was master among poets, it was Chrysippus, not Aristotle, he chose.[51] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius wrote: \"If the gods use dialectic, they would use none other than that of Chrysippus.\"[52] The logical work by Chrysippus came to be neglected and forgotten. Aristotle's logic prevailed, partly because it was seen as more practical, and partly because it was taken up by the Neoplatonists.[46] As recently as the 19th century, Stoic logic was treated with contempt, a barren formulaic system, which was merely clothing the logic of Aristotle with new terminology.[53] It was not until the 20th century, with the advances in logic, and the modern propositional calculus, that it became clear that Stoic logic constituted a significant achievement.[27]/nFor the Stoics, truth is distinguished from error by the sage who possesses right reason.[54] Chrysippus's theory of knowledge was empirical.[55] The senses transmit messages from the external world, and their reports are controlled not by referring them to innate ideas, but by comparing them to previous reports stored in the mind.[55] Zeno had defined impressions of sense as \"an impression in the soul\"[56] and this was interpreted literally by Cleanthes, who compared the impression on the soul to the impression made by a seal on wax.[57] Chrysippus preferred to regard it as an alteration or change in the soul;[56] that is, the soul receives a modification from every external object that acts upon it, just as the air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at once.[56]/nIn the receipt of an impression, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its own existence, but that also of its cause\u00a0\u2013 just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it.[56] The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First must come the impression, and the understanding\u00a0\u2013 having the power of utterance\u00a0\u2013 expresses in speech the affection it receives from the object.[58] True presentations are distinguished from those that are false by the use of memory, classification and comparison.[55] If the sense organ and the mind are healthy\u00a0\u2013 and provided that an external object can be really seen or heard\u00a0\u2013 the presentation, due to its clearness and distinctness, has the power to extort the assent that always lies in our power, to give or to withhold.[59] In a context in which people are understood to be rational beings, reason is developed out of these notions.[60]/nChrysippus insisted on the organic unity of the universe, as well as the correlation and mutual interdependence of all of its parts.[61] He said, the universe is \"the soul and guide of itself.\"[62] Following Zeno, Chrysippus determined fiery breath or aether to be the primitive substance of the universe.[63] Objects are made up of inert formless matter and an informing soul, \"pneuma\", provides form to the undifferentiated matter.[64] The pneuma pervades all of substance and maintains the unity of the universe and constitutes the soul of the human being.[64]/nThe classical elements change into one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction.[65] Fire first becomes solidified into air; then air into water; and lastly, water into earth. The process of dissolution takes place in the reverse order: earth being rarefied into water, water into air and air into fire.[65]/nThe human soul was divided by Chrysippus into eight faculties: the five senses, the power of reproduction, the power of speech, and the \"ruling part\" that is located in the chest rather than the head.[66] Individual souls are perishable; but, according to the view originated by Chrysippus, the souls of wise people survive longer after their death.[66] No individual soul can, however, survive beyond the periodic conflagration, when the universe is renewed.[66]/nThere were no universals or abstract objects for Chrysippus, making him a kind of nominalist.[i]/nFor Chrysippus, all things happen according to fate: what seems to be accidental has always some hidden cause.[69] The unity of the world consists in the chain-like dependence of cause upon cause.[70] Nothing can take place without a sufficient cause.[71] According to Chrysippus, every proposition is either true or false, and this must apply to future events as well:[72]/nIf any motion exists without a cause, then not every proposition will be either true or false. For that which has not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.[73]/nThe Stoic view of fate is entirely based on a view of the universe as a whole. Individual things and persons only come into consideration as dependent parts of this whole.[74] Everything is, in every respect, determined by this relation, and is consequently subject to the general order of the world.[70]/nIf his opponents objected that, if everything is determined by destiny, there is no individual responsibility, since what has been once foreordained must happen, come what may, Chrysippus replied that there is a distinction to be made between simple and complex predestination.[75] Becoming ill may be fated whatever happens but, if a person's recovery is linked to consulting a doctor, then consulting the doctor is fated to occur together with that person's recovery, and this becomes a complex fact.[76] All human actions\u00a0\u2013 in fact, our destiny\u00a0\u2013 are decided by our relation to things,[77] or as Chrysippus put it, events are \"co-fated\" to occur:[76]/nThe non-destruction of one's coat, he says, is not fated simply, but co-fated with its being taken care of, and someone's being saved from his enemies is co-fated with his fleeing those enemies; and having children is co-fated with being willing to lie with a woman. ... For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, he says, it was fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ... But it will be in our power, he says, with what is in our power being included in fate.[78]/nThus our actions are predetermined, and are causally related to the overarching network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own.[79] The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects.[80] Every action is brought about by the co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent.[80] Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes.[80] Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible.[81] Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not.[81] This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.[82]/nChrysippus also argued for the existence of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for.[83] It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental.[71] Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences.[84] There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity.[84] To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.[84]/nThe Stoics believed that the universe is God, and Chrysippus affirmed that \"the universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul.\"[85] It is the guiding principle of the universe, \"operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality which embraces all existence.\"[85] Based on these beliefs, physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein identified Chrysippus as a Pandeist.[j]/nChrysippus sought to prove the existence of God, making use of a teleological argument:/nIf there is anything that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the things that are in the universe\u00a0\u2013 the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.[87]/nChrysippus spoke of God and gods interchangeably. He interpreted the gods of traditional Greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of the one reality. Cicero tells us that \"he further maintained that aether is that which people call Zeus, and that the air which permeates the seas is Poseidon, and that the earth is what is known by the name of Demeter, and he treated in similar style the names of the other gods.\"[85] In addition, the universe exists for the benefit of the universal god:/nWe should infer in the case of a beautiful dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for mice; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.[88]/nIn response to the question of how evil could exist in a good universe, Chrysippus replied \"evil cannot be removed, nor is it well that it should be removed.\"[89] Firstly, he argued, following Plato, that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness.[90] Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows.[90] Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole.[91] Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the comedy; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, \"so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use.\"[92]/nChrysippus regarded bodies, surfaces, lines, places, the void and time as all being infinitely divisible.[93] He determined one of the principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.[94]/nChrysippus also responded to a problem first posed by Democritus.[95] If a cone is divided by a plane parallel to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then the surface of the cone must be stepped.[94] The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal.[96] Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.[96]/nChrysippus was notable for claiming that \"one\" is a number. One was not always considered a number by the ancient Greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are measured. Aristotle in his Metaphysics wrote, \"... a measure is not the things measured, but the measure or the One is the beginning of number.\"[97] Chrysippus asserted that one had \"magnitude one\" (Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f15\u03bd),[98] although this was not generally accepted by the Greeks, and Iamblichus wrote that \"magnitude one\" was a contradiction in terms.[97]/nChrysippus taught that ethics depended on physics. In his Physical Theses, he stated: \"for there is no other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe.\"[100] The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature.[101] A person's individual nature is part of the nature of the whole universe,[102] and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe.[103] Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly.[104] People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason.[104] Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.[104]/nThe Stoics admitted between the good and the bad a third class of things\u00a0\u2013 the indifferent (adiaphora).[105] Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty.[106] Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as \"good\",[105] but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them.[106] Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual\u00a0\u2013 in other words, there is such a thing as moral progress, and character has to be built up.[104]/nThe Stoics sought to be free of the unruly emotions, which they regarded as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment.[104] Chrysippus wrote a whole book, On Passions (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u1ff6\u03bd), concerning the therapy of the emotions.[107] The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia).[107] Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop.[108] One cannot hope to eradicate the passions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm.[109] Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the passions in the mind as if they were present.[110] By applying reason to passions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.[110]", "21008667": "Hiyya al-Daudi (born circa 1085 in Babylonia, died Kingdom of Castile, 1154) (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d3\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9) was a prominent rabbi, composer, and poet of Andalusia.

His research includes topics in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, algebraic combinatorics, arithmetic combinatorics, geometric combinatorics, probability theory, compressed sensing and analytic number theory.[4]/nTao was born to Chinese immigrant parents and raised in Adelaide. Tao won the Fields Medal in 2006 and won the Royal Medal and Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics in 2014. He is also a 2006 MacArthur Fellow. Tao has been the author or co-author of over three hundred research papers.[5] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest living mathematicians and has been referred to as the \"Mozart of mathematics.\"[6][7][8][9][10]/nTao's parents are first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong to Australia.[11] Tao's father, Billy Tao,[a] was a Chinese paediatrician who was born in Shanghai and earned his medical degree (MBBS) from the University of Hong Kong in 1969.[12] Tao's mother, Grace Leong,[b] was born in Hong Kong; she received a first-class honours degree in mathematics and physics at the University of Hong Kong.[10] She was a secondary school teacher of mathematics and physics in Hong Kong.[13] Billy and Grace met as students at the University of Hong Kong.[14] They then emigrated from Hong Kong to Australia in 1972.[11][10]/nTao also has two brothers, Trevor and Nigel, who are living in Australia. Both formerly represented the states at the International Mathematical Olympiad.[15] Furthermore, Trevor has been representing Australia internationally in chess and holds the title of Chess International Master.[16] Tao speaks Cantonese but cannot write Chinese. Tao is married to Laura Tao, an electrical engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[10][17] They live in Los Angeles, California, and have two children: Riley[c] and daughter Madeleine.[18][19]/nA child prodigy,[20] Tao exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age, attending university-level mathematics courses at the age of 9. He is one of only three children in the history of the Johns Hopkins' Study of Exceptional Talent program to have achieved a score of 700 or greater on the SAT math section while just eight years old; Tao scored a 760.[21][6] Julian Stanley, Director of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth, stated that Tao had the greatest mathematical reasoning ability he had found in years of intensive searching.[22]/nTao was the youngest participant to date in the International Mathematical Olympiad, first competing at the age of ten; in 1986, 1987, and 1988, he won a bronze, silver, and gold medal, respectively. Tao remains the youngest winner of each of the three medals in the Olympiad's history, having won the gold medal at the age of 13 in 1988.[23]/nAt age 14, Tao attended the Research Science Institute, a summer program for secondary students. In 1991, he received his bachelor's and master's degrees at the age of 16 from Flinders University under the direction of Garth Gaudry.[24] In 1992, he won a postgraduate Fulbright Scholarship to undertake research in mathematics at Princeton University in the United States. From 1992 to 1996, Tao was a graduate student at Princeton University under the direction of Elias Stein, receiving his PhD at the age of 21.[24] In 1996, he joined the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1999, when he was 24, he was promoted to full professor at UCLA and remains the youngest person ever appointed to that rank by the institution.[24]/nHe is known for his collaborative mindset; by 2006, Tao had worked with over 30 others in his discoveries,[6] reaching 68 co-authors by October 2015./nTao has had a particularly extensive collaboration with British mathematician Ben J. Green; together they proved the Green\u2013Tao theorem, which is well known among both amateur and professional mathematicians. This theorem states that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers. The New York Times described it this way:[25][26]/nIn 2004, Dr. Tao, along with Ben Green, a mathematician now at the University of Cambridge in England, solved a problem related to the Twin Prime Conjecture by looking at prime number progressions\u2014series of numbers equally spaced. (For example, 3, 7 and 11 constitute a progression of prime numbers with a spacing of 4; the next number in the sequence, 15, is not prime.) Dr. Tao and Dr. Green proved that it is always possible to find, somewhere in the infinity of integers, a progression of prime numbers of equal spacing and any length./nMany other results of Tao have received mainstream attention in the scientific press, including:/nTao has also resolved or made progress on a number of conjectures. In 2012, Green and Tao announced proofs of the conjectured \"orchard-planting problem,\" which asks for the maximum number of lines through exactly 3 points in a set of n points in the plane, not all on a line. In 2018, with Brad Rodgers, Tao showed that the de Bruijn\u2013Newman constant, the nonpositivity of which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, is nonnegative.[30] In 2020, Tao proved Sendov's conjecture, concerning the locations of the roots and critical points of a complex polynomial, in the special case of polynomials with sufficiently high degree.[31]/nBritish mathematician and Fields medalist Timothy Gowers remarked on Tao's breadth of knowledge:[32]/nTao's mathematical knowledge has an extraordinary combination of breadth and depth: he can write confidently and authoritatively on topics as diverse as partial differential equations, analytic number theory, the geometry of 3-manifolds, nonstandard analysis, group theory, model theory, quantum mechanics, probability, ergodic theory, combinatorics, harmonic analysis, image processing, functional analysis, and many others. Some of these are areas to which he has made fundamental contributions. Others are areas that he appears to understand at the deep intuitive level of an expert despite officially not working in those areas. How he does all this, as well as writing papers and books at a prodigious rate, is a complete mystery. It has been said that David Hilbert was the last person to know all of mathematics, but it is not easy to find gaps in Tao's knowledge, and if you do then you may well find that the gaps have been filled a year later./nAn article by New Scientist[33] writes of his ability:/nSuch is Tao's reputation that mathematicians now compete to interest him in their problems, and he is becoming a kind of Mr. Fix-it for frustrated researchers. \"If you're stuck on a problem, then one way out is to interest Terence Tao,\" says Charles Fefferman [professor of mathematics at Princeton University].[34]/nTao has won numerous mathematician honours and awards over the years.[35] He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Australian Academy of Science (Corresponding Member), the National Academy of Sciences (Foreign member), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society,[36] and the American Mathematical Society.[37] In 2006 he received the Fields Medal; he was the first Australian, the first UCLA faculty member, and one of the youngest mathematicians to receive the award.[34][38] He was also awarded the MacArthur Fellowship. He has been featured in The New York Times, CNN, USA Today, Popular Science, and many other media outlets.[39] In 2014, Tao received a CTY Distinguished Alumni Honor from Johns Hopkins Center for Gifted and Talented Youth in front of 979 attendees in 8th and 9th grade that are in the same program from which Tao graduated. In 2021, President Joe Biden announced Tao had been selected as one of 30 members of his President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, a body bringing together America's most distinguished leaders in science and technology.[40] In 2021, Tao was awarded the Riemann Prize Week as recipient of the inaugural Riemann Prize 2019 by the Riemann International School of Mathematics at the University of Insubria.[41] Tao was a finalist to become Australian of the Year in 2007.[42]/nAs of 2022, Tao has published over three hundred articles, along with sixteen books.[43] He has an Erd\u0151s number of 2.[44] He is a highly cited researcher.[45][46]/nFrom 2001 to 2010, Tao was part of a well-known collaboration with James Colliander, Markus Keel, Gigliola Staffilani, and Hideo Takaoka. They found a number of novel results, many to do with the well-posedness of weak solutions, for Schr\u00f6dinger equations, KdV equations, and KdV-type equations.[C+03]/nMichael Christ, Colliander, and Tao developed methods of Carlos Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega to establish ill-posedness of certain Schr\u00f6dinger and KdV equations for Sobolev data of sufficiently low exponents.[CCT03][47] In many cases these results were sharp enough to perfectly complement well-posedness results for sufficiently large exponents as due to Bourgain, Colliander\u2212Keel\u2212Staffilani\u2212Takaoka\u2212Tao, and others. Further such notable results for Schr\u00f6dinger equations were found by Tao in collaboration with Ioan Bejenaru.[BT06]/nA particularly notable result of the Colliander\u2212Keel\u2212Staffilani\u2212Takaoka\u2212Tao collaboration established the long-time existence and scattering theory of a power-law Schr\u00f6dinger equation in three dimensions.[C+08] Their methods, which made use of the scale-invariance of the simple power law, were extended by Tao in collaboration with Monica Vi\u0219an and Xiaoyi Zhang to deal with nonlinearities in which the scale-invariance is broken.[TVZ07] Rowan Killip, Tao, and Vi\u0219an later made notable progress on the two-dimensional problem in radial symmetry.[KTV09]/nA technical tour de force by Tao in 2001 considered the wave maps equation with two-dimensional domain and spherical range.[T01a] He built upon earlier innovations of Daniel Tataru, who considered wave maps valued in Minkowski space.[48] Tao proved the global well-posedness of solutions with sufficiently small initial data. The fundamental difficulty is that Tao considers smallness relative to the critical Sobolev norm, which typically requires sophisticated techniques. Tao later adapted some of his work on wave maps to the setting of the Benjamin\u2013Ono equation; Alexandru Ionescu and Kenig later obtained improved results with Tao's methods.[T04a][49]/nIn 2016, Tao constructed a variant of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations which possess solutions exhibiting irregular behavior in finite time.[T16] Due to structural similarities between Tao's system and the Navier\u2013Stokes equations themselves, it follows that any positive resolution of the Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness problem must take into account the specific nonlinear structure of the equations. In particular, certain previously proposed resolutions of the problem could not be legitimate.[50] Tao speculated that the Navier\u2013Stokes equations might be able to simulate a Turing complete system, and that as a consequence it might be possible to (negatively) resolve the existence and smoothness problem using a modification of his results.[6][27] However, such results remain (as of 2022) conjectural./nBent Fuglede introduced the Fuglede conjecture in the 1970s, positing a tile-based characterisation of those Euclidean domains for which a Fourier ensemble provides a basis of L2.[51] Tao resolved the conjecture in the negative for dimensions larger than 5, based upon the construction of an elementary counterexample to an analogous problem in the setting of finite groups.[T04b]/nWith Camil Muscalu and Christoph Thiele, Tao considered certain multilinear singular integral operators with the multiplier allowed to degenerate on a hyperplane, identifying conditions which ensure operator continuity relative to Lp spaces.[MTT02] This unified and extended earlier notable results of Ronald Coifman, Carlos Kenig, Michael Lacey, Yves Meyer, Elias Stein, and Thiele, among others.[52][53][54][55][56][57] Similar problems were analysed by Tao in 2001 in the context of Bourgain spaces, rather than the usual Lp spaces.[T01b] Such estimates are used in establishing well-posedness results for dispersive partial differential equations, following famous earlier work of Jean Bourgain, Kenig, Gustavo Ponce, and Luis Vega, among others.[58][59]/nA number of Tao's results deal with \"restriction\" phenomena in Fourier analysis, which have been widely studied since seminal articles of Charles Fefferman, Robert Strichartz, and Peter Tomas in the 1970s.[60][61][62] Here one studies the operation which restricts input functions on Euclidean space to a submanifold and outputs the product of the Fourier transforms of the corresponding measures. It is of major interest to identify exponents such that this operation is continuous relative to Lp spaces. Such multilinear problems originated in the 1990s, including in notable work of Jean Bourgain, Sergiu Klainerman, and Matei Machedon.[63][64][65] In collaboration with Ana Vargas and Luis Vega, Tao made some foundational contributions to the study of the bilinear restriction problem, establishing new exponents and drawing connections to the linear restriction problem. They also found analogous results for the bilinear Kakeya problem which is based upon the X-ray transform instead of the Fourier transform.[TVV98] In 2003, Tao adapted ideas developed by Thomas Wolff for bilinear restriction to conical sets into the setting of restriction to quadratic hypersurfaces.[T03][66] The multilinear setting for these problems was further developed by Tao in collaboration with Jonathan Bennett and Anthony Carbery; their work was extensively used by Bourgain and Larry Guth in deriving estimates for general oscillatory integral operators.[BCT06][67]/nIn collaboration with Emmanuel Candes and Justin Romberg, Tao has made notable contributions to the field of compressed sensing. In mathematical terms, most of their results identify settings in which a convex optimisation problem correctly computes the solution of an optimisation problem which seems to lack a computationally tractable structure. These problems are of the nature of finding the solution of an underdetermined linear system with the minimal possible number of nonzero entries, referred to as \"sparsity\". Around the same time, David Donoho considered similar problems from the alternative perspective of high-dimensional geometry.[68]/nMotivated by striking numerical experiments, Candes, Romberg, and Tao first studied the case where the matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform.[CRT06a] Candes and Tao abstracted the problem and introduced the notion of a \"restricted linear isometry,\" which is a matrix that is quantitatively close to an isometry when restricted to certain subspaces.[CT05] They showed that it is sufficient for either exact or optimally approximate recovery of sufficiently sparse solutions. Their proofs, which involved the theory of convex duality, were markedly simplified in collaboration with Romberg, to use only linear algebra and elementary ideas of harmonic analysis.[CRT06b] These ideas and results were later improved by Candes.[69] Candes and Tao also considered relaxations of the sparsity condition, such as power-law decay of coefficients.[CT06] They complemented these results by drawing on a large corpus of past results in random matrix theory to show that, according to the Gaussian ensemble, a large number of matrices satisfy the restricted isometry property.[CT06]/nIn 2007, Candes and Tao introduced a novel statistical estimator for linear regression, which they called the \"Dantzig selector.\" They proved a number of results on its success as an estimator and model selector, roughly in parallel to their earlier work on compressed sensing.[CT07] A number of other authors have since studied the Dantzig selector, comparing it to similar objects such as the statistical lasso introduced in the 1990s.[70] Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome H. Friedman conclude that it is \"somewhat unsatisfactory\" in a number of cases.[71] Nonetheless, it remains of significant interest in the statistical literature./nIn 2009, Candes and Benjamin Recht considered an analogous problem for recovering a matrix from knowledge of only a few of its entries and the information that the matrix is of low rank.[72] They formulated the problem in terms of convex optimisation, studying minimisation of the nuclear norm. Candes and Tao, in 2010, developed further results and techniques for the same problem.[CT10] Improved results were later found by Recht.[73] Similar problems and results have also been considered by a number of other authors.[74][75][76][77][78]/nIn the 1950s, Eugene Wigner initiated the study of random matrices and their eigenvalues.[79][80] Wigner studied the case of hermitian and symmetric matrices, proving a \"semicircle law\" for their eigenvalues. In 2010, Tao and Van Vu made a major contribution to the study of non-symmetric random matrices. They showed that if n is large and the entries of a n \u00d7 n matrix A are selected randomly according to any fixed probability distribution of average 0 and standard deviation 1, then the eigenvalues of A will tend to be uniformly scattered across the disk of radius n1/2 around the origin; this can be made precise using the language of measure theory.[TV10] This gave a proof of the long-conjectured circular law, which had previously been proved in weaker formulations by many other authors. In Tao and Vu's formulation, the circular law becomes an immediate consequence of a \"universality principle\" stating that the distribution of the eigenvalues can depend only on the average and standard deviation of the given component-by-component probability distribution, thereby providing a reduction of the general circular law to a calculation for specially-chosen probability distributions./nIn 2011, Tao and Vu established a \"four moment theorem\", which applies to random hermitian matrices whose components are independently distributed, each with average 0 and standard deviation 1, and which are exponentially unlikely to be large (as for a Gaussian distribution). If one considers two such random matrices which agree on the average value of any quadratic polynomial in the diagonal entries and on the average value of any quartic polynomial in the off-diagonal entries, then Tao and Vu show that the expected value of a large number of functions of the eigenvalues will also coincide, up to an error which is uniformly controllable by the size of the matrix and which becomes arbitrarily small as the size of the matrix increases.[TV11] Similar results were obtained around the same time by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Erd\u00f6s, Horng-Tzer Yau, and Jun Yin.[81][82]/nIn 2004, Tao, together with Jean Bourgain and Nets Katz, studied the additive and multiplicative structure of subsets of finite fields of prime order.[BKT04] It is well known that there are no nontrivial subrings of such a field. Bourgain, Katz, and Tao provided a quantitative formulation of this fact, showing that for any subset of such a field, the number of sums and products of elements of the subset must be quantitatively large, as compared to the size of the field and the size of the subset itself. Improvements of their result were later given by Bourgain, Alexey Glibichuk, and Sergei Konyagin.[83][84]/nTao and Ben Green proved the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the prime numbers; this result is generally referred to as the Green\u2013Tao theorem, and is among Tao's most well-known results.[GT08] The source of Green and Tao's arithmetic progressions is Endre Szemer\u00e9di's seminal 1975 theorem on existence of arithmetic progressions in certain sets of integers. Green and Tao showed that one can use a \"transference principle\" to extend the validity of Szemer\u00e9di's theorem to further sets of integers. The Green\u2013Tao theorem then arises as a special case, although it is not trivial to show that the prime numbers satisfy the conditions of Green and Tao's extension of the Szemer\u00e9di theorem./nIn 2010, Green and Tao gave a multilinear extension of Dirichlet's celebrated theorem on arithmetic progressions. Given a k \u00d7 n matrix A and a k \u00d7 1 matrix v whose components are all integers, Green and Tao give conditions on when there exist infinitely many n \u00d7 1 matrices x such that all components of Ax + v are prime numbers.[GT10] The proof of Green and Tao was incomplete, as it was conditioned upon unproven conjectures. Those conjectures were proved in later work of Green, Tao, and Tamar Ziegler.[GTZ12]/nTextbooks/nResearch articles. Tao is the author of over 300 articles.

He was descended from Tristram Coffin, the first owner of Nantucket Island. Coffin was an orphan, and was raised by his uncle, the Reverend Moses Hallock.[3] He attended Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, from where he graduated in 1828. He had a son, Seldon J. Coffin. He died in Easton, Pennsylvania on February 6, 1873.[2][4]/nAfter graduating from Amherst, Coffin became a teacher at various schools and colleges. His career in meteorology began in 1838. He worked at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, from 1840 to 1843, during which he installed an apparatus for detecting the wind's direction and velocity, atop Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts.[2] Together with William Ferrel, he deduced the Buys Ballot's law, which was named after the Dutch meteorologist C. H. D. Buys Ballot.[1] He collaborated on meteorological studies with the Smithsonian Institution beginning in 1846. That same year, he acquired a chair at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, in mathematics and natural philosophy, a position he held until his death.[2] Also, while at Lafayette, he served as treasurer to the board of trustees from 1863 to 1873.[5]/nCoffin made significant contributions to contemporaneous studies of winds. He is most noted for two publications: Winds of the Northern Hemisphere and The Winds of the Globe. Winds of the Northern Hemisphere was commissioned by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in an attempt to help predict the occurrence of storms.[6] The second, also commissioned by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was meant to extend the work of the previous publication in light of increased interest from agricultural, engineering, and manufacturing interests. Ultimately, both were published by the Smithsonian Institution, and provided novel theoretical contributions and a wealth of tabulated raw data for use by others.[7][8] Finally, it is worth noting that much of The Winds of the Globe was written posthumously. Coffin gathered the data, but died before any detailed analysis could be made of them; Coffin's coworker, Dr. Alexander J. Woeikof performed that analysis instead.[9]/nIn this book, Coffin aggregates measurements of the \"lower strata\"\u2014any wind directly measurable by weather vane, windmill or other ground-based apparatus\u2014from 579 stations across the Northern Hemisphere.[10] The distribution of these stations, as well as the sum of the duration of measurements at each station is shown in Table 1.[11]/nFrom each station, Coffin aggregated five measurements: the mean direction of wind, its mean speed, mean rate of change over the course of the year, direction and amount of \"deflecting forces\" that caused such changes, and the ratio of time spent blowing in the direction of the points of the compass.[10] The resulting data set comprises almost 160 pages of tables, sectioned by measurement and subsequently by region. Subsets of this data are also visualized in charts such as Figure 1.[12]/nFrom this Coffin draws several general conclusions. First, Coffin was able to establish the existence of two of the three trade winds, the southwesterly band around 60\u00b0 latitude, and the northeasterly band above it.[13] He then unified two contemporary theories of global wind systems in order to explain the phenomena.[14] Second, Coffin correlates the prevalence of monsoons with seasonal temperature differences caused by difference between the relatively stable temperature of large bodies of water, and the much less stable temperature of landmasses.[15] Third, by the same principle, Coffin notes that lakes significantly disrupt wind flow.[16] Coffin believes he can then straightforwardly claim that, though there are two prevailing trade winds, their course can, and often is, diverted by landmasses and smaller bodies of water.[17]/nThe remainder of the book is spent discussing particular phenomena, and explaining them in terms of the above general principles. It also includes an appendix with excerpts of scientific correspondence that Coffin deemed relevant.[18]/nThe most prominent criticism of The Winds of the Northern Hemisphere was its relatively sparse coverage outside the US and Europe; this ultimately became one of the motivation for writing The Winds of the Globe.[19] Coffin also notes two other methodological issues. First, measurements of velocity were sometimes estimated qualitatively on a 1-10 scale.[20] Second, since cloud height can only be estimated as well, what constitutes the \"lower strata\" is not entirely clear\u2014especially when differences between upper and lower strata were apparent.[21]/nThe Winds of the Globe had a much more expansive data set than its predecessor. In this book, Coffin aggregates measurements of the \"lower strata\" from 3223 stations across the world.[22] A summary of the distribution of these stations, as well as the sum of the duration of measurements at each station is reproduced in Table 2.[22]/nIn this case Coffin took six measurements: the mean direction of the lower currents, the ratio that the progressive motion bears to the total distance travelled, modifications that the mean current undergoes in the different seasons of the year, the directions of the forces that cause those modifications, the magnitude of those forces, and finally to show, how and to what degree the winds of the lower strata differ from the higher winds.[22] The resulting volume includes over 650 pages of results, again tabulated by parameter and subsequently region. As before, certain subsets are visualized and presented, as exemplified in Figure 2.[23]/nThe data in The Winds of the Globe leads to conclusions that generally agree with those of its predecessor. Woeikof confirms the existence of the two trade winds found above 30\u00b0 latitude, and established the existence of a third, southwesterly band between 0\u00b0-30\u00b0 latitude.[24] The greater wealth of data also allows Woeikof to give a more accurately describe the extent of these winds, each of the three spanning 30\u00b0 latitude from the equator on top of the other.[24] Another novel contribution was the realization that these wind bands shift with the seasons. When the sun is in its zenith over the northern hemisphere (our summer) the equatorial band moves northward, as do all the others.[25] The reverse happens in our winter.[25]/nThe Winds of the Globe also made significant progress towards empirically verifying the current theoretical association of the effect of air pressure on the direction of winds, as well as precisifying the previously poorly quantified relationship between pressure gradients and wind velocity.[26] Contrarily, it served to problematize Hadley's contemporaneous theory about the movement of the upper atmosphere, and the effect of gravity on the shape of convection cells.[27]/nWoeikof then applied these general conclusions to particular instances. Most notably, he was able to explain the mechanism behind the dry and wet seasons of Asia and Australia, as well as their corresponding monsoons.[28] Woeikof was also able to use the effect of landmasses on wind currents to explain the difference in climate between Asia and North America based on the differing geographies of the two regions.[29]/nAs stated in his The Winds of the Globe, Winds of the Northern Hemisphere was not received well due to its spotty coverage of Asia, the Oceans, and Central America. However, NOAA still calls The Winds of the Northern Hemisphere a \"most important work\" in the history of meteorology.[30] Additionally, the Smithsonian Institution called Wind of the Northern Hemisphere \"an important addition to meteorology.\"[31] Finally, Winds of the Northern Hemisphere was given out as a reference book to the first sergeants of the US weather service.[32]/nCoffin's more universally acclaimed contributions to meteorology began with his Winds of the Globe, which helped pick out flaws in the prevailing theory by Hadley.[33] Ferrel used Coffin's data to confirm theories of about the \"general circulation of the atmosphere.\"[33] Indeed, Landsbergh, 1964 credits Coffin's data as being foundational to the creation of mathematical climatology.[34] Youmans argues that Northern Hemisphere was the first to establish that there are three large circulation cells in the Northern, and then later the Southern, hemispheres.[35][36] This, in combination with Coffin's derivation Buys-Ballot's law, found in another piece, lead Youmans to go so far as to say that Coffin's results \"have been referred to in all the treatises on meteorology which have appeared since their publication, and they have been employed with other materials as the basis of the wind-charts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, prepared and published by the English Board of Trade.\"[37][36] The Smithsonian institution calls Coffin one of four people to make significant contributions to \"one of the most important additions to meteorology of the present day\u2026the establishment of the dependence of the force and direction of the wind upon the pressure of the atmosphere at different points.\"[38] Henry, the leader of the Smithsonian Institution, called The Winds of the Globe \"perhaps the most important contribution to knowledge which the institution has given to the world.\"[39]", "72159566": "Janis Marie Oldham (March 31, 1956 \u2013 July 14, 2021) was an American mathematician specializing in differential geometry and mathematics education and known for her efforts in mentoring mathematics students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.[1][2][3]/nOldham was African American.[4] She was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on March 31, 1956,[1][2] and graduated from North Central High School (Indianapolis) in 1974.[2] She became an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, majored in mathematics, and graduated with a bachelor of arts in 1978./nAfter going to Purdue University and earning a master's degree in mathematics in 1980, she went to the University of California, Berkeley for doctoral study, completing her Ph.D. in mathematics in 1990.[1] Her dissertation, Connections in Super Principal Fiber Bundles, concerned connections in fiber bundles, mathematical structures used to transport geometric information from one part of a topological space to another.

After two years' teaching at Williams College, he began a doctorate at the University of Strasbourg, which was awarded in 1901. He then spent his entire career at Harvard, retiring in 1941. He taught in the engineering school, becoming Professor of Mechanics in 1919. Although Huntington's research was mainly in pure mathematics, he valued teaching mathematics to engineering students. He advocated mechanical calculators and had one in his office. He had an interest in statistics, unusual for the time, and worked on statistical problems for the USA military during World War I./nHuntington's primary research interest was the foundations of mathematics. He was one of the \"American postulate theorists\" (according to Michael Scanlan, the expression is due to John Corcoran), American mathematicians active early in the 20th century (including E. H. Moore and Oswald Veblen) who proposed axiom sets for a variety of mathematical systems. In so doing, they helped found what is now known as metamathematics and model theory.[1]/nHuntington was perhaps the most prolific of the American postulate theorists, devising sets of axioms (which he called \"postulates\") for groups, abelian groups, geometry, the real number field, and complex numbers. His 1902 axiomatization of the real numbers has been characterized as \"one of the first successes of abstract mathematics\" and as having \"filled the last gap in the foundations of Euclidean geometry\".[2]  Huntington excelled at proving axioms independent of each other by finding a sequence of models, each one satisfying all but one of the axioms in a given set. His 1917 book The Continuum and Other Types of Serial Order was in its day \"...a widely read introduction to Cantorian set theory\" (Scanlan 1999). Yet Huntington and the other American postulate theorists played no role in the rise of axiomatic set theory then taking place in continental Europe./nIn 1904, Huntington put Boolean algebra on a sound axiomatic foundation. He revisited Boolean axiomatics in 1933, proving that Boolean algebra required but a single binary operation (denoted below by infix '+') that commutes and associates, and a single unary operation, complementation, denoted by a postfix prime. The only further axiom Boolean algebra requires is:/nnow known as Huntington's axiom./nRevising a method from Joseph Adna Hill, Huntington is credited with the method of equal proportions or Huntington\u2013Hill method of apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the states, as a function of their populations determined in the U.S. Census[1].  This mathematical algorithm has been used in the U.S. since 1941 and is currently the method used./nIn 1919, Huntington was the third President of the Mathematical Association of America, which he helped found as a charter member and its first vice-president.[3] He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1913 and the American Philosophical Society in 1933.

H. Moore was his supervisor,[6] he was most influenced by the writings of Henri Poincar\u00e9. After teaching at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison from 1907 to 1909 and at Princeton University from 1909 to 1912, he taught at Harvard from 1912 until his death.[4] Being the only American familiar with the three main mathematical institutions within the United States \u2013 Chicago, Harvard and Princeton \u2013 he was held in high professional regard.[5]/nDuring his membership in the American Mathematical Society, Birkhoff served multiple positions in the organization. In 1919, he served as vice president of the society. He was editor of Transactions of the American Mathematical Society from 1920 to 1924./nFrom 1925 to 1926, he was President of the American Mathematical Society. During his tenure as president of the society, Birkhoff sought to create a lectureship program to travel the United States to promote mathematics.[7] In 1926, he travelled Europe to serve as an unofficial representative if the Rockefeller Foundation's International Education Board.[5] During his time in Europe, Birkhoff attempted to create links between American and French institutions, especially due to his affection for Paris.[8]/nIn 1937, he served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a rare occurrence for mathematicians and was proof of his respect amongst the scientific community.[9]/nIn 1912, attempting to solve the four color problem, Birkhoff introduced the chromatic polynomial. Even though this line of attack did not prove fruitful, the polynomial itself became an important object of study in algebraic graph theory./nIn 1913, he proved Poincar\u00e9's \"Last Geometric Theorem,\" a special case of the three-body problem, a result that made him world-famous and improved the international recognition of American mathematics.[5]/nBirkhoff was also a contributor to developing general relativity.He wrote on the foundations of relativity and quantum mechanics, publishing (with R. E. Langer) the monograph Relativity and Modern Physics in 1923. In 1923, Birkhoff also proved that the Schwarzschild geometry is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein field equations. A consequence is that black holes are not merely a mathematical curiosity, but could result from any spherical star having sufficient mass. In 1927, he published his Dynamical Systems. His theorem would be used to develop the Oppenheimer\u2013Snyder model./nBirkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the ergodic theorem. Combining insights from physics on the ergodic hypothesis with measure theory, this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics, probability theory, group theory, and functional analysis. He also worked on number theory, the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem, and the four colour problem. He proposed an axiomatization of Euclidean geometry different from Hilbert's (see Birkhoff's axioms); this work culminated in his text Basic Geometry (1941)./nHis 1933 Aesthetic Measure proposed a mathematical theory of aesthetics.[10] While writing this book, he spent a year studying the art, music and poetry of various cultures around the world. His 1938 Electricity as a Fluid combined his ideas on philosophy and science. His 1943 theory of gravitation is also puzzling since Birkhoff knew (but didn't seem to mind) that his theory allows as sources only matter which is a perfect fluid in which the speed of sound must equal the speed of light./nBirkhoff believed that fellowships from foreign nations would improve the mathematic standards in the United States,[11] though he wanted to raise the standards for fellowships, believing that the qualifications in less-developed countries were different and that access should be limited.[12] He also was adamant that foreign fellows be able to meet language requirements.[13]/nAlbert Einstein and Norbert Wiener, among others, accused[14][15][16] Birkhoff of advocating anti-Semitic selection processes. During the 1930s, when many Jewish mathematicians fled Europe and tried to obtain positions in the United States, Birkhoff is alleged to have influenced the selection process at American institutions to exclude Jews.[15] Saunders Mac Lane, who was at Harvard at the time, would call Einstein's allegations \"worthless\" as he was not familiar with American processes and that the two had competing ideas regarding general relativity while also rebutting the reports of anti-Semitism against Wiener, writing \"Birkhoff clearly listened to Norbert's ideas. There could be many reasons why Birkhoff did not take steps to appoint him\".[17] Mac Lane also stated that Birkhoff's efforts were motivated less by animus towards Jews than by a desire to find jobs for home-grown American mathematicians.[18]/nBirkhoff was also close to Jewish mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Gian-Carlo Rota writes: \"Like other persons rumored to be anti-Semitic, he would occasionally feel the urge to shower his protective instincts on some good-looking young Jew. Ulam's sparkling manners were diametrically opposite to Birkhoff's hard-working, aggressive, touchy personality. Birkhoff tried to keep Ulam at Harvard, but his colleagues balked at the idea.\"[19]/nSummarizing Birkhoff's selection process, fellow mathematician Oswald Veblen would write:[4]/nWhile Birkhoff was subject to as many prejudices as most of us, he kept always what most of us lose as we grow older, the power to see people and events simply and naively rather than with reference to current opinion./nIn 1923, he was awarded the inaugural B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize by the American Mathematical Society for his paper in 1917 containing, among other things, what is now called the Birkhoff curve shortening process.[20]/nHe was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences,[21] and the London and Edinburgh Mathematical Societies./nThe George David Birkhoff Prize in applied mathematics is awarded jointly by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in his honor./nBirkhoff would marry Margaret Elizabeth Graftus in 1908 and would remain married with her.[4] The two had three children, Barbara, mathematician Garrett Birkhoff (1911\u20131996) and Rodney.[4]", "65442147": "U.

In the following year he was appointed a Staff Member of the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. Here he continued to work on the nature of interstellar dust, publishing many papers in this field,[21] that led to a consideration of carbon-containing grains as well as the older silicate models./nWickramasinghe published the first definitive book on Interstellar Grains in 1967.[22] He has made many contributions to this field, publishing over 350 papers in peer-reviewed journals, over 75 of which are in Nature.  Hoyle and Wickramasinghe further proposed a radical kind of panspermia that included the claim that extraterrestrial life forms enter the Earth's atmosphere and were possibly responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and genetic novelty that Hoyle and Wickramasinghe contended was necessary for macroevolution.[23]/nChandra Wickramasinghe had the longest-running collaboration with Fred Hoyle. Their publications on books and papers[21] arguing for panspermia and a cosmic hypothesis of life are controversial and, in particular detail, essentially contra the scientific consensus in both astrophysics and biology. Several claims made by Hoyle and Wickramasinghe between 1977 and 1981, such as a report of having detected interstellar cellulose, were criticised by one author as pseudoscience.[24] Phil Plait has described Wickramasinghe as a \"fringe scientist\" who \"jumps on everything, with little or no evidence, and says it\u2019s from outer space\".[25]/nIn 1974 Wickramasinghe first proposed the hypothesis that some dust in interstellar space was largely organic,[26] and followed this up with other research confirming the hypothesis.[27] Wickramasinghe also proposed and confirmed the existence of polymeric compounds based on the molecule formaldehyde (H2CO).[28] Fred Hoyle and Wickramasinghe later proposed the identification of bicyclic aromatic compounds from an analysis of the ultraviolet extinction absorption at 2175A.,[29] thus demonstrating the existence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in space./nThroughout his career, Wickramasinghe, along with his collaborator Fred Hoyle, has advanced the panspermia hypothesis, that proposes that life on Earth is, at least in part, of extraterrestrial origin.[30][31] The Hoyle\u2013Wickramasinghe model of panspermia include the assumptions that dormant viruses and desiccated DNA and RNA can survive unprotected in space;[32] that small bodies such as asteroids and comets can protect the \"seeds of life\", including DNA and RNA,[33][34][35]  living, fossilized, or dormant life, cellular[36][37] or non-cellular;[33][34][35][36][38][39][40][41] and that the collisions of asteroids, comets, and moons have the potential to spread these \"seeds of life\" throughout an individual star system and then onward to others.[38][41] The most contentious issue around the Hoyle\u2013Wickramasinghe model of the panspermia hypothesis is the corollary of their first two propositions that viruses and bacteria continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere from space, and are hence responsible for many major epidemics throughout history.[42][43][44]/nTowards the end of their collaboration, Wickramasinghe and Hoyle hypothesised that abiogenesis occurred close to the Galactic Center before panspermia carried life throughout the Milky Way,[45] and stated a belief that such a process could occur in many galaxies throughout the Universe.[46][47]/nOn 20 January 2001 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) conducted a balloon flight from Hyderabad, India to collect stratospheric dust from a height of 41\u00a0km (135,000\u00a0ft) with a view to testing for the presence of living cells.  The collaborators on this project included a team of UK scientists led by Wickramasinghe.  In a paper presented at a SPIE conference in San Diego in 2002 the detection of evidence for viable microorganisms from 41\u00a0km above the Earth's surface was presented.[48] However, the experiment did not present evidence as to whether the findings are incoming microbes from space rather than microbes carried up to 41\u00a0km from the surface of the Earth./nIn 2005 the ISRO group carried out a second stratospheric sampling experiment from 41\u00a0km altitude and reported the isolation of three new species of bacteria including one that they named Janibacter hoylei sp.nov. in honour of Fred Hoyle.[49] However, these facts do not prove that bacteria on Earth originated in the cosmic environment. Samplings of the stratosphere have also been carried out by Yang et al. (2005,[50] 2009[51]). During the experiment strains of highly radiation-resistant Deinococcus bacterium were detected at heights up to 35\u00a0km. Nevertheless, these authors have abstained from linking these discoveries to panspermia.\nWickramasinghe was also involved in coordinating analyses of the red rain in Kerala in collaborations with Godfrey Louis.[52]/nHoyle and Wickramasinghe have advanced the argument that various outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesised that cometary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations\u2014a view almost universally dismissed by external experts on this pandemic.[8]/nOn 24 May 2003 The Lancet published a letter from Wickramasinghe,[53] jointly signed by Milton Wainwright and Jayant Narlikar, in which they hypothesised that the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin instead of originating from chickens. The Lancet subsequently published three responses to this letter, showing that the hypothesis was not evidence-based, and casting doubts on the quality of the experiments referenced by Wickramasinghe in his letter.[54][55][56] Claims connecting terrestrial disease and extraterrestrial pathogens have been rejected by the scientific community.[8]/nIn 2020, Wickramasinghe and colleagues published a paper claiming that Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic was also of extraterrestrial origin, the claim was criticised for lacking evidence.[57]/nOn 29 December 2012 a green fireball was observed in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka.[58][59] It disintegrated into fragments that fell to the Earth near the villages of Aralaganwila and Dimbulagala and in a rice field near Dalukkane. Rock samples were submitted to the Medical Research Institute of the Ministry of Health in Colombo.[citation needed]/nThe rocks were sent to the University of Cardiff in Wales for analysis, where Chandra Wickramasinghe's team analyzed them and claimed that they contained extraterrestrial diatoms. From January to March 2013, five papers were published in the fringe Journal of Cosmology outlining various results from teams in the United Kingdom, United States and Germany.[60][failed verification][61][failed verification] However, independent experts in meteoritics stated that the object analyzed by Wickramasinghe's team was of terrestrial origin,[62][63] a fulgurite created by lightning strikes on Earth.[64] Experts in diatoms complemented the statement, saying that the organisms found in the rock represented a wide range of extant terrestrial taxa, confirming their earthly origin.[62]/nWickramasinghe and collaborators responded, using X-ray diffraction, oxygen isotope analysis, and scanning electron microscope observations, in a March 2013 paper asserting that the rocks they found were indeed meteorites,[65] instead of being created by lightning strikes on Earth as stated by scientists from the University of Peradeniya.[64][66] However, these claims were also criticised for not providing evidence that the rocks were actually meteorites.[67]/nIn 2018, Wickramasinghe and over 30 other authors published a paper in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology entitled \"Cause of Cambrian Explosion - Terrestrial or Cosmic?\" which argued in favour of panspermia as the origin of the Cambrian explosion, and posited that cephalopods are alien lifeforms that originated from frozen eggs that were transported to earth via meteor.[68] The claims gained widespread press coverage.[69][70][71] Virologist Karin M\u00f6lling, in a companion commentary published in the same journal, stated that the claims \"cannot be taken seriously\".[72]/nWickramasinghe and his mentor Fred Hoyle have also used their data to argue in favor of cosmic ancestry,[73][74][75][76][77][78] and against the idea of life emerging from inanimate objects by abiogenesis.[79]/nOnce again the Universe gives the appearance of being biologically constructed, and on this occasion on a truly vast scale. Once again those who consider such thoughts to be too outlandish to be taken seriously will continue to do so. While we ourselves shall continue to take the view that those who believe they can match the complexities of the Universe by simple experiments in their laboratories will continue to be disappointed./nWickramasinghe attempts to present scientific evidence to support the notion of cosmic ancestry and \"the possibility of high intelligence in the Universe and of many increasing levels of intelligence converging toward a God as an ideal limit.\"[80]/nDuring the 1981 scientific creationist trial in Arkansas, Wickramasinghe was the only scientist testifying for the defense, which in turn was supporting creationism.[79][81] In addition, he wrote that the Archaeopteryx fossil finding is a forgery, a charge that the scientific community considers an \"absurd\" and \"ignorant\" statement.[82][83]/nWickramasinghe was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to science, astronomy and astrobiology.[84]", "58233200": "Mihnea Popa (born 11 August 1973) is a Romanian-American mathematician at Harvard University, specializing in algebraic geometry.[1]  He is known for his work on complex birational geometry, Hodge theory, abelian varieties, and vector bundles./nPopa received his bachelor's degree in 1996 from the University of Bucharest.

He acknowledged the sudden nature of the decision and its impact on the preparations for the exams, which involved approximately 500,000 students.[38]/nIn August 2020, El-Tom argued against closing schools due to the pandemic, stating that many students would quit school and start working in markets, and a large part of the student body would forget previous lessons. However, he conceded to the Health Emergency Committee.[39] In September 2020, the Ministry of Education declared a delay in the school opening date, initially set for the 27th of that month, to 22 November. This decision was made in response to the unpreparedness of many schools across different regions of Sudan, which were adversely affected by floods and heavy rainfall.[40]/nIn November 2020, the World Bank Board of Directors approved an education project supported by a $61.5 million grant to support preparatory education in Sudan to maintain and improve basic education for children, with significant support for teachers, schools and communities. The project was planned to enhance the government's ability to formulate policies and monitor progress across the education system. This grant for education constituted the largest funding to support basic education in Sudan. The project covered all public schools, prioritising investment in disadvantaged and marginalised areas. In early 2020, the Global Partnership for Education provided an additional $11 million grant to support Sudan in strengthening programs to respond to the country's education needs in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.[41]/nIn November 2020, as part of an initiative to give 50,000 out-of-school children access to high-quality formal and informal education, the Education Above All (EAA) Foundation and its partner UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federal Ministry of Education of Sudan. According to a statement from EAA, the project was planned to put a special emphasis on enhancing learning environments and building capacity to ensure that children who are deprived of education receive a quality education, as well as increasing community involvement and raising awareness of the value of access to and enrolment in primary education.[42]/nEl-Tom's ministry had taken steps to reform the educational system in Sudan while advocating for \"free education for all\" by 2030. Regarding the curricula and their changes, El-Tom believed that the general trend, regardless of the subject, is to take into account the student's age and the readiness of their mind to absorb the material.[43] El-Tom addressed the debate about adjusting the number of Qur\u2019an surahs for a specific stage. He clarified that when choosing a surah for a six-year-old, it should align with specific objectives and the child's ability to memorise and understand it effortlessly.[44][35] This task was carried out by the National Center for Educational Curricula, Training, Guidance and Research, led by Omer al-Qarray, which revised and developed elementary school curricula from grade one to grade six in 2020.[27]/nA public debate ensued involving politicians, clerics, and journalists over proposals to change the school curricula, led by the Director of Curricula at the Ministry of Education, Omar Al-Qarai. At the same time, education experts and activists opposed the change. The controversy began after a proposal for a new history book for the sixth grade was leaked. Specifically, the painting The Creation of Adam by Renaissance artist Michelangelo caused controversy due to claims of it being heretical.[45] In January 2021, discussions about the curricula emerged on social media among Sudanese individuals. Additionally, accounts and pages were created that either criticized or supported Omar Al-Qarai.[46] The situation worsened as a video emerged featuring imam Muhammad Al-Amin Ismail, shedding tears during the Friday Khutbah.[47] In the video, he expressed his disappointment regarding the content in the new curricula before launching a criticism against Al-Qarai.[48][49]/nThe head of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, Minni Minnawi, tweeted that the campaign led by some imams do not stem from motives to preserve religion, but rather was a political campaign aimed at obstructing change that begins with the educational curricula. The political secretary of the Justice and Equality Movement, Suleiman Sandal, stated in press statements that \"a school curriculum will not be taught to our children that contains images that embody God while we are in the government\". The leader of the National Umma Party, Abd al-Rahman al-Ghali, incited the government to dismiss al-Qarai pointing to Al-Qari's intellectual and political background as a member of the Republican Brotherhood, whose founder, Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, was executed in 1985 on charges of apostasy.[50][51]/nThe educational expert, Mubarak Yahya, head of the Sudanese Coalition for Education for All, criticised the regression of the curricula issue to the political arena and the quarrels that it entailed. He said that the curricula required a national conference to ensure proper construction of them at a high professional level and societal values and advice, far from politics. However a member of the Central Council of the Sudanese Gathering of the Teachers Committee, Ammar Yusef, believed that there is a campaign against Al-Qari behind which supporters of the former regime stand. But he pointed out that the Teachers' Committee did not participate in developing the new curricula.[50][52]/nOmer al-Qarray blamed the Minister of Religious Affairs and Endowments, Nasr al-Din Mufreh, for his silence even when some clerics called for his death. Al-Qari had insisted that he would not step down unless a decision was taken to cancel the curricula in response to pressure.[53][54] However,  Al-Qarai resigned soon afterwards on 7 January 2021.[55]/nThe Sudanese Teachers Committee affirmed that there would be no turning back from the project of radical change in the education system that was initiated by the Ministry of Education, and great strides were made in it.[56]/nPrime Minister Abdallah Hamdok formed a national committee to review the curricula, and to submit its report after two weeks. The committee ensured that specialists prepared each subject and that the curriculum met high-quality educational goals, professional and national standards, and was teachable.[57]/nOn 8 February 2021, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok issued a decision to relieve the ministers of the transitional government from their positions in preparation of a new government formation.[58] The statement added that the ministers would continue in their positions as caretakers until the formation of the new government and the completion of handover procedures once the Transitional Sovereignty Council had announced the formation of the new government. The statement indicated that the new formation would not include the name of a Minister of Education, as consultations were still taking place regarding this ministry.[59]/nEl-Tom was excluded from the new cabinet's nomination list by the Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who submitted the list to the Transitional Sovereignty Council under the pretext that El-Tom had failed a \"security check\". The Sudanese Teachers Committee protested the exclusion.[60][61] El-Tom considered his exclusion from the ministry due to a failed security check a \u201cdisgrace to his reputation\u201d, which caused him \"psychological harm\". He told Al-Ekhbari: \"I am now an accused citizen, and those accusing me must prove whether I am an agent, or have I committed a crime, or been involved in corruption, or what?\".[62] He mentioned that he received calls questioning if he had committed any wrongdoing that might have led to his exclusion from the ministry.[63][64]/nThe Teachers Committee - the leading component of the Sudanese Professionals Association - announced its rejection of the partisan quota of the ministry, and supported El-Tom. In May 2021 and after two months of the post being vacant, a memorandum calling on the Prime Minister to name El-Tom as Minister of Education was signed by a group of civil society organisations, university professors and intellectuals.[65] The memorandum also demanded the approval of the laws drawn up by the competent committees to reform education including the Public Education Law of 2020, the Private Education Law of 2020, and the Law of the National Center for Educational Curricula, Training, Guidance and Research 2020.[66][67]/nIn April 2021, the Ministry of Education denied that El-Tom has resigned, contrary to what was being circulated on social media.[68][69] However, on 26 August 2021, El-Tom announced that he had submitted his resignation letter to Hamdok because Hamdok sanctioned the new curriculum, after it had been approved by the Minister of Education.[70]/nAfterwards, Hamdok demanded that each book of the textbooks be carefully reviewed by authors, language specialists and designers, including illustrators and makers of pictures. Hamdok also requested that the draft of the book be sent to reviewers specialised in the subject of each book. Hamdok called for the rewriting of the history book for the sixth grade and the preservation of the contested surahs without removing any of the verses, and keeping all the units and lessons that were removed from the mathematics textbooks.[71] Hamdok met with delegations of Islamic and Christian clerics, alongside the Minister of Religious Affairs, Nasr al-Din Mufreh, to discuss reviewing the curriculum developed under Omer al-Qarray's leadership at the National Curriculum Center.[72]/nEl-Tom is married with three children.[60]/nEl-Tom was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (FIMA) in 1978,[73] and a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences (FAAS) in 1986.[74] He was a member of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste, Italy, between 1984 and 1989.

He was also an Eastern Orthodox cleric (Metropolitan of Nafpaktos), physician, physicist, astronomer, mathematician, author, educator and geographer. His philosophical thought kept influencing Greek education for two hundred years after its inception.[1]/nCorydalleus was born in Korydallos, Attica. It was renamed from Pachy in 1923 to honor him. Korydalleus finished his initial education in Athens. From 1604 to 1608 he attended Saint Athanasius college in Rome. He continued his studies in medicine and philosophy at the University of Padua. He received his doctorate at the university on June 5 of 1613. Galileo Galilei was the chair of the mathematics department until 1610. Korydalleus met Cesare Cremonini who influenced the young Greek with Neo-Aristotelian thought. The new idea distanced Aristotelian thought from the clasp of the church's medieval Scholasticism and Averroism.[2][3][4][5]/nThe new philosophical interpretation attempted to liberate Aristotelian thought from ecclesiastical control and apologetic objectives. The interpretation was dangerous because it was suspicious to Church authorities. The system possessed secular atheistic views. Korydalleus carefully implemented his system of Neo-Aristotelianism and avoided confrontation with the Orthodox doctrine. He felt Aristotelian philosophy should exclude Platonic influences. He felt that it should not be changed within the context of a dialogue with theology. This exhibits a major shift from Neoplatonic Byzantine views on Aristotle. His work analyzed the conflict between the Christian conception of Creation and Aristotelian ideas on the eternity of substance.[6][7]/nHe taught Italian, Greek, and Latin in Venice from 1608 to 1609 at the Flanginian School, in Athens 1613\u201319, 1643\u201346, in Cephalonia (1619\u201321), and in Zakynthos 1621\u201322, 1628\u201336. Korydalleus was the director of the Patriarchal Academy of Constantinople     1622\u201323, 1625\u201328, 1636\u201340. He translated numerous texts from Latin, such as those by Cesare Cremonini.[8][9]\nCremonini was Corydalleus's mentor but he was also involved in the Galileo affair. In 1633, Galileo was prosecuted by the Roman Catholic Inquisition for his support of heliocentrism. The astronomical model assumed the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Cremonini did not support Galileo, he also refused to look through his telescope and he stanchly supported Aristotle's idea that the moon was smooth. Galileo contradicted the Aristotelian idea of the incorruptibly perfect smooth Moon. Ptolemy's geocentric model was used by the Catholic Church until its decline./nCorydalleus was appointed director of the Patriarchal Academy of Constantinople by patriarch Cyril Lucaris. Korydalleus reorganized the educational curriculum following the Neo-Aristotelian model. The model emancipated philosophy from theology. Science was reintroduced to schools which led to a revolution for Orthodox education. There was a renewal of interest in Hellenic literature. The drawback of this reintroduction was that Ancient Greek thought superseded the new scientific advancement put forth by Galileo Galilei, Copernicus, and contemporaries. This is clearly demonstrated with Corydalleus's works on Claudius Ptolemy and Aristotle. A major debate at the time was Heliocentrism. In this respect, the Byzantine curriculum continued. Historians view the period of Loukaris and Korydalleus as \"Orthodox humanism.\" The upside to the isolation of thought was an attempt to continue Greek identity in the Ottoman Empire. Most of his works served as textbooks until the nineteenth century.[10][11]/nCorydalleus eventually became a presbyter. He took on the name Theodosius in 1622. He served as archbishop of Arta and Naupactus from 1640 to 1642. His academic interests superseded his ecclesiastical endeavors. He devoted his life to teaching. Corydalleus was criticized and suspected of atheism. Calvinism and Protestantism were brought into the Orthodox world both Corydalleus and Cyril Lucaris were accused of following the new faith. Corydalleus was never seriously persecuted and continued to teach, his student's included: patriarch Nectarius of Jerusalem, loannis Karyophyllis, Meletios Syrigos, Evgenios Yannoulis, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, and Georgios Sougdouris. Corydalleus's Neo-Aristotelianism became the philosophical education in southeastern Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of his works can still be found in the libraries of Bucharest and Jassy.[12][13]/nAt one point Corydalleus's influence was so strong the system disallowed new philosophical thought. The system sanctioned by the Church was known as Corydalism. Eventually Methodios Anthrakites tried to abandon Aristotelianism and was teaching modern western philosophy but he was ordered to teach solely Aristotelian philosophy based on Corydalleus's tradition. \nIn the first half of the 18th century, there were debates between Aristotelians namely Dorotheos Lesvios and non-Aristotelians Nikolaos Zerzoulis. Zerzoulis tried to explain Aristotle's authority in the church by showing discrepancies between several Aristotelian and Christian views./nThe Modern Greek Enlightenment during the second half of the 18th century presented alternatives to Neo-Aristotelian thought or Corydalism. Both Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic cosmology were under attack. Corydalism continued to flourish until the Greek revolution. Corydalleus's contributions were of great importance to the development of Greek education during a period of transition from the post-Byzantine era to the age of the Greek Enlightenment.[14][15]/nCorydalleus wrote a funeral oration which he performed in Constantinople around 1630\u20131640. Poulcheria was a Greek woman who died young. She was a member of an aristocratic family who were members of the Phanariotic society. The discourse was preserved in five manuscripts. Corydalleus utilized Aristotelian doctrines discussing the separation of the soul from the body. The Immortality of the soul. The meaning of fear and the perception of time. Corydalleus implements Demotic Greek mixed with Ancient Greek wording and stylistic elements.[16]/nReligious scholar Vasilios N. Makrides suggests that Corydalleus's Neo-Aristotelian legacy was not an entirely positive one, stating that/nBy the end of the eighteenth century, it had become a hindrance to introducing new scientific ideas from Europe. This is why the Greek bearers of Enlightenment ideas criticized it, and why scores of scholars entered into debates about the validity of Neo-Aristotelianism and its place alongside Christian doctrine.[17]/nIn contrast, Anastasios Tamis believes that Corydalleus's appointment as director of the academy/n... was of paramount importance for the transmission of humanist and secular thought and culture into the Greek lands under the Turkish yoke. Corydalleus reorganised the Academy of the Patriarchate along the lines of Padua University, imposing a secular philosophy as the basis for higher education, and thus breaking away from its connection with theology.[18]", "58691991": "C.

Herrington is best known for being the founder of the project and foundation Stop Straatintimidatie, an initiative seeking to criminalize street harassment in the Netherlands, and for her activism and research on sustainability issues./nHerrington has worked in senior sustainability-related positions for De Nederlandsche Bank, KPMG US and Schneider Electric and holds master's degrees in both econometrics and sustainability studies. In 2021, her study on the projections made in the 1972 sustainability report The Limits to Growth was widely publicized internationally./nHerrington studied mathematics and econometrics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.[3] After obtaining her master's degree in econometrics, she initially worked in the financial sector before becoming disillusioned[3] and in 2007[4] she instead became the executive director of StoereVrouwen,[3] a non-profit[5] Dutch women's movement promoting sustainable economic policies through \"fresh and hip\" activism.[3][4] Following the aftermath of the Great Recession, Herrington returned to the financial sector in 2011 as an international policymaker and economic policy advisor for De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) in Amsterdam.[3][6] During her work for DNB, Herrington worked to strengthen global banking standards in an effort to prevent further recessions[3] and to work on sustainability \"from the inside out\".[4] Herrington has also pursued various other lines of work. In 2011, she worked as a singer and composer on the Dutch erotic thriller film Caged.[7] She has also worked as an actress[8] and a model.[9]/nIn 2014, Herrington moved to New York City to pursue a job as Director of Sustainability Services of KPMG US.[3][10] In this role, she advised KPMG's clients in America on business strategies, long-term risk management and sustainability.[6] At KPMG, Herrington developed and implemented the \"KPMG Dynamic Assessment\" method, a holistic and analytic technique based on a triple bottom line (economic, social and environmental). Her technique was applied for various applications, including modelling climate change risks.[11] From 2016 to 2017 Herrington wrote articles for Vileine, a Dutch-language feminist platform for media, political and cultural analysis, detailing her personal experienes in the United States.[3]/nIn addition to working with KPMG US, Herrington also studied Sustainability Studies at Harvard University, obtaining her master's degree in 2020.[1][6] Herrington's master's thesis was published in November 2020[6][12] and was an analysis based on the 1972 sustainability report The Limits to Growth in Yale University's Journal of Industrial Ecology.[13] Herrington's study, Update to Limits to Growth, assessed whether, given key data known in 2020 about factors important for the Limits to Growth report, the original report's conclusions are supported. In particular, the 2020 study examined updated quantitative information about ten factors, namely population, fertility rates, mortality rates, industrial output, food production, services, non-renewable resources, persistent pollution, human welfare, and ecological footprint, and concluded that the Limits to Growth prediction is essentially correct in that continued economic growth is unsustainable under a \"business as usual\" scenario. The study found that current empirical data is broadly consistent with the 1972 projections, and that if major changes to the consumption of resources are not undertaken, economic growth will peak and then rapidly decline by around 2040.[14][15]/nHer study made headlines around the world in July 2021,[16] being publicized in major newspapers in the United States and in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Greece, China, Sri Lanka and other countries. Herrington was surprised by the sudden surge in attention and by the news headlines used,[12] since they suggested that her research suddenly demonstrated that the planet was on the brink of collapse. Herrington believed this to simplify the message and discount that she had confirmed predictions that were almost half a century old.[12] She was subsequently interviewed in The Guardian[1] and was a guest on sustainability-related podcasts.[11] In a 2022 article, Herrington stated that she \"did not predict the end of the world\" but instead that humanity now had \"a now or never opportunity to change direction\".[12] Also in 2022, Herrington was a contributing author to Limits and Beyond, a book published by the Swiss think-thank The Club of Rome exploring what has been done since the publication of The Limits of Growth and what can be done next.[17]/nAs of 2022, Herrington presently works as the Vice President of ESG Research (environment, social and governance research) at Schneider Electric and is a member of, and advisor to, The Club of Rome's Transformational Economics Commission.[6][12] Herrington is a frequent presenter and speaker on sustainability topics, having held presentations and talks at several universities both in the United States and internationally,[5][11][18] as well as at events hosted by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and the United States Department of Commerce.[11]/nIn 2014, Herrington started a project against street harassment dubbed Straatintimidatie (the Dutch word for street harassment), envisioned to speed up the spreading of awareness and to fight the problem. The main goal of Straatintimidatie was to launch a citizen's initiative that sought to make street harassment punishable with fines.[10][19] In the Netherlands, such an initiative requires 40,000 signatures to be considered by the House of Representatives.[8][10] The initiative initially surged in signatures, reaching 8,000 in just two days,[20] but engagement then tapered of. By 2016, they had reached over 19,000 signatures.[21] Herrington initially surrounded herself with a small number of supporters, including a social media manager, an attorney who authored the proposed bill, Cees Flinterman (a professor emeritus of human rights) and Soundos El Ahmadi\u00a0[nl] (a famous Dutch comedian).[10]/nIn 2014, Herrington was a guest on the Dutch talkshow Knevel & Van den Brink\u00a0[nl] to speak on street harassment. One of the other guests was Lodewijk Asscher, the Dutch Minister of Social Affairs. Straatintimidatie have also been in conversation with Ahmed Marcouch, member of the House of Representatives.[10] Marcouch previously suggested criminalizing street harassment in 2012.[8] Herrington has remained active in Straatintimidatie after her move to the United States.[3] In 2015, she was a part of a panel discussion on street harassment in the Bluestockings bookstore and activist center in New York.[22] Straatintimidatie was re-organized into a foundation in 2016 under the name Stop Straatintimidatie and continues to operate as such to this day. Stop Straatintimidatie continues to advocate for the criminalization of street harassment and publishes relevant research and investigations.[23] In 2018, Herrington's initial goal began to be achieved as street harassment started to be fined in the cities Amsterdam and Rotterdam, with other cities later following suit.[24]/nHerrington is married and has a daughter.[5]", "6328738": "Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u02bf\u0101dh al-Jayy\u0101n\u012b[1] (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0630 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u064a\u0627\u0646\u064a; 989, Cordova, Al-Andalus \u2013 1079, Ja\u00e9n, Al-Andalus) was an Arab, mathematician, Islamic scholar, and Qadi from Al-Andalus (in present-day Spain).[2] Al-Jayy\u0101n\u012b wrote important commentaries on Euclid's Elements and he wrote the first known treatise on spherical trigonometry./nLittle is known about his life.

S. Kennedy points out that while it was possible in pre-Islamic mathematics to compute the magnitudes of a spherical figure, in principle, by use of the table of chords and Menelaus' theorem, the application of the theorem to spherical problems was very difficult in practice.[6] Al-Jayy\u0101n\u012b's work on spherical trigonometry \"contains formulae for right-handed triangles, the general law of sines, and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle.\" This treatise later had a \"strong influence on European mathematics\", and his \"definition of ratios as numbers\" and \"method of solving a spherical triangle when all sides are unknown\" are likely to have influenced Regiomontanus.[4]/nThis article about a scientist from Al-Andalus is a stub.

Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz High School, a missionary school,[20] where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife,[25] Fay (Faina[20]) Zadeh, who said that he was \"deeply influenced\" by the \"extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\" Presbyterian missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \"To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States \u2013 people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' \u2013 willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\"[26] During this time, Zadeh was awarded several patents.[25]/nZadeh sat for the Iran national university exams and placed third in the nation.[25] As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering, one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by World War II, when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.[27]/nIn 1943, Zadeh decided to leave for the United States to continue his education.[20] He travelled to Philadelphia by way of Cairo after months of delay waiting first for the proper papers and later for the right ship to appear.[citation needed] He arrived in mid-1944, lived in New York and worked for an electronic association,[20] and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a graduate student in September that year.[27][20] While in the United States, he shortened his family name, creating a new middle name from the part he removed, and was thenceforth known as Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh.[19] He received an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946./nIn 1947, as his parents had settled in New York City, Zadeh went to work as an engineer at Columbia University.[20] Zadeh then applied to Columbia University.[27][20] Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student and offered him an instructorship as well.[27] He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949 and became an assistant professor the next year.[24][27] Zadeh taught for ten years at Columbia and was promoted to full professor in 1957./nThe chairman of the electronic engineering department at the University of California, wrote and offered him work.[20] In 1959, Zadeh joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. During his lengthy research career, Zadeh made important scientific contributions in two distinct areas: (1) linear system theory and classical control systems, and (2) fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and related science and technology./nZadeh was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 for Natural Sciences in Applied Mathematics.[28]/nZadeh's first important research contribution, well known among scholars of his generation in the electrical engineering community, was in the area of classical control systems. His pioneer work, co-authored with Charles Desoer, Linear System Theory: The State Space Approach, laid a critical foundation for all modern approaches to system analysis and control.[29] The second and more well-known contribution of Zadeh's research is his lifelong dedication to the creation, enhancement and the real-world impacts of a broad collection of science and technology  based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic.  He published his seminal work on fuzzy sets in 1965, in which he described the motivation of replicating human-like reasoning and detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory./nIn 1973 he proposed his theory of fuzzy logic.  Together, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic provide the necessary foundations for a broad class of related innovations, including (but not limited to):/nHe was also on the Board of Governors for International Neural Network Society (INNIS) in 2003./nZadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963. One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science. He initiated and completed (in 1968) the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley's advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments. \nIn 1973, Lotfi Zadeh received the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS. Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships: Academic Planning & Resource Allocation (1992\u201395); Committees (1969\u201370; 1980\u201381); Courses of Instruction (1975\u201380); and Faculty Awards (1990\u201392). Professor Zadeh graduated more than 50 PhD students, many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering, management and information sciences.[30]/nZadeh photographed people around him.[31]/nZadeh was called \"quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life\", and was quoted as saying in an interview: \"The question really isn't whether I'm American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else. I've been shaped by all these people and cultures, and I feel quite comfortable among all of them.\"[33] He noted in the same interview: \"Obstinacy and tenacity, not being afraid to get embroiled in controversy \u2013 that's very much a Turkish tradition. That's part of my character, too. I can be very stubborn. That has probably been beneficial for the development of fuzzy logic.\"[34] He described himself as \"an American, mathematically oriented, electrical engineer of Iranian descent, born in Russia.\"[24]/nHe and his wife Fay Zadeh had two children, Stella and Norman Zada. His wife wrote a book, My Life and Travels with the Father of Fuzzy Logic[35] about their travels and experiences together, visiting \"exotic places\" and meeting interesting people around the world./nZadeh died in his home in Berkeley, California,[4] on 6 September 2017, at the age of 96.[1][3][unreliable source?] He was buried at the First Alley of Honors, on  29 September 2017[36] in Baku, Azerbaijan, the city in which he was born.[4] His funeral was well attended by \"highly respected people.\"[37] A month prior to his death, the University of Tehran had released an erroneous report that Zadeh had died, but withdrew it several days later.[38]/nAccording to Google Scholar, as of November 2021, Zadeh's work has been cited at least 269,091 times in scholarly works,[39] with the 1965 Fuzzy sets paper receiving at least 122,743 citations.[40]/nZadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval [0,1]) operating on the domain of all possible values.  He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that fuzzy logic was a generalisation of classical and Boolean logic. He also proposed fuzzy numbers as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).[41]/nZadeh's research career has had a lasting impact on artificial intelligence (AI).  Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are both motivated by our understanding of human cognition: that we are comfortable with concepts that have vague boundaries. This is well aligned with the Physical symbol system assumption in AI (by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon), inspired by another aspect of human cognition: that humans are comfortable with concepts that are described by symbols./nThe concept of a linguistic variable in fuzzy logic connects a symbol that is typically a predicate in classical logic (e.g., \"John is Bold\", or in predicate logic \u2013 Bold(John)) \u2013 to linguistic values (e.g., \"John is somewhat bold.\" or in fuzzy logic \u2013 Bold(John)=Somewhat ) \u2013 which generalizes the binary value of predicate logic in two ways. \nFirst, the two possible values (True or False) in predicate logic are generalized to a continuum (typically from 0, which corresponds to False, to 1, which corresponds to True). This allows the expression of Bold(John)= 0.5, which indicates that John is midway between being devoid of boldness and being entirely bold./nThe second generalization enabled by fuzzy logic is to use a fuzzy set such as \"somewhat bold\" to describe a person's boldness level in a way that is more natural to human understanding and communication.  Without this generalization, we can only describe the value of a person's boldness as a number (e.g., 0.5) or as an interval (e.g., [0.25, 0.75]).  With this generalization, one can express the semantic meaning of \"somewhat bold\" as a fuzzy set in the domain of 0 and 1./nZadeh was also an active contributor to the AI community, including at the Dartmouth Workshop that coined the term \"artificial intelligence\". He was subsequently a frequent contributor to leading AI conferences such as AAAI and IJCAI, as well as other top venues such as AI Magazine./nZadeh is credited, along with John R. Ragazzini, in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the Z-transform method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in digital signal processing, digital control, and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research. He was an editor of the International Journal of Computational Cognition./nZadeh's work also included computing with words and perceptions. His later papers include \"From Search Engines to Question-Answering Systems\"[42] and \"Toward a Generalized Theory of Uncertainty (GTU)\u2014An Outline\".[43]/nA complete list of publications is available.[44]/nZadeh was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Association for Computing Machinery, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the International Fuzzy Systems Association, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.[5] He was also a member of the Academies of Science of Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Finland, Korea and Poland, and of the International Academy of Systems Studies in Moscow. He received 24 honorary doctorates.[7]/nAwards received by Zadeh include, among many others:/nIn 2014, the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society established the \"Lotfi A. Zadeh Pioneer Award\", which is given to honour a person or persons with \"outstanding and pioneering contributions to academic and/or industrial research in systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and/or cybernetics.\"  The award is funded from a $100,000 donation from Zadeh's son, Norm Zadeh, and is administered by the IEEE.

Winners of the scholarship receive a complete tuition waiver for the semester or semester-equivalent in which they achieved a 4.0 average.[54]/nOn 4 February 2021, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA) jointly celebrated the centenary of Zadeh's birth.[55]/nOn 30 November 2021, Google honored Zadeh with a Google Doodle.[56][57] His seminal paper Fuzzy sets was submitted for publication on this day in 1964.[8][56]", "70085": "Sir Joseph John Thomson OM FRS[1] (18 December 1856 \u2013 30 August 1940) was a British physicist and Nobel Laureate in Physics, credited with the discovery of the electron, the first subatomic particle to be found./nIn 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (now called electrons), which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large charge-to-mass ratio.[2] Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph.[2][3]/nThomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the conduction of electricity in gases.[4] Thomson was also a teacher, and seven of his students went on to win Nobel Prizes: Ernest Rutherford (Chemistry 1908), Lawrence Bragg (Physics 1915), Charles Barkla (Physics 1917), Francis Aston (Chemistry 1922), Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (Physics 1927), Owen Richardson (Physics 1928) and Edward Victor Appleton (Physics 1947).[5] Only Arnold Sommerfeld's record of mentorship offers a comparable list of high-achieving students./nJoseph John Thomson was born on 18 December 1856 in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Lancashire, England. His mother, Emma Swindells, came from a local textile family. His father, Joseph James Thomson, ran an antiquarian bookshop founded by Thomson's great-grandfather. He had a brother, Frederick Vernon Thomson, who was two years younger than he was.[6] J. J. Thomson was a reserved yet devout Anglican.[7][8][9]/nHis early education was in small private schools where he demonstrated outstanding talent and interest in science. In 1870, he was admitted to Owens College in Manchester (now University of Manchester) at the unusually young age of 14 and came under the influence of Balfour Stewart, Professor of Physics, who initiated Thomson into physical research.[10] Thomson began experimenting with contact electrification and soon published his first scientific paper.[11] His parents planned to enrol him as an apprentice engineer to Sharp, Stewart & Co, a locomotive manufacturer, but these plans were cut short when his father died in 1873.[6]/nHe moved on to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1876. In 1880, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics (Second Wrangler in the Tripos[12] and 2nd Smith's Prize).[13]  He applied for and became a Fellow of Trinity College in 1881.[14]  He received his Master of Arts degree (with Adams Prize) in 1883.[13]/nIn 1890, Thomson married Rose Elisabeth Paget at the church of St. Mary the Less. Rose, who was the daughter of Sir George Edward Paget, a physician and then Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, was interested in physics. Beginning in 1882, women could attend demonstrations and lectures at the University of Cambridge. Rose attended demonstrations and lectures, among them Thomson's, leading to their relationship.[15]/nThey had two children: George Paget Thomson, who was also awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on the wave properties of the electron, and Joan Paget Thomson (later Charnock),[16] who became an author, writing children's books, non-fiction and biographies.[17]/nOn 22 December 1884, Thomson was appointed Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge.[2] The appointment caused considerable surprise, given that candidates such as Osborne Reynolds or Richard Glazebrook were older and more experienced in laboratory work.  Thomson was known for his work as a mathematician, where he was recognised as an exceptional talent.[18]/nHe was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1906, \"in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the conduction of electricity by gases.\" He was knighted in 1908 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1912. In 1914, he gave the Romanes Lecture in Oxford on \"The atomic theory\". In 1918, he became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death. He died on 30 August 1940; his ashes rest in Westminster Abbey,[19] near the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and his former student Ernest Rutherford.[20]/nRutherford succeeded him as Cavendish Professor of Physics. Six of Thomson's research assistants and junior colleagues (Charles Glover Barkla,[21] Niels Bohr,[22] Max Born,[23] William Henry Bragg, Owen Willans Richardson[24] and Charles Thomson Rees Wilson[1]) won Nobel Prizes in physics, and two (Francis William Aston[25] and Ernest Rutherford[26]) won Nobel prizes in chemistry. Thomson's son (George Paget Thomson) also won the 1937 Nobel Prize in physics for proving the wave-like properties of electrons.[27]/nThomson's prize-winning master's work, Treatise on the motion of vortex rings, shows his early interest in atomic structure.[4]  In it, Thomson mathematically described the motions of William Thomson's vortex theory of atoms.[18]/nThomson published a number of papers addressing both mathematical and experimental issues of electromagnetism.  He examined the electromagnetic theory of light of James Clerk Maxwell, introduced the concept of electromagnetic mass of a charged particle, and demonstrated that a moving charged body would apparently increase in mass.[18]/nMuch of his work in mathematical modelling of chemical processes can be thought of as early computational chemistry.[2] In further work, published in book form as Applications of dynamics to physics and chemistry (1888), Thomson addressed the transformation of energy in mathematical and theoretical terms, suggesting that all energy might be kinetic.[18] His next book, Notes on recent researches in electricity and magnetism (1893), built upon Maxwell's Treatise upon electricity and magnetism, and was sometimes referred to as \"the third volume of Maxwell\".[4] In it, Thomson emphasized physical methods and experimentation and included extensive figures and diagrams of apparatus, including a number for the passage of electricity through gases.[18] His third book, Elements of the mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism (1895)[28] was a readable introduction to a wide variety of subjects, and achieved considerable popularity as a textbook.[18]/nA series of four lectures, given by Thomson on a visit to Princeton University in 1896, were subsequently published as Discharge of electricity through gases (1897).  Thomson also presented a series of six lectures at Yale University in 1904.[4]/nSeveral scientists, such as William Prout and Norman Lockyer, had suggested that atoms were built up from a more fundamental unit, but they envisioned this unit to be the size of the smallest atom, hydrogen. Thomson in 1897 was the first to suggest that one of the fundamental units of the atom was more than 1,000 times smaller than an atom, suggesting the subatomic particle now known as the electron. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson made his suggestion on 30 April 1897 following his discovery that cathode rays (at the time known as Lenard rays) could travel much further through air than expected for an atom-sized particle.[29] He estimated the mass of cathode rays by measuring the heat generated when the rays hit a thermal junction and comparing this with the magnetic deflection of the rays. His experiments suggested not only that cathode rays were over 1,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom, but also that their mass was the same in whichever type of atom they came from. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light, negatively charged particles which were a universal building block of atoms. He called the particles \"corpuscles\", but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891, prior to Thomson's actual discovery.[30]/nIn April 1897, Thomson had only early indications that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had thought they could not be). A month after Thomson's announcement of the corpuscle, he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates.[31] This became the classic means of measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron.  (The charge itself was not measured until Robert A. Millikan's oil drop experiment in 1909.)/nThomson believed that the corpuscles emerged from the atoms of the trace gas inside his cathode ray tubes. He thus concluded that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. In 1904, Thomson suggested a model of the atom, hypothesizing that it was a sphere of positive matter within which electrostatic forces determined the positioning of the corpuscles.[2]  To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge.  In this \"plum pudding model\", the electrons were seen as embedded in the positive charge like raisins in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary, but orbiting rapidly).[32][33]/nThomson made the discovery around the same time that Walter Kaufmann and Emil Wiechert discovered the correct mass to charge ratio of these cathode rays (electrons).[34]/nIn 1912, as part of his exploration into the composition of the streams of positively charged particles then known as canal rays, Thomson and his research assistant F. W. Aston channelled a stream of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured its deflection by placing a photographic plate in its path.[6] They observed two patches of light on the photographic plate (see image on right), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection, and concluded that neon is composed of atoms of two different atomic masses (neon-20 and neon-22), that is to say of two isotopes.[35][36] This was the first evidence for isotopes of a stable element; Frederick Soddy had previously proposed the existence of isotopes to explain the decay of certain radioactive elements./nThomson's separation of neon isotopes by their mass was the first example of mass spectrometry, which was subsequently improved and developed into a general method by F. W. Aston and by A. J. Dempster.[2][3]/nEarlier, physicists debated whether cathode rays were immaterial like light (\"some process in the aether\") or were \"in fact wholly material, and ... mark the paths of particles of matter charged with negative electricity\", quoting Thomson.[31] The aetherial hypothesis was vague,[31] but the particle hypothesis was definite enough for Thomson to test./nThomson first investigated the magnetic deflection of cathode rays. Cathode rays were produced in the side tube on the left of the apparatus and passed through the anode into the main bell jar, where they were deflected by a magnet. Thomson detected their path by the fluorescence on a squared screen in the jar. He found that whatever the material of the anode and the gas in the jar, the deflection of the rays was the same, suggesting that the rays were of the same form whatever their origin.[37]/nWhile supporters of the aetherial theory accepted the possibility that negatively charged particles are produced in Crookes tubes,[citation needed] they believed that they are a mere by-product and that the cathode rays themselves are immaterial.[citation needed] Thomson set out to investigate whether or not he could actually separate the charge from the rays./nThomson constructed a Crookes tube with an electrometer set to one side, out of the direct path of the cathode rays. Thomson could trace the path of the ray by observing the phosphorescent patch it created where it hit the surface of the tube. Thomson observed that the electrometer registered a charge only when he deflected the cathode ray to it with a magnet. He concluded that the negative charge and the rays were one and the same.[29]/nIn May\u2013June 1897, Thomson investigated whether or not the rays could be deflected by an electric field.[6] Previous experimenters had failed to observe this, but Thomson believed their experiments were flawed because their tubes contained too much gas./nThomson constructed a Crookes tube with a better vacuum. At the start of the tube was the cathode from which the rays projected. The rays were sharpened to a beam by two metal slits \u2013 the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Any electron beam would collide with some residual gas atoms within the Crookes tube, thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this space charge electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson's Crookes tube the density of residual atoms was so low that the space charge from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection./nWhen the upper plate was connected to the negative pole of the battery and the lower plate to the positive pole, the glowing patch moved downwards, and when the polarity was reversed, the patch moved upwards./nIn his classic experiment, Thomson measured the mass-to-charge ratio of the cathode rays by measuring how much they were deflected by a magnetic field and comparing this with the electric deflection. He used the same apparatus as in his previous experiment, but placed the discharge tube between the poles of a large electromagnet. He found that the mass-to-charge ratio was over a thousand times lower than that of a hydrogen ion (H+), suggesting either that the particles were very light and/or very highly charged.[31]  Significantly, the rays from every cathode yielded the same mass-to-charge ratio. This is in contrast to anode rays (now known to arise from positive ions emitted by the anode), where the mass-to-charge ratio varies from anode-to-anode.  Thomson himself remained critical of what his work established, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech referring to \"corpuscles\" rather than \"electrons\"./nThomson's calculations can be summarised as follows (in his original notation, using F instead of E for the electric field and H instead of B for the magnetic field):/nThe electric deflection is given by \n\n\n\n\u0398\n=\nF\ne\nl\n\n/\n\nm\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Theta =Fel/mv^{2}}\n\n, where \u0398 is the angular electric deflection, F is applied electric intensity, e is the charge of the cathode ray particles, l is the length of the electric plates, m is the mass of the cathode ray particles and v is the velocity of the cathode ray particles. The magnetic deflection is given by \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n=\nH\ne\nl\n\n/\n\nm\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi =Hel/mv}\n\n, where \u03c6 is the angular magnetic deflection and H is the applied magnetic field intensity./nThe magnetic field was varied until the magnetic and electric deflections were the same, when  \n\n\n\n\u0398\n=\n\u03d5\n,\nF\ne\nl\n\n/\n\nm\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n=\nH\ne\nl\n\n/\n\nm\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Theta =\\phi ,Fel/mv^{2}=Hel/mv}\n\n. This can be simplified to give \n\n\n\nm\n\n/\n\ne\n=\n\nH\n\n2\n\n\nl\n\n/\n\nF\n\u0398\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m/e=H^{2}l/F\\Theta }\n\n. The electric deflection was measured separately to give \u0398 and H, F and l were known, so m/e could be calculated./nAs the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity, are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of matter./nAs to the source of these particles, Thomson believed they emerged from the molecules of gas in the vicinity of the cathode./nIf, in the very intense electric field in the neighbourhood of the cathode, the molecules of the gas are dissociated and are split up, not into the ordinary chemical atoms, but into these primordial atoms, which we shall for brevity call corpuscles; and if these corpuscles are charged with electricity and projected from the cathode by the electric field, they would behave exactly like the cathode rays./nThomson imagined the atom as being made up of these corpuscles orbiting in a sea of positive charge; this was his plum pudding model. This model was later proved incorrect when his student Ernest Rutherford showed that the positive charge is concentrated in the nucleus of the atom./nIn 1905, Thomson discovered the natural radioactivity of potassium.[39]/nIn 1906, Thomson demonstrated that hydrogen had only a single electron per atom.

His mother is American and his father, a physicist, is from Iran.[1] He graduated from the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia.[2] He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and math from the University of Virginia and a PhD in math from the University of Maryland, College Park.[3]/nIn 2002, he won a Sloan-Swartz Fellowship in Theoretical Neurobiology at the California Institute of Technology, and in 2007 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Changizi also conducted research at the University College Cork and Duke University.[1]/nChangizi says that visual illusions are due to a neural lag which most humans experience while awake. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd. Although not the first to suggest this idea, he was the first to show how the idea can explain and unify a large variety of perceptual illusions.[4][5]/nIn 2010, together with colleague Dr. Tim Barber, Changizi started the research institute 2ai Labs, with the idea to start tech companies based on his research, and subsequently bring funding toward further research at the institute.[6] Changizi took the post of director of human cognition at 2ai.[7]", "37332": "Josiah Willard Gibbs (/\u0261\u026abz/;[2] February 11, 1839 \u2013 April 28, 1903) was an American scientist who made significant theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous inductive science. Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, he created statistical mechanics (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics.  As a mathematician, he invented modern vector calculus (independently of the British scientist Oliver Heaviside, who carried out similar work during the same period)./nIn 1863, Yale awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was a professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death in 1903. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by Albert Einstein as \"the greatest mind in American history.\"[3] In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London,[3] \"for his contributions to mathematical physics.\"[4]/nCommentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century New England and the great international impact of his ideas.  Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to Robert A. Millikan, in pure science, Gibbs \"did for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure.\"[5]/nGibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He belonged to an old Yankee family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of Josiah Willard Gibbs Sr., and his wife Mary Anna, n\u00e9e Van Cleve. On his father's side, he was descended from Samuel Willard, who served as acting President of Harvard College from 1701 to 1707. On his mother's side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. Jonathan Dickinson, the first president of the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University). Gibbs's given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 18th century.[6] His paternal grandmother, Mercy (Prescott) Gibbs, was the sister of Rebecca Minot Prescott Sherman, the wife of American founding father Roger Sherman; and he was the second cousin of Roger Sherman Baldwin, see the Amistad case below./nThe elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as \"Josiah\", while the son was called \"Willard\".[7] Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at Yale Divinity School from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the abolitionist who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship Amistad, allowing them to testify during the trial that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves.[8]/nWillard Gibbs was educated at the Hopkins School and entered Yale College in 1854 at the age of 15. At Yale, Gibbs received prizes for excellence in mathematics and Latin, and he graduated in 1858, near the top of his class.[9] He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the Sheffield Scientific School. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.[10]/nRelatively few documents from the period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision.[11] In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician Hubert Anson Newton, a leading authority on meteors, who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant.[10][11] After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.[12]/nRecurrent pulmonary trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to tuberculosis, which had killed his mother. He also suffered from astigmatism, whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to oculists, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses.[13][14] Though in later years he used glasses only for reading or other close work,[13] Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the Civil War of 1861\u201365.[15]  He was not conscripted and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.[16]/nIn 1863, Gibbs received the first Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled \"On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing\", in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for gears.[9][18][19] In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a PhD degree[20] and Gibbs's was only the fifth PhD granted in the US in any subject.[18]/nAfter graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the college for a term of three years. During the first two years, he taught Latin and during the third year, he taught \"natural philosophy\" (i.e., physics).[6] In 1866, he patented a design for a railway brake[21] and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled \"The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length\", in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.[22]/nAfter his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866\u201367 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the Sorbonne and the Coll\u00e8ge de France, given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as Joseph Liouville and Michel Chasles.[23] Having undertaken a punishing regimen of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the Riviera, where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.[24]/nMoving to Berlin, Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker, as well as by chemist Heinrich Gustav Magnus.[25]  In August 1867, Gibbs's sister Julia was married in Berlin to Addison Van Name, who had been Gibbs's classmate at Yale.  The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany.[26] In Heidelberg, Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz, and chemist Robert Bunsen. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and thermodynamics.[27]/nGibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students.[28]  It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine governor, his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering.[29][30]  In 1871, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.[31]/nGibbs published his first work in 1873.[9] His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy. These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, such as the ones that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena.[32]  Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct. He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.[33][34]/nMaxwell included a chapter on Gibbs's work in the next edition of his Theory of Heat, published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs's graphical methods in a lecture to the Chemical Society of London and even referred to it in the article on \"Diagrams\" that he wrote for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.[35][36] Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that \"only one man lived who could understand Gibbs's papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead.\"[37]/nGibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one form of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications.  He described that research in a monograph titled \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\", published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations,[38] begins with a quotation from Rudolf Clausius that expresses what would later be called the first and second laws of thermodynamics: \"The energy of the world is constant. The entropy of the world tends towards a maximum.\"[39]/nGibbs's monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations.[40] The work has been described as \"the Principia of thermodynamics\" and as a work of \"practically unlimited scope\".[38] It solidly laid the foundation for physical Chemistry.[41] Wilhelm Ostwald, who translated Gibbs's monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the \"founder of chemical energetics\".[42] According to modern commentators,/nIt is universally recognised that its publication was an event of the first importance in the history of chemistry\u00a0... Nevertheless it was a number of years before its value was generally known, this delay was due largely to the fact that its mathematical form and rigorous deductive processes make it difficult reading for anyone, and especially so for students of experimental chemistry whom it most concerns./nGibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.[43]/nFrom 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the exterior algebra of Hermann Grassmann into a vector calculus well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the dot and cross products of two vectors and introduced the concept of dyadics. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the quaternionic calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with Peter Guthrie Tait and others in the pages of Nature.[6]/nGibbs's lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by Edwin Bidwell Wilson into a textbook, Vector Analysis, published in 1901.[6] That book helped to popularize the \"del\" notation that is widely used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the \"Gibbs phenomenon\" in the theory of Fourier series (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, Henry Wilbraham).[45]/nFrom 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on physical optics, in which he investigated birefringence and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of Lord Kelvin and others.[6] In his work on optics, just as much as in his work on thermodynamics,[46] Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts. The methods that he used were highly original and the obtained results showed decisively the correctness of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.[47]/nGibbs coined the term statistical mechanics and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of chemical potential (1876),[28] and statistical ensemble (1902).[48] Gibbs's derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, published in 1902, a year before his death.[46]/nGibbs's retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that \"except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home\u2014a little exercise between work and dinner\u2014and one might occasionally come across him at that time.\"[49] Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by Irving Fisher in 1891.[50] After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his Collected Works.[51] Another distinguished student was Lee De Forest, later a pioneer of radio technology.[52]/nGibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, the victim of an acute intestinal obstruction.[49] A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121\u00a0High Street,[53] and his body was buried in the nearby Grove Street Cemetery. In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory. The eminent British physicist J. J. Thomson was in attendance and delivered a brief address.[54]/nGibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the Adirondacks (at Keene Valley, New York) and later at the White Mountains (in Intervale, New Hampshire),[56] his sojourn in Europe in 1866\u201369 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven.[6] He joined Yale's College Church (a Congregational church) at the end of his freshman year[56][57] and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life.[58] Gibbs generally voted for the Republican candidate in presidential elections but, like other \"Mugwumps\", his concern over the growing corruption associated with machine politics led him to support Grover Cleveland, a conservative Democrat, in the election of 1884.[59]  Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.[58]/nGibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed.[60] Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for Rudolf Clausius, one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H. A. Newton.[61]  In Edward Bidwell Wilson's view,/nGibbs was not an advertiser for personal renown nor a propagandist for science; he was a scholar, scion of an old scholarly family, living before the days when research had become r\u00e9search\u00a0... Gibbs was not a freak, he had no striking ways, he was a kindly dignified gentleman./nAccording to Lynde Wheeler, who had been Gibbs's student at Yale, in his later years Gibbs/nwas always neatly dressed, usually wore a felt hat on the street, and never exhibited any of the physical mannerisms or eccentricities sometimes thought to be inseparable from genius\u00a0... His manner was cordial without being effusive and conveyed clearly the innate simplicity and sincerity of his nature./nHe was a careful investor and financial manager, and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at $100,000[56] (roughly $3.26\u00a0million today[62]). For many years, he served as trustee, secretary, and treasurer of his alma mater, the Hopkins School.[63] US President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as one of the commissioners to the National Conference of Electricians, which convened in Philadelphia in September 1884, and Gibbs presided over one of its sessions.[56] A keen and skilled horseman,[64] Gibbs was seen habitually in New Haven driving his sister's carriage.[65] In an obituary published in the American Journal of Science, Gibbs's former student Henry A. Bumstead referred to Gibbs's personal character:/nUnassuming in manner, genial and kindly in his intercourse with his fellow-men, never showing impatience or irritation, devoid of personal ambition of the baser sort or of the slightest desire to exalt himself, he went far toward realizing the ideal of the unselfish, Christian gentleman. In the minds of those who knew him, the greatness of his intellectual achievements will never overshadow the beauty and dignity of his life./nGibbs's papers from the 1870s introduced the idea of expressing the internal energy\u00a0U of a system in terms of the entropy\u00a0S, in addition to the usual state-variables of volume\u00a0V, pressure\u00a0p, and temperature\u00a0T. He also introduced the concept of the chemical potential\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mu }\n\n of a given chemical species, defined to be the rate of the increase in U associated with the increase in the number N of molecules of that species (at constant entropy and volume). Thus, it was Gibbs who first combined the first and second laws of thermodynamics by expressing the infinitesimal change in the internal energy, dU, of a closed system in the form:[46]/nwhere T is the absolute temperature, p is the pressure, dS is an infinitesimal change in entropy and dV is an infinitesimal change of volume. The last term is the sum, over all the chemical species in a chemical reaction, of the chemical potential, \u03bci, of the ith species, multiplied by the infinitesimal change in the number of moles, dNi of that species. By taking the Legendre transform of this expression, he defined the concepts of enthalpy, H  and Gibbs free energy, G./nThis compares to the expression for Helmholtz free energy, A./nWhen the Gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative the reaction will proceed spontaneously. When a chemical system is at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy is zero. An equilibrium constant is simply related to the free energy change when the reactants are in their standard states./nChemical potential is usually defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy./nGibbs also obtained what later came to be known as the \"Gibbs\u2013Duhem equation\".[66]/nIn an electrochemical reaction characterized by an electromotive force \u2130 and an amount of  transferred charge Q, Gibbs's starting equation becomes/nThe publication of the paper \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" (1874\u201378) is now regarded as a landmark in the development of chemistry.[9] In it, Gibbs developed a rigorous mathematical theory for various transport phenomena, including adsorption, electrochemistry, and the Marangoni effect in fluid mixtures.[40] He also formulated the phase rule/nfor the number F of variables that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of C components existing in P phases. Phase rule is very useful in diverse areas, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, and petrology. It can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry.[67]/nTogether with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, Gibbs founded \"statistical mechanics\", a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of ensembles of all possible physical states of a system composed of many particles. He introduced the concept of \"phase of a mechanical system\".[68][69] He used the concept to define the microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles; all related to the Gibbs measure, thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.[70]/nGibbs generalized Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of entropy \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n by defining the entropy of an arbitrary ensemble as/nwhere \n\n\n\n\nk\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k_{\\text{B}}}\n\n is the Boltzmann constant, while the sum is over all possible microstates \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n, with \n\n\n\n\np\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p_{i}}\n\n the corresponding probability of the microstate (see Gibbs entropy formula).[71]  This same formula would later play a central role in Claude Shannon's information theory and is therefore often seen as the basis of the modern information-theoretical interpretation of thermodynamics.[72]/nAccording to Henri Poincar\u00e9, writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the irreversibility of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, \"the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics.\"[73] Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's H-theorem and of the ergodic hypothesis, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.[74][75]/nGibbs was well aware that the application of the equipartition theorem to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the specific heats of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on \"hypotheses about the constitution of matter\".[46] Gibbs's own framework for statistical mechanics, based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable microstates, could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries.[9][76] His resolution of the so-called \"Gibbs paradox\", about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the indistinguishability of particles required by quantum physics.[77]/nBritish scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton's quaternions in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Following W. K. Clifford in his Elements of Dynamic (1888), Gibbs noted that the product of quaternions could be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional vector, so that the use of quaternions involved mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. In his Yale classroom notes he defined distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. Through the 1901 textbook Vector Analysis prepared by E. B. Wilson from Gibbs notes, he was largely responsible for the development of the vector calculus techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.[78]/nWhile he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his \"multiple algebra\".[79] Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. To establish priority of Grassmann's ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay \"Theorie der Ebbe und Flut\" on tides that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the University of Berlin, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a vector space (linear space).[80][81]/nAs Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet orbits.[82]:\u200a160\u200a He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in crystallography.[83]/nThough Gibbs's research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical electromagnetism by applying Maxwell's equations to the theory of optical processes such as birefringence, dispersion, and optical activity.[6][84]  In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called luminiferous ether).  Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a longitudinal electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of light, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their \"gauge invariance\"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an ad hoc condition on the properties of the aether.[84]/nIn his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that/nit may be said for the electrical theory [of light] that it is not obliged to invent hypotheses, but only to apply the laws furnished by the science of electricity, and that it is difficult to account for the coincidences between the electrical and optical properties of media unless we regard the motions of light as electrical./nShortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in Germany.[85]/nGibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues, and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible.[9] His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy, a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the US and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the academy, both Elias Loomis and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs's work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.[86]/nEven though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs's graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics only came into widespread use in the mid 20th century, with the work of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tisza and Herbert Callen.[87] According to James Gerald Crowther,/nin his later years [Gibbs] was a tall, dignified gentleman, with a healthy stride and ruddy complexion, performing his share of household chores, approachable and kind (if unintelligible) to students. Gibbs was highly esteemed by his friends, but American science was too preoccupied with practical questions to make much use of his profound theoretical work during his lifetime. He lived out his quiet life at Yale, deeply admired by a few able students but making no immediate impress on American science commensurate with his genius./nOn the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1879 and received the 1880 Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on chemical thermodynamics.[88] He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and Williams College.[6]/nIn Europe, Gibbs was inducted as honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1892 and elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1897.[1] He was elected as corresponding member of the Prussian and French Academies of Science and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin,[89] Erlangen, and Christiania[6] (now Oslo). The Royal Society further honored Gibbs in 1901 with the Copley Medal, then regarded as the highest international award in the natural sciences,[3] noting that he had been \"the first to apply the second law of thermodynamics to the exhaustive discussion of the relation between chemical, electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work.\"[42] Gibbs, who remained in New Haven, was represented at the award ceremony by Commander Richardson Clover, the US naval attach\u00e9 in London.[90]/nIn his autobiography, mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of Sterling Library and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs's course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann, David Hilbert, and Ernst Mach. From this, Rota concluded that Gibbs's work was better known among the scientific elite of his day than the published material suggests.[91] Lynde Wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of Gibbs.[92] That Gibbs succeeded in interesting his European correspondents in his work is demonstrated by the fact that his monograph \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" was translated into German (then the leading language for chemistry) by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1892 and into French by Henri Louis Le Ch\u00e2telier in 1899.[93]/nGibbs's most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs's lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom, who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations, thereby assuring it of widespread use.[94] In industrial chemistry, Gibbs's thermodynamics found many applications during the early 20th century, from electrochemistry to the development of the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia.[95]/nWhen Dutch physicist J. D. van der Waals received the 1910 Nobel Prize \"for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids\" he acknowledged the great influence of Gibbs's work on that subject.[96] Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly his 1900 paper on Planck's law for quantized black-body radiation. That work was based largely on the thermodynamics of Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Planck declared that Gibbs's name \"not only in America but in the whole world will ever be reckoned among the most renowned theoretical physicists of all times.\"[97]/nThe first half of the 20th century saw the publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of chemical thermodynamics, both of which used and extended Gibbs's work in that field: these were Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Processes (1923), by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall, and Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs (1933), by Edward A. Guggenheim.[66]/nGibbs's work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics.[74][75] According to mathematical physicist Arthur Wightman,/nIt is one of the striking features of the work of Gibbs, noticed by every student of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, that his formulations of physical concepts were so felicitously chosen that they have survived 100 years of turbulent development in theoretical physics and mathematics./nInitially unaware of Gibbs's contributions in that field, Albert Einstein wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904.  After reading Gibbs's textbook (which was translated into German by Ernst Zermelo in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs's treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs's work.[98]/nGibbs's early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call \"convex analysis\",[99] including ideas that, according to Barry Simon, \"lay dormant for about seventy-five years\".[100]  Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs's work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the Gibbs lemma in game theory, the Gibbs inequality in information theory, as well as Gibbs sampling in computational statistics./nThe development of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook Vector Analysis, based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.[101]/nAt Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the triode amplifier and has been called the \"father of radio\".[102] De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization \"that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the higher theory of waves and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power.\"[52] Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.[103]/nGibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of Irving Fisher, who received the first PhD in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices, Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the general equilibrium of markets, and he used Gibbs's vectorial notation.[50][51]  Gibbs's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson.[104] In 1947, Samuelson published Foundations of Economic Analysis, based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as epigraph a remark attributed to Gibbs: \"Mathematics is a language.\"  Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his \"debts were not primarily to Pareto or Slutsky, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale.\"[105]/nMathematician Norbert Wiener cited Gibbs's use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as \"the first great revolution of twentieth century physics\" and as a major influence on his conception of cybernetics. Wiener explained in the preface to his book The Human Use of Human Beings that it was \"devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general.\"[106]/nWhen the German physical chemist Walther Nernst visited Yale in 1906 to give the Silliman lecture, he was surprised to find no tangible memorial for Gibbs. Nernst donated his $500 lecture fee to the university to help pay for a suitable monument. This was finally unveiled in 1912, in the form of a bronze bas-relief by sculptor Lee Lawrie, installed in the Sloane Physics Laboratory.[107] In 1910, the American Chemical Society established the Willard Gibbs Award for eminent work in pure or applied chemistry.[108] In 1923, the American Mathematical Society endowed the Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship, \"to show the public some idea of the aspects of mathematics and its applications\".[109]/nIn 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by Lars Onsager. Onsager, who much like Gibbs, focused on applying new mathematical ideas to problems in physical chemistry, won the 1968 Nobel Prize in chemistry.[110] In addition to establishing the Josiah Willard Gibbs Laboratories and the J. Willard Gibbs Assistant Professorship in Mathematics, Yale has also hosted two symposia dedicated to Gibbs's life and work, one in 1989 and another on the centenary of his death, in 2003.[111] Rutgers University endowed a J. Willard Gibbs Professorship of Thermomechanics, held as of 2014 by Bernard Coleman.[112]/nGibbs was elected in 1950 to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans.[113] The oceanographic research ship USNS Josiah Willard Gibbs (T-AGOR-1) was in service with the United States Navy from 1958 to 1971.[114] Gibbs crater, near the eastern limb of the Moon, was named in the scientist's honor in 1964.[115]/nEdward Guggenheim introduced the symbol G for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by Dirk ter Haar in 1966.[116] This notation is now universal and is recommended by the IUPAC.[117] In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name \"gibbs\" (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy calorie per kelvin,[118] but this usage did not become common, and the corresponding SI unit joule per kelvin carries no special name./nIn 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known. Einstein replied: \"Lorentz\", adding \"I never met Willard Gibbs; perhaps, had I done so, I might have placed him beside Lorentz.\"[119] Author Bill Bryson in his bestselling popular science book A Short History of Nearly Everything ranks Gibbs as \"perhaps the most brilliant person that most people have never heard of\".[120]/nIn 1958, USS San Carlos was renamed USNS Josiah Willard Gibbs and re-designated as an oceanographic research ship./nIn 1909, the American historian and novelist Henry Adams finished an essay entitled \"The Rule of Phase Applied to History\", in which he sought to apply Gibbs's phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. William James, Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams's tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society.[121]  The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma, edited by Henry Adams's younger brother Brooks.[122]/nIn the 1930s, feminist poet Muriel Rukeyser became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work (\"Gibbs\", included in the collection A Turning Wind, published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography (Willard Gibbs, 1942).[123]  According to Rukeyser:/nWillard Gibbs is the type of the imagination at work in the world. His story is that of an opening up which has had its effect on our lives and our thinking; and, it seems to me, it is the emblem of the naked imagination\u2014which is called abstract and impractical, but whose discoveries can be used by anyone who is interested, in whatever \"field\"\u2014an imagination which for me, more than that of any other figure in American thought, any poet, or political, or religious figure, stands for imagination at its essential points./nIn 1946, Fortune magazine illustrated a cover story on \"Fundamental Science\" with a representation of the thermodynamic surface that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. Rukeyser called this surface a \"statue of water\"[125] and the magazine saw in it \"the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms.\"[126] The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a radar screen, an oscilloscope waveform, Newton's apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.[126]/nGibbs's nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser's biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs's former students to produce a more technically oriented biography.[127] Rukeyser's approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs's former student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Wilson.[128]  With Van Name's and Wilson's encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.[129][130]/nBoth Gibbs and Rukeyser's biography of him figure prominently in the poetry collection True North (1997) by Stephanie Strickland.[131]  In fiction, Gibbs appears as the mentor to character Kit Traverse in Thomas Pynchon's novel Against the Day (2006). That novel also prominently discusses the birefringence of Iceland spar, an optical phenomenon that Gibbs investigated.[132]/nIn 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the American Scientists commemorative postage stamp series designed by artist Victor Stabin, depicting Gibbs, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Richard Feynman. The first day of issue ceremony for the series was held on May 4 at Yale University's Luce Hall and was attended by John Marburger, scientific advisor to the president of the United States, Rick Levin, president of Yale, and family members of the scientists honored, including physician John W. Gibbs, a distant cousin of Willard Gibbs.[133]/nKenneth R. Jolls, a professor of chemical engineering at Iowa State University and an expert on graphical methods in thermodynamics, consulted on the design of the stamp honoring Gibbs.[134][135][136]  The stamp identifies Gibbs as a \"thermodynamicist\" and features a diagram from the 4th edition of Maxwell's Theory of Heat, published in 1875, which illustrates Gibbs's thermodynamic surface for water.[135][136] Microprinting on the collar of Gibbs's portrait depicts his original mathematical equation for the change in the energy of a substance in terms of its entropy and the other state variables.[137]/nGibbs's other papers are included in both:", "528853": "David van Dantzig (September 23, 1900 \u2013 July 22, 1959) was a Dutch mathematician, well known for the construction in topology of the solenoid.

This manner of study, which engages heart and mind together, seems to teeter on the brink of religion. He believes that science, holistically, can have a great impact on people. Big history science is filled with little mysterious coincidences, upon which our entire existence rests.

In 1668 the order was suppressed by Pope Clement IX.  Angeli was a student of Bonaventura Cavalieri.  From 1662 until his death he taught at the University of Padua./nFrom 1654 to 1667 he devoted himself to the study of geometry, continuing the research of Cavalieri and Evangelista Torricelli based on the method of Indivisibles.  He then moved on to\nmechanics, where he often found himself in conflict with Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Giovanni Riccioli./nJean-\u00c9tienne Montucla in his monumental Histoire des math\u00e9matiques (Paris, 1758), lavishes praise on Angeli (II, p.\u00a069)./nAngeli moved from Rome to his native city of Venice in 1652 and began publishing on the method of indivisibles. The method had been under attack by Jesuits Paul Guldin, Mario Bettini, and Andr\u00e9 Tacquet. Angeli's first response appeared in an \"Appendix pro indivisibilibus,\" attached to his 1658 book Problemata geometrica sexaginta, and was aimed at Bettini.[1] Alexander (2014) shows how indivisibles and infinitesimals were perceived as a theological threat and opposed on doctrinal grounds in the 17th century. The opposition was spearheaded by clerics and more specifically by the Jesuits. In 1632 (the year Galileo was summoned to stand trial over heliocentrism) the Society's Revisors General led by father Jacob Bidermann banned teaching indivisibles in their schools.[1]:\u200a17\u200a Cavalieri's indivisibles and Galileo Galilei's heliocentrism were systematically opposed by the Jesuits and attacked through a spectrum of means, be it mathematical, academic, political, or religious.[1]:\u200aPart I\u200a Bettini called the method of indivisibles \"counterfeit philosophizing\" and sought to discredit it through a discussion of a paradox presented in Galileo's Discorsi. Angeli analyzes Bettini's position and proves it untenable.[1]:\u200a168/nIn the preface to his work De infinitis parabolis (1659), Angeli examines the criticisms of indivisibles penned by Jesuit Tacquet, who claimed in his 1651 book Cylindricorum et annularium libri IV that/nAngeli writes that Tacquet's criticisms were already raised by Guldin and satisfactorily answered by Cavalieri. In his work, Tacquet asked rhetorically: \"Who does this reasoning convince?\" Angeli responds incredulously: Whom does it convince? Everyone except the Jesuits.  Angeli proceeds to give an impressive list of European mathematicians that have accepted the method of indivisibles, including Jean Beaugrand, Ismael Boulliau, Richard White, and Frans van Schooten.[1]:\u200a169\u200a Angeli is trying to portray the Jesuits as the lone holdouts against a method that is being universally accepted. However, as Alexander points out, the mathematicians cited reside north of the Alps. Of the three Italians that Angeli cites, Torricelli, Rocca, and Raffaello Magiotti, only the former had in fact published on indivisibles, and in any case by 1659 all three were dead. Despite his protestations to the contrary, Angeli was, in his own land, alone./nJames Gregory studied under Angeli from 1664 until 1668 in Padua./nAndersen[2] notes that Angeli, who was a Jesuat like Cavalieri, remarked that the circles opposed to the method of indivisibles mainly contained Jesuit mathematicians./nTacquet warned that unless the method of indivisibles is destroyed first, it will destroy geometry.[1]:\u200a169\u200a  Tacquet's concern reflected the Jesuits' commitment to geometry as practiced by Euclid, as well as their commitment to Aristotelian philosophy that rejected the notion that the continuum is made up of indivisibles.  Angeli followed his teacher Cavalieri and argued that the composition of the continuum has no bearing on the method of indivisibles, and \"even if the continuum is not composed of indivisibles, the method of indivisibles nevertheless remains unshaken.\" Angeli then went beyond his teacher's cautious advocacy of the method by declaring that the effectiveness of the method of indivisibles provides evidence that the continuum is in fact composed of indivisibles, contrary to the Jesuit position./nOn 6 December 1668 Pope Clement IX issued a brief suppressing the Jesuati order counting Angeli among its members, on the grounds that \"no advantage or utility to the Christian people was to be anticipated from their survival.\"  Writes Alexander: \"It was a stunningly violent and unexpected end to an old and venerable order. Founded by the Blessed John Colombini in 1361 to tend for the poor and the sick, it had survived for [over] three centuries.\"[1]:\u200a171,\u200a2\u200a  While Angeli had previously published no fewer than nine books promoting and using the method of indivisibles, he did not publish a word on the topic ever again.[1]:\u200a174", "52793931": "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is the name given by gambling authors[1][2] to the four U.S. Army engineers who first discovered in the 1950s the best playing strategy in the casino game of Blackjack that can be  formulated on the basis of the player's and the dealer's cards. The so-called Basic Strategy, which was subsequently refined through the use of computers and combinatorial analysis,  loses the least money to the casino in the long term./nIn 1953, Roger Baldwin, a private in the U.S. Army with a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University, stationed in  Aberdeen Proving Ground, the U.S. Army's oldest active proving ground,[3] was playing dealer's choice poker in the barracks. After a player acting as dealer selected Blackjack, someone remarked that the dealer, as they do in the Las Vegas casinos, would have to stand on 17 and hit on 16.[1] Baldwin was intrigued by this news enough to embark on a project during his off-work hours to discover the optimal playing strategy for the player on the basis of the player's and the dealer's cards, as well as the rules dictating the dealer's play. For this, Baldwin asked the help of Wilbert Cantey, a sergeant at the facility, who had left the seminary  because of his hustling at pool and cards and pursued a master's degree in Mathematics. They enlisted the help of privates Herbert Maisel, who later became a professor at Georgetown University, and James McDermott, who had a master's from Columbia University.[1]/nFor their project, the four Army men used only the desk calculators available at the military base, which were called at the time \u201cadding machines.\u201d The result of their work was presented in an analytical study in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, in September 1956,[4] and subsequently in a book titled Playing Blackjack to Win that was published in 1957.[5] The book, with a foreword written by TV quiz-show star Charles Van Doren, contained a pull-out strategy chart with sections on Draw or Stand, Doubling Down, and Splitting Pairs.[4]/nThe book did include, in a chapter titled \"Using the Exposed Cards to Improve Your Chances\", the first  valid card-counting system ever published, but their method was not strong enough to offer a positive-expectation strategy for the player, although it did offer the least costly strategy in the game of casino Blackjack.[6] A gambling expert has claimed that any player who uses the Four Horsemen's basic strategy today \"would not be giving up more than a few hundredths of a percent [of expected value] over perfect basic strategy.\"[6]/nThe four originators of Blackjack's Basic Strategy went on with their lives away from casinos and gambling, dedicating themselves to scientific research, teaching and business.[7] \nBut their work caused an immediate sensation in gambling research as well as among professional gamblers. MIT Professor of Mathematics Edward O. Thorp tested their strategy on the university's IBM computers and found it to be accurate \"within a couple of hundredths of a percentage point.\"[1] Thorp went on to formulate the first strong card counting strategy and tested it in actual casino play, in trips he took to Las Vegas, often accompanied by Claude Shannon, who is sometimes referred to as \"father of information theory\".[8]/nThe existence of a casino-beating system spread throughout the American gambling and casino circles, and in 1962, E. O. Thorp published his \"seminal\" work Beat The Dealer, widely considered to be the original Blackjack manual.[9] The book sold over 700,000 copies and earned a place in the New York Times bestseller list. The publication and subsequent notoriety of the book was the cause at the time behind many casinos changing the rules and conditions of how Blackjack was offered \u2013 for example, they stopped dealing single-deck Blackjack down to the last card.[10] After players began complaining, most casinos went back to the previous rules and conditions. The tables were soon full of casual gamblers who believed that by they could now \"beat the house,\" even though most of them never strictly followed Thorp's \"complicated,\" two-parallel-counts system, or even the simpler systems that subsequently appeared, such as High-Low, and the casinos started winning more money than before Thorp's book had appeared.[10]/nThorp's work in turn inspired the research and the exploits of professional blackjack players such as Stanford Wong, Ken Uston, and the MIT Blackjack Teams of the 1990s, as well as many others.[1]/nIn 1965, in an early recognition of the impact that the work of the four U.S. Army men would have on the game of 21, gambling author Dr. Allan N.

Three of these problems had been open for more than forty years:[1]/nIn solving these problems, Enflo developed new techniques which were then used by other researchers in functional analysis and operator theory for years. Some of Enflo's research has been important also in other mathematical fields, such as number theory, and in computer science, especially computer algebra and approximation algorithms./nEnflo works at Kent State University, where he holds the title of University Professor. Enflo has earlier held positions at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, \u00c9cole Polytechnique, (Paris) and The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm./nEnflo is also a concert pianist./nIn mathematics, Functional analysis is concerned with the study of vector spaces and operators acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of functional spaces, in particular transformations of functions, such as the Fourier transform, as well as in the study of differential and integral equations. In functional analysis, an important class of vector spaces consists of the complete normed vector spaces over the real or complex numbers, which are called Banach spaces. An important example of a Banach space is a Hilbert space, where the norm arises from an inner product. Hilbert spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, stochastic processes, and time-series analysis. Besides studying spaces of functions, functional analysis also studies the continuous linear operators on spaces of functions./nAt Stockholm University, Hans R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m suggested that Enflo consider Hilbert's fifth problem in the spirit of functional analysis.[4] In two years, 1969\u20131970, Enflo published five papers on Hilbert's fifth problem; these papers are collected in Enflo (1970), along with a short summary. Some of the results of these papers are described in Enflo (1976) and in the last chapter of Benyamini and Lindenstrauss./nEnflo's techniques have found application in computer science. Algorithm theorists derive approximation algorithms that embed finite metric spaces into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces with low \"distortion\" (in Gromov's terminology for the Lipschitz category; c.f. Banach\u2013Mazur distance). Low-dimensional problems have lower computational complexity, of course. More importantly, if the problems embed well in either the Euclidean plane or the three-dimensional Euclidean space, then geometric algorithms become exceptionally fast./nHowever, such embedding techniques have limitations, as shown by Enflo's (1969) theorem:[5]/nThis theorem, \"found by Enflo [1969], is probably the first result showing an unbounded distortion for embeddings into Euclidean spaces. Enflo considered the problem of uniform embeddability among Banach spaces, and the distortion was an auxiliary device in his proof.\"[7]/nA uniformly convex space is a Banach space so that, for every \n\n\n\n\u03f5\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\epsilon >0}\n\n there is some \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta >0}\n\n so that for any two vectors with \n\n\n\n\u2016\nx\n\u2016\n\u2264\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\|x\\|\\leq 1}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u2016\ny\n\u2016\n\u2264\n1\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\|y\\|\\leq 1,}/nimplies that/nIntuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short./nIn 1972 Enflo proved that \"every super-reflexive Banach space admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm\".[8][9]/nWith one paper, which was published in 1973, Per Enflo solved three problems that had stumped functional analysts for decades: The basis problem of Stefan Banach, the \"Goose problem\" of Stanislaw Mazur, and the approximation problem of Alexander Grothendieck. Grothendieck had shown that his approximation problem was the central problem in the theory of Banach spaces and continuous linear operators./nThe basis problem was posed by Stefan Banach in his book, Theory of Linear Operators. Banach asked whether every separable Banach space has a Schauder basis./nA Schauder basis or countable basis is similar to the usual (Hamel) basis of a vector space; the difference is that for Hamel bases we use linear combinations that are finite sums, while for Schauder bases they may be infinite sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces including Banach spaces./nSchauder bases were described by Juliusz Schauder in 1927.[10][11] Let V denote a Banach space over the field F. A Schauder basis is a sequence (bn) of elements of V such that for every element v \u2208 V there exists a unique sequence (\u03b1n) of elements in F so that/nwhere the convergence is understood with respect to the norm topology. Schauder bases can also be defined analogously in a general topological vector space./nBanach and other Polish mathematicians would work on mathematical problems at the Scottish Caf\u00e9. When a problem was especially interesting and when its solution seemed difficult, the problem would be written down in the book of problems, which soon became known as the Scottish Book. For problems that seemed especially important or difficult or both, the problem's proposer would often pledge to award a prize for its solution./nOn 6 November 1936, Stanislaw Mazur posed a problem on representing continuous functions. Formally writing down problem 153 in the Scottish Book, Mazur promised as the reward a \"live goose\", an especially rich price during the Great Depression and on the eve of World War II./nFairly soon afterwards, it was realized that Mazur's problem was closely related to Banach's problem on the existence of Schauder bases in separable Banach spaces. Most of the other problems in the Scottish Book were solved regularly. However, there was little progress on Mazur's problem and a few other problems, which became famous open problems to mathematicians around the world.[12]/nGrothendieck's work on the theory of Banach spaces and continuous linear operators introduced the approximation property. A Banach space is said to have the approximation property, if every compact operator is a limit of finite-rank operators. The converse is always true.[13]/nIn a long monograph, Grothendieck proved that if every Banach space had the approximation property, then every Banach space would have a Schauder basis. Grothendieck thus focused the attention of functional analysts on deciding whether every Banach space have the approximation property.[13]/nIn 1972, Per Enflo constructed a separable Banach space that lacks the approximation property and a Schauder basis.[14] In 1972, Mazur awarded a live goose to Enflo in a ceremony at the Stefan Banach Center in Warsaw; the \"goose reward\" ceremony was broadcast throughout Poland.[15]/nIn functional analysis, one of the most prominent problems was the invariant subspace problem, which required the evaluation of the truth of the following proposition:/nFor Banach spaces, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Enflo. (For Hilbert spaces, the invariant subspace problem remains open.)/nEnflo proposed a solution to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article's complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987[16] Enflo's long \"manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians\"[17] and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976).[18][19] Enflo's works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo's ideas.[16]/nIn the 1990s, Enflo developed a \"constructive\" approach to the invariant subspace problem on Hilbert spaces.[20]/nAn essential idea in Enflo's construction was \"concentration of polynomials at low degrees\": For all positive integers \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, there exists \n\n\n\nC\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C(m,n)>0}\n\n such that for all homogeneous polynomials \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n and \n\n\n\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Q}\n\n of degrees \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n (in \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n variables), then/n|\n\nP\nQ\n\n|\n\n\u2265\nC\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n|\n\nP\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nQ\n\n|\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |PQ|\\geq C(m,n)|P|\\,|Q|,}/nwhere \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nP\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |P|}\n\n denotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. Enflo proved that \n\n\n\nC\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C(m,n)}\n\n does not depend on the number of variables \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n. Enflo's original proof was simplified by Montgomery.[21]/nThis result was generalized to other norms on the vector space of homogeneous polynomials. Of these norms, the most used has been the Bombieri norm./nThe Bombieri norm is defined in terms of the following scalar product:\nFor all \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n,\n\u03b2\n\u2208\n\n\nN\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha ,\\beta \\in \\mathbb {N} ^{N}}\n\n we have/nwhere we use the following notation:\nif \n\n\n\n\u03b1\n=\n(\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03b1\n\nN\n\n\n)\n\u2208\n\n\nN\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha =(\\alpha _{1},\\dots ,\\alpha _{N})\\in \\mathbb {N} ^{N}}\n\n, we write \n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\u03b1\n\n|\n\n=\n\n\u03a3\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |\\alpha |=\\Sigma _{i=1}^{N}\\alpha _{i}}\n\n and\n\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n!\n=\n\n\u03a0\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n(\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n!\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\alpha !=\\Pi _{i=1}^{N}(\\alpha _{i}!)}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\n\n\n=\n\n\u03a0\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\nN\n\n\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X^{\\alpha }=\\Pi _{i=1}^{N}X_{i}^{\\alpha _{i}}.}/nThe most remarkable property of this norm is the Bombieri inequality:/nLet \n\n\n\nP\n,\nQ\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P,Q}\n\n be two homogeneous polynomials respectively of degree \n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\u2218\n\n\n(\nP\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d^{\\circ }(P)}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\u2218\n\n\n(\nQ\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d^{\\circ }(Q)}\n\n with \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n variables, then, the following inequality holds:/nIn the above statement, the Bombieri inequality is the left-hand side inequality; the right-hand side inequality means that the Bombieri norm is a norm of the algebra of polynomials under multiplication./nThe Bombieri inequality implies that the product of two polynomials cannot be arbitrarily small, and this lower-bound is fundamental in applications like polynomial factorization (or in Enflo's construction of an operator without an invariant subspace)./nEnflo's idea of \"concentration of polynomials at low degrees\" has led to important publications in number theory[22] algebraic and Diophantine geometry,[23] and polynomial factorization.[24]/nIn applied mathematics, Per Enflo has published several papers in mathematical biology, specifically in population dynamics./nEnflo has also published in population genetics and paleoanthropology.[25]/nToday, all humans belong to one population of Homo sapiens sapiens, which is individed by species barrier. However, according to the \"Out of Africa\" model this is not the first species of hominids: the first species of genus Homo, Homo habilis, evolved in East Africa at least 2 Ma, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. Homo erectus evolved more than 1.8 Ma, and by 1.5 Ma had spread throughout the Old World./nAnthropologists have been divided as to whether current human population evolved as one interconnected population (as postulated by the Multiregional Evolution hypothesis), or evolved only in East Africa, speciated, and then migrating out of Africa and replaced human populations in Eurasia (called the \"Out of Africa\" Model or the \"Complete Replacement\" Model)./nNeanderthals and modern humans coexisted in Europe for several thousand years, but the duration of this period is uncertain.[26] Modern humans may have first migrated to Europe 40\u201343,000 years ago.[27] Neanderthals may have lived as recently as 24,000 years ago in refugia on the south coast of the Iberian peninsula such as Gorham's Cave.[28][29] Inter-stratification of Neanderthal and modern human remains has been suggested,[30] but is disputed.[31]/nWith Hawks and Wolpoff, Enflo published an explanation of fossil evidence on the DNA of Neanderthal and modern humans. This article tries to resolve a debate in the evolution of modern humans between theories suggesting either multiregional and single African origins. In particular,\nthe extinction of Neanderthals could have happened due to waves of modern humans entered Europe\u00a0\u2013 in technical terms, due to \"the continuous influx of modern human DNA into the Neandertal gene pool.\"[32][33][34]/nEnflo has also written about the population dynamics of zebra mussels in Lake Erie.[35]/nPer Enflo is also a concert pianist./nA child prodigy in both music and mathematics, Enflo won the Swedish competition for young pianists at age 11 in 1956, and he won the same competition in 1961.[37] At age 12, Enflo appeared as a soloist with the Royal Opera Orchestra of Sweden.

Jeans was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Wilson's Grammar School,[3][4] Camberwell and Trinity College, Cambridge.[5]\nAs a gifted student, Jeans was counselled to take an aggressive approach to the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos competition:[6]/nEarly in the Michaelmas term of 1896, Walker sent for Jeans and Hardy and advised them to take Part I of the Mathematical Tripos in two years. He told them that he could not guarantee that they would come out higher than fifteenth in the list of wranglers, but he understood that they would never regret it. They accepted his advice, and went to R. R. Webb, the most famous private coach of the period\u00a0... At the end of his first year, [Jeans] told Walker that he had quarrelled with Webb, his coach. Walker accordingly took Jeans himself, and the result was a triumph:\u00a0... Jeans was bracketed second wrangler with J. F. Cameron\u00a0... [and] R.W.H.T. Hudson was Senior Wrangler and G. H. Hardy fourth wrangler./nJeans was elected Fellow of Trinity College in October 1901,[7][8] and taught at Cambridge, but went to Princeton University in 1904 as a professor of applied mathematics. He returned to Cambridge in 1910./nHe made important contributions in many areas of physics, including quantum theory, the theory of radiation and stellar evolution. His analysis of rotating bodies led him to conclude that Pierre-Simon Laplace's theory that the solar system formed from a single cloud of gas was incorrect, proposing instead that the planets condensed from material drawn out of the sun by a hypothetical catastrophic near-collision with a passing star. This theory is not accepted today./nJeans, along with Arthur Eddington, is a founder of British cosmology. In 1928, Jeans was the first to conjecture a steady state cosmology based on a hypothesized continuous creation of matter in the universe.[9] In his book Astronomy and Cosmogony (1928) he stated: \"The type of conjecture which presents itself, somewhat insistently, is that the centers of the nebulae are of the nature 'singular points' at which matter is poured into our universe from some other, and entirely extraneous spatial dimension, so that, to a denizen of our universe, they appear as points at which matter is being continually created.\"[10] This theory fell out of favour when the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background was widely interpreted as the tell-tale signature of the Big Bang./nHis scientific reputation is grounded in the monographs The Dynamical Theory of Gases (1904), Theoretical Mechanics (1906), and Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism (1908). After retiring in 1929, he wrote a number of books for the lay public, including The Stars in Their Courses (1931), The Universe Around Us, Through Space and Time (1934), The New Background of Science (1933), and The Mysterious Universe.  These books made Jeans fairly well known as an expositor of the revolutionary scientific discoveries of his day, especially in relativity and physical cosmology./nIn 1939, the Journal of the British Astronomical Association reported that Jeans was going to stand as a candidate for parliament for the Cambridge University constituency. The election, expected to take place in 1939 or 1940, did not take place until 1945, and without his involvement./nHe also wrote the book Physics and Philosophy (1943) where he explores the different views on reality from two different perspectives: science and philosophy.  On his religious views, Jeans was an agnostic Freemason.[11][12]/nJeans married twice, first to the American poet Charlotte Tiffany Mitchell in 1907, who died,[13] and then to the Austrian organist and harpsichordist Suzanne Hock (better known as Susi Jeans) in 1935. Susi and Jeans had three children: George, Christopher, and Catherine.[14]/nJeans died in 1947 with the presence of his wife and Joy Adamson, who suggested to the widow to create a death mask of Jeans. It is now held by the Royal Society.[15][16]/nOne of Jeans' major discoveries, named Jeans length, is a critical radius of an interstellar cloud in space. It depends on the temperature, and density of the cloud, and the mass of the particles composing the cloud. A cloud that is smaller than its Jeans length will not have sufficient gravity to overcome the repulsive gas pressure forces and condense to form a star, whereas a cloud that is larger than its Jeans length will collapse./nJeans came up with another version of this equation, called Jeans mass or Jeans instability, that solves for the critical mass a cloud must attain before being able to collapse./nJeans also helped to discover the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law, which relates the energy density of black-body radiation to the temperature of the emission source./nJeans is also credited with calculating the rate of atmospheric escape from a planet due to kinetic energy of the gas molecules, a process known as Jeans escape./nJeans espoused a philosophy of science rooted in the metaphysical doctrine of idealism and opposed to materialism in his speaking engagements and books. His popular science publications first advanced these ideas in 1929's The Universe Around Us when he likened \"discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space,\" to, \"trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas.\" But he turned to this idea as the primary subject of his best-selling[17] 1930 book, The Mysterious Universe, where he asserted that a picture of the universe as a \"non-mechanical reality\" was emerging from the science of the day./nThe Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter./nIn a 1931 interview published in The Observer, Jeans was asked if be believed that life was an accident or if it was, \"part of some great scheme.\" He said that he favored, \"the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness,\" going on to suggest that, \"each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.\"[19]/nIn his 1934 address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Aberdeen as the Association's president, Jeans spoke specifically to the work of Descartes and its relevance to the modern philosophy of science. He argued that, \"There is no longer room for the kind of dualism which has haunted philosophy since the days of Descartes.\"[20]/nWhen Daniel Helsing reviewed The Mysterious Universe for Physics Today in 2020, he summarized the philosophical conclusions of the book, \"Jeans argues that we must give up science\u2019s long-cherished materialistic and mechanical worldview, which posits that nature operates like a machine and consists solely of material particles interacting with each other.\" His evaluation of Jeans contrasted these philosophical views with modern science communicators such as Neil deGrasse Tyson and Sean Carroll who he suggested, \"would likely take issue with Jeans\u2019s idealism.\"[17]", "53744269": "Choi Seok-jeong (Korean:\u00a0\ucd5c\uc11d\uc815; Hanja:\u00a0\u5d14\u932b\u9f0e; 1646\u20131715) was a Korean politician and mathematician in the Joseon period of Korea./nHe published the Gusuryak (Korean:\u00a0\uad6c\uc218\ub7b5; Hanja:\u00a0\u4e5d\u6578\u7565) in 1700,[1] the first known literature on Latin squares,[2] predating Leonhard Euler by at least 67 years.[3][4] He also invented the hexagonal tortoise problem.[5] Choi was a member of the Jeonju Choe clan./nThe Choi Seok-jeong Award was created in 2021 to recognize those who develop or spread mathematics.[6] Spelling of laureates' names matches their Wikipedia page, if it exists, the remainder used Revised Romanization of Korean with the Korean Romanization Converter of Al Lab and Narainfotech./n/nThis Korean academic-related biographical article is a stub.

Raymond was musically inclined. He played cornet in the family orchestra, which performed at dances and fairs, and accompanied silent films on the piano./nHe entered Brown University in 1914, intending to become an actuary. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy as an ensign. Brown awarded him his first degree in 1920, and a master's degree in actuarial mathematics in 1921. That year, he married Una Maude Greene; they had four children, thanks to whom they have ample descent./nWilder chose to do his Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin, the most fateful decision of his life. At Texas, Wilder discovered pure mathematics and topology, thanks to the remarkable influence of Robert Lee Moore, the founder of topology in the US and the inventor of the Moore method for teaching mathematical proof. Moore was initially unimpressed by the young actuary, but Wilder went on to solve a difficult open problem that Moore had posed to his class. Moore suggested Wilder write up the solution for his Ph.D. thesis, which he did in 1923, titling it Concerning Continuous Curves. Wilder thus became the first of Moore's many doctoral students at the University of Texas./nAfter a year as an instructor at Texas, Wilder was appointed assistant professor at the Ohio State University in 1924. That university required that its academic employees sign a loyalty oath, which Wilder was very reluctant to sign because doing so was inconsistent with his lifelong progressive political and moral views./nIn 1926, Wilder joined the faculty of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he supervised 26 Ph.Ds and became a research professor in 1947. During the 1930s, he helped settle European refugee mathematicians in the United States. Mathematicians who rubbed shoulders with Wilder at Michigan and who later proved prominent included Samuel Eilenberg, the cofounder of category theory, and the topologist Norman Steenrod. After his 1967 retirement from Michigan at the rather advanced age of 71, Wilder became a research associate and occasional lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara./nWilder was vice president of the American Mathematical Society, 1950\u20131951, president 1955\u20131956, and the Society's Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer in 1969. He was president of the Mathematical Association of America, 1965\u20131966, which awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal in 1973.[1] He was elected to the American National Academy of Sciences in 1963. Brown University (1958) and the University of Michigan (1980) awarded him honorary doctorates.  The mathematics department at the University of California annually bestows one or more graduating seniors with an award in Wilder's name./nThe historical, philosophical, and anthropological writings of Wilder's later years suggest a warm, colorful personality. Raymond (2003) attests to this having been the case. For instance:/nWilder's thesis set out a new approach to the Sch\u00f6nflies programme, which aimed to study positional invariants of sets in the plane or 2-sphere. A positional invariant of a set A with respect to a set B is a property shared by all homeomorphic images of A contained in B. The best known example of such a positional invariant is embodied in the Jordan curve theorem: A simple closed curve in the 2-sphere has precisely two complementary domains and is the boundary of each of them. A converse to the Jordan curve theorem, proved by Sch\u00f6nflies, states that a subset of the 2-sphere is a simple closed curve if it:/nIn his \"A converse of the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem in three dimensions\" (1930), Wilder showed that a subset of Euclidean 3-space whose complementary domains satisfied certain homology conditions was a 2-sphere./nAround 1930, Wilder moved from set-theoretic topology to algebraic topology, calling in 1932 for the unification of the two areas. He then began an extensive investigation of the theory of manifolds, e.g., his \"Generalized closed manifolds in n-space\" (1934), in effect extending the Sch\u00f6nflies programme to higher dimensions. This work culminated in his Topology of Manifolds (1949), twice reprinted, whose last three chapters discuss his contributions to the theory of positional topological invariants./nDuring the 1940s, Wilder met and befriended the University of Michigan anthropologist Leslie White, whose professional curiosity included mathematics as a human activity (White 1947). This encounter proved fateful, and Wilder's research interests underwent a major change, towards the foundations of mathematics. This change was foreshadowed by his 1944 article \"The nature of mathematical proof,\" and heralded by his address to the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, titled \"The cultural basis of mathematics,\" which posed the questions:/nIn 1952, he wrote up his course on foundations and the philosophy of mathematics into a widely cited text, Introduction to the foundations of mathematics./nWilder's Evolution of mathematical concepts. An elementary study (1969) proposed that \"we study mathematics as a human artifact, as a natural phenomenon subject to empirical observation and scientific analysis, and, in particular, as a cultural phenomenon understandable in anthropological terms.\" In this book, Wilder wrote:/nWilder's last book, Mathematics as a cultural system (1981), contained yet more thinking in this anthropological and evolutionary vein./nWilder's eclectic and humanist perspective on mathematics appears to have had little influence on subsequent mathematical research. It has, however, had some influence on the teaching of mathematics and on the history and philosophy of mathematics. In particular, Wilder can be seen as a precursor to the work of Howard Eves, Evert Willem Beth, and Davis and Hersh (1981). Wilder's call for mathematics to be scrutinized by the methods of social science anticipates some aspects of Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael Nunez.

In 1899 he became professor of mathematics in Zagreb, where he gave lectures until his death in 1942.[3]/nFrom 1903 to 1908 he wrote on hyperbolic geometry (or Bolyai\u2013Lobachevskian geometry). In 1910, following a 1909 publication of Sommerfeld, he applied hyperbolic geometry to the special theory of relativity.[4] Sommerfeld, using the imaginary form of Minkowski space, had shown in his 1909 paper[5] that the Einstein formula for combination of velocities is most clearly understandable as a formula for triangular addition on the surface of a sphere of imaginary radius. Vari\u0107ak reinterpreted this result as showing that rapidity combines by the triangle rule in hyperbolic space. This is a fundamental result for the hyperbolic theory which was  demonstrated later by other approaches by Robb (1911) and Borel (1913).

He was born at Chamelet, Beaujolais, France[1] and died in Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, France./nHe was Engineer-in-Chief of the \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es [National school of bridges and roads], a technical school in Paris./nIn 1791, de Prony embarked on the task of producing logarithmic and trigonometric tables for the French Cadastre (geographic survey). The effort was sanctioned by the French National Assembly, which, after the French Revolution wanted to bring uniformity to the multiple measurements and standards used throughout the nation.  In particular, his tables were intended for precise land surveys, as part of a greater cadastre effort. The tables were vast, calculating logarithms from 1 to 200,000,[2] with values  calculated to between fourteen and twenty-nine decimal places,[a] (which de Prony recognized was excessively precise).[3]/nInspired by Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, de Prony divided up the labor into three levels, bragging that he \"could manufacture logarithms as easily as one manufactures pins.\"[4]:\u200a36/nThe first level consisted of five or six high-ranking mathematicians with sophisticated analytical skills, including Adrien-Marie Legendre and Lazare Carnot. This group chose the analytical formulas most suited to evaluation by numerical methods, and specified the number of decimals and the numerical range the tables were to cover./nThe second group of lesser mathematicians, seven or eight in number, were known as the \"planners\" and had previous experience as computers in the cadastre, mainly with experience having to do with practical mathematics.[4] The planners combined analytical and computational skills, with this group calculating the pivotal values using the formulas provided and the sets of starting differences. They also prepared\ntemplates for the human computers, and the first worked row of calculations, as well as the instructions for the computers to carry the sequence to completion. Finally, this group was tasked with verifying all the calculations made by the human computers. Since recalculating every value would have nullified the use of the lowest level computers since their tasks would have been completely repeated, the planners used a method knows as \"differencing,\" where they compared adjacent values in the tables, checking for any discrepancies.[4]/nThe third group consisted of sixty to ninety human computers. These had no more than a rudimentary knowledge of arithmetic and carried out the most laborious and repetitive part of the process. Many were out-of-work hairdressers, because, with the guillotining of the aristocracy, the hairdressing trade, which had tended the elaborate hairstyles of the elite, was in recession.[5][6][4]:\u200a33\u201339\u200aDue to their lack of experience, they only had to calculate simple problems of addition and subtraction. In addition, this group did not operate under a factory-like model, instead opting to work from home, sending their results and receiving their new tasks from the planners in a non-centralized manner. These calculators could produce an average of around 700 calculations a day.[4]/nThe tables developed by de Prony's team were doubly important for French metric cartography. Firstly, at the time, sailors needed logarithms for math pertaining to spherical geometry, because this was needed to quickly and accurately position themselves to guarantee safe and efficient travel across the seas.[7] However, the implementation of the new French Revolutionary metric system would make the old logarithmic tables would be obsolete, and French sailors would be unwilling to switch measurement systems since it would have rendered positional calculations significantly more difficult and less precise. Thus, de Prony, by making new logarithmic tables for the new metric system, would have facilitated the transition, enabling sailors to adopt the system. The second key element was that trigonometric values were needed for cadastral measures. Thus, for accurate mapping of the French territory and its subdivisions all the way down to the lowest levels of property ownership, de Prony needed to complete the trigonometric tables. These were both seen as crucial for Revolutionary pride considering the importance of naval prowess at the time and the need for administrative efficiency.[8]/nAccording to Prony, the project was to leave \"nothing to desire with respect to exactitude\" and to be \"the most vast... monument to calculation ever executed or even conceived.\" The tables were not used for their original purpose of bringing consistent standards for measurement, as the entire cadastre project saw delays in establishing both new measurement units as well as budget cuts. In particular, these tables, which were designed for the decimal division of circles and time, turned out to be obsolete after the French had changed their measurement system. Moreover, there was no practical use for the full extent of de Prony's calculation's accuracy. Hence, these tables became more of artifacts and monuments to Enlightenment rather than objects of practical use.[3]/nBy the turn of the 19th century, there was a shift in the meaning of calculation. The talented mathematicians and other intellectuals who produced creative and abstract ideas were regarded separately from those who were able to perform tedious and repetitive computations. Before the 19th century, calculation was regarded as a task for the academics, while afterwards, calculations were associated with unskilled laborers. This was accompanied by a shift in gender roles as well, as women, who were usually underrepresented in mathematics at the time, were hired to perform extensive computations for the tables as well as other computational government projects until the end of World War II. This shift in the interpretation of calculation was largely due to de Prony's calculation project during the French Revolution.[3]:\u200a186\u200a This project was able to unite people from many different walks of life as well as mathematical abilities (in the traditional sense) and hence changed the meaning of calculation from intelligence into unskilled labor.[3]:\u200a190/nProny was able to have artisans (workers who excelled in mechanical arts that require intelligence) work along with mathematicians to perform the calculations. Prony noted a few interesting observations about this new dynamic. First, it was fascinating to see so many different people work on the same problem. Second, he realized that even the ones with the least intellectual ability were able to perform these computations with astonishingly few errors. Prony saw this entire system as a collection of human computers working together as a whole - a machine governed by hierarchical principles of the division of labor. In fact, Prony may have begun to amend his notion of intelligence, which he began to use to evaluate the system as a whole, rather than evaluating the intelligence of its constituents.[3]:\u200a195,\u200a6/nCharles Babbage, credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, was inspired by de Prony's take on Smith's division of labor. He agreed with the three tiered system, but Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery. This would keep only the two highest groups human, and also would transform the role of the planners into a maintenance group for the machine.[9]/nThe French Revolutionary government passed the law that made the metric system the official measurement system in 1795, but they did not include the decimal angle measurement, making much of de Prony's work worthless. This also meant that the funding needed for de Prony to finish and publish his tables dried up. De Prony continued his work until 1800, but because his publisher went bankrupt, the work was not seen by the public eye until the first excerpt of the table was published a century later.[4] The Napoleonic government abandoned the project, before abandoning the metric system entirely in 1812 dooming de Prony's work.[10]/nOne of de Prony's important scientific inventions was the \"brake\" which he invented in 1821 to measure the torque produced by an engine./nHe also was first to propose using a reversible pendulum to measure gravity, which was independently invented in 1817 by Henry Kater and became known as the Kater's pendulum./nProny created a method of converting sinusoidal and exponential curves into a systems of linear equations. Prony estimation is used extensively in signal processing and finite element modelling of non linear materials.[11]/nProny was employed by Napoleon to superintend the engineering operations for protecting the province of Ferrara against the inundations of the Po and for draining and improving the Pontine Marshes. After the Restoration he was likewise engaged in regulating the course of the Rh\u00f4ne, and in several other important works.[12]/nProny was a member, and eventually president, of the French Academy of Science.  He was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810.  His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

He graduated from Oberlin College with a Bachelor of Arts in 1965, where he was influenced towards probability by Samuel Goldberg (b. 1925), an ex-student of William Feller. He moved to Stanford, taking classes with Kai Lai Chung, and writing his thesis, Weak Convergence of Conditioned Sums of Independent Random Vectors, in 1969 with advisor Samuel Karlin on problems associated with the invariance principle. He graduated with a Master of Science in 1966 and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1969.[1][2][3]/nLiggett joined the faculty at UCLA in 1969, where he spent his entire career.

Dubbed the Cardcaptor by the cards' guardian Cerberus (better known as Kero-chan), Sakura must wield the Clow Staff to capture the card spirits and turn them back into cards for her use. Sakura is aided by her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, who creates battle costumes for her as well as videotaping her ventures as Cardcaptor; and later by Syaoran Li, a Chinese boy who is a direct descendant of the Clow Cards' creator Clow Reed. The anime also introduced a fourth companion, Meiling Li (sometimes spelled as Meilin Li), Syaoran's cousin. The rest of the characters are mostly oblivious to Sakura's magical life, aside from her brother Toya who has his own magical powers, and later Eriol Hiiragizawa, who is a reincarnated Clow Reed./nThe anime was dubbed into English by Nelvana under the title of Cardcaptors, with most of the character names changed to English ones with the exception of Sakura, Meilin, Kero, Mr. Terada, Wang Wei, Ruby Moon, Yue, and Clow Reed./nA large number of the characters reappear as alternate selves in Clamp's other series, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic./nSakura Kinomoto (\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u3055\u304f\u3089, Kinomoto Sakura) is the heroine of Cardcaptor Sakura, named after the Japanese word for \"cherry blossom\". Her most defining character traits are her unyielding determination, caring nature and loyalty to her friends. Sakura is portrayed as a perceptively sweet, extremely energetic and cheerful character who is well-loved, pretty, cheerful, cute and at times na\u00efve, clumsy, and clueless. Sakura is athletically gifted and skilled in sports at school, being  an excellent runner and called the \"best baton twirler in school\" by her friends.[2] She hates math and is openly phasmophobic. Sakura maintains a crush on Yukito Tsukishiro for most of the manga and anime, but when she finally confesses to Yukito, she is gently rejected by him. Then, when asked by Sakura, he reveals he has feelings for her big brother, Touya. Eventually, Sakura realizes she is actually in love with Syaoran, but doesn't realize her feelings until he first confesses his love for her. Although she fails to admit her feelings in the final episode, Sakura later manages to finally confess her love to Syaoran when he and Meiling return to visit in the series movie, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card./nShe becomes the titular Cardcaptor by guardian beast Cerberus after accidentally opening and releasing the Clow Cards from the Clow Book. Aided by Cerberus, her best friend and cousin Tomoyo Daidouji, and later Syaoran, Sakura successfully captures all the cards and is named the new Clow Mistress by the cards' second guardian Yue (Yukito's true form).[3] In the second half of the manga and anime, Sakura must use the power of her own star to transform the Clow Cards into Sakura Cards, or else the cards would lose their powers. In the beginning of the Clear Card arc, all the Sakura cards suddenly turn blank, losing their powers and while looking for a way to restore them, Sakura must capture new cards of an unknown origin that started appearing around town. She later learns that Syaoran was responsible for the Sakura cards' disappearance in a move to protect her, as her own power had grown too strong for her to control, leading to the creation of the Clear cards./nFor all Japanese-language productions of the anime (including movies, audio CDs, and video games), Sakura is voiced by Sakura Tange. In the Animax English dub, she is voiced by Andrea Kwan. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Kari Wahlgren.[4] In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Monica Rial, who reprised her role as Sakura from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle.[5]/nIn the Nelvana English dub Cardcaptors, she is known as Sakura Avalon, though her given name is repronounced as \"Sa-KU-ra\" instead of \"SA-ku-ra\". She is voiced by Carly McKillip. In this version, she is portrayed as a more thick-skinned character than in the original anime, her initial romantic feelings for Yukito and fear of ghosts are removed, and later in the series she and Syaoran never developed their romance as it was heavily edited out./nCerberus[6] (/\u02c8s\u025c\u02d0rb\u0259r\u0259s/) (\u30b1\u30eb\u30d9\u30ed\u30b9, Keruberosu) (Greek: \u039a\u03ad\u03c1\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 K\u00e9rberos [kerberos]), nicknamed Kero by Sakura; is the appointed guardian of the book which holds the Clow Cards, as well as the series' provider of comic relief. He is one of two magical creatures created by Clow Reed along with the Clow Cards. Before his death, Clow appointed Kero as the one to select the potential candidate to be the next master of the cards, Cerberus himself, and his \"brother\" and fellow guardian, Yue. After Sakura accidentally releases the cards, Cerberus chooses her to be the candidate and teaches her the basics of capturing the cards. Throughout the series, he displays an extensive knowledge of mysticism. After Sakura passes the Final Judgment to become the Clow Cards master, Cerberus remains with her as a friend, companion, adviser, and protector when new threats appear./nHaving spent a lengthy amount of time in the book while it was in Osaka, Cerberus speaks with a pointed Osakan-accent.[7] He tends to be bossy, demanding, egotistical and gluttonous, but clearly displays his affection for Sakura, especially if she is hurt or in danger. He becomes very fond of video games, and is addicted to sweets.[7] Cerberus spends most of his time in a \"temporary\" or \"false form\": a small figure resembling an orange stuffed animal with wings.[7] Unlike Yue, Cerberus' magical powers are like the sun, and thus largely self-sustaining, and he is subsequently not as dependent on his master's power to support his life as is Yue. However, his master must have control of the Firey and Earthy cards in order to power his true form, a large-winged mountain lion. In the anime adaptation, the Light card is changed to the Earthy card to delay his obtaining his true form.[7] Cerberus' name is taken from the Greek mythological figure, Cerberus, a large three-headed dog who was assigned to guard the gates of the Greek underworld. In the bilingual Kodansha version of the manga, the name for Cerberus' borrowed form is Cero./nIn the anime adaptation, his false form is voiced by Aya Hisakawa, while his hidden form is voiced by Masaya Onosaka. In the Animax dub, his false form is voiced by Sarah Hauser, whereas his true form is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In the Cardcaptors dub, his name is spelled Keroberos (based on the Japanese pronunciation of his name), and \"Kero\" was repronounced as \"kir\u014d\" instead of \"ker\u014d\". In this dub, his false form is voiced by Matt Hill with a New York accent, and Richard Newman voices his true form, though the accent is not as distinct. In the second film, he is voiced by Wendee Lee and Dave Wittenberg, in his respective forms. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Kero's false form is voiced by Mikaela Krantz and Kero's true form is voiced by Christopher Sabat.[8]/nCerberus appears in Episode 44 of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle in his borrowed form, although in the parallel world he dwells in it appears to be his singular body.[9] Cerberus (using \"Kero\" as a nickname) guards the Country of Kero, and has a prophetic dream of Syaoran, Sakura, Fai, Kurogane and Mokona, the protagonists of Tsubasa, arriving in his world and recruits Mokona to climb up a mountain to retrieve one of Sakura's memory feathers which shrinks down the protagonists in size. Aya Hisakawa reprised her role as Cerberus for this character appearance, while Chris Cason provided his English voice.[10]/nTomoyo Daidouji (\u5927\u9053\u5bfa \u77e5\u4e16, Daid\u014dji Tomoyo) is the best friend and primary assistant of Sakura Kinomoto, and her second cousin on their mother's sides. The daughter of the president of Daid\u014dji Toy Company, Sonomi Daidoji (Sakura's aunt),[11] Tomoyo is a person of dignified bearing; svelte, sophisticated, ladylike, who lives a life of wealth and is watched over by a team of female maids and bodyguards.[12] She has access to a variety of state of the art prototype technological gadgets from her mother's company, and supplies Sakura and Cerberus with different mobile devices throughout the series. Her most defining character traits is her attentiveness, integrity and selflessness towards Sakura's welfare, and her love of spoiling her friend./nTomoyo is initially comes off as stereotypical \"Ojou-san\"; a demure, wealthy, upwardly-mobile high-class female stock character, especially one of nobility or gentry ancestry. However, she is depicted as having exceptional emotional maturity. Tomoyo is hard-working, highly motivated, compassionate, intelligent, meticulous; giving her a unique air of cultured politeness, deportment, refinement, and etiquette amongst the cast. Tomoyo regularly speaks using more formal verb conjugations and expressions than normally seen in elementary students. She uses 'watakushi', a personal pronoun which, when used outside of formal situations, makes a character seem either \"prim and proper,\" \"cultured,\" or \"snobby.\" Tomoyo is artistically gifted, having displayed talents as an amateur fashion designer, beautician, cinematographer, seamstress, choreographer, and vocalist. Tomoyo is shown announcing, performing, or costume designing in various school events. In the anime, her musical ability causes her to be targeted by both the Voice and Song cards. When needed, Tomoyo can exhibit considerable perceptiveness, cunning and resourcefulness, which was most prominently displayed in The Sealed Card film./nBecause Tomoyo lacks magical powers and athletic abilities, Sakura takes on an active protective responsibility most times when capturing or transforming cards. If Tomoyo is ever in danger (or missing), Sakura will be the one concerned for her most, and her focus changes from that of the Card at hand to prioritize Tomoyo's safety. Fortunately, Sakura has always succeeded and hugs Tomoyo warmly whenever she reunites with her. Starting in Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card, to remove herself from unnecessary danger while documenting Sakura's exploits, Tomoyo has begun using a small camera-equipped drone so as not to worry Sakura./nTomoyo is notable for her crafty streak and obsession of documenting every single detail of Sakura's personal life on video as much as possible, much to Sakura's discomfort. When she learns of Sakura's new role as a Cardcaptor, she insists that Sakura must wear \"special outfits\", is responsible for choreographing Sakura's new action poses and begins providing Sakura with the various \"magical girl\" protective-costumes she wears during her captures, as well as accompanying her on magical (and non-magical) endeavors to record the events with her video camera. This \"art project\" seems to serve Tomoyo's personal benefit and enjoyment rather than improving Sakura's performance. But she doesn't let her own desires supersede Sakura's needs and wants; she just wants to help and see Sakura be happy. Tomoyo faithfully assists, keeps Sakura's new identity secret and often covers for her in times of need./nIn both the manga and anime adaptations, Tomoyo admits that she loves Sakura, but Sakura replies innocently, \"I love you, too,\" in the platonic sense. This is emphasized using manga conventions: Tomoyo declares her love against a background of flowers, while Sakura replies against a blank white background. In the manga, some scenes give the appearance that Tomoyo has a crush on Sakura's brother Toya; however, according to Volume 1 of Clamp no Kiseki: The Ultimate Collection, and an interview in the Cardcaptor Sakura Memorial Book, this was an error caused by one of the finishing artists not being aware that CLAMP intended for Tomoyo to have romantic feelings for Sakura.[13] Later scenes show that Tomoyo recognizes that Toya and Sakura, being brother and sister, have the same ears, and that Tomoyo secretly blushed over Toya because his ears reminded her of Sakura.  Instead, she encourages Sakura's love of Yukito, and later becomes Syaoran's confidante and wingman when he begins to fall in love with Sakura./nCLAMP stated that the reason that Sakura does not return her friend Tomoyo's feelings is not because Tomoyo is another girl, as Sakura does not consider sex or gender a barrier for her romantic attraction. She simply does not have romantic feelings for Tomoyo in particular.[14] Demonstrating this, Sakura confesses that she has a crush on a female teacher in the series.[15]/nAlthough not the actual character, two of Tomoyo's alternate forms make an appearance in Cardcaptor Sakura's spiritual successor Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, three in the animated version./nIn the anime adaptation, the character is voiced by Junko Iwao. In the Animax dub, she is voiced by Sarah Hauser for the first season, and later by Claudia Thompson. In the English dub of Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, her voice is supplied by Michelle Ruff. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Tomoyo is voiced by Natalie Hoover.[8]/nIn the English adaptation Cardcaptors, Tomoyo is renamed Madison Taylor, she is voiced by Maggie Blue O'Hara, and her elegant speech was replaced with valley girl speech, similar to O'Hara's portrayal of Kitty Pryde in X-Men: Evolution. J.D. Considine of The New York Times called Tomoyo \"creepy\" and said it was \"no wonder\" that she had been changed so heavily in the adaptation.[16]/nTouya Kinomoto (\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u6843\u77e2, Kinomoto T\u014dya) is Sakura's older brother. His birthday is February 29. Though he teases her frequently, he cares a great deal for her and works to protect her. He is fully aware of what she is doing as a Cardcaptor, and regularly takes on several part-time jobs that put him in a position to be nearby when she is working on capturing a card. He is also known for being a chick magnet, a status only reinforced by the fact that he never dates or actively shows romantic interest in anyone. He disliked Syaoran and often holds a grudge against him, but deep down he thought to himself that if there was someone Sakura should be with it would be Syaoran. Touya possesses several magical powers, including the ability to see ghosts and other non-humans, the ability to sense when Sakura is in danger, and mild precognition. He has an extremely close relationship with his best friend Yukito; as the series progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that he is aware that Yukito is Yue's alter ego. To save both Yukito and Yue, Touya becomes a normal human being after he gives all of his magical powers to Yue, making him promise to protect Sakura in his stead as well as himself (and, by extension, Yukito).[17] However, it has been revealed in the last chapter of Clear Card arc that he is gradually regaining his magic and seems to be developing new and greater abilities that he shall reveal when the time is right./nIn the Japanese anime adaptation, Touya is voiced by Seki Tomokazu. In the English manga his name is spelled \"Toya\". In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin for the first season. In the English adaptation Cardcaptors, his name is changed to Tori Avalon and he is voiced by Tony Sampson. In the English dub of the second film, Kirk Thornton takes over the voicing role. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, Touya is voiced by Clifford Chapin.[8]/nYue/Yukito are an independent dissociative personality: Yukito is a \"false\" persona created to mask Yue's \"true\" identity. For most of the series, Yue remained in a \"state of hibernation\"; Yukito is unaware of Yue's existence, though he maintains an enormous appetite for food in an unconscious attempt to give Yue power. Yue's existence is revealed to the other characters after all of the Clow Cards are collected, and Toya states he knew of Yue's existence all along and was just waiting for Yukito to tell him himself./n/nSyaoran Li, sometimes spelled as Shaoran Li or originally as Xiaolang Li (\u674e\u5c0f\u72fc L\u01d0 Xi\u01ceol\u00e1ng; \u30ea\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30aa\u30e9\u30f3 Ri Shaoran, or Ri Syaoran (Kunrei);[18] Cantonese Jyutping: lei5 siu2 long4), is the love interest of the Japanese manga series Cardcaptor Sakura, created by CLAMP./nA member of the Li clan of sorcerers from Hong Kong, whom are distant relatives of Clow Reed, the creator of the Clow Cards, he initially rivals against Sakura because he believes that he should be the one to inherit the Clow Cards and tries to capture the cards for himself. As the series progresses, however, Syaoran comes to respect Sakura and becomes her friend and ally. He eventually falls in love with her, though she is slow to realize it due to her own feelings for Yukito./nOriginally, Syaoran appeared smitten with Yukito, but later revealed that the attraction was due to high moon power inside of Yukito. Eventually, in the beginning of the third season, Syaoran finally begins to realize he has deeply fallen in love with Sakura, as he constantly blushes whenever he is around her.[19] In the manga, Syaoran begins to develop feelings for Sakura around the time of the Erase Card's capture. Once Syaoran realizes his feelings, he tries to admit his love for Sakura several times, but is both too nervous to confess his feelings while also being constantly interrupted. Syaoran also becomes extremely jealous whenever he sees Sakura spending time with Eriol, believing he harbours romantic feelings for Sakura and considers him a rival. Syaoran's love for Sakura is proven to be really strong as he thinks strongly of her well-being and needs before his own as shown when after Yukito rejects Sakura's feelings, Syaoran comforts her even though Sakura is still unaware about his own romantic feelings towards her. Nearing the end of the series, Syaoran finally confesses his feelings to Sakura, but decides to return to Hong Kong, since Sakura has now become the new master of the cards./nIn the series  movie, Cardcaptor Sakura Movie 2: The Sealed Card, he and Meiling return from Hong Kong a few months later to visit. Throughout the movie, Syaoran waits for Sakura to reply to his confession, but as Sakura constantly keeps trying to tell him how she feels, they are repeatedly interrupted. Syaoran and Sakura work together to defeat the Nothing Card that has been secretly stealing the Sakura cards while making parts of Tomoeda disappear. Eventually at the end of the movie, they manage to defeat the Nothing Card, which becomes the Hope Card and Sakura finally confesses her love for Syaoran and jumps into his arms./nTwo years later, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda and enrolls at the same middle school as Sakura and most of her friends. However, his true objective is to watch over Sakura and help her with the mystery surrounding the Clear Cards. He also keeps contact with Eriol, who instructs him to not interfere until the time is right. Later he reveals to Sakura that he was the one who took away the spirits contained within the Sakura Cards in order to protect herself from her own power, which is growing out of control, thus leading to the creation of the Clear Cards. Despite intending to reveal all the truth to Sakura, Syaoran becomes unable to tell her anything about Akiho or Kaito's involvement due to a spell Kaito placed on him./nSyaoran manages to catch several cards by playing a major role in helping Sakura seal them. He is allowed to attempt the final judgment but fails. Syaoran is shown to have similar powers to Sakura, such as sensing Clow Cards and magical auras, is a skilled martial artist, and wields a sword which he can use to cast spells when equipped with incantation papers. He can also use a device (dubbed a \"lasenboard\" in the Cardcaptors anime dub[20]), which can detect and direct him to magical entities. A running gag is Kero calling him \"kid\"./nSyaoran is voiced by Motoko Kumai in the Japanese version. In the Animax English dub, he is voiced by Candice Moore. In the Nelvana English dub, he is voiced by Mona Marshall in the second feature film. In Funimation's English dub of Clear Card, he is voiced by Jason Liebrecht, who reprises his role as Syaoran from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle.[5]/nIn Cardcaptors, Syaoran's name is listed as Li Showron, and he is voiced by Rhys Huber during the Clow Cards arc and the first movie, and Jordan Kilik in the Sakura Cards arc. He is introduced as the male lead in the first episode of the dub (episode 8 of the original anime), and is considered a rival Cardcaptor. He is more abrasive and blunt than in the original anime version. Instead of being infatuated with Yukito, he is shy. He also does not develop a romantic interest in Sakura and is not close to telling her his feelings like he does in episode 69, one episode before the finale./nMeiling Li (\u674e\u8393\u9234 L\u01d0 M\u00e9il\u00edng, \u30ea\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3 Ri Meirin, Cantonese Jyutping: lei5 mui4 ling4), sometimes spelled as Meilin Li, is Syaoran Li's cousin and fianc\u00e9e, and only appears in the anime adaptation of Cardcaptor Sakura. Introduced towards the end of episode 19, she is a very impulsive, bratty, straightforward, clingy, and overconfident girl. As children living in Hong Kong, Meiling and Syaoran trained in martial arts under the tutelage of Wang Wei. One night her pet bird escaped from its cage, and the normally quiet and withdrawn Syaoran told her not to cry, then left. After spending hours in the rain, he returned with the bird and Meiling was both grateful and touched. From that day, she devoted herself to him, eventually declaring that she liked Syaoran above all others and, reasoning that he liked her as well, she declared them to be engaged, much to Syaoran's chagrin. At the same time, she promised that if he found someone he liked more than her, he would tell her and she would release him from the promise.[21]/nIn coming to Tokyo, Meiling intends to help Syaoran find and gather the Clow Cards, and actively dislikes Sakura. As the series progresses, Meiling develops a grudging respect for Sakura that turns into a good friendship by the time Meiling returns to Hong Kong in episode 43 by her mother due to unknown reasons. During her initial visit, Meiling seemed to recognize that Syaoran was falling in love with Sakura, but it wasn't until she briefly returned in episode 60 that she acknowledges and accepts Sakura  as the person Syaoran loves. Wanting to keep her promise, Syaoran attempts to tell her that he loves Sakura, but Meiling interrupts and tells him that she knows because he is now calling Sakura by her first name, something he only does for his sisters and her. She releases Syaoran from their promise, then quickly leaves. Meiling spends the night at Tomoyo Daid\u014dji's house and releases all of her frustration by crying without burdening Syaoran. At the end of the episode, Meiling returns home and is not seen again in the main series. She returns in the second movie, with Syaoran, to see her old friends, but actually secretly came back to help Sakura finally confess her love to Syaoran. Meiling also occasionally appears in the anime adaptation of Clear Card, talking to Sakura on the phone and giving her hints at developing her relationship with Syaoran. A running gag is Kero calling her \"brat.\"/nAlong with her temporary stay in Tomoeda and being supportive of Syaoran, Meiling also plays a limited role in the story because, unlike Syaoran, she has no magical abilities, relying solely on her physical fighting abilities and a healthy dose of pride. Her lack of powers and tendency to leap before thinking, however, results in her hindering more than helping Syaoran in most battles against the cards. She challenges The Fight card in episode 20, and was nearly badly wounded and had to be rescued by Syaoran. Recognizing that she was being a burden, Meiling grew upset and lashed out at Syaoran. However, she was then able to be an aid to him while fighting The Twin card, as their years of practicing martial arts together enables them to match the card's synchronized fighting style./nIn Clear Card episode 13, Meiling matured and is much less of a brat than she used to be. Even Sakura is amazed to see Meiling speak so politely to Fujitaka, to which Meiling responds, \u201cIt\u2019s just good manners,\u201d as if that's how she's always been.[22]/nMeiling's signature hairstyle is the Chinese ni\u00faji\u01ceot\u00f3u (\u725b\u89d2\u5934)./nIn the Japanese version of the anime adaptation, Meiling is voiced by Yukana. In the Animax English dub, she is voiced by Sarah Hauser. In the English dub of the second movie, she is voiced by Julie Maddalena. In the English dub of the Clear Card arc, she is voiced by Trina Nishimura.[8]/nIn the English adaptation Cardcaptors, she is known as Meilin Rae and is voiced by Nicole Oliver. Her unrequited engagement with Syaoran was omitted along with the fact that she and Syaoran were cousins. Rather she is portrayed as a long time friend of Syaoran and her romantic feelings toward him were watered down but still evident./nClow Reed (\u30af\u30ed\u30a6\u30fb\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9, Kur\u014d R\u012bdo) is the sorcerer who originally created the Clow Cards, and their magical guardians Cerberus and Yue. Along with Kohaku of Wish, and Yuuko of xxxHolic, he is one of the few Clamp-created characters to appear in more than one work./nBorn of an English father and a Chinese mother, Clow created a new type of magic that blended both Eastern and Western magical elements. His plan was to hand down the magic to people who would use and protect it while meeting all of the qualifications. However, few people could learn his brand of magic. The character of Clow is only seen in flashbacks, as he has long been dead before the series starts. Few details are revealed about his character, personality, or life, though multiple characters comment on his eccentricity. He displays a gentle and affable personality in his interactions with his creations./nWhen Clow knew he was about to die, he chose his then-unborn descendant Sakura Kinomoto to become the new guardian of the cards and the new master of Yue and Cerberus. Clow's magical ability allowed him to foresee most of the future and plan many of the situations that would enable Sakura to succeed in taking full possession of the Clow Cards. Likewise, he deliberately made the sealing wand pink, reflecting that its future user would be a young girl. He also split his soul into two reincarnations: Eriol Hiiragizawa, who had all of his memories and magic, and Fujitaka Kinomoto, Sakura's father. In the anime adaptation, Clow does not split his soul, instead passing on his memories, soul and powers to Eriol exclusively. Syaoran Li is also an indirect descendant of Clow's Chinese lineage./nIn the anime adaptation and the film, he is voiced by Kazuo Hayashi. In the Animax English dub, he is voiced by Darren Pleavin. In Nelvana's English adaptation, Cardcaptors, his given name is repronounced as \"klau\u0307\" instead of \"kl\u014d\", and is voiced by Dale Wilson. Clow Reed also appears in two additional CLAMP works, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic, where he has another descendant named Fei-Wang Reed and worked with the Dimensional Witch Y\u016bko Ichihara in arranging the series of events in the former series./nFujitaka Kinomoto (\u6728\u4e4b\u672c \u85e4\u9686, Kinomoto Fujitaka) is the father of titular character Sakura Kinomoto and her brother Touya Kinomoto. A busy professor of archaeology at Towa University, Fujitaka is a kind and caring father. He met his late wife Nadeshiko while doing his first year as a teacher at her high school. Nadeshiko had climbed a tree to return a baby bird to its nest, but fell out of the tree, landing on Fujitaka. Upon seeing her, he stated that \"an angel has fallen from the sky.\" They fell in love and married when she was sixteen. Though Nadeshiko died seven years before the start of the series, Fujitaka is shown to still be very much in love with her and devoted to her memory. He keeps a picture of her in the dining room, changing it each morning./nLittle is initially said about Fujitaka's family or past. During the second half of the series, it is revealed that when Clow Reed divided his soul (seeking to no longer be the most powerful magician in the world), he split it into two halves. One of these halves became Eriol Hiiragizawa, holding all of Clow's magic and memories, and the other being Fujitaka, who has no magic of his own, but fathered the one who would inherit the cards. It is stated that Fujitaka has no magical powers of his own, but he is also unaffected by other Clow's magic, such as the Eriol's sleep spell. At the end of the series, Eriol gives half of his magic to Fujitaka. This enables Fujitaka to finally see the spirit of Nadeshiko, who has been watching over her family since her death./nIn the anime adaptation, Fujitaka's role as the other half of Clow Reed's reincarnation is completely removed as is his immunity to Eriol's magic and he is never able to see Nadeshiko's spirit. He is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka. In the Cardcaptors dub, his name is changed to Aiden Avalon and he is voiced by Brian Drummond. In the Animax dub, he is voiced by Scott Evans. In the English dub of the second movie, he is voiced by Michael McConnohie.

She is rarely seen in the series, but is said to be a wealthy woman and the President of a large toy corporation. She greatly loved her cousin Nadeshiko, and disapproved of her marriage to Fujitaka, later blaming Fujitaka for Nadeshiko's death at a young age. During the marriage, it is implied that Nadeshiko was at least partially cut off from her family. Sonomi maintains a pixie cut, a hairstyle Nadeshiko loved giving her when they were kids; and has Tomoyo keep her hair long because it reminds her of Nadeshiko./nAfter meeting Sakura tite for the first time, Sonomi realizes that Nadeshiko had lived a happy life and is able to come to terms with the marriage. At times, she still treats Fujitaka as a \"rival\" competing to love Nadeshiko more, but she also helps him pass on gifts from Sakura to her grandfather and to arrange for Sakura to meet her great-grandfather while on a family vacation. Sonomi shows great affection for Sakura\u2013treating her like her own daughter\u2013and often clears her busy work schedule to join her and Tomoyo whenever Sakura comes over to visit./nIn the Cardcaptors English adaptation, her name is changed to Samantha Taylor and her declaration of love for Nadeshiko is modified to a purely familiar love rather than a romantic love./nSonomi is voiced by Miki It\u014d in anime series.

She met Fujitaka when she climbed a tree to rescue a bird nest and accidentally fell, and landed on him as he saved her from getting hurt. He then remarked, \"l had thought an angel fell from the sky\". With those words, she fell in love with him. Soon after, against the wishes of her family, they got married despite their nine-year age gap (he was 25, she was 16). She died from an unnamed illness when Sakura was three. Because she was 27 when she died and Sakura was three and Toya was ten, it is likely that she gave birth to Toya at 17. Although she has died, she is still very much remembered and loved by her family; Fujitaka keeps her picture in the family room and Sakura never fails to greet her photo every morning. She appears occasionally as a spirit and is seen only by Toya, Eriol, and Sakura (beginning with volume 4 of the Clear Card arc)./nNadeshiko is voiced by Y\u016bko Minaguchi in the anime series.

In the manga, they become engaged when he gives her a ring, noting that he hopes it will one day become her wedding ring. Rika gives him a teddy bear she made and named after herself, which legends says will allow them to remain in love forever. Towards the end of the series, when Sakura is unsure of her feelings about Syaoran, the couple is shown having a picnic at a park, with Terada slipping away so Sakura doesn't notice him. During the series, none of the other characters appear to know about the relationship, though when Rika is taken over by the Sword card, Sakura hears her call out \"Sensei\" (teacher) when she uses the Illusion card to show Rika her most beloved./nIn the anime adaptation, their relationship is not shown in the same light. Their engagement and more romantic scenes between them are removed, and Rika notes that Terada reminds her of her absentee father. Terada is also shown accepting cakes made by Rika and in accepting the bear and naming it after his \"hardest working student.\" In the Cardcaptors English dub, he is simply called Mr. Terada, and all aspects of the romantic relationship between Terada and Rika are completely removed, with Rika's shyness and reactions to him made to appear to be more of a general fear of men than romantic feelings./nIn the anime series, he is voiced by T\u014dru Furusawa for the first season and first movie, and by Katsuyuki Konishi for the second and third seasons and the second film.

Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved (or greatest fear in the English dub), allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial Eriol Hiiragizawa created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card./nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher Yoshiyuki Terada. In the manga series, they are engaged to be married when she is old enough, and they frequently spend time alone together on \"dates.\" In the anime adaptation, the engagement is removed as are many of their dates, however they are still shown to have affection for one another (it's implied that he reminds her of her father, who's oft busy on overseas business). Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. In both the manga and anime, when Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika's attacks induced by the Sword card, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look./nAfter graduating from Elementary School, Rika is the only among Sakura's friends who enrolled in a different Junior High School, and thus is not seen with them in Clear Card, although they usually keep in touch./nIn the Cardcaptors English adaptation, Rika's name is translated as Rita and all hints of her relationship with Terada are removed.

He is infamously known for fabricating highly detailed stories on the supposed history of practically any subject, usually whatever Sakura and her friends happening to be discussing.  Sakura and Syaoran are often gullible enough to believe the stories, which often provide an element of humour in the series.  His stories are primarily interrupted by Chiharu, who physically disciplines him by strangling him until he stops talking and will resort to dragging him away when she proves to be unsuccessful.  His storytelling is later supplemented by Eriol, who helps to reinforce the false validity of his stories and whose presence prevents Chiharu from stopping Yamazaki's lies.  Notably, Yamazaki's eyes are almost never open, causing Meiling to hypothesize that he only opens his eyes when telling the truth, a hypothesis that is later proven false./nWhile generally viewed as lighthearted and energetic, Yamazaki can also be sensitive and serious. In the last volume of the manga, when Sakura was down, he leaves the scene in order for Chiharu to talk to Sakura. Chiharu adds that he understands that Sakura needs her guidance and counseling, which is why he left so they could talk rather than stay to tell stories./nYamazaki is named after film director, Takashi Yamazaki, who is a friend of CLAMP.[citation needed]  He is known as Zachary Marker in the English adaptation Cardcaptors and his relationship with Chiharu is written so that they are cousins and her acts of strangling are the result of sibling rivalry.

Chiharu's most notable trait is her relationship with Takashi Yamazaki, whom she has known since kindergarten.[23]  She is never fooled by his rampant storytelling and is usually driven silence him by comically strangling him, which usually does not prevent him from continuing. Despite the rough-handling, she and Yamazaki actually share a close relationship and it is implied that they care for one another in a more affectionate manner. In the last volume of the series, Chiharu speaks openly about her relationship with Yamazaki when Sakura turns to her for advice on love and true feelings as Sakura reflects on her own relationship with Syaoran./nIn the Cardcaptors dub, she is known as Chelsea and Yamazaki is written as her cousin to justify the random acts of strangling as sibling rivalry./nIn the Japanese version, she is voiced by Miwa Matsumoto.

Despite being bad at gymnastics, she is also a member of the school's cheerleading squad alongside Sakura./nNaoko loves reading various types of stories, especially fantasy stories and ghost stories.

Initially objecting to Nadeshiko's marriage to Fujitaka Kinomoto, he became more accepting upon meeting Sakura and later receiving a gift from her as a form of peace between family members. In the episode, Sakura and the Rainbow of Memories, Sakura doesn't know who he was and they spent a good time together, playing tennis, having tea, Sakura giving him cookies and Masaki giving Sakura the dress her mother wore. Just before leaving, Sakura used the Rain card to make a rainbow for Masaki, prompting him to remember when Nadeshiko had first pointed out a rainbow to him.

After this incident, the readers learn that Sakura's older brother Toya dated Kaho when she was his junior high school teacher and that they broke up when Kaho left to study in England. Before she left, she told them that when they met again, they would be in love with different people which he acknowledges is now true./nAfter meeting her, Cerberus incorrectly believes that Kaho is the false form of his fellow guardian Yue, which is later shown to actually be Yukito Tsukishiro. Kaho's role is to use the bell left at her family's shrine to give Sakura another chance when she is unable to defeat Yue out of fear of hurting him. The bell changes Sakura's staff into a new staff containing her own power of the stars and gives her the power to use the cards to defeat Yue. After fulfilling this duty, she returns to England.

He moves from England to transfer to Tomoeda Elementary school after Sakura Kinomoto passed the Last Judgement and became the official master of the cards. He is depicted as a quiet, mature boy while at school, though he also shows a mischievous side when he regularly joins classmate Takashi Yamazaki in weaving complex lies about the history of objects, places, and events. While seeming a normal student to Sakura, Syaoran Li is suspicious of him, mainly due to that Eriol is overly nice to Sakura which makes Syaoran jealous. It is soon shown that Yue and Cerberus are able to detect his magical signature as being Clow's, and Eriol must erase Yue's memories of encountering him after he is accidentally seen by him./nEriol came to Japan in order to aid Sakura and force her to use her own magical powers to convert the Clow Cards into Sakura cards. This is necessary as the cards take their magical energy from their master, but until Sakura converted them, they could not use her magic and were slowly dying. The guardian Yue also was suffering the same fate, forcing Sakura's brother to \"feed\" him all of his magical power to prevent Yue, and his false form Yukito, from dying./nSakura does not become aware that Eriol is causing all of the magical disasters that are forcing her to convert the cards until near the end of the series when Eriol reveals himself to her.

He then takes Sakura, Syaoran, Tomoyo, Yue, and Cerberus to his home where he explains why he had to give her a reason to convert the cards, as her doing so without a need could have been dangerous for Sakura./nEriol's true age is unknown, as he used his magic to halt his aging process to remain the same physical age as Sakura. He is romantically involved with Kaho Mizuki, whom he originally sent from England to aid Sakura in the Final Judgment and who offers Sakura support through letters during the second arc.

While questioned about his reasons, Eriol claims that he is waiting for the right time to interfere, and thus forbids both Syaoran and his companions in England from taking action until then./nIn the anime series, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, with all of the elements from the manga regarding Fujitaka's relation to Clow and inheriting of half of his powers removed. The final explanation at Eriol's house is also shifted slightly so it takes place the day after the final battle, rather than immediately after, and it is done because Sakura seeks him out rather than him giving an invitation./nThe character of Eriol is voiced by Nozomu Sasaki.

Nicknamed Suppi by Ruby Moon, Spinel Sun spends most of his time reading and projects a calm demeanor. Ruby Moon often teases him that he needs to have more fun. During the series, he mostly remains out of sight of the main characters, except when he once runs into Cerberus in his false form (though this encounter is exclusive to the anime). Fortunately for him, Cerberus doesn't suspect anything and instead declares Spinel Sun a monster and feeds him, sweets, not realizing that the sweets would turn him into a hyperactive eating machine. Cerberus does not learn his true identity until just before the final battle when the two cats face one another. Initially, Spinel Sun appears to have the upper hand, however, Cerberus' greater determination to protect Sakura enables him to defeat him./nIn the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in his true form, and by Yumi T\u014dma in his false form.

Ruby Moon has a friendly brother/sister relationship with Eriol's other guardian, Spinel Sun; she teases him constantly and gives him a nickname \"Suppi-chan\", and is granted free-rein by Eriol to do as she pleases, which contrasts with Spinel's serious demeaner and reluctance to leave his master's side./nHer true form resembles a human-sized fairy dressed long dark red and black gown, with black and pink butterfly wings that performs ruby-based attacks. As with Yue, Ruby Moon also takes his energy from the Moon, and both are rivals in power and ability.

Thus-far, it has been hinted that he's after the Clear Cards as a means of powering a certain spell, possibly connected to a magical object, a magical time-controlling pocket watch (mentioned above), which he had stolen from the society of sorcerers he was formerly a part of, and that he's using both Sakura and Akiho to get them (having some-how created a connection between then before they had even met, which is evident by them sharing the same reoccurring dreams but are completely oblivious that they have been seeing one another), but that the ones that Sakura has created so far are not yet enough for his purpose to activate the Alice in Clockland relic he stole from the magic association from which he was excommunicated./nIn the anime adaptation, Yuna D.

Canright was an exceptionally smart student during high-school and took upper-level classes, most notably in math and Chemistry. She met her future husband, Richard Canright, when they were both undergrads at Miami University of Ohio, where her father was a Professor and dean of students. After eloping when she was 19 and he was 21, they moved to Pasadena for Richard to attend graduate school at Caltech. Before joining JPL, Canright worked as a typist while attending college at Occidental College in Los Angeles.[1] Canright graduated from Occidental College in 1940./nIn 1939 the National Academy of Sciences approached Caltech's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (who were known around Caltech's campus as the \"Suicide Squad\" because of numerous experiments gone wrong) with a grant for Rocket Research of $1,000. The next year, the U.S. government invested $10,000 into the program,[1] which prompted the group to hire outside help. One of the men who started JPL, Frank Malina, approached Barbara and Richard Canright for positions as mathematicians. Both Barbara and Richard accepted the positions which made Barbara the only female employee at JPL at the time. During her time at JPL, Canright calculated thrust from rocket engines and analyzed the data to increase performance.[1] One of JPL's, and Canright's, crowning achievements was the successful use of rockets for bomber aircraft.[2] After the successful development of jet propulsion bombers, JPL shifted its focus to designing a rocket which would reach a higher altitude than a helium-filled balloon. Canright, along with Melba Nead, Virginia Prettyman, and Macie Roberts, were responsible for calculating the potential of rocket propellants.[1] In 1943, after the success of designing and testing of a rocket propellant, Canright became pregnant with her first child. Due to the unavailability of maternity leave in 1943, Canright had to resign.[2]/nJust like her early life, Canright's life after the JPL program has largely been forgotten. Some information has been uncovered through Barbara's daughter, Patricia Canright Smith. Throughout Barbara and Richard's marriage they had four children: Bruce Canright, Patricia Canright Smith, Geoff Canright, and David Canright. Bruce was a scientist at NASA, Geoff, a physics professor, David, a math professor, and Patricia, a private-practice psychotherapist.[4] In 1964 Barbara and Richard Canright divorced after 26 years of marriage. Barbara Canright died in Seattle Washington at age 78 on September 17, 1997./nBarbara Canright's crucial role in the development of the JPL program has been remembered through Nathalia Holt's book Rise of the Rocket Girls and an article by Occidental College, Canright's Alma mater, Guardians of the Galaxy.

He is an author of widely used primers in critical thinking and ethical practice and of a variety of unconventional books and essays on philosophical topics./nWeston was born in 1954 and grew up in the Sauk County region of southwestern Wisconsin, country identified with the conservationist Aldo Leopold (in his Sand County Almanac) and the architect and visionary Frank Lloyd Wright, a strong influence on his father's family.[1] He is a 1976 Honors graduate of Macalester College, and received his PhD in philosophy in 1982 from the University of Michigan, where he wrote his PhD dissertation with Frithjof Bergmann on \"The Subjectivity of Values\".[2] He taught at the State University of New York at Stony Brook for ten years, and subsequently at Elon University, where he has won the university's premiere awards for both teaching and scholarship,[3] as well as abroad in Costa Rica, Western Australia, and British Columbia./nWeston has worked in philosophy for his entire professional life but teaches and writes on interdisciplinary themes and beyond as well. He has co-taught with biologists and ecologists and in both Philosophy and Environmental Studies at Elon,[4] working as well with astronomers,[5] Zen masters[6] and in environmental education programs[7] as well as on design and social change projects such as Common Ground Eco-Village.[8] Weston retired from full-time teaching in 2018 while continuing to write and to take more leadership roles in the eco-village./nWeston's philosophical project as a whole advances an expansive \"toolbox\" for critical, creative, and constructive thinking, especially for purposes of social and environmental re-imagination and pragmatic ethical practice. The social, ethical, even ontological problems that we so often take as \"given\" are more often, he argues, products of underlying conditions, practices, and choices.[9] This view may be identified with deconstruction, but too often, Weston argues,/nThis reconstructive project calls on a set of skills and concepts less often recognized and valued in philosophy. Inspired in particular by the pragmatic social philosophy of John Dewey, Weston envisions open-ended, generative, imaginative and experimental thinking, modeled on crafts such as building or performance and empirical science, gradually displacing more category-bound and formal thinking that tends to be more reactive and critical. In a variety of essays and books he lays out key concepts such as \"the hidden possibilities of things\" \u2013 the sense that the world has much more depth and possibility than it may seem \u2013 and correlatively the need to thematize and resist self-validating reduction, the process by which some being or some part of the world are reduced to less than they might be, and then that very reduction is taken as an excuse and validation for itself, the obliterated possibilities now thoroughly out of view.[10] Correspondingly, the task of knowing and valuing is not to \"read off\" the nature and possibility of things off the world as it is \"given\", but to actively engage the world, to \"venture the trust\" to create new kinds of openings in interaction with the world within which deeper possibilities might emerge.[11]/nSettled modes of value issue in the familiar ethics, of persons for example, but the \"originary\" areas of ethics, as Weston calls them, are only now taking shape, and are not a matter of extension or application of pre-given principles but rather the co-creation or co-constitution of new values. In environmental ethics in particular, Weston argues that we stand at the very beginning of our exploration.[12] At the same time, he also argues for a \"multicentric\" approach to reconstituting the human relation to the more-than-human world, as opposed to the \"mono-centrism\" that could either be human-centered (anthropocentric) or larger-than-human but still \"centered\" in the sense that one dimension and model for values determines who or what morally counts and why.[13]/nAnother key theme is the centrality of the built and lived world to the shaping of thought, as well as vice versa. Philosophers tend to assume a one-way connection\u2014that thought determines world\u2014while philosophy's critics, such as doctrinaire Marxists, see it just the other way around. In Weston's view the connection goes both ways, and is genuinely dialectical. A world or a set of concrete practices represent the enactment of certain ideas, but they also shape our ideas in turn. The cultural enactment and perpetuation of anthropocentrism is one good example. But this is, in his view, a good thing, and a necessary one: it gives thought an anchor, allows us to work out ideas concretely, and gives us a lever for philosophical change as well: by actually changing the world.[14] Once again, the world as it is, is not somehow the limit of possibility./nFinally, just as ethical practice becomes intelligent, creative, critical engagement with problematic situations and possibilities rather than \"puzzle-solving\", so even the widely taught and conventional field of critical thinking becomes something more than a matter of testing someone else's arguments for \"fallacies\", but rather a constructive and open-ended process of framing one's own arguments and energetically recasting and exploring others' lines of thought./nWeston has called his overall project \"Pragmatopian\", adapting Charlotte Perkins Gilman's term for the project of her visionary novels: radical but experimental utopias. Philosophy as he tries to practice it, Weston has said, is a kind of \"pragmatopian dare\".[15]/nWeston has written over fifty essays and reviews in the above fields as well as others such as philosophy of education and the philosophy of space exploration. Some of the more noted and often-reprinted of these are (original appearances only):/nCritics argue that Weston's notions of \"originary ethics\" and \"reconstructive engagement\" offer little or no concrete guidance, especially in less-than-optimal situations in which choices nonetheless must be made. Though Weston has challenged what he has called \"dilemma-ism\" as a method of doing ethics or as an expectation about the necessary structure of ethical problems, sometimes we do have genuine dilemmas that need to be addressed. Some critics hold that Weston's commitment to opening up new possibilities may open up a range of problematic and possibly disturbing possibilities as well.[17]/nWeston's ethics textbooks in particular take substantive positions in ethical philosophy. Weston's rationale is that any practical textbook necessarily does so, and that this  is just less noticeable or objectionable to traditionalists in the usual textbooks because the substance tends to be the taken-for-granted norms.[18] Weston's method is to try to reconstruct certain fields the long way around: by rewriting their textbooks, modeling a quite different approach in practice and therefore inviting new kinds of students into the field and perhaps also reshaping their teachers' views without arguing in the usual way against the assumed norms.", "65311565": "Martin Pearson Roseveare (24 April 1898, in Great Snoring \u2013 30 March 1985, in Mzuzu, Malawi) was an English mathematician responsible for designing the ration books for the United Kingdom used during the Second World War./nMartin attended Marlborough College thanks to winning a scholarship, then proceeding to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics.

His father's family could trace its history back to the Norman conquest when it acquired land at Routh near Beverley, Yorkshire. His mother's family, the Taschereau family, was well-established in Quebec, tracing their ancestry back to the early days of the French colony.  His parents were Sir Randolph Isham Routh (1782\u20131858) and his second wife, Marie Louise Taschereau (1810\u20131891).[3] Sir Randolph was Commissary General of the British Army 1826, Chairman of the Irish Famine Relief Commission (1845\u201348) and Deputy Commissary General, the senior Commissariat officer at the Battle of Waterloo, and Marie Louise was the daughter of Judge Jean-Thomas Taschereau and the sister of Judge Jean-Thomas and Cardinal Elz\u00e9ar-Alexandre Taschereau.[5]/nRouth came to England aged eleven and attended University College School and then entered University College, London in 1847, having won a scholarship.

Such coordinates are associated with conserved momenta and as such are useful in problem solving.[8] Routh also devised a new method for solving problems in mechanics. Although Routh's procedure does not add any new insights, it allows for more systematic and convenient analysis, especially in problems with many degrees of freedom and at least some cyclic coordinates.[9][10]/nIn addition to his intensive work in teaching and writing, which had a persistent effect on the presentation of mathematical physics, he also contributed original research such as the Routh\u2013Hurwitz theorem./nCentral tenets of modern control systems theory relied upon the Routh stability criterion (though nowadays due to modern computers it is not as important), an application of Sturm's theorem to evaluate Cauchy indices through the use of the Euclidean algorithm.", "52728667": "Sir William Richard Joseph Cook, KCB FRS (10 April 1905\u00a0\u2013 16 September 1987) was a British civil servant and mathematician./nA graduate of Bristol University, he joined the staff of the Woolwich Arsenal in 1928, working on the 6-inch naval guns and the 3-inch antiaircraft rocket. During the Second World War he was deputy controller of the Projectile Development Establishment. After the war he became director of the Ministry of Supply's Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire. In 1947 he joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service, serving as its chief from 1950 to 1954, when he became deputy head of the Weapons Group of the newly created United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). It was under his leadership that Britain developed the hydrogen bomb, and he was present as the scientific director of the Operation Grapple nuclear tests at Malden Island in May and June 1957, and the successful thermonuclear test at Christmas Island in November 1957. In 1958, he became the UKAEA's Member for Engineering and Production, and oversaw the expansion of the civil nuclear power industry./nCook returned to the Ministry of Defence in 1960 as one of two deputies to the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence. Cook served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence from 1966 until 1970, when he retired from the civil service. He oversaw the development of weapons such as the Panavia Tornado, Rapier surface-to-air missile, SEPECAT Jaguar and FH70 howitzer. After Rolls-Royce went bankrupt in 1970, he chaired a committee that determined that the Rolls-Royce RB211 engine should be continued. When Rolls-Royce was nationalised in 1971, he was appointed one of the company's directors. He retired in 1976, but continued to assist the company for four more years. He was also a director of GEC Marconi Electronics from 1972 to 1979, and Marconi International Marine from 1971 to 1975, and a consultant to British Telecom from 1982 to 1985./nWilliam Richard Joseph (Bill) Cook was born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire on 10 April 1905, the oldest child of John Cook, a railway inspector, and his wife, Eva n\u00e9e Boobyer.[1] He had two younger siblings; a sister, Stella, and a brother, Leonard. He was educated at Trowbridge Trinity School and Trowbridge Boy's High School\n(merged with the girls' grammar school in 1969, becoming comprehensive in 1974 as The John of Gaunt School). He gained his Higher School Certificate with a distinction in mathematics, for which he was awarded a university scholarship. He entered Bristol University, from which he received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1925. This was followed by a Diploma of Education in 1926, and a Master of Science degree in 1927, writing his dissertation on \"The forces between atoms and ions\".[2]/nCook worked as a part-time lecturer, and an assistant to John Lennard-Jones. He considered becoming a teacher, but in 1928 he elected to become a civil servant instead, joining the staff of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich as a librarian.[1] He initially worked in the external ballistics section of the Research Department there, where he developed the Cook Camera. This was used to investigate the problem of the inaccuracy of the Royal Navy's triple-mounted 6 inch naval guns. The problem was traced to the blast waves interfering with each other, and was resolved by delaying the firing of the middle gun by a few milliseconds.[2] In 1929, he married Grace Purnell.[1] They had a daughter, Betty.[3]/nIn 1935 Cook was sent to work on the 3-inch anti-aircraft rocket,[4] the brainchild of Lord Cherwell and Duncan Sandys.[5] The rocket had a problem, the bonding of the cordite to the outer case failing. Cook led the project which corrected this, enabling the rockets to be deployed in 1940, with the first battery under Sandys' command, in time to support the air defence of Britain during the Second World War.[4] He divorced Grace in 1939, and married  Gladys Allen, a librarian at Woolwich.[1] They had a son, Robert Anthony, and a daughter, Elizabeth Mary.[3] The Rocket Development Department moved from Woolwich to Fort Halstead, and then to Aberporth in 1940, where it became the Projectile Development Establishment, with Sir Alwyn Crow as Controller of Projectile Development and Cook as his deputy.[4]/nIn 1943, Cook was asked to provide an expert opinion on military intelligence that the Germans were developing long-range rockets. Cherwell, Crow and Cook were agreed that a long-range liquid-propellant rocket was technologically infeasible, and a solid-propellant rocket using cordite would be impractically large. Wernher von Braun proved them wrong, with the successful deployment of the V-2 rocket. Cook then turned to the study of missile guidance mechanisms for the British Liquid Oxygen-Petrol / Guided Aerial Projectile  (LOP/GAP) liquid-propellant rocket. After the war he became director of the Ministry of Supply's Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire.[4]/nFunding for the Rocket Propulsion Establishment was niggardly, and in 1947 the Chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service (CRNSS), Frederick Brundrett, recruited Cook as his Director of Physical Research. In this capacity, Cook was mainly concerned with underwater warfare, particularly the detection of submarines. In 1950, Brundrett became Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence to Sir Henry Tizard, and Cook succeeded him as CRNSS.[4] He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1951.[6] Tizard retired soon after the 1951 election that returned Winston Churchill's Conservative Party to office, and was succeeded by Sir John Cockcroft. But Cockcroft was also the director of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire, and found himself unable to devote sufficient time to both roles. He therefore was succeeded as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence by Brundrett in 1954. Brundrett asked Cook to become the chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee.[4]/nOn 27 July 1954, Cabinet agreed to develop the hydrogen bomb.[7] This task would fall most heavily on the shoulders of Sir William Penney, who was appointed the head of the Weapons Group of the newly created United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).[8] To help him, Penney suggested Cook be appointed as his deputy.[9] Sir Geoffrey Taylor supported this,[10] and the Lord President of the Council, the Marquess of Salisbury, persuaded the First Sea Lord, Sir Rhoderick McGrigor, to release Cook to work with Penney.[7] Cook commenced work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston on 1 September 1954.[9] His task was to manage the British hydrogen bomb programme.[10] He confessed to the chief scientist, Samuel Curran, \"I'm not a real scientist.\"[11]/nAlthough Penney and Cook had very different temperaments, they forged a good working relationship.[12] Under Cook, \"the establishment ran like clockwork... everything was well-documented; there was a lot of open discussion; and everything operated on a very short time scale.\"[13] Cook kept a tight rein on the work through the Weapons Development Policy Committee, which he created in April 1956.[13] The consensus of scientists who worked on the project was that Britain would not have developed the hydrogen bomb without Cook, although Cook gave the credit to Penney.[14] Cook was present as the scientific director of the Operation Grapple nuclear tests at Malden Island in May and June 1957,[15][10] and the successful thermonuclear test at Christmas Island in November 1957.[16] He was created a knight bachelor in the 1958 New Year Honours.[17]/nOn 1 February 1958, Cook became the UKAEA's Member for Engineering and Production vice Sir Christopher Hinton, who had left to become chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board. In the wake of an inquiry by Lord Fleck, production was separated from the UKAEA's Industry Group in July 1959, and Cook became Member for Development and Engineering. In April 1961, these two functions were also separated, and Cook became the head of the Reactor Group.[18] The British government decided in 1957 that electricity generation by nuclear power would be promoted, and that there would be a building programme to achieve 5,000 to 6,000 MW capacity by 1965, a quarter of UK's generating needs.[19]/nCook was responsible for the four magnox reactors at Calder Hall, the four reactors under construction at Chapel Cross, and the uranium enrichment plant at Capenhurst. From Hinton he had inherited a conflict of responsibilities for reactor development between the Industry Group and Cockcroft's Research Group . Cockcroft wanted it in the Research Group, and proposed building a research centre in Winfrith with low-powered research reactors for testing various combinations of coolants, neutron moderators and nuclear fuels. In the end, Cockcroft prevailed and Winfrith was built. Cook mainly dealt with the development of new reactors. A number of types were developed, including the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale, considered a natural successor to the Magnox reactors; the Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) at Dounreay; the high-temperature Dragon reactor at Winfrith. In addition, under the 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Royal Navy received access to Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) technology used in US nuclear submarines.[18] He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1962.[3]/nIn 1960, Cook returned to the Ministry of Defence as one of two deputies to the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Solly Zuckerman, the other being Alan Cottrell. This was a turbulent time for the Ministry of Defence, with tight budgetary constraints leading to heated debates over procurement of new weapons systems, none more so than the BAC TSR-2, which was eventually cancelled. Cook was involved in negotiations with the French, and later German and Italian governments, to build a replacement, which eventually saw service with the RAF as the Panavia Tornado. He also managed to salvage a troubled project known as PT428, which became the Rapier surface-to-air missile.[20]/nThe controversial 1966 Defence White Paper led to the resignation of Zuckerman and then Cottrell. Cook then served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence from 1966 until 1970, when he retired from the civil service, although he chaired nuclear safety committees until 1981. He was involved in several projects, including the SEPECAT Jaguar, the Mallard communications system, and the FH70 howitzer.[20] In 1967, the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson sent Cook to brief the French military attach\u00e9 in London, Colonel Andr\u00e9  Thoulouze, on the British hydrogen bomb project. The French hydrogen bomb project was stalled, and Wilson hoped that providing some assistance might influence the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, to approve the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities. He gave the French indications of paths that would not work, and suggested that their proposed design was too complex. This proved to be sufficient to set the French scientists on the right track, and France successfully tested a hydrogen bomb on 24 August 1968. Despite this, de Gaulle still vetoed Britain's membership of the EEC a second time.[21][22] For his services, Cook was raised to a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1970 Birthday Honours.[23]/nAfter Rolls-Royce went bankrupt in 1970, the Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Carrington, asked Cook to chair a committee to determine whether the development of the RB211 jet engine should be continued. He recommended that it should be. When Rolls-Royce was nationalised in 1971, he was appointed one of the company's directors. He retired as a director in 1976, but continued to assist the company for four more years. He was a director of GEC Marconi Electronics from 1972 to 1979, and Marconi International Marine from 1971 to 1975. He was also a consultant to British Telecom from 1982 to 1985.[24]/nCook suffered a massive stroke from which he did not regain consciousness, and died in London's Westminster Hospital on 16 September 1987.[1]", "23270237": "Sir Wilfred Halliday Cockcroft (7 June 1923 \u2013 27 September 1999) was an eminent mathematics educator from the University of Hull./nHe attended Keighley Boys' Grammar School, now called Beckfoot Oakbank, and studied Mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford.

He showed great aptitude for the study of mathematics and languages at an early age, and was fortunate in finding a Polish schoolmaster who secretly aided him in acquiring the rudiments of a modern education. Besides his native Yiddish, Filipowski became conversant in Polish, Russian, Latin, Hebrew, Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese, and at age 15 he published An Almanac for One Hundred Years in both Polish and Russian.[1]/nIn 1839 he emigrated to England, and received an appointments as Teacher of Hebrew and Oriental languages at the Jews' College and the West Metropolitan Jewish School.[2]  His first published work was Mo'ed Mo'adim on the Jewish, Karaite, Christian, and Muslim calendars (1846; republished 1863), with tables from the Creation to the year AM 6000. In 1847 he edited a Hebrew annual, Ha-Asif, or Harvest: The Annual Hebrew Magazine, containing various essays on Hebrew literature and mathematics, in both Hebrew and English (1849).[2]/nThe Jewish Chronicle praised Filipowski's calendrical calculations for correcting the defects of Elias H. Lindo's Calendar, especially his erroneous method for calculating the termination of Shabbat in London.  According to Filipowski, for almost a decade London Jews had been ending the Shabbat and festivals at the wrong time. Even more serious was the implication that, since the termination of the day affects the time at which the brit milah takes place, users of Lindo's Calendar might have performed that operation on the seventh or ninth day, instead of the eighth day as required by Jewish law.[3]/nFilipowski afterwards was employed as an actuary for the Colonial and Standard Life offices in Edinburgh, a position he kept for about eight years. He later worked as an actuary of the Mercantile, Professional, and General Life and Guarantee Insurance Company, and as an assistant computer at the Royal and Briton companies.[3]/nIn this capacity he published A Table of Anti-Logarithms (1849), which included a testimonial by mathematician Augustus De Morgan and established Filipowski's name among mathematicians.[4] He later published Napier's Canon of Logarithms (1857), a translation of John Napier's Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio from the Latin into English, and in 1864\u201366 he edited Francis Baily's Doctrine of Life Annuities and Assurance. The monthly periodical The Actuarial Magazine, devoted to tables of different kinds, was also edited by Filipowski for a short time.[1]/nFilipowski returned to London in 1860, where he designed a multiplying machine which made use of Slonimski's theorem.[5] The machine's calculating rods include a set of fifty-six wooden cylindrical rods stored in holes in a wooden mahogany case. One of Filipowski's calculating devices survives at the Science Museum, London.[6]/nIn 1851 Filipowski founded a Jewish antiquarian society, \u1e24evrat Me'orerei Yeshenim (a forerunner of the Mekitze Nirdamim), in connection with which he published many important and valuable works in Hebrew.[7] He edited and published for the society translations of Solomon ibn Gabirol's Miv\u1e25ar ha-Peninim (1851), Abraham bar \u1e24iyya's Sefer ha-'Ibbur (1851), Azariah dei Rossi's Matzref la-Kesef (1854), Menahem ben Saruk's Ma\u1e25beret (1854), Dunash ben Labrat's Teshuvot (1855), and Abraham Zacuto's Sefer Yu\u1e25asin ha-Shalem, with notes by Jacob Emden (1857).[8][9][10]/nIn 1862 he designed a font of Hebrew type with the vowel-points attached to the letters, from which a pocket edition of the Ashkenazi siddur was printed, containing also an English translation by him.[11] In 1867 he founded a short-lived periodical, The Hebrew National, and in 1870 published Biblical Prophecies, on the Jewish position in regard to the Biblical prophecies and the Messiah. A few months before his death in June 1872, Filipowski completed his Hebrew and Roman Almanack from the Year 1 C.E. to Perpetuity.[3]/nIn appreciation of his services to antiquarian research he was elected a fellow of the Antiquarian Society, and for his actuarial work an honorary fellow of the Society of Actuaries.", "1086307": "Thomas Simpson FRS (20 August 1710 \u2013 14 May 1761) was a British mathematician and inventor known for the eponymous Simpson's rule to approximate definite integrals. The attribution, as often in mathematics, can be debated: this rule had been found 100 years earlier by Johannes Kepler, and in German it is called Keplersche Fassregel./nSimpson was born in Sutton Cheney, Leicestershire. The son of a weaver,[1] Simpson taught himself mathematics. At the age of nineteen, he married a fifty-year old widow with two children.[2] As a youth, he became interested in astrology after seeing a solar eclipse. He also dabbled in divination and caused fits in a girl after 'raising a devil' from her.  After this incident, he and his wife had to flee to Derby.[3] He moved with his wife and children to London at age twenty-five, where he supported his family by weaving during the day and teaching mathematics at night.[4]/nFrom 1743, he taught mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Simpson was a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1758, Simpson was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nHe died in Market Bosworth, and was laid to rest in Sutton Cheney. A plaque inside the church commemorates him./nSimpson's treatise entitled The Nature and Laws of Chance and The Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions were based on the work of De Moivre and were attempts at making the same material more brief and understandable. Simpson stated this clearly in The Nature and Laws of Chance, referring to De Moivre's Doctrine of Chances: \"tho' it neither wants Matter nor Elegance to recommend it, yet the Price must, I am sensible, have put it out of the Power of many to purchase it\". In both works, Simpson cited De Moivre's work and did not claim originality beyond the presentation of some more accurate data. While he and De Moivre initially got along, De Moivre eventually felt that his income was threatened by Simpson's work and in his second edition of Annuities upon Lives, wrote in the preface:[5]/n\"After the pains I have taken to perfect this Second Edition, it may happen, that a certain Person, whom I need not name, out of Compassion to the Public, will publish a Second Edition of his Book on the same Subject, which he will afford at a very moderate Price, not regarding whether he mutilates my Propositions, obscures what is clear, makes a Shew of new Rules, and works by mine; in short, confounds, in his usual way, every thing with a croud of useless Symbols; if this be the Case, I must forgive the indigent Author, and his disappointed Bookseller.\"/nThe method commonly called Simpson's Rule was known and used earlier by Bonaventura Cavalieri (a student of Galileo) in 1639, and later by James Gregory;[6] still, the long popularity of Simpson's textbooks invites this association with his name, in that many readers would have learnt it from them./nIn the context of disputes surrounding methods advanced by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pierre de Fermat proposed the challenge to find a point D such that the sum of the distances to three given points, A, B and C is least, a challenge popularised in Italy by Marin Mersenne in the early 1640s. Simpson treats the problem in the first part of Doctrine and Application of Fluxions (1750), on pp.\u00a026\u201328, by the description of circular arcs at which the edges of the triangle ABC subtend an angle of pi/3; in the second part of the book, on pp.\u00a0505\u2013506 he extends this geometrical method, in effect, to weighted sums of the distances. Several of Simpson's books contain selections of optimisation problems treated by simple geometrical considerations in similar manner, as (for Simpson) an illuminating counterpart to possible treatment by fluxional (calculus) methods.[7] But Simpson does not treat the problem in the essay on geometrical problems of maxima and minima appended to his textbook on Geometry of 1747, although it does appear in the considerably reworked edition of 1760. Comparative attention might, however, usefully be drawn to a paper in English from eighty years earlier as suggesting that the underlying ideas were already recognised then:/nOf further related interest are problems posed in the early 1750s by J. Orchard, in The British Palladium, and by T. Moss, in The Ladies' Diary; or Woman's Almanack (at that period not yet edited by Simpson)./nThis type of generalisation was later popularised by Alfred Weber in 1909.  The Simpson-Weber triangle problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimised. In 1971, Luc-Normand Tellier[8] found the first direct (non iterative) numerical solution of the Fermat and Simpson-Weber triangle problems. Long before Von Th\u00fcnen's contributions, which go back to 1818, the Fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of space economy./nIn 1985, Luc-Normand Tellier[9] formulated an all-new problem called the \u201cattraction-repulsion problem\u201d, which constitutes a generalisation of both the Fermat and Simpson-Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted the space economy theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analysed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992),[10] and Jalal and Krarup (2003).[11] The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005)[12] as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.", "67343208": "Sonja Petrovi\u0107 is a Serbian-American statistician and associate professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Computing, at Illinois Institute of Technology.

A critic of the constitution proposed by Marie-Jean H\u00e9rault de S\u00e9chelles in 1793, the Convention Nationale \u2014 and the Jacobin faction in particular \u2014 voted to have Condorcet arrested. He died in prison after a period of hiding from the French Revolutionary authorities./nCondorcet was born in Ribemont (in present-day Aisne), descended from the ancient family of Caritat, who took their title from the town of Condorcet in Dauphin\u00e9, of which they were long-time residents. Fatherless at a young age, he was taken care of by his devoutly religious mother who dressed him as a girl till age eight. He was educated at the Jesuit College in Reims and at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre in Paris, where he quickly showed his intellectual ability and gained his first public distinctions in mathematics.[4] When he was sixteen, his analytical abilities gained the praise of Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Alexis Clairaut; soon, Condorcet would study under d'Alembert./nFrom 1765 to 1774, he focused on science. In 1765, he published his first work on mathematics, entitled Essai sur le calcul int\u00e9gral, which was well received, launching his career as a mathematician. He went on to publish more papers, and on 25 February 1769, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie royale des Sciences.[5]/nIn 1772, he published another paper on integral calculus. Soon after, he met Jacques Turgot, a French economist, and the two became friends. Turgot became an administrator under King Louis XV in 1772 and Controller-General of Finance under Louis XVI in 1774./nCondorcet worked with Leonhard Euler and Benjamin Franklin. He soon became an honorary member of many foreign academies and philosophic societies, including the American Philosophical Society (1775),[6] the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1785), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1792)[7]\nand also in Prussia and Russia./nHis political ideas, many in congruity with Turgot's, were criticized heavily in the English-speaking world, however, most notably by John Adams who wrote two of his principal works of political philosophy to oppose Turgot's and Condorcet's unicameral legislature and radical democracy.[8]/nIn 1774, Condorcet was appointed inspector general of the Paris mint by Turgot.[9] From this point on, Condorcet shifted his focus from the purely mathematical to philosophy and political matters. In the following years, he took up the defense of human rights in general, and of women's and Blacks' rights in particular (an abolitionist, he became active in the Society of the Friends of the Blacks in the 1780s). He supported the ideals embodied by the newly formed United States, and proposed projects of political, administrative and economic reforms intended to transform France./nIn 1776, Turgot was dismissed as Controller General. Consequently, Condorcet submitted his resignation as Inspector General of the Monnaie, but the request was refused, and he continued serving in this post until 1791. Condorcet later wrote Vie de M. Turgot (1786), a biography which spoke fondly of Turgot and advocated Turgot's economic theories. Condorcet continued to receive prestigious appointments: in 1777, he became Permanent Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, holding the post until the abolition of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1793; and, in 1782, secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.[10]/nIn 1785, Condorcet published his Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions,[11] one of his most important works.  This work described several now famous results, including Condorcet's jury theorem, which states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases as the number of members of the group increases, and Condorcet's paradox, which shows that majority preferences can become intransitive with three or more options \u2013 it is possible for a certain electorate to express a preference for A over B, a preference for B over C, and a preference for C over A, all from the same set of ballots.[12]/nThe paper also outlines a generic Condorcet method, designed to simulate pair-wise elections between all candidates in an election. He disagreed strongly with the alternative method of aggregating preferences put forth by Jean-Charles de Borda (based on summed rankings of alternatives). Condorcet was one of the first to systematically apply mathematics in the social sciences.[citation needed]/nIn 1781, Condorcet wrote a pamphlet, Reflections on Negro Slavery, in which he denounced slavery.[13] In 1786, Condorcet worked on ideas for the differential and integral calculus, giving a new treatment of infinitesimals \u2013 a work which apparently was never published. In 1789, he published Vie de Voltaire (1789), which agreed with Voltaire in his opposition to the Church. In the same year he was elected as president of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks and lived in an apartment at H\u00f4tel des Monnaies, Paris, across the Louvre.[14] In 1791, Condorcet, along with Sophie de Grouchy, Thomas Paine, Etienne Dumont, Jacques-Pierre Brissot, and Achilles Duchastellet published a brief journal titled Le R\u00e9publicain, its main goal being the promotion of republicanism and the rejection of constitutional monarchy. The journal's theme was that any sort of monarchy is a threat to freedom no matter who is leading and that liberty is freedom from domination.[15]/nIn 1795, Condorcet's book Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind was published after his death by his wife Sophie de Grouchy. It dealt with theoretical thought on perfecting the human mind and analyzing intellectual history based on social arithmetic.[16] Thomas Malthus wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) partly in response to Condorcet's views on the \"perfectibility of society.\"/nCondorcet took a leading role when the French Revolution swept France in 1789, hoping for a rationalist reconstruction of society, and championed many liberal causes. As a result, in 1791 he was elected as a Paris representative in the Legislative Assembly, and then became the secretary of the Assembly./nCondorcet was not affiliated with any political party but counted many friends among the Girondins. He distanced himself from them during the National Convention, however, due to his distaste for their factionalism./nIn April 1792 Condorcet presented a project for the reformation of the education system, aiming to create a hierarchical system, under the authority of experts, who would work as the guardians of the Enlightenment and who, independent of power, would be the guarantors of public liberties. The project was judged to be contrary to republican and egalitarian virtues, handing the education of the Nation over to an aristocracy of savants, and Condorcet's proposal was not taken up by the Assembly. Several years later, in 1795, when the Thermidorians had gained in strength, the National Convention would adopt an educational plan based on Condorcet's proposal.[17]/nHe advocated women's suffrage for the new government, writing an article for Journal de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1789, and by publishing De l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9 (\"For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women\") in 1790.[18]/nAt the Trial of Louis XVI in December 1792, Condorcet, who opposed the death penalty albeit supporting the trial itself, spoke out against the execution of the King during the public vote at the Convention \u2013 he proposed to send the king to work as a slave rower on galley ships./nCondorcet was on the Constitution Committee and was the main author of the Girondin constitutional project. This constitution was not put to a vote. When the Montagnards gained control of the Convention, they wrote their own, the French Constitution of 1793. Condorcet criticized the new work, and as a result, he was branded a traitor. On 3 October 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest.[19]/nThe warrant forced Condorcet into hiding. He hid for some months in the house of Mme. Vernet in Paris, where he wrote Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progr\u00e8s de l'esprit humain (Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit), which was published posthumously in 1795 and is considered one of the major texts of the Enlightenment and of historical thought. It narrates the history of civilization as one of progress in the sciences, shows the intimate connection between scientific progress and the development of human rights and justice, and outlines the features of a future rational society entirely shaped by scientific knowledge.[22]/nOn 25 March 1794 Condorcet, convinced he was no longer safe, left his hideout and attempted to flee Paris. He went to seek refuge at the house of Jean-Baptiste Suard, a friend of his with whom he had resided in 1772,[23] but he was refused on the basis that he would be betrayed by one of their residents. Two days later, he was arrested in Clamart and imprisoned in Bourg-la-Reine (or, as it was known during the Revolution, Bourg-l'\u00c9galit\u00e9, \"Equality Borough\" rather than \"Queen's Borough\") where, after another two days, he was found dead in his cell. The most widely accepted theory is that his friend Pierre Jean George Cabanis gave him a poison which he eventually used. However, some historians believe that he may have been murdered (perhaps because he was too loved and respected to be executed). Jean-Pierre Brancourt (in his work L'\u00e9lite, la mort et la r\u00e9volution) claims that Condorcet was killed with a mixture of Datura stramonium and opium./nCondorcet was symbolically interred in the Panth\u00e9on in 1989, in honour of the bicentennial of the French Revolution and Condorcet's role as a central figure in the Enlightenment.  His coffin, however, was empty as his remains, originally interred in the common cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine, were lost during the nineteenth century./nIn 1786 Condorcet married Sophie de Grouchy, who was more than twenty years his junior. Sophie, reckoned one of the most beautiful women of the day, became an accomplished salon hostess as Madame de Condorcet, and also an accomplished translator of Thomas Paine and Adam Smith. She was intelligent and well educated, fluent in both English and Italian. The marriage was a strong one, and Sophie visited her husband regularly while he remained in hiding. Although she began proceedings for divorce in January 1794, it was at the insistence of Condorcet and Cabanis, who wished to protect their property from expropriation and to provide financially for Sophie and their young daughter, Louise 'Eliza' Alexandrine./nCondorcet was survived by his widow and four-year-old Eliza. Sophie died in 1822, never having remarried, and having published all her husband's works between 1801 and 1804. Her work was carried on by Eliza, wife of former United Irishman Arthur O'Connor.  The Condorcet-O'Connors published a revised edition between 1847 and 1849./nCondorcet's work was mainly focused on a quest for a more egalitarian society. This path led him to think and write about gender equality in the Revolutionary context. In 1790, he published \"Sur l'admission des femmes au droit de cit\u00e9\" (\"On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship\") in which he strongly advocated for women's suffrage in the new Republic as well as the enlargement of basic political and social rights to include women. One of the most famous Enlightenment thinkers at the time, he was one of the first to make such a radical proposal./n'The rights of men stem exclusively from the fact that they are sentient beings, capable of acquiring moral ideas and of reasoning upon them. Since women have the same qualities, they necessarily also have the same rights. Either no member of the human race has any true rights, or else they all have the same ones; and anyone who votes against the rights of another, whatever his religion, colour or sex, automatically forfeits his own.'[24]:\u200a157/nLike fellow Enlightenment thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book Emile ou De l'Education (1762), Condorcet identified education as crucial to the emancipation of individuals. He stated: \"I believe that all other differences between men and women are simply the result of education\".[25]/nCondorcet's whole plea for gender equality is founded on the belief that the attribution of rights and authority comes from a false assumption that men possess reason and women do not./nScholars[who?] often disagree on the true impact that Condorcet's work had on pre-modern feminist thinking. His detractors[who?] point out that, when he was eventually given some responsibilities in the constitutional drafting process, his convictions did not translate into concrete political action and he made limited efforts to push these issues on the agenda.[26] Some scholars[who?] on the other hand, believe that this lack of action is not due to the weakness of his commitment but rather to the political atmosphere at the time and the absence of political appetite for gender equality on the part of decision-makers.[27] Along with authors such as Mary Wollstonecraft, d'Alembert or Olympe de Gouges, Condorcet made a lasting contribution to the pre-feminist debate.[28][according to whom?]/nCondorcet's Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit (1795) was perhaps the most influential formulation of the idea of progress ever written. It made the Idea of Progress a central concern of Enlightenment thought. He argued that expanding knowledge in the natural and social sciences would lead to an ever more just world of individual freedom, material affluence, and moral compassion. He argued for three general propositions: that the past revealed an order that could be understood in terms of the progressive development of human capabilities, showing that humanity's \"present state, and those through which it has passed, are a necessary constitution of the moral composition of humankind\"; that the progress of the natural sciences must be followed by progress in the moral and political sciences \"no less certain, no less secure from political revolutions\"; that social evils are the result of ignorance and error rather than an inevitable consequence of human nature.[29] He was innovative in suggesting that scientific medicine might in the future significantly extend the human life span, perhaps even indefinitely, such that future humans only die of accident, murder and suicide rather than simply old age or disease.[30] Nick Bostrom has thus described him as an early transhumanist.[31]/nCondorcet's writings were a key contribution to the French Enlightenment, particularly his work on the Idea of Progress. Condorcet believed that through the use of our senses and communication with others, knowledge could be compared and contrasted as a way of analyzing our systems of belief and understanding. None of Condorcet's writings refer to a belief in a religion or a god who intervenes in human affairs. Condorcet instead frequently had written of his faith in humanity itself and its ability to progress with the help of philosophers such as Aristotle. Through this accumulation and sharing of knowledge he believed it was possible for anybody to comprehend all the known facts of the natural world. The enlightenment of the natural world spurred the desire for enlightenment of the social and political world. Condorcet believed that there was no definition of the perfect human existence and thus believed that the progression of the human race would inevitably continue throughout the course of our existence. He envisioned man as continually progressing toward a perfectly utopian society. He believed in the great potential towards growth that man possessed./nHowever, Condorcet stressed that for this to be a possibility man must unify regardless of race, religion, culture or gender.[32]  To this end, he became a member of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks).[33] He wrote a set of rules for the Society of the Friends of the Blacks which detailed the reasoning and goals behind the organization along with describing the injustice of slavery and put in a statement calling for the abolition of the slave trade as the first step to true abolition.[24]/nCondorcet was also a strong proponent of women's civil rights. He claimed that women were equal to men in nearly every aspect and asked why then should they be debarred from their fundamental civil rights; the few differences that existed were due to the fact that women were limited by their lack of rights. Condorcet even mentioned several women who were more capable than average men, such as Queen Elizabeth and Maria-Theresa.[24]/nFor Condorcet's republicanism the nation needed enlightened citizens and education needed democracy to become truly public. Democracy implied free citizens, and ignorance was the source of servitude. Citizens had to be provided with the necessary knowledge to exercise their freedom and understand the rights and laws that guaranteed their enjoyment. Although education could not eliminate disparities in talent, all citizens, including women, had the right to free education. In opposition to those who relied on revolutionary enthusiasm to form the new citizens, Condorcet maintained that revolution was not made to last and that revolutionary institutions were not intended to prolong the revolutionary experience but to establish political rules and legal mechanisms that would insure future changes without revolution. In a democratic city there would be no Bastille to be seized. Public education would form free and responsible citizens, not revolutionaries.[34]/nRothschild (2001) argues that Condorcet has been seen since the 1790s as the embodiment of the cold, rational Enlightenment. However she suggests his writings on economic policy, voting, and public instruction indicate different views both of Condorcet and of the Enlightenment. Condorcet was concerned with individual diversity; he was opposed to proto-utilitarian theories; he considered individual independence, which he described as the characteristic liberty of the moderns, to be of central political importance; and he opposed the imposition of universal and eternal principles. His efforts to reconcile the universality of some values with the diversity of individual opinions are of continuing interest. He emphasizes the institutions of civilized or constitutional conflict, recognizes conflicts or inconsistencies within individuals, and sees moral sentiments as the foundation of universal values. His difficulties call into question some familiar distinctions, for example between French, German, and English-Scottish thought, and between the Enlightenment and the counter-Enlightenment. There was substantial continuity between Condorcet's criticism of the economic ideas of the 1760s and the liberal thought of the early 19th century.[32]/nThe Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in the rue du Havre, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, is named in his honour, as are streets in many French cities.", "2003831": "Ruth Moufang (10 January 1905 \u2013 26 November 1977) was a German mathematician./nShe was born to German chemist Eduard Moufang and Else Fecht Moufang.

Ruth Moufang's mother was Else Fecht, who was the daughter of Alexander Fecht (1848-1913) from Kehl and Ella Scholtz (1847-1921). Ruth was the younger of her parents' two daughters, having an elder sister named Erica.[1]/nShe studied mathematics at the University of Frankfurt. In 1931 she received her Ph.D. on projective geometry under the direction of Max Dehn, and in 1932 spent a fellowship year in Rome. After her year in Rome, she returned to Germany to lecture at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg and the University of Frankfurt.[1]/nDenied permission to teach by the minister of education of Nazi Germany, she worked at Research and Development of Krupp (battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, etc.), where she became the first German woman with a doctorate to be employed as an industrial mathematician. At the end of World War II she was leading the Department of Applied Mathematics at the arms industry of Krupp./nIn 1946 she was finally allowed to accept a teaching position at the University of Frankfurt, and in 1957 she became the first woman professor at the university.[2]/nMoufang's research in projective geometry built upon the work of David Hilbert. She was responsible for ground-breaking work on non-associative algebraic structures, including the Moufang loops named after her.[1]/nIn 1933, Moufang showed Desargues's theorem does not hold in the Cayley plane. The Cayley plane uses octonion coordinates which do not satisfy the associative law. Such connections between geometry and algebra had been previously noted by Karl von Staudt and David Hilbert.[1] Ruth Moufang thus initiated a new branch of geometry called Moufang planes.[2]/nShe published 7 papers on this topic, these are/nMoufang published only one paper on group theory, Einige Untersuchungen \u00fcber geordenete Schiefk\u00f6rper \u24c9, which appeared in print in 1937.[1]", "1643384": "Cedric Austen Bardell Smith (5 February 1917 \u2013 10 January 2002) was a British statistician and geneticist.

He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys until 1929, when the family moved to London. His education continued at Bec School, Tooting, for three years, then at University College School, London. In 1935, although having failed his Higher School Certificate, he was awarded an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in the Mathematical Tripos, with a First in Part II in 1937 and a Distinction in Part III in 1938. Following graduation he began postgraduate research, taking his PhD in 1942./nWhile a student at Cambridge, Smith became close friends with three other students at Trinity College, R. L. Brooks, A. H. Stone and W. T. Tutte. Together they tackled a number of problems in the mathematical field of combinatorics and devised an imaginary mathematician, 'Blanche Descartes', under which name to publish their work. The group studied dissections of rectangles into squares, especially the 'perfect' squared square, a square that is divided into a number of smaller squares, no two of which are the same size. Publications under the name of 'Blanche Descartes' or 'F. de Carteblanche' continued to appear into the 1980s. The group also published more mainstream articles under their own names, the final one being R.L. Brooks, C.A.B. Smith, A.H. Stone and W.T. Tutte, 'Determinants and current flows in electric networks', Discrete Math., Vol. 100 (1992)./nDuring World War II, as a Quaker and conscientious objector, Smith joined the Friends Relief Service; he worked as a hospital porter at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Smith's pacifist views saw him develop an interest in peace studies. Among other responsibilities for the Society of Friends, he was a member of the Quaker Peace Studies Trust which established the chair of Peace Studies at the University of Bradford. Smith was also a founder member (and Chairman) of the Conflict Research Society./nIn 1946 he was appointed Assistant Lecturer at the Galton Laboratory at University College London. He remained at UCL for the rest of his career, becoming successively Lecturer and Reader, before appointment as Weldon Professor of Biometry in 1964. On his arrival at UCL, Smith was influenced by J. B. S. Haldane, who introduced him to problems of linkage in human genetics in which field he was able to bring his skills as a statistician to bear. He invented some of the mathematical methods used to map human genes.[1] In 1955, he invented the \"gene counting\" method of inferring gene frequencies from the frequencies of genotypes in populations.[2] This was an early example of the EM Algorithm, over 20 years before its introduction by Dempster, Laird and Rubin.

Educated initially as an electrical engineer and later specializing in mathematical physics, he helped develop the sampling techniques still used by the United States Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He is also known as the father of the quality movement and was hugely influential in post-WWII Japan, credited with revolutionizing Japan's industry and making it one of the most dominant economies in the world.[1][2] He is best known for his theories of management.[3]/nDeming received a BS degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wyoming at Laramie (1921), an MS degree from the University of Colorado (1925), and a PhD from Yale University (1928). Both graduate degrees were in mathematics and physics. He had an internship at Western Electric's Hawthorne Works in Cicero, Illinois, while studying at Yale. He later worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Census Bureau. While working under Gen. Douglas MacArthur as a census consultant to the Japanese government, he was asked to teach a short seminar on statistical process control (SPC) methods to members of the Radio Corps, at the invitation of Homer Sarasohn. During this visit, he was contacted by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) to talk directly to Japanese business leaders, not about SPC, but about his theories of management, returning to Japan for many years to consult. Later, he became a professor at New York University, while engaged as an independent consultant in Washington, D.C./nDeming was the author of Quality Productivity and Competitive Position, Out of the Crisis (1982\u20131986), and The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education (1993), and books on statistics and sampling. Deming played the flute and drums and composed music throughout his life, including sacred choral compositions and an arrangement of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"[4]/nIn 1993, he founded the W. Edwards Deming Institute in Washington, D.C., where the Deming Collection at the U.S. Library of Congress includes an extensive audiotape and videotape archive. The aim of the institute is to \"Enrich society through the Deming philosophy.\"  [5]/nDeming's teachings and philosophy are clearly illustrated by examining the results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry,[6] as the following example (called the Ford-Mazda study) shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan (by Mazda) and the United States (by Ford). Soon after the car model was on the market (c.\u20091950),[7] Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmissions over the US-made transmissions, and they were willing to wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmissions. Finally, Ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. However, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts\u2014e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch (300\u00a0mm \u00b1 3\u00a0mm)\u2014then the Japanese parts were all within 1\u204416 of an inch (1.6\u00a0mm), less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.[8][9]/nIn his book The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education[10] Deming championed the work of Walter Shewhart, including statistical process control, operational definitions, and what Deming called the \"Shewhart Cycle\",[11] which had evolved into Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA). Deming is well known for his work in Japan after WWII, particularly his work with the leaders of Japanese industry. That work began in July and August 1950, in Tokyo and at the Hakone Convention Center,[12] when Deming delivered speeches on what he called \"Statistical Product Quality Administration\". Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second-largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught:[13]/nDeming is best known in the United States for his 14 Points (Out of the Crisis, by W. Edwards Deming, preface) and his system of thought he called the \"System of Profound Knowledge\". The system includes four components or \"lenses\" through which to view the world simultaneously:/nDeming made a significant contribution to Japan's reputation for innovative, high-quality products, and for its economic power. He is regarded as having had more impact on Japanese manufacturing and business than any other individual not of Japanese heritage. Despite being honored in Japan in 1951 with the establishment of the Deming Prize, he was only just beginning to win widespread recognition in the United States at the time of his death in 1993.[15] President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Technology in 1987. The following year, the National Academy of Sciences gave Deming the Distinguished Career in Science award./nWilliam Edwards Deming was born in Sioux City, Iowa, but he was raised in Polk City, Iowa, on his grandfather Henry Coffin Edwards' chicken farm, then later on a 40-acre (16\u00a0ha) farm purchased by his father in Powell, Wyoming. He was the son of William Albert Deming and Pluma Irene Edwards,[16]\nHis parents were well-educated and emphasized the importance of education to their children. Pluma had studied in San Francisco and was a musician. William Albert had studied mathematics and law./nHe was a direct descendant of John Deming,[17] (1615\u20131705) an early Puritan settler and original patentee of the Connecticut Colony, and Honor Treat, the daughter of Richard Treat (1584\u20131669), an early New England settler, deputy to the Connecticut Legislature and also a patentee of the Royal Charter of Connecticut, 1662./nDeming was a professor of statistics in New York University graduate school of business administration (1946\u20131993) and taught at Columbia University's graduate school of business (1988\u20131993). He also was a consultant for private business./nIn 1927, Deming was introduced to Walter A. Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration in the work of Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the control chart, as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.[18]/nIn 1936, he studied under Sir Ronald Fisher and Jerzy Neyman at University College, London, England./nDeming edited a series of lectures delivered by Shewhart at USDA, Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control, into a book published in 1939. One reason he learned so much from Shewhart, Deming remarked in a videotaped interview, was that, while brilliant, Shewhart had an \"uncanny ability to make things difficult.\" Deming thus spent a great deal of time both copying Shewhart's ideas and devising ways to present them with his own twist.[19]/nDeming developed the sampling techniques that were used for the first time during the 1940 U.S. Census, formulating the Deming-Stephan algorithm for iterative proportional fitting in the process.[20] During World War II, Deming was a member of the five-man Emergency Technical Committee. He worked with H.F. Dodge, A.G. Ashcroft, Leslie E. Simon, R.E. Wareham, and John Gaillard in the compilation of the American War Standards (American Standards Association Z1.1\u20133 published in 1942)[21] and taught SPC techniques to workers engaged in wartime production. Statistical methods were widely applied during World War II, but faded into disuse a few years later in the face of huge overseas demand for American mass-produced products.[citation needed]/nIn 1947, Deming was involved in early planning for the 1951 Japanese census. The Allied powers were occupying Japan, and he was asked by the United States Department of the Army to assist with the census. He was brought over at the behest of General Douglas MacArthur, who grew frustrated at being unable to complete so much as a phone call without the line going dead due to Japan's shattered postwar economy. While in Japan, his expertise in quality-control techniques, combined with his involvement in Japanese society, brought him an invitation from the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE).[16]/nJUSE members had studied Shewhart's techniques, and as part of Japan's reconstruction efforts, they sought an expert to teach statistical control. From June\u2013August 1950, Deming trained hundreds of engineers, managers, and scholars in SPC and concepts of quality. He also conducted at least one session for top management (including top Japanese industrialists of the likes of Akio Morita, the cofounder of Sony Corp.)[22]  Deming's message to Japan's chief executives was that improving quality would reduce expenses, while increasing productivity and market share.[13]  Perhaps the best known of these management lectures was delivered at the Mt. Hakone Conference Center in August 1950./nA number of Japanese manufacturers applied his techniques widely and experienced heretofore unheard-of levels of quality and productivity. The improved quality combined with the lowered cost created new international demand for Japanese products./nDeming declined to receive royalties from the transcripts of his 1950 lectures, so JUSE's board of directors established the Deming Prize (December 1950) to repay him for his friendship and kindness.[22]  Within Japan, the Deming Prize continues to exert considerable influence on the disciplines of quality control and quality management.[23]/nIn 1960, the Prime Minister of Japan (Nobusuke Kishi), acting on behalf of Emperor Hirohito, awarded Deming Japan's Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class. The citation on the medal recognizes Deming's contributions to Japan's industrial rebirth and its worldwide success. The first section of the meritorious service record describes his work in Japan:[22]/nThe second half of the record lists his service to private enterprise through the introduction of epochal ideas, such as quality control and market survey techniques./nAmong his many honors, an exhibit memorializing Deming's contributions and his famous Red Bead Experiment is on display outside the board room of the American Society for Quality.[24]/nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1991./nDavid Salsburg wrote:/nLater, from his home in Washington, D.C., Deming continued running his own consultancy business in the United States, largely unknown and unrecognized in his country of origin and work. In 1980, he was featured prominently in an NBC TV documentary titled If Japan can... Why can't we? about the increasing industrial competition the United States was facing from Japan. As a result of the broadcast, demand for his services increased dramatically, and Deming continued consulting for industry throughout the world until his death at the age of 93./nFord Motor Company was one of the first American corporations to seek help from Deming. In 1981, Ford's sales were falling. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. Ford's newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford.[27] Deming questioned the company's culture and the way its managers operated. To Ford's surprise, Deming talked not about quality, but about management. He told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85% of all problems in developing better cars. In 1986, Ford came out with a profitable line of cars, the Taurus-Sable line. In a letter to Autoweek, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, \"We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming's teachings.\"[28] By 1986, Ford had become the most profitable American auto company. For the first time since the 1920s, its earnings had exceeded those of arch-rival General Motors (GM). Ford had come to lead the American automobile industry in improvements. Ford's following years' earnings confirmed that its success was not a fluke, for its earnings continued to exceed GM and Chrysler's./nIn 1982, Deming's book Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position was published by the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering, and was renamed Out of the Crisis in 1986. In it, he offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but also by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved products and services. \"Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment.\"/nIn 1982, Deming, along with Paul Hertz and Howard Gitlow of the University of Miami Graduate School of Business in Coral Gables, founded the W. Edwards Deming Institute for the Improvement of Productivity and Quality. In 1983, the institute trained consultants of Ernst and Whinney Management Consultants in the Deming teachings. E&W then founded its Deming Quality Consulting Practice which is still active today./nHis methods and workshops regarding Total Quality Management have had broad influence. For example, they were used to define how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Storage Tanks program would work.[29]/nOver the course of his career, Deming received dozens of academic awards, including another, honorary, PhD from Oregon State University. In 1987, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology: \"For his forceful promotion of statistical methodology, for his contributions to sampling theory, and for his advocacy to corporations and nations of a general management philosophy that has resulted in improved product quality.\"  In 1988, he received the Distinguished Career in Science award from the National Academy of Sciences.[16]/nDeming continued to advise businesses large and small. From 1985 through 1989, Deming served as a consultant to Vernay Laboratories, a rubber manufacturing firm in Yellow Springs, Ohio, with fewer than 1,000 employees. He held several week-long seminars for employees and suppliers of the small company where his famous example \"Workers on the Red Beads\" spurred several major changes in Vernay's manufacturing processes./nDeming joined the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University in 1988. In 1990, during his last year, he founded the W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity, and Competitiveness at Columbia Business School to promote operational excellence in business through the development of research, best practices and strategic planning./nIn 1990, Marshall Industries (NYSE:MI, 1984\u20131999) CEO Robert Rodin trained with the then 90-year-old Deming and his colleague Nida Backaitis. Marshall Industries' dramatic transformation and growth from $400 million to $1.8 billion in sales was chronicled in Deming's last book The New Economics, a Harvard Case Study, and Rodin's book, Free, Perfect and Now./nIn 1993, Deming published his final book, The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education, which included the System of Profound Knowledge and the 14 Points for Management. It also contained educational concepts involving group-based teaching without grades, as well as management without individual merit or performance reviews./nThe philosophy of W. Edwards Deming has been summarized as follows:/nDr. W. Edwards Deming taught that by adopting appropriate principles of management, organizations can increase quality and simultaneously reduce costs (by reducing waste, rework, staff attrition and litigation while increasing customer loyalty). The key is to practice continual improvement and think of manufacturing as a system, not as bits and pieces.\"[30]/n\"The prevailing style of management must undergo transformation. A system cannot understand itself. The transformation requires a view from outside. The aim of this chapter is to provide an outside view\u2014a lens\u2014that I call a system of profound knowledge. It provides a map of theory by which to understand the organizations that we work in.\"[31]/n\"The first step is transformation of the individual. This transformation is discontinuous. It comes from understanding of the system of profound knowledge. The individual, transformed, will perceive new meaning to his life, to events, to numbers, to interactions between people.\"/n\"Once the individual understands the system of profound knowledge, he will apply its principles in every kind of relationship with other people. He will have a basis for judgment of his own decisions and for transformation of the organizations that he belongs to.\"/nDeming advocated that all managers need to have what he called a System of Profound Knowledge, consisting of four parts:/nHe explained, \"One need not be eminent in any part nor in all four parts in order to understand it and to apply it. The 14 points for management in industry, education, and government follow naturally as application of this outside knowledge, for transformation from the present style of Western management to one of optimization.\"/n\"The various segments of the system of profound knowledge proposed here cannot be separated. They interact with each other. Thus, knowledge of psychology is incomplete without knowledge of variation./n\"A manager of people needs to understand that all people are different. This is not ranking people. He needs to understand that the performance of anyone is governed largely by the system that he works in, the responsibility of management. A psychologist that possesses even a crude understanding of variation as will be learned in the experiment with the Red Beads (Ch. 7) could no longer participate in refinement of a plan for ranking people.\"[32]/nThe Appreciation of a system involves understanding how interactions (i.e., feedback) between the elements of a system can result in internal restrictions that force the system to behave as a single organism that automatically seeks a steady state. It is this steady state that determines the output of the system rather than the individual elements. Thus it is the structure of the organization rather than the employees, alone, which holds the key to improving the quality of output./nThe Knowledge of variation involves understanding that everything measured consists of both \"normal\" variation due to the flexibility of the system and of \"special causes\" that create defects. Quality involves recognizing the difference to eliminate \"special causes\" while controlling normal variation. Deming taught that making changes in response to \"normal\" variation would only make the system perform worse. Understanding variation includes the mathematical certainty that variation will normally occur within six standard deviations of the mean./nThe System of Profound Knowledge is the basis for application of Deming's famous 14 Points for Management, described below./nDeming offered 14 key principles to managers for transforming business effectiveness. The points were first presented in his book Out of the Crisis (p.\u00a023\u201324).[33] Although Deming does not use the term in his book, it is credited with launching the Total Quality Management movement.[34]/n\"Massive training is required to instill the courage to break with tradition. Every activity and every job is a part of the process.\"[35]/nIt is a common myth to credit Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) to Deming. Deming always referred to the Cycle as the Shewhart Cycle for Continuous Learning and Improvement.[36][37]/nIn the article on \"Clearing up myths about the Deming cycle and seeing how it keeps evolving\", by Ron Moen and Clifford Norman, they refer to the first origins of PDCA in the work of Galileo on Designed Experiments and Francis Bacon's work on Inductive learning. The basic idea of Scientific method being - making a hypothesis, conducting experiment, learning about hypothesis through experiment results. Later the idea seems to have inspired C I Lewis and through him to Shewhart, giving a clear account of evolution period from 17th century.[38]/nDeming credits a 1939 work by Shewhart for the idea and over time eventually developed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which has the idea of deductive and inductive learning built into the learning and improvement cycle. Deming finally published the PDSA cycle in 1993, in The New Economics on p.\u00a0132.[39]/nThe \"Seven Deadly Diseases\" include:/n\"A Lesser Category of Obstacles\" includes:/nDeming's advocacy of the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle, his 14 Points and Seven Deadly Diseases have had tremendous influence outside manufacturing and have been applied in other arenas, such as in the relatively new field of sales process engineering.[41]/nDeming's collaboration with Hans Lineweaver and Dean Burk[42] is possibly the least known of his work as a statistician, but it is relevant to what has become the most highly cited paper[43] ever published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society,[44] which was written after the authors had consulted Deming about the proper way to analyze their data. Although they are credited with the introduction of the double-reciprocal plot, in which the reciprocal rate is plotted against the reciprocal substrate concentration, they estimated the kinetic parameters by weighted linear regression with weights of the fourth power of the rates, as recommended by Deming. Unfortunately this (essential) part of their approach was quickly forgotten.[citation needed]/nDeming married Agnes Bell in 1922. She died in 1930, a little more than a year after they had adopted a daughter, Dorothy (died 1984). Deming made use of various private homes to help raise the infant, and following his marriage in 1932 to Lola Elizabeth Shupe (died 1986), with whom he coauthored several papers, he brought her back home to stay. Lola and he had two more children, Diana (born 1934) and Linda (born 1943). Deming was survived by Diana and Linda, along with seven grandchildren.[45]/nDeming died in his sleep at the age of 93 in his Washington home from cancer on December 20, 1993.[46] When asked, toward the end of his life, how he would wish to be remembered in the U.S., he replied, \"I probably won't even be remembered.\"  After a pause, he added, \"Well, maybe ... as someone who spent his life trying to keep America from committing suicide.\"[47]/nNotes/nBibliography", "68719496": "Heiko Enderling is a German-American mathematical biologist and mathematical oncologist whose research topics include radiotherapy, tumor-immune interactions, cancer stem cells, and dynamic biomarkers.

Despite being primarily a churchman, he maintained an active interest in research-level mathematics, and was listed by Alexander Macfarlane as one of ten leading 19th-century British mathematicians.[1][2][3] In the 1840s, he obtained an existence theorem for Steiner triple systems that founded the field of combinatorial design theory, while the related Kirkman's schoolgirl problem is named after him.[4][5]/nKirkman was born 31 March 1806 in Bolton, in the north west of England, the son of a local cotton dealer. In his schooling at the Bolton Grammar School, he studied classics, but no mathematics was taught in the school. He was recognised as the best scholar at the school, and the local vicar guaranteed him a scholarship at Cambridge, but his father would not allow him to go. Instead, he left school at age 14 to work in his father's office.[1][2][3]/nNine years later, defying his father, he went to Trinity College Dublin, working as a private tutor to support himself during his studies. There, among other subjects, he first began learning mathematics. He earned a B.A. in 1833 and returned to England in 1835.[1][2][3]/nOn his return to England, Kirkman was ordained into the ministry of the Church of England and became the curate in Bury and then in Lymm. In 1839 he was invited to become rector of Croft with Southworth, a newly founded parish in Lancashire, where he would stay for 52 years until his retirement in 1892. Theologically, Kirkman supported the anti-literalist position of John William Colenso, and was also strongly opposed to materialism. He published many tracts and pamphlets on theology, as well as a book Philosophy Without Assumptions (1876).[1][2][3]/nKirkman married Eliza Wright in 1841; they had seven children. To support them, Kirkman supplemented his income with tutoring, until Eliza inherited enough property to secure their living. The rectorship itself did not demand much from Kirkman, so from this point forward he had time to devote to mathematics.[1][2]/nKirkman died 4 February 1895 in Bowdon. His wife died ten days later.[1][3]/nKirkman's first mathematical publication was in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal in 1846, on a problem involving Steiner triple systems that had been published two years earlier in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary by Wesley S. B. Woolhouse.[1][2][3] Despite Kirkman's and Woolhouse's contributions to the problem, Steiner triple systems were named after Jakob Steiner who wrote a later paper in 1853.[1] Kirkman's second research paper, in 1848, concerned pluquaternions./nIn 1848, Kirkman published First Mnemonical Lessons, a book on mathematical mnemonics for schoolchildren. It was not successful, and Augustus De Morgan criticised it as \"the most curious crochet I ever saw\".[1][2][3]/nNext, in 1849, Kirkman studied the Pascal lines determined by the intersection points of opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed within a conic section. Any six points on a conic may be joined into a hexagon in 60 different ways, forming 60 different Pascal lines. Extending previous work of Steiner, Kirkman showed that these lines intersect in triples to form 60 points (now known as the Kirkman points), so that each line contains three of the points and each point lies on three of the lines. That is, these lines and points form a projective configuration of type 603603.[1]/nIn 1850, Kirkman observed that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which he set out as a puzzle in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary:/nFifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily, so that no two shall walk twice abreast./nThis problem became known as Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years.[1][2][3]/nIn 1848 Kirkman wrote \"On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of n Squares\".[6]\nGeneralizing the quaternions and octonions, Kirkman called a pluquaternion Qa a representative of a system with a imaginary units, a > 3.\nKirkman's paper was dedicated to confirming Cayley's assertions concerning two equations among triple-products of units as sufficient to determine the system in case a = 3 but not a = 4.[7] By 1900 these number systems were called hypercomplex numbers, and later treated as part of the theory of associative algebras./nBeginning in 1853, Kirkman began working on combinatorial enumeration problems concerning polyhedra, beginning with a proof of Euler's formula and concentrating on simple polyhedra (the polyhedra in which each vertex has three incident edges). He also studied Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra, and provided an example of a polyhedron with no Hamiltonian cycle, prior to the work of William Rowan Hamilton on the Icosian game. He enumerated cubic Halin graphs, over a century before the work of Halin on these graphs.[8] He showed that every polyhedron can be generated from a pyramid by face-splitting and vertex-splitting operations, and he studied self-dual polyhedra.[1][3]/nKirkman was inspired to work in group theory by a prize offered beginning in 1858 (but in the end never awarded) by the French Academy of Sciences. His contributions in this area include an enumeration of the transitive group actions on sets of up to ten elements. However, as with much of his work on polyhedra, Kirkman's work in this area was weighed down by newly invented terminology and, perhaps because of this, did not significantly influence later researchers.[1][3]/nIn the early 1860s, Kirkman fell out with the mathematical establishment and in particular with Arthur Cayley and James Joseph Sylvester, over the poor reception of his works on polyhedra and groups and over issues of priority. Much of his later mathematical work was published (often in doggerel) in the problem section of the Educational Times and in the obscure Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool.[1] However, in 1884 he began serious work on knot theory, and with Peter Guthrie Tait published an enumeration of the knots with up to ten crossings.[3] He remained active in mathematics even after retirement, until his death in 1895.[3]/nIn 1857, Kirkman was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society for his research on pluquaternions and partitions.[1] He was also an honorary member of the\nLiterary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, and a foreign member of the Dutch Society of Science.[2]/nSince 1994, the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications has handed out an annual Kirkman medal, named after Kirkman, to recognise outstanding combinatorial research by a mathematician within four years of receiving a doctorate.", "26448780": "Osip Ivanovich Somov (Russian: \u0418\u043e\u0301\u0441\u0438\u0444 (\u041e\u0301\u0441\u0438\u043f) \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043e\u0301\u043c\u043e\u0432; 13 June 1815, Moscow Governorate \u2013 8 May 1876, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian mathematician./n/nThis article about a Russian mathematician is a stub.

The report noted that the name \"Bannaker\" may have had the same origin as that of Banaka, a small village in the present-day Klay District of Bomi County in northwestern Liberia that had once participated in the African slave trade.[4][12] A 2021 update to this genealogy stated that Benjamin Banneker's father, Robert, was by May 18, 1731, married to Mary Lett (then called Mary Beneca), the daughter of a white woman by an enslaved man. The update noted that Banaka is the  home of the Vai people, who have lived there since about 1500 when they left the Mali Empire.[13]/nIn 1737, Banneker was named at the age of 6 on the deed of his family's 100-acre (0.40\u00a0km2) farm in the Patapsco Valley in rural Baltimore County.[14][15][16] A letter writer stated in 1791 that Banneker's parents had sent him to an obscure school where he learned reading, writing and arithmetic as far as double position.[clarification needed][17] However, the remainder of Banneker's early life is not well documented./nUnverified accounts that first appeared in books published more than 140 years after Banneker's death relate that, as a young teenager, Banneker met and befriended Peter Heinrich, a Quaker who later established a school near the Banneker family farm.[18][19] (Quakers were leaders in the anti-slavery movement and advocates of racial equality (see Quakers in the abolition movement and Testimony of equality)).[20] These accounts state that Heinrich shared his personal library and provided Banneker with his only classroom instruction.[19][21] Banneker's formal education (if any) presumably ended when he was old enough to help on his family's farm.[22]/nAround 1753, at about the age of 21, Banneker reportedly completed a wooden clock that struck on the hour. He appears to have modelled his clock from a borrowed pocket watch by carving each piece to scale. The clock continued to work until his death.[22][23]/nAfter his father died in 1759, Banneker lived with his mother and sisters.[3][9] In 1768, he signed a Baltimore County petition to move the county seat from Joppa to Baltimore.[24] An entry for his property in a 1773 Baltimore County tax list identified Banneker as the only adult member of his household.[25]/nIn 1772, brothers Andrew Ellicott, John Ellicott and Joseph Ellicott moved from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and bought land along the Patapsco Falls near Banneker's farm on which to construct gristmills, around which the village of Ellicott's Mills (now Ellicott City) subsequently developed.[26][27] The Ellicotts were Quakers who held the same views on racial equality as did many of their faith.[26][28] Banneker studied the mills and became acquainted with their proprietors.[29][9]/nIn 1788, George Ellicott, a son of Andrew Ellicott, loaned Banneker books and equipment to begin a more formal study of astronomy.[30][31][32] During the following year, Banneker sent George his work calculating a solar eclipse.[30][31][29]/nIn 1790, Banneker prepared an ephemeris for 1791, which he hoped would be placed within a published almanac.[33] However, he was unable to find a printer that was willing to publish and distribute the work.[30][34]/nIn early 1791, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson asked surveyor Major Andrew Ellicott (a son of Joseph Ellicott and a cousin of George Ellicott) to survey an area that would contain a new federal district. In February 1791, Ellicott left a surveying team that he had been leading in western New York so that he could begin the district's survey. Ellicott then hired Banneker as a replacement to assist in the initial survey of the federal district's boundaries, advancing him $60 for travel expenses to and at Georgetown.[35][36]/nThe territory that became the original District of Columbia was formed from land along the Potomac River that the states of Maryland and Virginia ceded to the federal government of the United States in accordance with the 1790 federal Residence Act and later legislation.  The territory was a square that measured 10 miles (16\u00a0km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (260\u00a0km2) (see: Founding of Washington, D.C.).[35][36][37] Ellicott's team placed boundary marker stones at or near every mile point along the borders of the new capital territory (see: Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia).[35][36]/nBiographers have stated that Banneker's duties on the survey consisted primarily of making astronomical observations and calculations to establish base points, including one at Jones Point in Alexandria, Virginia, where the survey started and where the south corner stone was to be located.[35][38] They have also stated that Banneker maintained a clock that he used to relate points on the ground to the positions of stars at specific times.[30][14]/nHowever, some have noted that Banneker's actual role in the survey is uncertain, as his involvement in the effort \"rests on extremely meager documentation\".[39][40] An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south corner stone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".[41] The news report did not mention Banneker's name.[42]/nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because the time that he was devoting to the project was conflicting with the time that he had expected to use to calculate an ephemeris for the year of 1792.[43][44] Further, the arrival of spring required him to direct more attention to his farm than was needed during the winter.[44] In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, Benjamin and Joseph Ellicott, who usually assisted Andrew, had completed the New York survey and were able to join the survey of the federal district at around that time.[44]/nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.[30][44] The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.  The team laid the Maryland stones and completed the boundary survey in 1792.[35][36][45]/nAfter returning to Ellicott's Mills, Banneker made astronomical calculations that predicted eclipses and planetary conjunctions for inclusion in an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[3][34][28] To aid Banneker in his efforts to have his almanac published, Andrew Ellicott (who had been authoring almanacs and ephemerides of his own since 1780)[46] forwarded Banneker's ephemeris to James Pemberton, the president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage.[30][34][14]/nPemberton then asked William Waring, a Philadelphia mathematician and ephemeris calculator,[47] and David Rittenhouse, a prominent American astronomer, almanac author,[48] surveyor and scientific instrument maker who was at the time serving as the president of the American Philosophical Society,[49] to confirm the accuracy of Banneker's work.[34][14] Waring endorsed Banneker's work, stating, \"I have examined Benjamin Banneker's Almanac for 1792, and am of the Opinion that it well deserves the Acceptance and Encouragement of the Public.\"[14]/nRittenhouse responded to Pemberton by stating that Banneker's ephemeris \"was a very extraordinary performance, considering the Colour of the Author\" and that he \"had no doubt that the Calculations are sufficiently accurate for the purposes of a common Almanac. .... Every instance of Genius amongst the Negroes is worthy of attention, because their suppressors seem to lay great stress on their supposed inferior mental abilities.\"[14] A biographer wrote that Banneker replied to Rittenhouse's endorsement by stating: \"I am annoyed to find that the subject of my race is so much stressed. The work is either correct or it is not. In this case, I believe it to be perfect.\"[50]/nPemberton then made arrangements for Joseph Crukshank (a Philadelphia Quaker who was a founder of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery and who had since 1770 been publishing almanacs, including at least one that Waring had calculated) to print Banneker's almanac.[30][51] Having thus secured the support of Pemberton, Rittenhouse and Waring, Banneker delivered a manuscript containing his ephemeris to William Goddard, a Baltimore printer who had published The Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris for every year since 1782.[52] Goddard then agreed to print and distribute Banneker's work within an almanac and ephemeris for the year of 1792.[14]/nBanneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia Almanack and Ephemeris, for the Year of our Lord, 1792 was the first in a six-year series of almanacs and ephemerides that printers agreed to publish and sell.[30][34] At least 28 editions of the almanacs, some of which appeared during the same year, were printed in seven cities in five states: Baltimore; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Delaware; Alexandria, Virginia; Petersburg, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; and Trenton, New Jersey.[30][53][54]/nThe title pages of the Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1792, 1793 and 1794 almanacs and ephemerides stated that the publications contained:/nthe Motions of the Sun and Moon, the True Places and Aspects of the Planets, the Rising and Setting of the Sun, Place and Age of the Moon, &c. \u2013 The Lunations, Conjunctions, Eclipses, Judgment of the Weather, Festivals, and other remarkable Days; Days for holding the Supreme and Circuit Courts of the United States, as also the useful Courts in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Also \u2013 several useful Tables, and valuable Receipts. \u2013 Various Selections from the Commonplace\u2013Book of the Kentucky Philosopher, an American Sage; with interesting and entertaining Essays, in Prose and Verse \u2013the whole comprising a greater, more pleasing, and useful Variety than any Work of the Kind and Price in North America.[55][56]/nIn addition to the information that its title page described, the 1792 almanac contained a tide table listing the methods for calculating the time of high water at four locations along the Chesapeake Bay (Cape Charles and Point Lookout, Virginia; Annapolis and Baltimore, Maryland).[58] Later almanacs contained tables for making such calculations for those locations as well as for Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Halifax, Quebec, Hatteras, Nantucket and other places.[59] Monthly tables in each edition listed astronomical data and weather predictions for each of the months' dates.[60]/nA Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1795 almanac contained a lengthy account of a yellow fever epidemic that had struck that city in 1793. Written by a committee whose president was the city's mayor, Matthew Clarkson, the account related the presumed origins and causes of the epidemic, as well as the extent and duration of the event.[61]/nThe title pages of two Baltimore editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac had woodcut portraits of him as he may have appeared.[57][62] However, a biographer later concluded that the portraits were more likely portrayals of an idealized African-American youth.[63]/nA Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1796 almanac contained a table enumerating the population of each U.S. state and the Southwest Territory as recorded in the 1790 United States census. The table listed the number of free persons and slaves in each state and the territory according to race and gender, as well as to whether they were above or below the age of 16 years. The table also listed the number of members of the U.S. House of Representatives that each state had during the almanac's year.[64]/nThe almanacs' editors prefaced the publications with adulatory references to Banneker and his race.[34][65] Editions of Banneker's 1792 and 1793 almanacs contained full or abridged copies of a lengthy commendatory letter that James McHenry,[66] the Secretary of the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention and self-described friend of Banneker, had written to Goddard and his partner, James Angell, in August 1791 to support the almanac's publication.[67]/nAs first published in Banneker's 1792 almanac and later given an increased circulation when re-published in Philadelphia within The American Museum, or Universal Magazine, McHenry's full letter began:/nBenjamin Banneker, a free Negro, has calculated an Almanack, for the ensuing year, 1792, which being desirous to dispose of, to the best advantage, he has requested me to aid his application to you for that purpose. Having fully satisfied myself, in respect to his title to this type of authorship, if you can agree to him for the price of his work, I may venture to assure you it will do you credit, as Editors, while it will afford you the opportunity to encourage talents that have thus far surmounted the most discouraging circumstances and prejudices.\"[68]/nIn their preface to Banneker's 1792 almanac, the editors of the work wrote that they:/nfeel themselves gratified in the Opportunity of presenting to the Public, through the Medium of their Press, what must be considered as an extraordinary Effort of Genius \u2014 a complete and accurate EPHEMERIS for the Year 1792, calculated by a sable Descendant of Africa, .... \u2014 They flatter themselves that a philanthropic Public, in this enlightened Era, will be induced to give their Patronage and Support to this Work, not only on Account of its intrinsic Merit, (it having met the Approbation of several of the most distinguished Astronomers in America, particularly the celebrated Mr. Rittenhouse) but from similar Motives to those which induced the Editors to give this Calculation the Preference, the ardent desire of drawing modest Merit from Obscurity, and controverting the long-established illiberal Prejudice against the Blacks.[69]/nAfter Goddard and Angell had published their 1792 Baltimore edition of the almanac, Angell wrote in the 1793 edition (which he alone edited) that abolitionists William Pitt, Charles James Fox and William Wilberforce had introduced the 1792 edition into the British House of Commons to aid their effort to end the British slave trade in Africa.[70][71] However, the British Parliament's report of the debate that accompanied this effort did not mention either Banneker or his almanac.[72]/nThe title page of a Petersburg edition of Banneker's 1794 \"Virginia Almanack\" stated that the work was \"Calculated by that ingenious self taught astronomer Benjamin Banneker, a black man\",[73] repeating a term that Angell had used in the 1793 Baltimore almanac.[70][71] The introduction to a 1795 Philadelphia edition contained a poem titled: \"Addressed to Benjamin Banneker\".[74][75] The verse began and ended:/nFain would the muse exalt her tuneful lays,And chant in strains sublime Banneker's praise;Fain would the soar on Fame's majestic wing,Thy genius, great Banneker, to sing;Thy talents and thy greatness would I shew,Not in applausive strains to thee undue;..............Long may thou live an evidence to shew,That Afric's sable race have talents too. And may thy genius bright its strength retain;Tho' nature to decline may still remain;And may favour us to thy latest yearsWith thy Ephemeris call'd Banneker's.A work which ages yet unborn shall nameAnd be the monument of lasting fame;A work which after ages shall adore,When Banneker, alas! shall be no more![74]/nThe writer of a tribute in a 1796 Baltimore edition quoted a quatrain[76] and amended another[77] that an Englishman, Thomas Gray, had placed in a popular poem first published in 1751 (see Adaptations and parodies of Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard).[78][79] The revised rhyme stated:/nNor you ye proud, impute to these the blameIf Afric's sons to genius are unknown,For Banneker has prov'd they may acquire a name,As bright, as lasting, as your own.[78][80]/nSupported by Andrew, George and Elias Ellicott and heavily promoted by the Maryland and Pennsylvania abolition societies, the early editions of the almanacs achieved commercial success.[81] Printers then distributed at least nine editions of Banneker's 1795 almanac.[82] A Wilmington, Delaware, printer issued five editions for distribution by different vendors. Printers in Baltimore issued three versions of the almanac, while three Philadelphia printers also sold editions.  A Trenton, New Jersey, printer additionally sold a version of the work.[83][84]/nIn 1796, Banneker gave a manuscript of one of his almanacs to Suzanna Mason, a member of the Ellicott family who was visiting his home.[85] In 1836, Mason's daughter wrote a published memoir of her mother's life, letters and manuscripts.[86]  The memoir contained a copy of a poem that Mason had sent to Banneker shortly after her 1796 visit.[87] A portion of the verse stated:/nBut thou, a man exhalted high,Conspicuous in the world's keen eye,On record now thy name's enrolled,And future ages will be told,There lived a man called Banneker,An African astronomer.[88]/nBanneker kept a series of journals that contained his notebooks for astronomical observations, his diary and accounts of his dreams.[30][89] The journals, only one of which escaped a fire on the day of his funeral, additionally contained a number of mathematical calculations and puzzles.[30][89][90]/nThe surviving journal described in April 1800 Banneker's recollections of the 1749, 1766 and 1783 emergences of Brood X of the seventeen-year periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim and related species) and stated, \"... they may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me.\"[91] Describing an effect that the pathogenic fungus, Massospora cicadina, has on its host,[92] the journal further stated that the insects:/n.... begin to Sing or make a noise from first they come out of the Earth till they die. The hindermost part rots off, and it does not appear to be any pain to them, for they still continue on Singing till they die.[93]/nThe journal also recorded Banneker's observations on the hives and behavior of honey bees.[94]/nBanneker's 1792 almanac contained an extract from an anonymous essay entitled \"On Negro Slavery, and the Slave Trade\" that the Columbian Magazine had published in 1790.[95] After quoting a statement that David Rittenhouse had made (that Negroes \"have been doomed to endless slavery by us \u2014 merely because their bodies have been disposed to reflect or absorb the rays of light in a way different from ours\"), the extract concluded:/nThe time, it is hoped is not very remote, when those ill-fated people, dwelling in this land of freedom, shall commence a participation with the white inhabitants, in the blessings of liberty; and experience the kindly protection of government, for the essential rights of human nature.[96]/nA Philadelphia edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that Joseph Crukshank published contained copies of pleas for peace that the English anti-slavery poet William Cowper and others had authored,[97] as well as anti-slavery speeches and writings from England and America. The latter included extracts from speeches that William Pitt, Matthew Montagu and Charles James Fox had given to the British House of Commons in 1792 during the debate on a motion for the abolition of the British slave trade,[98] an extract from a 1789 poem by an English Quaker, Thomas Wilkinson,[99] and an extract from a query in Thomas Jefferson's 1787 Notes on the State of Virginia.[100][28]/nCrukshank's edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac also contained a copy of \"A Plan of a Peace-Office, for the United States\".[101] Although the almanac did not identify the Plan's author, writers later attributed the work to Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the 1776 Declaration of Independence.[102]/nThe Plan proposed the appointment of a \"Secretary of Peace\", described the Secretary's powers and advocated federal support and promotion of the Christian religion.  The Plan stated:/nI. Let a Secretary of Peace be appointed to preside in this office; ....; let him be a genuine republican and a sincere Christian, ..../nII. Let a power be given to the Secretary to establish and maintain free schools in every city, village and township in the United States; .... Let the youth of our country be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and in the doctrines of a religion of some kind; the Christian religion should be preferred to all others; for it belongs to this religion exclusively to teach us not only to cultivate peace with all men, but to forgive\u2014nay more, to love our very enemies. ..../nIII. Let every family be furnished at public expense, by the Secretary of this office, with an American edition of the Bible. ..../nIV. Let the following sentence be inscribed in letters of gold over the door of every home in the United States:  THE SON OF MAN CAME INTO THE WORLD, NOT TO DESTROY MEN'S LIVES, BUT TO SAVE THEM./nV. To inspire a veneration for human life, and a horror at the shedding of human blood, let all those laws be repealed which authorise juries, judges, sheriffs, or hangmen to assume the resentments of individuals, and to commit murder in cold blood in any case whatever. ..../nVI. To subdue that passion for war, .... militia laws should everywhere be repealed, and military dresses and military titles should be laid aside. ....[103]/nOn August 19, 1791, after departing the federal capital area, Banneker wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1776 had drafted the United States Declaration of Independence and in 1791 was serving as United States Secretary of State.[104][105] Quoting language in the Declaration, the letter expressed a plea for justice for African Americans./nTo support his plea, Banneker included within his letter a handwritten manuscript of an almanac for 1792 containing his ephemeris with his astronomical calculations. He retained handwritten copies of the letter and Jefferson's August 30, 1791, reply in a volume of manuscripts that became part of a journal.[106]/nIn late 1792, James Angell published a Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1793 almanac that contained copies of Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply.[107] Soon afterwards, a Philadelphia printer distributed two sequential editions of a widely circulated pamphlet that also contained the letter and reply.[108]/nThe Universal Asylum, and Columbian Magazine also published Banneker's letter and Jefferson's reply in Philadelphia in late 1792.[109] The Magazine's editors (A Society of Gentlemen) titled the letter as being \"from the famous self-taught astronomer, Benjamin Banneker, a black man\".[109]/nIn his letter, Banneker accused Jefferson of criminally using fraud and violence to oppress his slaves by stating:/n.... Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that altho you were so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which he had conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should at the Same time be found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, with respect to your Selves.[104][110]/nThe letter ended:/nAnd now Sir, I Shall conclude and Subscribe my Self with the most profound respect,Your most Obedient humble ServantBenjamin Banneker[104][111]/nJefferson's reply did not directly respond to Banneker's accusations, but instead expressed his support for the advancement of his \"black brethren\". His reply, which writers have characterized as \"courteous\", \"polite\", \"ambivalent\", \"ambiguous\", \"evasive\", \"tepid\" and \"noncommittal\",[112] stated:/nPhiladelphia Aug. 30. 1791.Sir,I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th. instant and for the Almanac it contained. no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours of men, & that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa & America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body & mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecillity of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic society because I considered it as a document to which your whole colour had a right for their justification against the doubts which have been entertained of them. I am with great esteem, Sir,Your most obedt. humble servt.Th: Jefferson[113]/nMarie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, to whom Jefferson sent Banneker's almanac, was a noted French mathematician and abolitionist who was a member of the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Noirs (Society of the Friends of the Blacks).[30][114] It appears that the Academy of Sciences itself did not receive the almanac.[28]/nWhen writing his letter, Banneker informed Jefferson that his 1791 work with Andrew Ellicott on the District boundary survey had affected his work on his 1792 ephemeris and almanac by stating:/n.... And altho I had almost declined to make my calculation for the ensuing year, in consequence of that time which I had allotted therefor being taking up at the Federal Territory by the request of Mr. Andrew Ellicott,  ....[104][115]/nOn the same day that he replied to Banneker (August 30, 1791), Jefferson sent a letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that contained the following paragraph relating to Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott:/nI am happy to be able to inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I procured him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference in the structure of the parts on which intellect depends.[116][117]/nIn 1809, three years after Banneker's death, Jefferson expressed a different opinion of Banneker in a letter to Joel Barlow that criticized a \"diatribe\" that a French abolitionist, Henri Gr\u00e9goire, had written in 1808:[118]/nthe whole do not amount in point of evidence, to what we know ourselves of Banneker. we know he had spherical trigonometry enough to make almanacs, but not without the suspicion of aid from Ellicot, who was his neighbor & friend, & never missed an opportunity of puffing him. I have a long letter from Banneker which shews him to have had a mind of very common stature indeed.[119][120]/nBanneker never married.[121] For reasons that are unclear, the four editions of his 1797 almanac were the last ones that printers published.[122][123]  After selling much of his homesite to the Ellicotts and others,[15][124] he probably died in his log cabin nine years later on October 19, 1806, aged 74.[125] (Some sources state that Banneker died on Sunday, October 9, 1806, which was actually a Thursday.)[3][126] His chronic alcoholism, which worsened as he aged, may have contributed to his death.[127]/nAn obituary concluded:/nMr. Banneker is a prominent instance to prove that a descendant of Africa is susceptible of as great mental improvement and deep knowledge into the mysteries of nature as that of any other nation.[128]/nA commemorative obelisk that the Maryland Bicentennial Commission and the State Commission on Afro American History and Culture erected in 1977 near his unmarked grave stands in the yard of the Mount Gilboa African Methodist Episcopal Church in Oella, Maryland (see Mount Gilboa Chapel).[129]/nOn the day of his funeral in 1806, a fire burned Banneker's log cabin to the ground, destroying many of his belongings and papers.[3][130][131] In 1813, William Goodard, who had published the Baltimore edition of Banneker's 1792 almanac (Banneker's first published almanac), donated the manuscript for the almanac to the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts.[132]/nThe Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston holds in its collections the August 17, 1791, handwritten letter that Banneker sent to Thomas Jefferson.[133] Jefferson endorsed the letter as received on August 21, 1791.[134]/nThe Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten reply to Banneker.[135] Jefferson produced this document on a letter copying press made by James Watt & Co. that he used before he sent his reply to Banneker.[136] He retained the copy in his files.[137]/nThe Library of Congress also holds a copy of Jefferson's August 30, 1791, handwritten letter to the Marquis de Condorcet that described Banneker's race, abilities, almanac and work with Andrew Ellicott.[116] Jefferson produced this document on his copying press before sending the handwritten letter to the Marquis.[138]/nThe Library of Congress holds a handwritten duplicate of Jefferson's letter to the Marquis de Condorcet. The pagination in the duplicate differs from that in the copy that Jefferson produced on his copying press. The Library attributes the duplicate to Jefferson.[139]/nThe Princeton University Library holds within its Straus Autograph Collection the recipient's copy of the handwritten letter that Jefferson sent to Joel Barlow in 1809. Jefferson's letter cited the letter that Banneker had sent to him in 1791. Barlow endorsed Jefferson's letter after he received it.[140]/nThe Library of Congress holds a copy of Jefferson's 1809 letter to Joel Barlow that Jefferson had retained in his files after sending his handwritten letter to Barlow.[119] Jefferson used a polygraph device that enabled him to make the copy at the same time that he was writing the original. An Englishman, John Isaac Hawkins, and an American, Charles Willson Peale, had earlier developed this device with the help of Jefferson's suggestions.[140][141]/nIn 1987, a member of the Ellicott family, which had retained Banneker's only remaining journal, donated that document and other Banneker manuscripts to the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore.[142] The family also retained several items that Banneker had used after borrowing them from George Ellicott, as well as some that Banneker himself had owned.[130][143]/nIn 1996, a descendant of George Ellicott decided to sell at auction some of those items, including a drop-leaf table, candlesticks, candle molds, maps, letters and diaries.[144] Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items with a series of bids that totaled $85,000. The purchaser stated that he expected to keep some of the items and to donate the rest to the planned African American Civil War Memorial museum in Washington, D.C.[145]/nIn 1997, it was announced that the artifacts would initially be exhibited in the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and then loaned to the Banneker-Douglass Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. After completion of the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, the artifacts would be loaned to that facility for a period of twenty years.[146] The Oella museum displayed the table, candle molds and candlesticks after it opened in 1998.[147]/nA substantial mythology exaggerating Banneker's accomplishments has developed during the two centuries that have elapsed since his death, becoming a part of African-American culture.[2] Several such urban legends describe Banneker's alleged activities in the Washington, D.C., area around the time that he assisted Andrew Ellicott in the federal district boundary survey.[40][148][149] Others involve his clock, his astronomical works, his almanacs and his journals.[148][150]/nA United States postage stamp and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets, and other facilities and institutions throughout the United States have commemorated Banneker's documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived. In 1983, Rita Dove, a future Poet Laureate of the United States, wrote a biographical poem about Banneker while on the faculty of Arizona State University.[151]", "1708981": "Sir Samuel Morland, 1st Baronet (1625 \u2013 30 December 1695), or Moreland, was an English academic, diplomat, spy, inventor and mathematician of the 17th century, a polymath credited with early developments in relation to computing, hydraulics and steam power./nThe son of Thomas Morland, the rector of Sulhamstead Bannister in Berkshire, he was educated at Winchester College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow in 1649.[1] Devoting much time to the study of mathematics, Morland also became an accomplished Latinist and was proficient in Greek, Hebrew and French \u2013 then the language of culture and diplomacy. While he was a tutor at Cambridge, he first encountered Samuel Pepys who became a lifelong acquaintance./nA keen follower of public affairs, he left Cambridge and entered public service. He undertook a trip to Sweden in 1653, and in 1655 was sent by Oliver Cromwell on a mission to Italy to protest at actions taken against the Waldensians by the Duke of Savoy. He remained in Geneva for some time in an ambassadorial role, and also wrote a book: The History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piemont, published in London in 1658./nWhile he was serving as secretary to John Thurloe, a Commonwealth official in charge of espionage, Morland became disillusioned with the Government of the Commonwealth, allegedly after learning of a plot by Sir Richard Willis, Thurloe and Richard Cromwell to assassinate the future King Charles II. As a double agent, Morland began to work towards the Restoration, engaging in espionage and cryptography, activities that later helped him enter the King's service./nOn 18 July 1660 he was created a baronet and given a minor role at court, but his principal source of income came from applying his knowledge of mathematics and hydraulics to construct and maintain various machines. These included:/nFrom 1677 he lived in the Vauxhall area of central London, where he made improvements to New Spring Gardens which later became Vauxhall Gardens.

She began study at Wellesley College in 1894. Going to graduate study at Columbia University, she graduated with a master's degree in 1899. First she taught English at Northfield Seminary. In 1904 she began her long service at Wellesley College, beginning as an assistant in mathematics and becoming a full professor./nTaking a leave of absence, she studied for her Ph.D. with Frank Morley at Johns Hopkins University. Her thesis was titled \"Dupin's cyclide as a self-dual surface\".[1] With her doctoral degree, Young was eventually promoted to professor and became Lewis Attenbury Stimson Professor of Mathematics at Wellesley College.[2]/nIn 1933 Young contributed an article to American Mathematical Monthly on a configuration of triangles associated with a parabola \u03c0.[3] Let \u03c0 be a parabola, p and q fixed tangents to \u03c0 that intersect at T. Then a variable tangent to \u03c0 forms a triangle with p and q. The variability of this tangent describes the \"single infinity of triangles\". The corresponding orthocenters, circumcenters, centroids, and centers of the nine-point circle are approached using projective properties of the triangles./nYoung became emeritus professor in 1941. She died March 4, 1963, at Wellesley./nOne of the features of American Mathematical Monthly is a section devoted to problems articulated by readers, and eventual solutions of said problems. The published solutions are chosen for their elegance, and five involving geometry were by Mabel Young./nGiven a point and a circle, find the locus of second circles where the radical axis of the two circles lies on the given point. Young\u2019s analytical geometry solution established a condition on the radii.[4]/nA given segment subtends an angle from a point on another line. As the point moves along its line, find the envelope of the bisectors of the angles. Young's solution established the class of the envelope curve using projective geometry.[5]/nLet a point and a pair of intersecting planes be fixed. Then as a variable line lies on the point, find the locus of the midpoint of the segment determined by the planes. Young's solution starts with a line p through the point and parallel to the intersection of the planes. She identified the locus as a hyperbolic cylinder through use of a third parallel midway between the others that is the projective harmonic conjugate of a line at infinity.[6]/nIn a triangle ABC the feet of the altitudes and midpoints of the sides are used to define three involutions. The problem was to show that the double points of these involutions are three pairs of opposite vertices of a complete quadrilateral. Young's solution used the radical axis of the circumcircle and nine-point circle of the triangle.[7]/nYoung proposed construction of a strophoid: Form triangle AOB from a fixed point A and a variable B on circle centered at O. Then the locus of the orthocenter of AOB is a strophoid.[8]/nAnother problem required the concurrence of three lines determined by a triangle's altitudes and angle bisectors. Young's solution pointed to the Gergonne point and Nagel point of the triangle to obtain the concurrence.[9]", "41030586": "Lajos J\u00e1nossy (2 March 1912, Budapest \u2013 2 March 1978, Budapest) was a Hungarian physicist, astrophysicist and mathematician and a member of  the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

In 1947 invited by Walter Heitler and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger he joined  the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies as a professor and  group leader of the cosmic rays research laboratory./nIn 1950, invited by the Hungarian Government, J\u00e1nossy returned home to Budapest \u2014 not only for reasons of promised scientific possibilities, but also because his foster father and his mother had also returned there from their emigration in Moscow./nJ\u00e1nossy was charged with the task of managing the Cosmic Radiation Department at the Central Research Institute for Physics  (Hungarian abbreviation: KFKI) founded in 1950. He was very active in scientific organisation, education and public life. He was appointed deputy director of the KFKI from 1950 to 1956, and director from 1956 to 1970. In addition, he was also active as a university professor; the Department of Nuclear Physics at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University was established for him. He was the first head of the Department of Nuclear Physics from 1957 to 1970./nHis political engagement is attested by his membership, from 1962 until his death, in the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee./nAt the beginning of his career in Germany, England, and Ireland, J\u00e1nossy focussed on cosmic rays, both experiment and theory.[1] His name is linked to Geiger's coincidence detector development with special application to  cosmic-ray secondary components created in the upper layers of the atmosphere  (mesons such as kaons, muons, gamma rays). He demonstrated how primary cosmic rays colliding with the Earth's atmosphere produced secondary penetrating showers cascading to the surface of the earth (1940\u20131941)./nFrom an early age to his death, he had a wide-ranging  interest in the mathematical and statistical aspects of physical analysis, and, in particular, the application of probability and calculus to experimental results in nuclear physics and particle physics. He is known for his statistical analysis methods for  cosmic rays. Specifically,   during his stay in Dublin, he completed his classic monograph on cosmic rays (1948)[2] and published important monographs on particle showers (1950), introducing the eponymous joint probability densities\u2014now called J\u00e1nossy densities\u2014in the theory of random point processes.[3]/nUntil the 1950s, the most important field in the research of high-energy particles was the investigation of cosmic radiation. But as the large accelerators started to take over the leading role, J\u00e1nossy turned away from the investigation of cosmic radiation and focussed on theoretical problems of quantum mechanics, the dual character of light, as well as the theory of relativity./nTogether with KFKI colleagues, he carried out a famous low-intensity interference experiment, a quantum-mechanical process in which low-intensity photon beams interfere with themselves\u2014although the experiments originally  sought to refute this possibility. These interference results involving a small number of photons are significant for appreciating the quantum nature of light. The measurements he carried out in connection with the dual character of light (self-interference of few photons) supplied results that were expected on the basis of quantum mechanics; yet, due to the requirements of extremely high accuracy, measurements of this kind had not been carried out before J\u00e1nossy. Spurred by this famous photon experiment, Schr\u00f6dinger was quick to write a letter, in which he emphasized the importance of the result. In both the measurement of cosmic radiation and the low intensity interference experiment, precision of the correct results is of fundamental importance, which justified J\u00e1nossy's interest in the statistical evaluation of measurements./nIn the last one and a half decades of his theoretical activity, he was engaged in the hydrodynamic model of quantum mechanics and the interpretation problems of the theory of relativity. He had an interest in the physics philosophy of interpretation, and practical aspects of physics education and the promotion of physics as well. He was also active in the organization of  public  scientific. From 1953 until his death, he co-edited the Hungarian Physical Journal, and he was a member of the editorial board of Acta Physica Hungarica and Hungarian Science, as well as Foundations of Physics./nMember (1950) and, later, vice-president (1961 to 1973) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1961), the Royal Irish Academy (1949), the Mongolian Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of the German Democratic Republic (1954)./nAwarded the Kossuth Prize (1951);  Academic Gold Medal (1972); Vice chair of the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Physical Society (1950\u20131969); chair of the National Atomic Energy Commission.

In 1685 Taylor fought for James II against the Monmouth Rebellion. Returning to London to study mathematics and chemistry, he published the textbook Thesaurarium mathematicae in 1686, and married. Shortly after, with his wife pregnant, Taylor left for the Caribbean after an argument with his father-in-law, and arranged passage to Jamaica for himself and his goods, which included the indentures of three felons and some cloth. He arrived in Jamaica at Christmas 1686, selling the three felons for a disappointing \u00a345 profit.[2]   Though he stayed for under six months, his Multum in Parvo collected together natural history and social description of the island.[3] After some months and several attacks of the 'dry belly aches' (probably lead poisoning from locally distilled rum), he was warned that he should return to England to save his life. By now very short of money, he arranged passage as a captain's clerk on a Royal Navy ship, recording the story of the voyage.[2]/nTaylor's manuscript also includes an imaginative mythical version of the history of the island, amounting to fables rather than history, reflecting the stories told by the English settlers to justify their easy conquest of the island and to maintain that their loyalty had always been to the Stuart regime. (In fact, Robert Venables had led a difficult and inglorious invasion of the island for Cromwell's regime.) Taylor reports that when the English fleet arrived in 1655, the Spanish colony had a female Governor, the imaginary Marqueness Seignora Margareta Perez de Guzman, 'an Ancient Lady of Spain.' (Taylor says nothing good about women in general, nor about any individual woman.) The Marqueness offered to pay great treasures to the invaders to go away, and on their refusal arranged for the gold and silver to be buried with 'perfixt spells over it, soe that it lies still undiscovered, being inchanted by Magique Art'. He reports several stories of ghostly guards on treasure. In fact Venables had negotiated mundane bargains for cassava flour and cattle with the actual Spanish governor, Juan Ramirez de Arellano.[2]/nTaylor tells us that the English conquest took only three months, after which 'the Island was solely enjoyed by the English, the Spaniards and Negroes being subdued'. Actually the English conquest was deeply insecure during the six years of guerrilla warfare that Venables' successor had to prosecute.[2] Resistance by Jamaican Maroons, rebel slaves, and runaways continued until the end of slavery. (These fables did not mark the limits of reinterpretation; by 1683 the Jamaican Assembly announced that the Cromwellian conquest had occurred 'in the 7th year of His Majestys Reign' (though Charles II had been at the time an impoverished exile) and when 'he came to exercise His Royal Authority' the King 'was pleased to own what his Subjects had done which was the same as if he had Commissioned them'.[2])/nMultum in Parvo was probably intended for profitable publication. Unfortunately, its fervent and ingenious claims of Stuart loyalty would have been unsuitable after the last Stuart monarch of England was deposed in 1688; its forthright attacks on his wife's family and women in general may also have been unwise in the context of Taylor's return to England.

He is sometimes described in the United States as \"the father of life insurance\", or \"the father of insurance regulation\", as he campaigned that life insurance companies must keep reserves and provide surrender values. Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.[1]/nWright was born in South Canaan, Connecticut,[2] to a devout Christian family, who held anti-slavery beliefs and instilled in him a strict moral character. He was the first son of Elizur Wright (1762-1845),[3] whose father was also named Elizur Wright, and his second wife Clarissa Richards (1771\u20131843). Wright was one of 10 children; six were half-siblings by his father's first wife. His father was a 1781 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale College,[4] and was known for his mathematical learning and devotion to the Calvinist faith. In 1810 the family moved to Tallmadge, Ohio, and the younger Elizur worked on the farm and attended an Academy that was conducted by his father. The famous abolitionist John Brown attended the Academy in Tallmadge with Elizur. His home served often as a refuge for fugitive slaves.[5]/nIn 1826, the younger Wright graduated from Yale and began to teach: first for two years in Groton, Massachusetts, where he met and married Susan Clark,[4] then at Hudson, Ohio, as a mathematics and natural philosophy (science) professor at Western Reserve College and Preparatory School (1829-1833),[2] the first college in northern Ohio. It was during this time that Wright encountered the writings of William Lloyd Garrison. Garrison's small book, Thoughts on African Colonization, persuaded Wright that slavery should immediately be abolished, and that the American Colonization Society's effort to transport free blacks to an African colony was both unethical and impractical./nGarrison's pamphlet and his new newspaper, The Liberator, had other influence on Western Reserve College. In 1832, College pastor and professor of sacred literature (Bible) Beriah Green preached four abolitionist sermons clearly inspired by Garrison. The uproar this created, which was followed nationally, led to Green's resignation. Under pressure from conservative trustees, he left to become president of the Oneida Institute, where as a condition of his acceptance of the post, he was free to preach \"immediatism\", immediate abolition. The Oneida Institute focused on preparing future abolitionists, which Green felt was a moral and religious obligation./nThe school's most distinguished professor, President Charles Backus Storrs, professor of theology, \"bemoaned the fact that 'nothing is done in [the] college but discuss abolition and colonization'\".[6]:\u200a26\u200a He contracted tuberculosis, took a leave of absence, and died within six months.[6]:\u200a28/nThis left Wright as one of two remaining professors, and it was an environment scarcely more hospitable for him than it had been for Green. The other professor, Rufus Nutting, professor of ancient languages and head of the library,[6]:\u200a18\u200a was a colonizationist and cared little for abolitionism. Like Green, Wright wanted to accomplish more for the abolitionist cause than he could in Hudson./nAlong with the brothers Lewis and Arthur Tappan, Beriah Green, Theodore Weld, James Birney, and other like-minded individuals, Wright founded the American Anti-Slavery Society at a convention in Philadelphia in December 1833, the year Wright had moved to New York City.[2][5] Wright became the national secretary of the organization for five years. At this time, the American Anti-Slavery Society espoused the immediate abolition of slavery, and called for an end to racial prejudice and equality for all. To effect this change, members practiced a policy of \"moral suasion,\" an appeal to people's ethics in an attempt to get them to embrace abolitionism and renounce slavery as sinful./nWright edited a large number of publications, including Human Rights (1834-1835), The Emancipator and the Quarterly Anti-Slavery Magazine (1835-1838). His continued opposition to slavery incurred the enmity of its advocates, his house was once besieged by a mob,[when?] and an attempt was made to kidnap him and convey him to North Carolina.[why?] In 1838, he moved to Boston, where he became editor of the Massachusetts Abolitionist in April 1839. In 1846 he established the Chronotype newspaper, which he conducted until it was absorbed by the Commonwealth (1850), of which also he was for a time the editor.[2][5]/nHe was also involved in \"The Great Postal Campaign\"\u00a0\u2013 a project whose job was to distribute abolitionist material across the country. The Anti-Slavery Society was successful in recruiting agents throughout the country to spread their message, but when Garrison and others began to broaden the scope of the Society to include women's rights and took on an anti-religion, anti-government tone, Wright and others objected and began to split from the Society in 1840./nWright became involved with the newly created Liberty Party and began to separate from the evangelists and the religious anti-slavery movements, believing that government intervention was the way to abolition. Wright was a member of the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that assisted fugitive slaves.[7] He was arrested and charged for aiding in the 1851 escape of Shadrach Minkins, the first black man to be seized in New England under the Fugitive Slave Act. He was not convicted. Wright was also indicted and tried for libel in consequence of his severe words for the liquor interests while publishing the Chronotype.[5]/nWright eventually became estranged from the abolitionist movement. Moreover, due partially to disappointment in his church's lack of support for the abolitionist cause, and to a slowly growing desire to find secular solutions to social problems, the formerly pious and devout Congregationalist distanced himself from the church. Eventually, Wright became an atheist.[8][9]/nBetween 1853 and 1858, besides editing the Railroad Times, he gave his attention to invention and mechanics, constructing a spike-making machine, a water faucet, and an improvement in pipe coupling. He patented the last two, and manufactured them for a short time.[5]/nAccording to Frank Preston Stearns, Wright became interested in life insurance as a mathematical study and read \"the best works on life insurance ... with the same ardor with which young ladies devour an exciting novel.\"/nIn the spring of 1852 an insurance broker placed an advertising booklet in his hand wherein Elizur Wright looked it over and perceived quickly enough that no company could undertake to do what this one pretended to and remain solvent. At age 40, Wright visited the Royal Exchange in London to investigate the life insurance industry. It was on this trip where he saw an advertisement in the Daily Telegraph for the Sale of 42 Old Life Insurance Policies in which old men were auctioning off their life insurance policies to investors after faithfully paying premiums all their lives. Elizur recognized that these life insurance policy owners were too old to work and could no longer afford their premium payments but were not yet dead to collect the benefit. As a result, the policy owners looked to speculators or investors. Wright recognized and wrote about the fact that life insurance policy owners were not able to obtain as much as half of the value that should be in these policies in his book Politics and Mysteries of Life Insurance.[11]/nTo Wright, this was unconscionable, and upon his return to America, he began campaigning for a cleanup of the life insurance business, by requiring insurers to pay \u201csurrender values\u201d to policyholders on request and to hold adequate reserves to do so. Wright realized how easy it was to for insurance carriers to cheat, so he devised formulas for calculating the reserves and created statutory capital requirements for the industry. Ultimately, the life insurance industry accepted Wright's reforms.[12]   Wright served as an insurance commissioner for the State of Massachusetts from 1858 to 1866.[13][14]/nHe devised a new formula for finding the values of policies of various terms, known as the \u201caccumulation formula,\u201d and, in order to facilitate his work, invented and afterward patented (1869) the \u201carithmeter,\u201d a mechanical contrivance for multiplication and division, based on the logarithmic principle, a form of cylindrical slide rule.[5]/nWright, a member of the Forestry Association, was instrumental in obtaining the Massachusetts Forestry Act of 1882.[5] He initiated and promoted plans for making Middlesex Fells, an area north of Boston bordering Malden and Melrose, into a public park; although he did not succeed during his lifetime, the plan was carried out later and Middlesex Fells is Middlesex Fells Reservation to this day./nWright served as an officer of the National Liberal League.[15]/nAlong with his rationalist approach to insurance and religion, Wright was an ardent advocate of a phonetic writing system he called \"phonotypy.\" A column written in this system appeared in almost every issue of his newspaper, the Chronotype (1846-1850).[16]/nIn addition, he wrote many pamphlets and reports./nAttributio", "168977": "Tricia Marie McMillan, also known as Trillian Astra, is a fictional character from Douglas Adams' series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  She is most commonly referred to simply as \"Trillian\", a modification of her birth name, which she adopted because it sounded more \"space-like\". According to the movie version, her middle name is Marie.  Physically, she is described as \"a slim, darkish humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes,\" looking \"vaguely Arabic.\"[1]/nTricia McMillan is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The trilogy later reveals that Trillian eventually left the party with Zaphod Beeblebrox, who, according to the Quintessential Phase, is directly responsible for her nickname./nIn the radio series, she is carried off and forcibly married to the President of the Algolian Chapter of the Galactic Rotary Club and consequently does not appear in the second radio series at all.  The later radio series (the Tertiary Phase and beyond) reveal this (probably) occurred only in the artificial universe within the Guide offices.  In the books, which the third, fourth and fifth series follow, she saves the universe from the Krikketeers and later becomes a Sub-Etha Radio reporter under the name Trillian Astra./nSome drafts of the movie's screenplay, and Robbie Stamp's \"making of\" book covering the movie, state that Trillian was to be revealed as half-human, an acknowledged divergence from Douglas Adams' original storyline. This would have been done in order to underline the loneliness of Arthur Dent, the only 100% Homo sapiens remaining in the universe, after Earth's demolition. This idea was scrapped after the \"making of\" book was written, and the scene revealing Trillian's heritage (by the mice, to Arthur, on the Earth Mark II) was re-written. An interview with actress Zooey Deschanel, included on the DVD version, has her mention that Trillian is half-human, suggesting the interview was recorded prior to the change of plan./nIn the novels and radio series, Trillian does not have a romantic relationship with Arthur (although when Arthur starts seeing Fenchurch, Ford Prefect asks him what happened to Trillian). In the fifth book, Trillian is revealed as the mother of Random Dent. It is unclear for how long (if ever) Trillian had a relationship with Zaphod. They seem to travel away from each other after the third book, although in the fourth one Arthur states Trillian is with Zaphod, and in the fifth Trillian implies that she hadn't had a child with Zaphod simply because they're different species.  In the sixth novel, And Another Thing..., she pursues a relationship with Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged; she accuses Arthur of carrying a torch for her as well./nThe 2005 film puts a different spin on the character. The main emotional arc of the movie is a love triangle between Trillian, Zaphod, and Arthur. Trillian is initially attracted to Arthur when she meets him on Earth, but she's disappointed by his apparent lack of spontaneity. During their travels, Trillian discovers that Zaphod may be the more superficially exciting choice, but Arthur is the man who truly cares about her, Arthur commenting when he is about to have his head cut open by the mice that his feelings for Trillian are the only thing that he ever had questions about where the answer made him happy. The film concludes with Arthur and Trillian sharing a brief kiss as they prepare to return to the Heart of Gold with Ford and Zaphod as Slartibartfast plans to restart Earth, Arthur concluding that he is ready to move on from the planet now that there is a world to come back to./nTrillian was played on radio by Susan Sheridan, on television by Sandra Dickinson (who also reprised an alternate-universe version of the role in the fifth and sixth radio series, playing both original and alternate-universe versions in the latter), on the Original Records LP version by Cindy Oswin, and in the 2005 film by Zooey Deschanel.

Drinfeld introduced the notion of a quantum group (independently discovered by Michio Jimbo at the same time) and made important contributions to mathematical physics, including the ADHM construction of instantons, algebraic formalism of the quantum inverse scattering method, and the Drinfeld\u2013Sokolov reduction in the theory of solitons./nHe was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990.[1]\nIn 2016, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[2] In 2018 he received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics.[3] In 2023 he was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences.[4]/nDrinfeld was born into a Jewish[5] mathematical family, in Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union in 1954. In 1969, at the age of 15, Drinfeld represented the Soviet Union at the International Mathematics Olympiad in Bucharest, Romania, and won a gold medal with the full score of 40 points. He was, at the time, the youngest participant to achieve a perfect score, a record that has since been surpassed by only four others including Sergei Konyagin and Noam Elkies. Drinfeld entered Moscow State University in the same year and graduated from it in 1974. Drinfeld was awarded the Candidate of Sciences degree in 1978 and the Doctor of Sciences degree from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in 1988. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990. From 1981 till 1999 he worked at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering (Department of Mathematical Physics). Drinfeld moved to the United States in 1999 and has been working at the University of Chicago since January 1999./nIn 1974, at the age of twenty, Drinfeld announced a proof of the Langlands conjectures for GL2 over a global field of positive characteristic. In the course of proving the conjectures, Drinfeld introduced a new class of objects that he called \"elliptic modules\" (now known as Drinfeld modules). Later, in 1983, Drinfeld published a short article that expanded the scope of the Langlands conjectures. The Langlands conjectures, when published in 1967, could be seen as a sort of non-abelian class field theory. It postulated the existence of a natural one-to-one correspondence between Galois representations and some automorphic forms. The \"naturalness\" is guaranteed by the essential coincidence of L-functions. However, this condition is purely arithmetic and cannot be considered for a general one-dimensional function field  in a straightforward way. Drinfeld pointed out that instead of automorphic forms one can consider automorphic perverse sheaves or automorphic D-modules. \"Automorphicity\" of these modules and the Langlands correspondence could be then understood in terms of the action of Hecke operators./nDrinfeld has also worked in mathematical physics. In collaboration with his advisor Yuri Manin, he constructed the moduli space of Yang\u2013Mills instantons, a result that was proved independently by Michael Atiyah and Nigel Hitchin. Drinfeld coined the term \"quantum group\" in reference to Hopf algebras that are deformations of simple Lie algebras, and connected them to the study of the Yang\u2013Baxter equation, which is a necessary condition for the solvability of statistical mechanical models. He also generalized Hopf algebras to quasi-Hopf algebras and introduced the study of Drinfeld twists, which can be used to factorize the R-matrix corresponding to the solution of the Yang\u2013Baxter equation associated with a quasitriangular Hopf algebra./nDrinfeld has also collaborated with Alexander Beilinson to rebuild the theory of vertex algebras in a coordinate-free form, which have become increasingly important to two-dimensional conformal field theory, string theory, and the  geometric Langlands program.

Newton took up the position of tutor in January, 1853, a few months before Stanley's death, and served as the principal instructor of mathematics until 1855 when he was appointed professor of mathematics.[2]  He deferred taking up the appointment for one year, traveling to Europe to attend lectures by distinguished mathematicians. The Mathematics Genealogy Project lists his advisor as Michel Chasles, whose lectures on projective geometry he attended at the Sorbonne. Chasles' techniques had a significant impact on his subsequent research in mathematics, in particular on finding the equation of a circle tangent to three other circles.[3][4]/nHowever, Newton is best known for the study of the laws of meteors and of comets and their interrelation.  He attempted to contribute to the theory advanced by Denison Olmsted of Yale in 1833 that meteors were a part of a mass of bodies moving round the sun in a fixed orbit. He began in 1860, with a description of a meteor observed on November 15, 1859.[5] Using accounts of the path and timing of the meteor he used triangulation techniques to estimate its height and velocity.  Starting in 1861, he supervised the work of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences to perform coordinated observations of meteors, providing standardized observational charts for tracking their paths.[6] Results of this investigation, published in 1865, showed that the meteor showers in different months were occurring at different altitudes. He also examined the timing of meteor showers, showing that the drift in time over centuries could be explained by the precession of equinoxes (also known as axial precession,[7] which he then used to put strong constraints on the orbits of the Leonid meteors.[8]/nNewton played an important role in American mathematics, as Yale became the first institution in the United States to grant doctoral degrees in mathematics in 1862.[9] One of the most prominent graduates in mathematics during his tenure was E.H. Moore. He won the Smith gold medal from the National Academy of Sciences of which he was a founding member.[10] In 1867, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1867.[11] He was also elected an associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of London, served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1885), and was foreign member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh./nMany of his papers on meteors were published in the Memoirs of the National Academy, the Journal of Science, and the American Journal of Science./nIn 1859 he married Miss Anna C.

Returning to theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a treatise, Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana, mundo (T\u00fcbingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work contains nothing original but giving a clear representation of Wolff's philosophy. It met with great success, and the author was appointed to the office of preacher at the castle of T\u00fcbingen and of reader in the school of theology.[1]/nIn 1721, after two years study under Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at Halle, and in 1724 professor of mathematics. His friends at T\u00fcbingen disapproved of his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff's recommendation, he was invited by Peter I of Russia to lecture in Saint Petersburg, where he was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of gravity by the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences of Paris secured his return to his native land in 1731.[1]/nIn 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of military engineering, Karl Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (reigned 1733\u20131737) made him a privy councillor, but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state. He died at Stuttgart.[1]/nAfter his return from Imperial Russia, he won the highest respect at home and abroad, and Frederick II of Prussia is recorded to have said of him, \"He was a great man whom I shall ever remember with admiration.\"[1]/nBeside the Dilucidationes, he wrote De harmonia animi et corporis humani commentatio (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1735; T\u00fcbingen, 1741); De origine et permissione mali (1724), an account of the Leibnitzian theodicy.[1]/nAttribution:", "46601340": "Dr. Shisanji Hokari (\u7a42\u5208 \u56db\u4e09\u4e8c, Hokari Shisanji, 28 March 1908 \u2013 2 January 2004) was a Japanese mathematician.

He is known for contributions to geometric analysis and partial differential equations. Hamilton is best known for foundational contributions to the theory of the Ricci flow and the development of a corresponding program of techniques and ideas for resolving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and geometrization conjecture in the field of geometric topology. Grigori Perelman built upon Hamilton's results to prove the conjectures, and was awarded a Millennium Prize for his work. However, Perelman declined the award, regarding Hamilton's contribution as being equal to his own./nHamilton received his B.A. in 1963 from Yale University and Ph.D. in 1966 from Princeton University. Robert Gunning supervised his thesis. He has taught at University of California, Irvine, University of California, San Diego, Cornell University, and Columbia University./nHamilton's mathematical contributions are primarily in the field of differential geometry and more specifically geometric analysis.  He is best known for having discovered the Ricci flow and starting a research program that ultimately led to the proof, by Grigori Perelman, of William Thurston's geometrization conjecture and the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture./nFor his work on the Ricci flow, Hamilton was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry in 1996 and the Clay Research Award in 2003. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1999 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. He also received the AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in 2009, for his 1982 article Three-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, in which he introduced and analyzed the Ricci flow.[H82b]/nIn March 2010, the Clay Mathematics Institute, having listed the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture among their Millennium Prize Problems, awarded Perelman with one million USD for his 2003 proof of the conjecture.[1] In July 2010, Perelman turned down the award and prize money, saying that he believed his contribution in proving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture was no greater than that of Hamilton, who had developed the program for the solution.[2]/nIn June 2011, it was announced that the million-dollar Shaw Prize would be split equally between Hamilton and Demetrios Christodoulou \"for their highly innovative works on nonlinear partial differential equations in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry and their applications to general relativity and topology.\"[3][4]/nIn 2022, Hamilton joined University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa as an adjunct professor.[5]/nAs of 2022, Hamilton has been the author of forty-six research articles, around forty of which are in the field of geometric flows./nIn 1986, Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau discovered a new method for applying the maximum principle to control the solutions of the heat equation.[6] Among other results, they showed that if one has a positive solution u of the heat equation on a closed Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature, then one has/nfor any tangent vector v. Such inequalities, known as \"differential Harnack inequalities\" or \"Li\u2013Yau inequalities,\" are useful since they can be integrated along paths to compare the values of u at any two spacetime points. They also directly give pointwise information about u, by taking v to be zero./nIn 1993, Hamilton showed that the computations of Li and Yau could be extended to show that their differential Harnack inequality was a consequence of a stronger matrix inequality.[H93a] His result required the closed Riemannian manifold to have nonnegative sectional curvature and parallel Ricci tensor (such as the flat torus or the Fubini\u2013Study metric on complex projective space), in the absence of which he obtained with a slightly weaker result. Such matrix inequalities are sometimes known as Li\u2013Yau\u2013Hamilton inequalities./nHamilton also discovered that the Li\u2013Yau methodology could be adapted to the Ricci flow. In the case of two-dimensional manifolds, he found that the computation of Li and Yau can be directly adapted to the scalar curvature along the Ricci flow.[H88] In general dimensions, he showed that the Riemann curvature tensor satisfies a complicated inequality, formally analogous to his matrix extension of the Li\u2013Yau inequality, in the case that the curvature operator is nonnegative.[H93b] As an immediate algebraic consequence, the scalar curvature satisfies an inequality which is almost identical to that of Li and Yau. This fact is used extensively in Hamilton and Perelman's further study of Ricci flow./nHamilton later adapted his Li\u2013Yau estimate for the Ricci flow to the setting of the mean curvature flow, which is slightly simpler since the geometry is governed by the second fundamental form, which has a simpler structure than the Riemann curvature tensor.[H95c] Hamilton's theorem, which requires strict convexity, is naturally applicable to certain singularities of mean curvature flow due to the convexity estimates of Gerhard Huisken and Carlo Sinestrari.[7][8]/nIn 1956, John Nash resolved the problem of smoothly isometrically embedding Riemannian manifolds in Euclidean space.[9] The core of his proof was a novel \"small perturbation\" result, showing that if a Riemannian metric could be isometrically embedded in a certain way, then any nearby Riemannian metric could be isometrically embedded as well. Such a result is highly reminiscent of an implicit function theorem, and many authors have attempted to put the logic of the proof into the setting of a general theorem. Such theorems are now known as Nash\u2013Moser theorems./nIn 1982, Hamilton published his formulation of Nash's reasoning, casting the theorem into the setting of tame Fr\u00e9chet spaces; Nash's fundamental use of restricting the Fourier transform to regularize functions was abstracted by Hamilton to the setting of exponentially decreasing sequences in Banach spaces.[H82a] His formulation has been widely quoted and used in the subsequent time. He used it himself to prove a general existence and uniqueness theorem for geometric evolution equations; the standard implicit function theorem does not often apply in such settings due to the degeneracies introduced by invariance under the action of the diffeomorphism group.[H82b] In particular, the well-posedness of the Ricci flow follows from Hamilton's general result. Although Dennis DeTurck gave a simpler proof in the particular case of the Ricci flow, Hamilton's result has been used for some other geometric flows for which DeTurck's method is inaccessible./nIn 1964, James Eells and Joseph Sampson initiated the study of harmonic map heat flow, using a convergence theorem for the flow to show that any smooth map from a closed manifold to a closed manifold of nonpositive curvature can be deformed to a harmonic map. In 1975, Hamilton considered the corresponding boundary value problem for this flow, proving an analogous result to Eells and Sampson's for the Dirichlet condition and Neumann condition.[H75] The analytic nature of the problem is more delicate in this setting, since Eells and Sampson's key application of the maximum principle to the parabolic Bochner formula cannot be trivially carried out, due to the fact that size of the gradient at the boundary is not automatically controlled by the boundary conditions./nBy taking limits of Hamilton's solutions of the boundary value problem for increasingly large boundaries, Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau observed that a finite-energy map from a complete Riemannian manifold to a closed Riemannian manifold of nonpositive curvature could be deformed into a harmonic map of finite energy.[10] By proving extension of Eells and Sampson's vanishing theorem in various geometric settings, they were able to draw striking geometric conclusions, such as that if (M, g) is a complete Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature, then for any precompact open set D with smooth and simply-connected boundary, there cannot exist a nontrivial homomorphism from the fundamental group of D into any group which is the fundamental group of a closed Riemannian manifold of nonpositive curvature./nIn 1986, Hamilton and Michael Gage applied Hamilton's Nash\u2013Moser theorem and well-posedness result for parabolic equations to prove the well-posedness for mean curvature flow; they considered the general case of a one-parameter family of immersions of a closed manifold into a smooth Riemannian manifold.[GH86] Then, they specialized to the case of immersions of the circle S1 into the two-dimensional Euclidean space \u211d2, which is the simplest context for curve shortening flow. Using the maximum principle as applied to the distance between two points on a curve, they proved that if the initial immersion is an embedding, then all future immersions in the mean curvature flow are embeddings as well. Furthermore, convexity of the curves is preserved into the future./nGage and Hamilton's main result is that, given any smooth embedding S1 \u2192 \u211d2 which is convex, the corresponding mean curvature flow exists for a finite amount of time, and as the time approaches its maximal value, the curves asymptotically become increasingly small and circular.[GH86] They made use of previous results of Gage, as well as a few special results for curves, such as Bonnesen's inequality./nIn 1987, Matthew Grayson proved a complementary result, showing that for any smooth embedding S1 \u2192 \u211d2, the corresponding mean curvature flow eventually becomes convex.[11] In combination with Gage and Hamilton's result, one has essentially a complete description of the asymptotic behavior of the mean curvature flow of embedded circles in \u211d2. This result is sometimes known as the Gage\u2013Hamilton\u2013Grayson theorem. It is somewhat surprising that there is such a systematic and geometrically defined means of deforming an arbitrary loop in \u211d2 into a round circle./nThe modern understanding of the results of Gage\u2013Hamilton and of Grayson usually treat both settings at once, without the need for showing that arbitrary curves become convex and separately studying the behavior of convex curves. Their results can also be extended to settings other than the mean curvature flow.[12]/nHamilton extended the maximum principle for parabolic partial differential equations to the setting of symmetric 2-tensors which satisfy a parabolic partial differential equation.[H82b] He also put this into the general setting of a parameter-dependent section of a vector bundle over a closed manifold which satisfies a heat equation, giving both strong and weak formulations.[H86]/nPartly due to these foundational technical developments, Hamilton was able to give an essentially complete understanding of how Ricci flow behaves on three-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds of positive Ricci curvature[H82b] and nonnegative Ricci curvature[H86], four-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds of positive or nonnegative curvature operator[H86], and two-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive Euler characteristic or of positive curvature[H88]. In each case, after appropriate normalizations, the Ricci flow deforms the given Riemannian metric to one of constant curvature. This has strikingly simple immediate corollaries, such as the fact that any closed smooth 3-manifold which admits a Riemannian metric of positive curvature also admits a Riemannian metric of constant positive sectional curvature. Such results are notable in highly restricting the topology of such manifolds; the space forms of positive curvature are largely understood. There are other corollaries, such as the fact that the topological space of Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature on a closed smooth 3-manifold is path-connected. These \"convergence theorems\" of Hamilton have been extended by later authors, in the 2000s, to give a proof of the differentiable sphere theorem, which had been a major conjecture in Riemannian geometry since the 1960s./nIn 1995, Hamilton extended Jeff Cheeger's compactness theory for Riemannian manifolds to give a compactness theorem for sequences of Ricci flows.[H95a] Given a Ricci flow on a closed manifold with a finite-time singularity, Hamilton developed methods of rescaling around the singularity to produce a sequence of Ricci flows; the compactness theory ensures the existence of a limiting Ricci flow, which models the small-scale geometry of a Ricci flow around a singular point.[H95b] Hamilton used his maximum principles to prove that, for any Ricci flow on a closed three-dimensional manifold, the smallest value of the sectional curvature is small compared to its largest value. This is known as the Hamilton\u2013Ivey estimate; it is extremely significant as a curvature inequality which holds with no conditional assumptions beyond three-dimensionality. An important consequence is that, in three dimensions, a limiting Ricci flow as produced by the compactness theory automatically has nonnegative curvature.[H95b] As such, Hamilton's Harnack inequality is applicable to the limiting Ricci flow. These methods were extended by Grigori Perelman, who due to his \"noncollapsing theorem\" was able to apply Hamilton's compactness theory in a number of extended contexts./nIn 1997, Hamilton was able to combine the methods he had developed to define \"Ricci flow with surgery\" for four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds of positive isotropic curvature.[H97] For Ricci flows with initial data in this class, he was able to classify the possibilities for the small-scale geometry around points with large curvature, and hence to systematically modify the geometry so as to continue the Ricci flow. As a consequence, he obtained a result which classifies the smooth four-dimensional manifolds which support Riemannian metrics of positive isotropic curvature. Shing-Tung Yau has described this article as the \"most important event\" in geometric analysis in the period after 1993, marking it as the point at which it became clear that it could be possible to prove Thurston's geometrization conjecture by Ricci flow methods. The essential outstanding issue was to carry out an analogous classification, for the small-scale geometry around high-curvature points on Ricci flows on three-dimensional manifolds, without any curvature restriction; the Hamilton\u2013Ivey curvature estimate is the analogue to the condition of positive isotropic curvature. This was resolved by Grigori Perelman in his renowned \"canonical neighborhoods theorem.\" Building off of this result, Perelman modified the form of Hamilton's surgery procedure to define a \"Ricci flow with surgery\" given an arbitrary smooth Riemannian metric on a closed three-dimensional manifold. This led to the resolution of the geometrization conjecture in 2003./nIn one of his earliest works, Hamilton proved the Earle\u2013Hamilton fixed point theorem in collaboration with Clifford Earle.[EH70] In unpublished lecture notes from the 1980s, Hamilton introduced the Yamabe flow and proved its long-time existence. In collaboration with Shiing-Shen Chern, Hamilton studied certain variational problems for Riemannian metrics in contact geometry.[13] He also made contributions to the prescribed Ricci curvature problem.[14]/nThe collection/ncontains twelve of Hamilton's articles on Ricci flow, in addition to ten related articles by other authors./nMedia related to Richard Hamilton (mathematician) at Wikimedia Commons", "14390402": "Judith Victor Grabiner (born October 12, 1938) is an American mathematician and historian of mathematics, who is Flora Sanborn Pitzer Professor Emerita of Mathematics at Pitzer College, one of the Claremont Colleges.[1] Her main interest is in mathematics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.[2]/nGrabiner completed a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Chicago in 1960.

Couturat was a pioneer of the constructed language Ido./nBorn in Ris-Orangis, Essonne, France. In 1887 he entered \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure to study philosophy and mathematics. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the University of Toulouse and 1897 lectured in philosophy of mathematics at the University of Caen Normandy, taking a stand in favor of transfinite numbers. After a time in Hanover studying the writings of Leibniz, he became an assistant to Henri-Louis Bergson at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1905./nHe was the French advocate of the symbolic logic that emerged in the years before World War I, thanks to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, Giuseppe Peano and his school, and especially to The Principles of Mathematics by Couturat's friend and correspondent Bertrand Russell. Like Russell, Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics. In this, he was opposed by Henri Poincar\u00e9, who took considerable exception to Couturat's efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the logicism of Russell, while Poincar\u00e9 anticipated Brouwer's intuitionism./nHis first major publication was De Platonicis mythis (1896). In 1901, he published La Logique de Leibniz, a detailed study of Leibniz the logician, based on his examination of the huge Leibniz Nachlass in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716, his Nachlass was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibniz's unpublished work on logic. In 1903, Couturat published much of that work in another large volume, his Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz, containing many of the documents he had examined while writing La Logique. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate Aristotle from George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturat's editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell, also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz, and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship./nIn 1905, Couturat published a work on logic and the foundations of mathematics (with an appendix on Kant's philosophy of mathematics) that was originally conceived as a translation of Russell's Principles of Mathematics.  In the same year, he published L'Alg\u00e8bre de la logique, a classic introduction to Boolean algebra and the works of C.S. Peirce and Ernst Schr\u00f6der./nIn 1907, Couturat helped found the constructed language Ido, an offshoot of Esperanto, and was Ido's principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language, constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages, Couturat was paralleling Peano's advocacy of Interlingua. By pushing Ido, Couturat walked in Leibniz's footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the characteristica universalis./nCouturat, a confirmed pacifist, was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the French Army, in the first stage of World War I./nHe appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, A Curable Romantic.", "58299531": "Edward Barry Saff (born 2 January 1944 in New York City)[1] is an American mathematician, specializing in complex analysis, approximation theory, numerical analysis, and potential theory./nSaff received in 1964 his bachelor's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology and in 1968 his PhD from the University of Maryland, College Park under Joseph L.

Cassini was born in Perinaldo,[2][3] near Imperia, at that time in the County of Nice, part of the Savoyard state.[4][5] Cassini is known for his work on astronomy and engineering. He discovered four satellites of the planet Saturn and noted the division of the rings of Saturn; the Cassini Division was named after him. Giovanni Domenico Cassini was also the first of his family to begin work on the project of creating a topographic map of France./nThe Cassini space probe, launched in 1997, was named after him and became the fourth to visit the planet Saturn and the first to orbit the planet./nCassini was the son of Jacopo Cassini, a Tuscan, and Giulia Crovesi. In 1648 Cassini accepted a position at the observatory at Panzano, near Bologna, to work with Marquis Cornelio Malvasia, a rich amateur astronomer, initiating the first part of his career.[6] During his time at the Panzano Observatory, Cassini was able to complete his education under the scientists Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi. In 1650 the senate of Bologna appointed him as the principal chair of astronomy at the University of Bologna.[6]/nWhile in his position in Bologna, he observed and wrote a treatise on the comet of 1652. He was also employed by the senate of Bologna as hydraulic engineer, and appointed by Pope Alexander VII inspector of fortifications in 1657. He was subsequently director of waterways in the papal states.[7]/nIn San Petronio, Bologna, Cassini convinced church officials to create an improved sundial meridian line at the San Petronio Basilica, moving the pinhole gnomon that projected the Sun's image up into the church's vaults 66.8 meters (219\u00a0ft) away from the meridian inscribed in the floor. The much larger image of the Sun's disk projected by the camera obscura effect allowed him to measure the change in diameter of the Sun's disk over the year as the Earth moved toward and then away from the Sun. He concluded the changes in size he measured were consistent with Johannes Kepler's 1609 heliocentric theory, where the Earth was moving around the Sun in an elliptical orbit instead of the Ptolemaic system where the Sun orbited the Earth in an eccentric orbit.[8]/nCassini remained in Bologna working until Colbert recruited him to come to Paris to help set up the Paris Observatory. Cassini departed from Bologna on 25 February 1669.[6]/nCassini's determinations of the rotational periods of Jupiter and Mars in 1665\u20131667 enhanced his fame, and in 1669, with the reluctant assent of the Pope, he moved to France and through a grant from Louis XIV of France helped to set up the Paris Observatory, which opened in 1671;[7] he would remain the director of the observatory for the rest of his career until his death in 1712. For the remaining forty-one years of his life Cassini served as astronomer/astrologer to Louis XIV (\"The Sun King\"); serving the expected dual role yet focusing the overwhelming majority of his time on astronomy rather than the astrology he had studied so much in his youth.\nCassini thoroughly adopted his new country, to the extent that he became interchangeably known as Jean-Dominique Cassini, although that is also the name of his great-grandson, Dominique, comte de Cassini./nDuring this time, Cassini's method of determining longitude was used to measure the size of France accurately for the first time. The country turned out to be considerably smaller than expected, and the king quipped that Cassini had taken more of his kingdom from him than he had won in all his wars./nOn July 14, 1673 Cassini obtained the benefits of French citizenship. In 1674 he married Genevi\u00e8ve de Laistre, the daughter of the lieutenant general of the comt\u00e9 of Clermont. \"From this marriage Cassini had two sons; the younger, Jacques Cassini, succeeded him as astronomer and geodesist under the name of Cassini II.\"[6]/nIn 1711 Cassini went blind and he died on 14 September 1712 in Paris at the age of 87.[2]/nCassini observed and published surface markings on Mars (earlier seen by Christiaan Huygens but not published), determined the rotation periods of Mars and Jupiter, and discovered four satellites of Saturn: Iapetus and Rhea in 1671 and 1672, and Tethys and Dione (1684).[9] Cassini was the first to observe these four moons, which he called Sidera Lodoicea (the stars of Louis), including Iapetus, whose anomalous variations in brightness he correctly ascribed as being due to the presence of dark material on one hemisphere (now called Cassini Regio in his honour). In addition he discovered the Cassini Division in the rings of Saturn (1675).[6] He shares with Robert Hooke credit for the discovery of the Great Red Spot on Jupiter (ca. 1665). Around 1690, Cassini was the first to observe differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere./nIn 1672 he sent his colleague Jean Richer to Cayenne, French Guiana, while he himself stayed in Paris. The two made simultaneous observations of Mars and, by computing the parallax, determined its distance from Earth. This allowed for the first time an estimation of the dimensions of the Solar System: since the relative ratios of various Sun-planet distances were already known from geometry, only a single absolute interplanetary distance was needed to calculate all of the distances./nIn 1677, the English philosopher John Locke visited Cassini in Paris. He writes, \"At the Observatory, we saw the Moon in a twenty-two foot glass, and Jupiter, with his satellites, in the same. The most remote was on the east, and the other three on the west. We also saw Saturn and his rings, in a twelve-foot glass, and one of his satellites.\"[10]/nCassini initially held the Earth to be the centre of the Solar System, though later observations compelled him to accept the model of the Solar System proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus, and eventually that of Tycho Brahe. \"In 1659 he presented a model of the planetary system that was in accord with the hypothesis of Nicolaus Copernicus. In 1661 he developed a method, inspired by Kepler's work, of mapping successive phases of solar eclipses; and in 1662 he published new tables of the sun, based on his observations at San Petronio.\"[6] Cassini also rejected Newton's theory of gravity, after measurements he conducted which wrongly suggested that the Earth was elongated at its poles. More than forty years of controversy about the subject were closed in favour of Newton's theory after the measurements of the French Geodesic Mission (1736 to 1744) and the Lapponian expedition in 1737 led by Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis/nCassini was also the first to make successful measurements of longitude by the method suggested by Galileo, using eclipses of the Galilean satellites as a clock./nIn 1683, Cassini presented the correct explanation of the phenomenon of zodiacal light.[7] Zodiacal light is a faint glow that extends away from the Sun in the ecliptic plane of the sky, caused by dusty objects in interplanetary space./nCassini is also credited with introducing Indian Astronomy to Europe. In 1688, the French envoy to Siam (Thailand), Simon de la Loub\u00e8re, returned to Paris with an obscure manuscript relating to the astronomical traditions of that country, along with a French translation. The Siamese Manuscript, as it is now called, somehow fell into Cassini's hands. He was intrigued enough by it to spend considerable time and effort deciphering its cryptic contents,[citation needed] also determining on the way that the document originated in India.[11] His explication of the manuscript appeared in La Loub\u00e8re's book on the Kingdom of Siam in 1691,[12][non-primary source needed]./nAttracted to the heavens in his youth, his first interest was in astrology. While young he read widely on the subject of astrology, and soon was very knowledgeable about it; this extensive knowledge of astrology led to his first appointment as an astronomer. Later in life he focused almost exclusively on astronomy and all but denounced astrology as he became increasingly involved in the Scientific Revolution./nIn 1645 the Marquis Cornelio Malvasia, a senator of Bologna with a great interest in astrology, invited Cassini to Bologna and offered him a position in the Panzano Observatory, which he was constructing at that time. Most of their time was spent calculating newer, better, and more accurate ephemerides for astrological purposes using the rapidly advancing astronomical methods and tools of the day./nIn 1653, Cassini, wishing to employ the use of a meridian line, sketched a plan for a new and larger meridian line but one that would be difficult to build. His calculations were precise; the construction succeeded perfectly; and its success gave Cassini a brilliant reputation for working with engineering and structural works.[6]/nCassini was employed by Pope Clement IX in regard to fortifications, river management, and flooding of the Po River. \"Cassini composed several memoirs on the flooding of the Po River and on the means of avoiding it; moreover, he also carried out experiments in applied hydraulics.\"[6] In 1663 he was named superintendent of fortifications and in 1665 inspector for Perugia.[6] The Pope asked Cassini to take Holy Orders to work with him permanently but Cassini turned him down because he wanted to work on astronomy full-time./nIn the 1670s, Cassini began work on a project to create a topographic map of France, using Gemma Frisius's technique of triangulation. The project was continued by his son Jacques Cassini and eventually finished by his grandson C\u00e9sar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de Thury and published as the Carte de Cassini in 1789[13] or 1793.[14] It was the first topographic map of an entire country.", "47682758": "Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi (Japanese: \u6cb3\u539f\u6797 \u5065\u4e00, born 1975) is a Japanese graph theorist who works as a professor at the National Institute of Informatics and is known for his research on graph theory (particularly the theory of graph minors) and graph algorithms./nKawarabayashi was born on May 22, 1975, in Tokyo.\nHe earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Keio University in 1998, a master's degree from Keio in 2000, and a PhD from Keio in 2001, researching the Lov\u00e1sz\u2013Woodall conjecture[1] under the supervision of Katsuhiro Ota.[2] After temporary positions at Vanderbilt University[2] and under the supervision of Paul Seymour at Princeton University,[1] he became an assistant professor at Tohoku University in 2003, and moved to the National Institute of Informatics in 2006.[2]/nIn 2003, Kawarabayashi was one of three winners of the Kirkman Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications, an award given by them annually to researchers within four years of their PhD.

OKW/Chi).[3][4]/nWeber was born in 1906 in Oberstein (near Hamburg, Germany), the son of a merchant. In 1924, he graduated from the Abitur. He studied mathematics in Hamburg and at the University of G\u00f6ttingen  and in 1928 he handed over the Lehramt staatsexamen (state examination) in Mathematics, Physics, Biology. Weber took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil. in G\u00f6ttingen with Emmy Noether, (who was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, Hermann Weyl, and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics),  with a dissertation titled: Ideal theoretical interpretation of the representability of any natural numbers by square forms, (German: Idealtheoretische Deutung der Darstellbarkeit beliebiger nat\u00fcrlicher Zahlen durch quadratische Formen)[5] Noether had not been authorized to supervise dissertations on her own.[6]/nIn G\u00f6ttingen, his postdoctoral scholarship was co-sponsored by Edmund Landau in 1931, with whom he had been an assistant since 1928 and whom he represented in 1933 after his leave of absence. Landau and Noether had judged his dissertation to be excellent, but Weber was only a mediocre mathematician, and his usefulness for Landau consisted chiefly of his abilities in accurate proofreading, to which Landau devoted much attention (according to an anecdote which was then prevalent, he was able to distinguish between an Italic point and a Roman point).[7] In 1933, Oswald Teichm\u00fcller convinced Weber to convert to Nazism.[8]/nHe was involved in the publication of the Deutsche Mathematik and published a book on the Pell equation.[9]/nFrom 1946, Weber worked as a publishing director in Hamburg and from 1951 at the private school \"Institut Dr. Brechtefeld\" in Hamburg as a teacher. He left a detailed manuscript (written down before 1940) about his discussion with Hasse,[10] which serves as an important source for the events at that time in G\u00f6ttingen./nWeber was a member of the SA, but only became a Nazi on 1 May 1933 when he was given the Nazi party number 3,118,177.[11][12]  In November 1933, he signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State./nWeber was involved in the removal of the Jewish mathematician Edmund Landau on 2 November 1933 from the mathematics faculty at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Richard Courant was also forced out of G\u00f6ttingen in May 1933. As the leader of a group of pro-Nazi students Weber, along with the Nazi mathematician Oswald Teichm\u00fcller, along with the SS, organized a group that commanded a boycott of   Edmund Landau's lectures. In a letter that Richard Courant wrote to Abraham Flexner, he stated:/nLandau received a delegate from the students, who informed him that \"Aryan students want Aryan mathematics...and requested that he refrain from giving [any more] lectures.\"[14] The speaker for the students was a very young, scientifically gifted man, but completely muddled and notorious. That person was Oswald Teichm\u00fcller. Landau would leave the university soon after./nOn 13 February 1934 the university Dekan (Deacon) asked Weber, who was acting director of the mathematical institute at G\u00f6ttingen, for recommendations on who should replace Hermann Weyl as new operational director. Several days later Weber recommended, as the best mathematician, the algebraist Helmut Hasse, then working at the University of Marburg, but preferred the Nazi Udo Wegner.[6]  In 1940, Weber would write:/nThe decision was made by the Nazi Theodor Vahlen, who appointed Helmut Hasse in April 1934. The Nazi were unsure if Hasse was fully committed to National Socialist policies, and tried to appoint someone to a second chair at G\u00f6ttingen who was a firm Nazi supporter. Udo Wegner was a strong candidate, but the probability theorist Erhard Tornier and ardent Nazi, eventually gained the second chair.[16]/nLater Weber and other convinced national socialists, met in G\u00f6ttingen with the designated new head of the G\u00f6ttingen mathematical institute Helmut Hasse, who also sympathized with the Nazis, to question him about his ancestry, where Weber and his cronies did not consider him reliable for (Nazi) party politics, due to him having a Jewish grandmother. Although Hasse was acceptable to the Nazis, he was not acceptable to Weber, who refused to hand over the keys to the institute.[17] Proceedings were started against Weber with Weber sending a 400+ page document to Dr Mentzel of the Reich Ministry for Science Education and Adult Education.  War work interrupted the proceedings./nIn 1945, Weber was dismissed due to his Nazi involvement./nDuring World War II, he worked with Oswald Teichm\u00fcller in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht in section IVc under Wolfgang Franz which was scientific decoding of enemy crypts, the development of code-breaking methods and working on re-cyphering systems not solved by practical decoding.

In 1937 he set out a simpler and more conventional version of the John von Neumann 1923 axiomatic set theory. Soon after Alfred Tarski joined Berkeley's mathematics department in 1942, Robinson began to do major work on the foundations of mathematics, building on Tarski's concept of essential undecidabilility, by proving a number of mathematical theories undecidable. In 1950 Robinson proved that an essentially undecidable theory need not have an infinite number of axioms by coming up with a counterexample: Robinson arithmetic Q. Q is finitely axiomatizable because it lacks Peano arithmetic's axiom schema of induction; nevertheless Q, like Peano arithmetic, is incomplete and undecidable in the sense of G\u00f6del.

He is considered one of the most influential and prolific mathematics educators of the twentieth century.[2] He is best known for introducing new approaches to teaching and learning mathematics (Visible & Tangible Math), foreign languages (The Silent Way) and reading (Words in Color). Gattegno also developed pedagogical materials for each of these approaches, and was the author of more than 120 books and hundreds of articles[3] largely on the topics of education and human development./nGattegno was born November 11, 1911, in Alexandria, Egypt. His parents, Menachem Gattegno, a Spanish merchant, and his wife, Bchora, had nine children. Because of poverty, Gattegno and his siblings had to work starting from a young age. The future mathematician had no formal education until he started to learn on his own at the age of 14.[4] He took external examinations when he was 20 years old and obtained a teaching license in physics and chemistry from the University of Marseille in Cairo.[4]/nHe moved to England, where he became involved in teacher education and helped establish the Association of Teachers of Mathematics and the International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Teaching.[5] He taught at several universities including the University of Liverpool and the University of London.[3]/nGattegno's pedagogical approach is characterised by propositions based on the observation of human learning in many and varied situations. This is a description of three of these propositions. He was also influenced by the works of Jean Piaget and worked on introducing the implications of the latter's cognitive theory on education.[6]/nGattegno noticed that there is an \"energy budget\" for learning. Human beings have a highly developed sense of the economics of their own energy and are very sensitive to the cost involved in using it. It is therefore essential to teach in ways that are efficient in terms of the amount of energy spent by learners. To be able to quantitively determine whether one method was more efficient than another, he created a unit of measurement for the effort used to learn. He called that unit an ogden, and one can only say an ogden has been spent if the learning was done outside of ordinary functionings, and was retained. For example, learning one word in a foreign language costs one ogden, but if the word cannot be recalled, the ogden has not truly been spent. Gattegno's teaching materials and techniques were designed to be economical with ogdens, so that the greatest amount of information can be recalled with the least sense of effort. In 1970s, he collaborated with the film maker Joeseph Koenig.[7] They produced one-minute television films that featured animation contents that presented: 1) raw data on how the English language works; 2) the language's spatial ordering; 3) the effects of transformations; and, 4) the concepts of insertion, reversal, substitution, and addition.[7]/nFor Gattegno, certain kinds of learning are very expensive in terms of energy, i.e., ogdens, while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the content is of no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School is not the only place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebody's name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The \"mental glue\" necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy./nNot only is that type of learning expensive, it tends also to be fragile. It is typically difficult to remember those kinds of items. Even when we make a great effort, we do not always succeed. We often recognise a face without being able to remember the name of the person ... not to mention all that almost all of us have forgotten much of what we \"learned\" at school.  It is not unusual for us to forget much of what we memorize./nHowever, there is another way of functioning, which Gattegno called natural retention. An example of retention is the reception of sensory images. When we look at something \u2013 a street, a film, a person, a fine view \u2013 photons move from what we are contemplating and enter our eyes to strike the retina. When we listen to something, we create auditory images in a similar way, that is, through energy that enters our system, rather than energy we allocate from inside, to memorize an arbitrary item. To retain an auditory or visual image, we have to use perhaps only an insignificant amount of our own to retain it; the amount is so small we are not aware of any effort. Such images are easily acquired and generally remain for long periods. We all have experiences similar to the following examples Gattegno offered:/nFirst experience: \"I recently visited a village in the south of France where I had not been for over 10 years and I was able to say, 'Oh, yes, I know. The pharmacy is over there beyond the baker's.' I went to see and there it was. I had made no effort to memorise this village square. It had entered my mind during my previous visits and it had remained there.\"/nSecond experience: \"I visit a supermarket and go down the aisles. I see an unexceptional woman with a trolley. Three aisles further on, I see her again. I have not tried to remember her, but I have seen her and I can recognise her again a little later.\"/nOur system of retention is extremely efficient. We keep in our minds a huge quantity of information simply because we have seen, heard, tasted, smelled or felt it. That ability is part of human nature. It enables us to walk about our town without getting lost, to ski or to read a book./nGattegno proposed that we should base education, not on memorization, which has a high energetic cost and is often unreliable, but on retention. The learning tools and techniques Gattegno proposed rely systematically on retention./nGattegno argued that for pedagogical actions to be effective, teaching should be subordinated to learning, which requires that as an absolute prerequisite teachers must understand how people learn. Rather than present facts for memorization, teachers construct challenges for students to conquer. If the student cannot conquer the challenge easily, the teacher does not tell the answer, but observes and asks questions to determine where the confusion lies, and what awareness needs to be triggered in the student. His methodology is based on the idea that education is built around the acquisition of awareness obtained from the elements of learning.[8]/nThe role of teachers is not to try to transmit knowledge, but to engender acts of awareness in their students, for only awareness is educable. Gattegno created pedagogical materials designed to provoke awarenesses. The materials are intended to be used along with techniques aimed at leading students through a succession of awarenesses. As the students progress, teachers who observe their students can see when and how they can induce a new act of awareness./nFor example, he created Words in Colour for learning to read. Briefly, it consists of a series of word charts using a colour code in which each colour represents a phoneme of the language. The charts are used to provoke the phonological awareness in students of the sounds they are making and the order in which they are making them thus engendering all the awarenesses of how the graphemes relate to the phonemes and of how the spatial order of writing reflects the chronological order of speech. Other charts, called Fidels, list the graphemes used to spell each phoneme./nHe also used this colour code in The Silent Way  materials for learning foreign languages to enable students to identify and produce the sounds of the new language. The Words in Color method was one of his earliest works that generated interest.[9] Here, Cuisenaire rods are used, particularly with beginners, to create visible and tangible situations from which the students can induce the structures of the language. The silence of the teacher both gives the students room to explore the language and frees the teacher to observe the students. The teacher is thus able to propose a sequence of pedagogical challenges adapted precisely to the evolution of the students' learning. \"If I would be remembered for anything\", he said in one of his last seminars, \"it would be that I painted the sounds with colours.\"/nIn his approach to teaching mathematics, manipulatives, such as Geoboards which he invented and Cuisenaire Rods which he popularised, are part of a way of systematically developing students' mathematical thinking through the exploration of clear and tangible problems./nAll the materials created by Gattegno were designed to allow teachers using them to place the accent systematically on the students' learning rather than on what they, the teachers, do. Teachers watch their students deal with the challenges they are given, and provide them with feedback on their trials and errors. Teachers thus actively base their work on the awareness and awarenesses of the students, in the here and now. It is therefore very difficult for a teacher to closely follow a detailed lesson-plan, since the students are actively exploring the domain and have the freedom to take the lesson wherever they need it to go. The class becomes a kind of guided improvisation in which the teacher launches a challenge at a suitable level for the students, and if necessary nudges them into the awarenesses they need to have in order to learn. This is the case whatever the subject being dealt with, and is what is meant by Gattegno's expression, \"the subordination of teaching to learning\"./nGattegno found that only awareness is educable in human beings. On the path to learning, several awarenesses must be reached. The first is the awareness that there is something to be learned, some unknown to become known. The next awarenesses are triggered by experience with the subject matter. For example, rather than ask a student to write \"2+2=4,\" Gattegno might ask them to create the number 4 in as many ways as possible with colored rods. The student can then clearly see, feel, and describe the characteristics of the number 4. Instead of memorizing \"2+2=4,\" the student has had a mathematical experience, and become aware that \"4\" can be broken into parts, and that the process of breaking apart and putting together can be described in several ways./nWe are constantly becoming aware of new things. When it is something significant, the awareness is often audible in the form of the \"Ah!\" so typical of an important realisation. However, most realisations are made much more discretely. Indeed, as we live our everyday lives, we become aware of all sorts of things at great speed throughout the day: the price of bananas, that these bananas are not ripe enough, that the price of the yoghurts has been reduced because they are close to their sell-by date .... All our life is a succession of tiny awarenesses. Until we become aware of something, that thing remains totally unknown to us. As soon as we become aware of it and integrate it into our lives, we often no longer pay attention to it. But the moment of realisation, the act of learning, is an act of awareness./nThe role of the teacher in acts of learning is not to inform students of this or that piece of information, but to help them to discover it, to perform a conscious act to become aware of it./nGattegno suggests that learning takes place in four stages which can be described in terms of awareness./nThe first stage consists in a single act of awareness: the realisation that there is something new to be explored. As long as I am unaware that there is something to be known, I cannot start to learn./nThe second stage: As soon as I start to learn, I have to explore the situation in order to understand it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing./nThe third stage is a transitional stage. At the beginning, I am able to do what I want if I pay attention at each instant. At the end of this stage I no longer need to pay attention: the new skill has become completely automatic and because it is automatic, I am free to give my attention to learning other things./nThe fourth stage is that of transfer. For the rest of my life, what I have learnt can be used for all the new skills I may wish to acquire. When I learnt to run, I used the know-how I had acquired from learning to walk. Both of these, walking and running, were useful to me when I decided to learn cross-country skiing.

He was the older brother of mathematician Jules Tannery, to whose Notions Math\u00e9matiques he contributed an historical chapter.  Though Tannery's career was in the tobacco industry, he devoted his evenings and his life to the study of mathematicians and mathematical development./nTannery was born in Mantes-la-Jolie on 20 December 1843, to a deeply Catholic family.  He attended private school in Mantes, followed by the Lyc\u00e9es in Le Mans and Caen. He then entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, on whose entrance exam he excelled.  His curriculum included mathematics, the sciences, and the classics, all of which would be represented in his future academic work.  Tannery's life of public service began as he then entered the \u00c9cole d'Applications des Tabacs as an apprentice engineer./nAs an assistant engineer, Tannery spent two years in the state tobacco factory at Lille.  In 1867, he moved to Paris; three years later, he served as an artillery captain in the Franco-Prussian War.  Biographies of Tannery describe him as an ardent patriot and claim that he never fully accepted the humiliating Treaty of Frankfurt./nAfter his graduation from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Tannery had become interested in Auguste Comte and his positivist philosophy.  After the war, his interest in mathematics continued, and Comte's ideas would influence his approach to the study of the history of science.  Tannery moved several times with his career in the tobacco industry: to P\u00e9rigord in 1872, to Bordeaux in 1874, to Le Havre in 1877, and to Paris in 1883.  Bordeaux had something of an intellectual atmosphere, and though Tannery moved to Le Havre (near his parents, who lived at Caen) at his own request, he would also directly request the move to Paris, where his research and academic pursuits would be able to flourish./nIt was in Paris that Tannery took on his first two major editorial works.  In 1883, he began an edition of Diophantus's manuscripts, and in 1885, he and Charles Henry began an edition of one of Fermat's works.  This work was made possible by access to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, and so Tannery had to reduce his efforts in 1886 when he was transferred to Tonneins.  Even without access to the Biblioth\u00e8que, Tannery remained hard at work, however, as he published two books composed of articles he had been writing for the Revue philosophique de la France et de l'\u00e9tranger and for the Bulletin de sciences mathematiques./nIn 1888, Tannery moved back to Bordeaux, where he studied Greek astronomy and directed the tobacco factory.  Two years later, he was back in Paris; he would remain near Paris until his death.  Despite a heavy professional workload, he continued to be productive in his work in the history of science.  His editions of Diophantus and Fermat were published, along with over 250 articles.  From 1890 forward, Tannery's other major work focused on a new edition of Descartes's works and correspondence, on which he collaborated with Charles Adam, an historian of modern philosophy./nScandal arose in 1903 when the Coll\u00e8ge de France began a search for a new professor of the history of science.  Tannery was considered something of a shoo-in; he even began writing his inaugural lecture.  Instead, the position went to Gr\u00e9goire Wyrouboff, who concentrated on modern mathematicians instead of Tannery's classical and seventeenth-century idols.  Wyrouboff was also a freethinker, an asset to the secularist Third Republic, while Tannery was Catholic./nTannery died soon thereafter, on 27 November 1904, in Pantin, just outside Paris.

Vahlen worked briefly as an assistant in Johannes Stark's private physics laboratory. In 1930 Vahlen returned to his birthplace and became a lecturer of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Wien.[7][8]/nOnce Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Vahlen's career again gained momentum and flourished in Germany as a result of his support for the NSDAP. In that year, he became an ordinarius professor of mathematics at the Humboldt University of Berlin, as successor to Richard Edler von Mises,[9] who emigrated from Germany as a result of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which was in part directed against professors with Jewish ancestry, which von Mises had. After 1933, Vahlen was a strong advocate of Deutsche Mathematik, a parallel movement to Deutsche Physik, advocated by the Nobel Laureate physicists Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark; both movements were anti-Semitic. From 1934, he was ordinarius professor at the University of Berlin, a position he held until attaining emeritus status in 1937.[7]/nIn July 1933 Vahlen joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) but on 10 July 1936 he switched to the Schutzstaffel (SS) with the rank of Sturmbannf\u00fchrer and was assigned to the SS Main Office. On 30 January 1938 he was attached to the staff of the Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS. He received successive promotions, the last being to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer on 9 November 1943.[10]/nDuring the period 1933 to 1937, Vahlen served as third vice president of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft. In January 1934 he became an employee in the University Department of the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and Public Education, and by 26 April he was head of the department. From 1 June 1934, he was a Ministerial Director and Chief of the Science Office at the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture.[11] Actually, the Science Office was split into two components, WI, a continuation of the Prussian department, and WII, the army office for research. Vahlen was head of WI, but, in actuality, the deputy chief, the chemist Franz Bach\u00e9r ran WI.[12] From this position, in 1936, Vahlen began publishing the journal Deutsche Mathematik, for which the Berlin mathematician Ludwig Bieberbach was the editor; in the journal, political articles preceded the scholarly articles. On 1 January 1937 Vahlen was relieved of his duties at the Ministry at his own request. Through a manipulation of the election process by Vahlen and his supporters, he was selected as president of the Prussian Academy of Sciences effective 1 January 1939 and remained in this post until 1 April 1943.[6][7][13] In April 1944, Vahlen moved to Vienna after his Berlin apartment was destroyed in an air raid and again taught at the Technische Hochschule Wien. In August 1944 he moved to Prague and worked as a lecturer at the Charles University. At the end of the war in May 1945 he was imprisoned, and he died in Czech custody in November 1945.[14]/nVahlen gained his doctorate with Beitr\u00e4ge zu einer additiven Zahlentheorie, and continued to specialise in number theory, but later turned to applied mathematics./nTheodor Vahlen was an early proponent of geometric algebra. His 1902 paper in Mathematische Annalen recounts William Kingdon Clifford's construction of his 2n dimensional algebra with n \u2212 1 anti-commuting square roots of \u22121. Vahlen also recounts split-biquaternions and parabolic biquaternions originated by Clifford. But Vahlen cites Eduard Study most of all since Study also focussed on the geometric motions (translation and rotation) as implicit in algebra. Since Vahlen explores some of the fractional-linear transformations of Clifford algebras, he is sometimes remembered for the Vahlen matrices. These are \n\n\n\n2\n\u00d7\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2\\times 2}\n\n matrices with coefficients in a Clifford algebra that act on a projective line over a ring.\nIn 1985 Lars Ahlfors recalled the article as follows: \"The method was introduced as early as 1901 by K.T. Vahlen in a rather short, but remarkable, paper. His motivation was to unify the theory of motions in Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic space, which is obviously in the spirit of Clifford. In this respect the paper seems somewhat antiquated, but the essence is in the method it advocates.\"[15]\nThe subject of relativity was a polemical issue in Nazi Germany.

He was the fifth born of the six children in the family of L\u00e9on de Rham, a constructions engineer.[1] Georges de Rham grew up in Roche but went to school in nearby Aigle, the main town of the district, travelling daily by train. By his own account, he was not an extraordinary student in school, where he mainly enjoyed painting and dreamed of becoming a painter.[2] In 1919 he moved with his family to Lausanne in a rented apartment in Beaulieu Castle, where he would live for the rest of his life. Georges de Rham started the Gymnasium in Lausanne with a focus on humanities, following his passion for literature and philosophy but learning little mathematics. On graduating from the Gymnasium in 1921 however, he decided not to continue with the Faculty of Letters in order to avoid Latin. He opted instead for the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lausanne. At the faculty he started out studying biology, physics and chemistry and no mathematics initially. While trying to learn some mathematics by himself as a tool for physics, his interest was raised and by the third year he abandoned biology to focus decisively on mathematics.[3]/nAt the University he was mainly influenced by two professors, Gustave Dumas and Dmitry Mirimanoff, who guided him in studying the works of \u00c9mile Borel, Ren\u00e9-Louis Baire, Henri Lebesgue, and Joseph Serret. After graduating in 1925, de Rham remained at the University of Lausanne as an assistant to Dumas. Starting work towards completing his doctorate, he read the works of Henri Poincar\u00e9 on topology on the advice of Dumas. Although he found inspiration for a thesis subject in Poincar\u00e9, progress was slow as topology was a relatively new topic and access to the relevant literature was difficult in Lausanne.[2] With the recommendation of Dumas, de Rham contacted Lebesgue and went to Paris for a few months in 1926 and, again, for a few months in 1928. Both trips were financed by his own savings and he spent his time in Paris taking classes and studying at the University of Paris and the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Lebesgue provided de Rham with a lot of help in this period, both with his studies and supporting his first research publications. When he finished his thesis Lebesgue advised him to send it to \u00c9lie Cartan and, in 1931, De Rham received his doctorate from the University of Paris before a commission led by Cartan and including Paul Montel and Gaston Julia as examiners.[1]/nIn 1932 de Rham returned to the University of Lausanne as an extraordinary professor. In 1936 he also became a professor at the University of Geneva and continued to hold both positions in parallel until his retirement in 1971.[4]/nde Rham was also one of the best mountaineers in Switzerland. As a member of the Independent High Mountain Group of Lausanne since 1944, he opened several difficult routes, some of them in the Valais Alps (such as the south ridge of the Stockhorn from Baltschieder[5]) and Vaud Alps (such as L'Argentine[6] and Pacheu). In 1944 he wrote a complete climbing guidebook of the Miroir d'Argentine, where he climbed routes until 1980.  According to John Milnor, in 1933 de Rham encountered on one of his hikes James Alexander and Hassler Whitney, who were climbing together near the Weisshorn in Valais; this meeting  was the beginning of a more than 40-year friendship between Whitney and de Rham.[7]/nThe theory of differential forms has classical roots, with the relation between forms and differential topology initiated in the early 20th century by Henri Poincar\u00e9 and \u00c9lie Cartan, who observed the Poincar\u00e9 lemma as well as the fact that not every closed differential form is exact. Cartan conjectured in 1928 that the Betti numbers of a smooth manifold could be encoded by differential forms. As a particular form of this, he conjectured that a closed form is exact if it integrates to zero over any submanifold without boundary, and that a submanifold without boundary is itself a boundary of another submanifold, if every closed form integrates to zero over it. De Rham, in his 1931 thesis, proved Cartan's conjecture by decomposing an arbitrary \ndifferential form into the sum of a closed form and some number of elementary forms, which are differential forms associated to a smooth triangulation of the space.[8]/nFollowing this work, de Rham made several attempts to unify forms and submanifolds into a single kind of mathematical object. He identified the ultimate notion of a current in the 1950s, generalizing (and inspired by) Laurent Schwartz's recent work on distributions.[9] De Rham's work on these topics is now usually formulated in the language of cohomology theory, although he did not do so himself.[8] In this form, his thesis work has become foundational to the field of differential topology, while his theory of currents is basic to geometric measure theory and related fields.[10][11] His work is particularly important for Hodge theory and sheaf theory./nIn an additional part of his 1931 thesis, de Rham introduced higher-dimensional versions of the three-dimensional lens spaces and computed their homology, thereby establishing a necessary condition in order for two lens spaces to be homeomorphic.[8]/nThe structure of a Riemannian product automatically implies a product structure of the holonomy groups. In 1952 De Rham considered the converse, proving that, if there is a decomposition of the tangent bundle into vector subbundles which are invariant under the holonomy group, then the Riemannian structure must decompose as a product. This result, now known as the de Rham decomposition theorem, has become a fundamental textbook result in Riemannian geometry.[12][13]", "234861": "James Joseph Sylvester FRS HonFRSE (3 September 1814\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1897) was an English mathematician. He made fundamental contributions to matrix theory, invariant theory, number theory, partition theory, and combinatorics.  He played a leadership role in American mathematics in the later half of the 19th century as a professor at the Johns Hopkins University and as founder of the American Journal of Mathematics.  At his death, he was a professor at Oxford University./nJames Joseph was born in London on 3 September 1814, the son of Abraham Joseph, a Jewish merchant.[1] James later adopted the surname Sylvester when his older brother did so upon emigration to the United States./nAt the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of Augustus De Morgan at the University of London. His family withdrew him from the university after he was accused of stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the Liverpool Royal Institution./nSylvester began his study of mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1831,[2] where his tutor was John Hymers. Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the tripos, for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a Smith's prize.[3] In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at University College London and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an MA by Trinity College Dublin. In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia, but left after less than four months. A student who had been reading a newspaper in one of Sylvester's lectures insulted him and Sylvester struck him with a sword stick. The student collapsed in shock and Sylvester believed (wrongly) that he had killed him. Sylvester resigned when he felt that the university authorities had not sufficiently disciplined the student.[4] He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry. However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England./nOn his return to England, he was hired in 1844 by the Equity and Law Life Assurance Society for which he developed successful actuarial models and served as de facto CEO, a position that required a law degree. As a result, he studied for the Bar, meeting a fellow British mathematician studying law, Arthur Cayley, with whom he made significant contributions to invariant theory and also matrix theory during a long collaboration.[5] He did not obtain a position teaching university mathematics until 1855, when he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he retired in 1869, because the compulsory retirement age was 55. The Woolwich academy initially refused to pay Sylvester his full pension, and only relented after a prolonged public controversy, during which Sylvester took his case to the letters page of The Times./nOne of Sylvester's lifelong passions was for poetry; he read and translated works from the original French, German, Italian, Latin and Greek, and many of his mathematical papers contain illustrative quotes from classical poetry. Following his early retirement, Sylvester published a book entitled The Laws of Verse in which he attempted to codify a set of laws for prosody in poetry.[6]/nIn 1872, he finally received his B.A. and M.A. from Cambridge, having been denied the degrees due to his being a Jew.[2]/nIn 1876[7] Sylvester again crossed the Atlantic Ocean to become the inaugural professor of mathematics at the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. His salary was $5,000 (quite generous for the time), which he demanded be paid in gold. After negotiation, agreement was reached on a salary that was not paid in gold.[8]/nIn 1877, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[9]/nIn 1878 he founded the American Journal of Mathematics. The only other mathematical journal in the US at that time was the Analyst, which eventually became the Annals of Mathematics./nIn 1883, he returned to England to take up the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University. He held this chair until his death, although in 1892 the university appointed a deputy professor to the same chair. He was on the governing body of Abingdon School.[10]/nSylvester died at 5 Hertford Street, London on 15 March 1897. He is buried in Balls Pond Road Cemetery on Kingsbury Road in London.[11]/nSylvester invented a great number of mathematical terms such as \"matrix\" (in 1850),[12] \"graph\" (in the sense of network)[13] and \"discriminant\".[14] He coined the term \"totient\" for Euler's totient function \u03c6(n).[15] In discrete geometry he is remembered for Sylvester's problem and a result on the orchard problem, and in matrix theory he discovered\nSylvester's determinant identity,[16] which generalizes the Desnanot\u2013Jacobi identity.[17] His collected scientific work fills four volumes. In 1880, the Royal Society of London awarded Sylvester the Copley Medal, its highest award for scientific achievement; in 1901, it instituted the Sylvester Medal in his memory, to encourage mathematical research after his death in Oxford./nSylvester House, a portion of an undergraduate dormitory at Johns Hopkins University, is named in his honor.

Wilkins later went on to become the President of the American Nuclear Society in 1974.[6]/nWilkins had a widely varied career, spanning seven decades and including significant contributions to pure and applied mathematics, civil and nuclear engineering, and optics.[7] Wilkins was one of the African American scientists and technicians on the Manhattan Project during the Second World War. He also conducted nuclear physics research in both academia and industry. He wrote numerous scientific papers, served in various important posts, earned several significant awards and helped recruit minority students into the sciences.[2][8][9]  During his life he was often the target of racism.[2]/nIn 1940, Wilkins completed his AB in mathematics at the University of Chicago.[3] He went on to an MS and PhD in mathematics at the same institution, which he completed in 1941 and 1942.[3]/nHaving initially been unable to secure a research position,[10] Wilkins taught mathematics from 1943 to 1944 at the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Tuskegee, Alabama.[3]/nIn 1944 he returned to the University of Chicago where he served first as an associate mathematical physicist and then as a physicist in its Metallurgical Laboratory, as part of the Manhattan Project.[4] Working under the direction of Arthur Holly Compton and Enrico Fermi, Wilkins researched the extraction of fissionable nuclear materials, but was not told of the research group's ultimate goal until after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Wilkins was the co-discoverer or discoverer of a number of phenomena in physics such as the Wilkins effect and the Wigner\u2013Wilkins spectra.[11]/nWhen Wilkins's team was about to be transferred to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (known at the time as site \"X\"), due to the Jim Crow laws of the Southern United States, Wilkins would have been prevented from working there. When Edward Teller was informed about this, he wrote a letter on September 18, 1944, to Harold Urey (who was the director of war research at Columbia at the time) of Wilkins's abilities, informing him about the issue caused by local reactions to Wilkins's race, and recommending his services for a new position.[12] As Teller explained:/nKnowing that men of high qualifications are scarce these days, I thought that it might be useful that I suggest a capable person for this job. Mr. Wilkins in Wigner's group at the Metallurgical Laboratory has been doing, according to Wigner, excellent work. He is a colored man and since Wigner's group is moving to \"X\" it is not possible for him to continue work with that group. I think that it might be a good idea to secure his services for our work.[13]/nWilkins then continued to teach mathematics and conduct significant research in neutron absorption with physicist Eugene Wigner, including the development of its mathematical models.[2][4]  He would also later help design and develop nuclear reactors for electrical power generation, becoming part owner of one such company.[4]/nTo improve communication between mathematicians and nuclear engineers on a project, Wilkins earned  bachelor's (1957) and master's degrees (1960) in mechanical engineering from New York University, thus earning five science degrees during his life. It also qualified him to design and build nuclear facilities.[10]/nIn 1970 Wilkins went on to serve Howard University as its distinguished professor of applied mathematical physics and also to help found the university's PhD program in mathematics.[4][14] During his tenure at Howard he undertook a sabbatical position as a visiting scientist at Argonne National Laboratory from 1976 to 1977.[2]/nFrom 1974 to 1975 Wilkins served as president of the American Nuclear Society[4][15] and in 1976 became the second African American to be elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[4][16]/nFrom 1990 Wilkins lived and worked in Atlanta, Georgia, as a distinguished professor of applied mathematics and mathematical physics at Clark Atlanta University, and retired again for his last time in 2003.[2][16]/nThroughout his years of research Wilkins published more than 100 papers on a variety of subjects, including differential geometry, linear differential equations, integrals, nuclear engineering, gamma radiation shielding and optics, garnering numerous professional and scientific awards along the way.[2][17]/nWilkins had two children with his first wife Gloria Louise Steward (d.1980) whom he married in June 1947,[1][11] married Maxine G.

He was the first to expound the Copernican system in English but discarded the notion of a fixed shell of immoveable stars to postulate infinitely many stars at varying distances.[1] He was also first to postulate the \"dark night sky paradox\".[2]/nThomas Digges, born about 1546, was the son of Leonard Digges (c. 1515 \u2013 c. 1559), the mathematician and surveyor, and Bridget Wilford, the daughter of Thomas Wilford, esquire, of Hartridge in Cranbrook, Kent, by his first wife, Elizabeth Culpeper, the daughter of Walter Culpeper, esquire. Digges had two brothers, James and Daniel, and three sisters, Mary, who married a man with the surname of  Barber; Anne, who married William Digges; and Sarah, whose first husband was surnamed Martin, and whose second husband was John Weston.[3]/nAfter the death of his father, Digges grew up under the guardianship of John Dee,[4] a typical Renaissance natural philosopher. In 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Digges, with John Chamber and Henry Savile, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by Dee.[5]/nDigges served as a member of parliament for Wallingford and also had a military career as a Muster-Master General to the English forces from 1586 to 1594 during the war with the Spanish Netherlands. In his capacity of Master-Muster General he was instrumental in promoting improvements at the Port of Dover.[6]/nDigges died on 24 August 1595. His last will, in which he specifically excluded both his brother, James Digges, and William Digges, was proved on 1 September. Digges was buried in the chancel of the church of St Mary Aldermanbury, London.[7]/nDigges married Anne St Leger (1555\u20131636), daughter of Sir Warham St Leger and his first wife, Ursula Neville (d. 1575), the fifth daughter of George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, by his third wife, Mary Stafford.[8] In his will he named two surviving sons, Sir Dudley Digges (1583\u20131639), politician and statesman, and Leonard Digges (1588\u20131635), poet, and two surviving daughters, Margaret and Ursula. After Digges's death, his widow, Anne, married Thomas Russell of Alderminster in Warwickshire, \"whom in 1616 William Shakespeare named as an overseer of his will\".[9]/nDigges attempted to determine the parallax of the 1572 supernova observed by Tycho Brahe, and concluded it had to be beyond the orbit of the Moon. This contradicted Aristotle's view of the universe, according to which no change could take place among the fixed stars./nIn 1576, he published a new edition of his father's perpetual almanac, A Prognostication everlasting. The text written by Leonard Digges for the third edition of 1556 was left unchanged, but Thomas added new material in several appendices. The most important of these was A Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved. Contrary to the Ptolemaic cosmology of the original book by his father, the appendix featured a detailed discussion of the controversial and still poorly known Copernican heliocentric model of the Universe. This was the first publication of that model in English, and a milestone in the popularisation of science./nFor the most part, the appendix was a loose translation into English of chapters from Copernicus' book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Thomas Digges went further than Copernicus, however, by proposing that the universe is infinite, containing infinitely many stars, and may have been the first person to do so, predating Giordano Bruno's (1584)[10] and William Gilbert's (1600)[11] same views. According to Harrison:[12]/nCopernicus had said little or nothing about what lay beyond the sphere of fixed stars. Digges's original contribution to cosmology consisted of dismantling the starry sphere, and scattering the stars throughout endless space./nBy grafting endless space onto the Copernican system and scattering the stars throughout this endless space, Digges pioneered... the idea of an unlimited universe filled with the mingling rays of countless stars./nAn illustration of the Copernican universe can be seen above right. The outer inscription on the map reads (after spelling adjustments from Elizabethan to Modern English):/nThis orb of stars fixed infinitely up extends itself in altitude spherically, and therefore immovable the palace of felicity garnished with perpetual shining glorious lights innumerable, far excelling our sun both in quantity and quality the very court of celestial angels, devoid of grief and replenished with perfect endless joy, the habitacle for the elect./nIn 1583, Lord Burghley appointed Digges, along with Henry Savile (Bible translator) and John Chamber, to sit on a commission to consider whether England should adopt the Gregorian calendar, as proposed by John Dee; in fact Britain did not adopt the calendar until 1752.[13]", "74061172": "Jo Johannis Dronkers (24 May 1910 \u2013 20 February 1973) was a Dutch mathematician who is notable for the development of mathematical methods for the calculation of tides and tidal currents in estuaries. His work formed much of the mathematical basis for the design of the Delta Works. He attended the 1954 International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam, where his work was discussed by David van Dantzig.[1]/nJo Johannis Dronkers was born in Poortvliet, the son of Willem Dronkers, a mayor, and Cornelia Pieternella van der Slikke. He had a twin brother, Johannis Jo Dronkers (1910-1993). He attended the State High School in Bergen op Zoom and then studied mathematics and physics at Leiden University. He completed his dissertation entitled \"On stratifiable congruences\" in 1939 under the supervision of Professor Willem van der Woude.[2][3][4]/nAlthough his work dealt with a problem in pure mathematics, it was notable for containing eleven propositions, five of which concerned tides. Three of these five propositions contained fundamental criticism of the work of Jannis Pieter Mazure, who at that time was one of the most influential people in the field of tidal calculations in the Netherlands. Amongst other propositions, Dronkers proposed a solution to the problem caused by the influence of upstream discharge on the calculation of tidal motion in downstream rivers.[5]/nAnother of Dronkers' propositions concerned an inaccuracy in the work of Hendrik Lorentz contained in Lorentz's report on tidal movements as a consequence of the Zuiderzee Works.[6][3]/nIn 1934, Dronkers commenced his career at Rijkswaterstaat, a Dutch governmental agency responsible for water management and civil engineering works. He was assigned to the Sea Arms, Lower Rivers and Coasts service, a division directed by Dr. Johan van Veen, where Dronkers focused on the mathematical study of tides and related hydrodynamic phenomena. His expertise contributed significantly to the post-war restoration efforts associated with the aftermath of the Inundation of Walcheren in 1945. Dronkers' role during this period is vividly described in A. den Doolaard's non-fiction novel Het verjaagde water, in which he is described as \"The Calculator.\"[7]/nDronkers' collaborative work with notable engineers like Frank Spaargaren led to several key publications in hydraulic engineering, particularly on topics such as tidal basin closures. His work gained further prominence following the devastating North Sea Flood of 1953, as he became deeply involved in the Delta Works project, a series of major civil engineering projects built to protect the Netherlands from sea flooding. Between 1949 and 1963, Dronkers served at the Central Study Service of RIjkswaterstaat, later renamed the Directorate for Water Management and Water Movement, under the leadership of Ir. J.B. Schijf. Here, as the chief mathematician, he played an integral role in the early studies that shaped the Delta Plan.[8][9]/nIn 1963, Dronkers took over as head of the hydrological department of the Delta Service, succeeding Ir. H.A. Ferguson. His mathematical acumen was crucial in devising tidal calculations for the Delta Works. The earlier Delta Commission Report of 1961, to which Dronkers contributed, focused extensively on storm surges and tidal motion, and included work by other notable Dutch engineers like Pieter Jacobus Wemelsfelder. Dronkers' work was pivotal in transitioning from empirical approaches to more scientifically robust computational methodologies in hydraulic engineering.[1] His analytical techniques allowed for a proactive assessment of hydraulic interventions, thereby laying the groundwork for evidence-based strategic planning in the field.[10][11] This approach continues to influence much of hydraulic engineering.[12][13][14]/nDronkers published his magnum opus, Tidal computations in rivers and coastal waters, in 1964. It remains a benchmark in the field of tidal calculation theory, and led to the award of the Conrad Medal by the Royal Netherlands Institute of Engineers to Dronkers in 1965.[15] However, the book\u2019s reception was not without controversy in the hydraulic engineering community. Dronkers' computational approach, though rigorous, was criticized by Johan Van Veen for its complexity and computational demands, which he believed could hinder timely practical applications. Instead, Van Veen proposed the use of an electrical analogue, which led to the use of the Deltar analogue computer.[16] Conversely, the notable Dutch civil engineer Johannes Theodoor Thijsse advocated for a physical model-based approach.[17]", "64361845": "Gerhard Karl Theodor Haenzel (5 March 1898, Wolin, Pomerania (German Empire) \u2013 6 March 1944, Lesneven, Brittany (occupied France)) was a German mathematician./nHaenzel, whose father was a teacher and school board member, completed his Abitur after studying from 1907 to 1915 at the Peter Gr\u00f6ning-Gymnasium in Stargard.

He was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1883./nThomas Hirst was born in Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, England, where both his parents came from families in the wool trade. He was the youngest of four sons. The family moved to Wakefield so that the boys could attend a better school. Thomas attended Wakefield Proprietary School for four years from 1841.[1] Of these days, he said[2] \"... I could obtain the most rudimentary and necessary instruction. I remember, however, that here mathematics was my favourite study ...\" He left the school at fifteen to work as an apprentice engineer in Halifax, surveying for proposed railway lines. It was there that he met John Tyndall, ten years older than Hirst and working as an engineer in the same firm./nIn his late teens, at the instigation of Tyndall, Hirst decided to go to Germany for education, initially in chemistry. He eventually received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Marburg in 1852 (tutor: Friedrich Ludwig Stegmann). In 1853, he attended  geometry lectures by Jakob Steiner at University of Berlin. Hirst married Anna Martin in 1854, and spent much of the decade of the 1850s on the European continent, where he socialised with many mathematicians, and used his inherited wealth to support himself./nFrom 1860 to 1864, Hirst taught at University College School, but resigned because he wanted more time for his mathematical research. He was appointed Professor of Physics at University College London in 1865, and he succeeded Augustus De Morgan to the Chair of Mathematics at UCL in 1867. In 1873 he was appointed as the first Director of Studies at the new Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He retired from that post in 1882, to be succeeded by William Davidson Niven./nFrom the 1860s onwards, Hirst also allocated much of his time in England to the administrative committees of British science. He was an active member of the governing councils of the Royal Society, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and the London Mathematical Society. He was the founding president of an association to reform school mathematics curricula and also worked to promote the education of women. Alongside his old friend Tyndall, Hirst was a member of T. H. Huxley's London X-Club. He died in London in 1892, four weeks after he had made the last entry in his journal, and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.[3][4]/nIn his early days, Hirst wrote extensively in his notebooks (sometimes called the Journal), recording everything he read and much of what he was thinking about. This extraordinary record of about fifty years is preserved in the library of the Royal Institution. As a result, we know much about the development of his mind before he became a professional mathematician. We know, for example, what the effect was of his reading the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, that epoch-making book authored anonymously by Robert Chambers which promoted the idea of evolution in 1844./n\"Almost no-one reads like this anymore. It is the reading practice of a self-improving autodidact, shaped by Bible-reading amongst denominations of learned liberal Dissent... Hirst copied large chunks into his journal... the journal shows that Hirst moved between Vestiges and other related works such as Paley's Natural Theology and John Arthur Phillips' Geology of Yorkshire...\"[5]/nBoth Hirst and Tyndall left in their journals and letters evidence that Vestiges (especially its geological evidence) made a good case against the story of Genesis and the case for divine intervention; yet they were not atheists.

He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the Information Age, alongside the work of Claude Shannon.[4][5][6]/nBoole was the son of a shoemaker. He received a primary school education and learned Latin and modern languages through various means. At 16, he began teaching to support his family. He established his own school at 19 and later ran a boarding school in Lincoln. Boole was an active member of local societies and collaborated with fellow mathematicians./nIn 1849, Boole was appointed the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork) in Ireland, where he met his future wife, Mary Everest. He continued his involvement in social causes and maintained connections with Lincoln. In 1864, Boole died due to fever-induced pleural effusion after developing pneumonia./nBoole published around 50 articles and several separate publications in his lifetime. Some of his key works include a paper on early invariant theory and \"The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,\" which introduced symbolic logic. Boole also wrote two systematic treatises: \"Treatise on Differential Equations\" and \"Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences.\" He contributed to the theory of linear differential equations and the study of the sum of residues of a rational function. In 1847, Boole developed Boolean algebra, a fundamental concept in binary logic, which laid the groundwork for the algebra of logic tradition and forms the foundation of digital circuit design and modern computer science. Boole also attempted to discover a general method in probabilities, focusing on determining the consequent probability of events logically connected to given probabilities. His work was expanded upon by various scholars, such as Charles Sanders Peirce and William Stanley Jevons. Boole's ideas later gained practical applications when Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov employed Boolean algebra to optimize the design of electromechanical relay systems, leading to the development of modern electronic digital computers. University College Cork celebrated the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth in 2015, highlighting his significant impact on the digital age./nBoole's contributions to mathematics earned him various honors, including the Royal Society's first gold prize for mathematics, the Keith Medal, and honorary degrees from the Universities of Dublin and Oxford./nBoole was born in 1815 in Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, the son of John Boole Snr (1779\u20131848), a shoemaker[7] and Mary Ann Joyce.[8] He had a primary school education, and received lessons from his father, but due to a serious decline in business, he had little further formal and academic teaching.[9] William Brooke, a bookseller in Lincoln, may have helped him with Latin, which he may also have learned at the school of Thomas Bainbridge. He was self-taught in modern languages.[2] In fact, when a local newspaper printed his translation of a Latin poem, a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretence that he was not capable of such achievements.[10] At age 16, Boole became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings, taking up a junior teaching position in Doncaster at Heigham's School.[11] He taught briefly in Liverpool.[3]/nBoole participated in the Lincoln Mechanics' Institute, in the Greyfriars, Lincoln, which was founded in 1833.[2][12] Edward Bromhead, who knew John Boole through the institution, helped George Boole with mathematics books[13] and he was given the calculus text of Sylvestre Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix by the Rev. George Stevens Dickson of St Swithin's, Lincoln.[14] Without a teacher, it took him many years to master calculus.[3]/nAt age 19, Boole successfully established his own school in Lincoln: Free School Lane.[15]  Four years later he took over Hall's Academy in Waddington, outside Lincoln, following the death of Robert Hall. In 1840, he moved back to Lincoln, where he ran a boarding school.[3] Boole immediately became involved in the Lincoln Topographical Society, serving as a member of the committee, and presenting a paper entitled \"On the origin, progress, and tendencies of polytheism, especially amongst the ancient Egyptians and Persians, and in modern India\".[16]/nBoole became a prominent local figure, an admirer of John Kaye, the bishop.[17] He took part in the local campaign for early closing.[2] With Edmund Larken and others he set up a building society in 1847.[18] He associated also with the Chartist Thomas Cooper, whose wife was a relation.[19]/nFrom 1838 onwards, Boole was making contacts with sympathetic British academic mathematicians and reading more widely. He studied algebra in the form of symbolic methods, as far as these were understood at the time, and began to publish research papers.[3]/nBoole's status as a mathematician was recognised by his appointment in 1849 as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork (now University College Cork (UCC)) in Ireland. He met his future wife, Mary Everest, there in 1850 while she was visiting her uncle John Ryall who was professor of Greek. They married in 1855.[20][21] He maintained his ties with Lincoln, working there with E. R. Larken in a campaign to reduce prostitution.[22]/nIn 1861, Boole was involved in a Judgement in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland against one John Hewitt Wheatley of Craig House, Sligo for the sum of \u00a3400, whereby Wheatley's estate and interest in lands of Maghan/Mahon, County Cork became vested in Boole.[23]/nIn March 1863, Boole leased Litchfield Cottage, Cork, the house in which he would live with his wife Mary until his death in December of the following year.[24] The premises was described in the deeds as \"all that and those the dwelling house called Litchfield Cottage with the premises and appurtenances thereunto belonging and the Garden and Walled in field to the rere thereof\". Boole's will bequeathed all his 'estate term and interest' in the lease of Litchfield Cottage unto his wife.[25] In August 1865, some 8 months after his death, Mary (by then living at 68 Harley Street, London) passed the house on to Francis Heard of Ballintemple, Cork, Esquire, a captain in her Majesty's 87th Regiment of South Cork./nIn 1844, Boole's paper \"On a General Method in Analysis\" won the first gold prize for mathematics awarded by the Royal Society.[26] He was awarded the Keith Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1855[27] and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1857.[14] He received honorary degrees of LL.D. from the University of Dublin and the University of Oxford.[28]/nBoole's first published paper was \"Researches in the theory of analytical transformations, with a special application to the reduction of the general equation of the second order\", printed in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal in February 1840 (Volume 2, No. 8, pp.\u00a064\u201373), and it led to a friendship between Boole and Duncan Farquharson Gregory, the editor of the journal.[20] His works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications.[30][22]/nIn 1841, Boole published an influential paper in early invariant theory.[14] He received a medal from the Royal Society for his memoir of 1844, \"On a General Method in Analysis\".[20] It was a contribution to the theory of linear differential equations, moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published, to variable coefficients.[31] The innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute.[32] In 1847, Boole published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, the first of his works on symbolic logic.[33]/nBoole completed two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects during his lifetime. The Treatise on Differential Equations[34] appeared in 1859, and was followed, the next year, by a Treatise on the Calculus of Finite Differences,[35] a sequel to the former work.[20]/nIn 1857, Boole published the treatise \"On the Comparison of Transcendent, with Certain Applications to the Theory of Definite Integrals\",[36] in which he studied the sum of residues of a rational function. Among other results, he proved what is now called Boole's identity:/nfor any real numbers ak\u00a0>\u00a00, bk, and t\u00a0>\u00a00.[37] Generalisations of this identity play an important role in the theory of the Hilbert transform.[37]/nIn 1847, Boole published the pamphlet Mathematical Analysis of Logic. He later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system and wanted An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities to be seen as the mature statement of his views.[20] Contrary to widespread belief, Boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of Aristotle's logic. Rather he intended to systematise it, to provide it with a foundation, and to extend its range of applicability.[38] Boole's initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on quantification, between Sir William Hamilton who supported the theory of \"quantification of the predicate\", and Boole's supporter Augustus De Morgan who advanced a version of De Morgan duality, as it is now called. Boole's approach was ultimately much further reaching than either sides' in the controversy.[39] It founded what was first known as the \"algebra of logic\" tradition.[40]/nAmong his many innovations is his principle of wholistic reference, which was later, and probably independently, adopted by Gottlob Frege and by logicians who subscribe to standard first-order logic. A 2003 article[41] provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of Aristotelian logic and Boolean logic; it also reveals the centrality of holistic reference in Boole's philosophy of logic./nIn every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them, the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.[42]/nBoole conceived of \"elective symbols\" of his kind as an algebraic structure. But this general concept was not available to him: he did not have the segregation standard in abstract algebra of postulated (axiomatic) properties of operations, and deduced properties.[43] His work was a beginning to the algebra of sets, again not a concept available to Boole as a familiar model. His pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days./nBoole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word \"and\" and addition by the word \"or\". But in Boole's original system, + was a partial operation: in the language of set theory it would correspond only to disjoint union of subsets. Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as exclusive or, or in set theory terms symmetric difference; this step means that addition is always defined.[40][44]/nIn fact, there is the other possibility, that + should be read as disjunction.[43] This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, in the form of the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation x + x = 0 as implying x = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.[14]/nThe second part of the Laws of Thought contained a corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities. Here the goal was algorithmic: from the given probabilities of any system of events, to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events.[45][20]/nIn late November 1864, Boole walked, in heavy rain, from his home at Lichfield Cottage in Ballintemple[46] to the university, a distance of three miles, and lectured wearing his wet clothes.[47] He soon became ill, developing pneumonia. As his wife believed that remedies should resemble their cause, she wrapped him in wet blankets \u2013 the wet having brought on his illness.[47][48][49]  Boole's condition worsened and on 8 December 1864,[50] he died of fever-induced pleural effusion./nHe was buried in the Church of Ireland cemetery of St Michael's, Church Road, Blackrock (a suburb of Cork). There is a commemorative plaque inside the adjoining church.[51]/nBoole is the namesake of the branch of algebra known as Boolean algebra, as well as the namesake of the lunar crater Boole. The keyword Bool represents a Boolean datatype in many programming languages, though Pascal and Java, among others, both use the full name Boolean.[52] The library, underground lecture theatre complex and the Boole Centre for Research in Informatics[53] at University College Cork are named in his honour. A road called Boole Heights in Bracknell, Berkshire is named after him./nBoole's work was extended and refined by a number of writers, beginning with William Stanley Jevons, who also authored the article about Boole in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Augustus De Morgan had worked on the logic of relations, and Charles Sanders Peirce integrated his work with Boole's during the 1870s.[54] Other significant figures were Platon Sergeevich Poretskii, and William Ernest Johnson. The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a propositional calculus is credited to Hugh MacColl (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson.[54] Surveys of these developments were published by Ernst Schr\u00f6der, Louis Couturat, and Clarence Irving Lewis./nIn 1921, the economist John Maynard Keynes published a book on probability theory, A Treatise of Probability. Keynes believed that Boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis.[55] In his book The Last Challenge Problem, David Miller provides a general method in accord with Boole's system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by Keynes and others. Theodore Hailperin showed much earlier that Boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems.[56]/nBoole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses. Claude Shannon attended a philosophy class at the University of Michigan which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers. Victor Shestakov at Moscow State University (1907\u20131987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than Claude Shannon in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians Sofya Yanovskaya, Gaaze-Rapoport, Roland Dobrushin, Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky, though they presented their academic theses in the same year, 1938.[clarification needed] But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical digital circuit design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the Information Age.[57]/n\"Boole's legacy surrounds us everywhere, in the computers, information storage and retrieval, electronic circuits and controls that support life, learning and communications in the 21st century. His pivotal advances in mathematics, logic and probability provided the essential groundwork for modern mathematics, microelectronic engineering and computer science.\"/n\u2014University College Cork.[4]/nThe year 2015 saw the 200th anniversary of Boole's birth.

Combining his interests in mathematics and theology, he compared the Christian trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with the three dimensions of space, and was attracted to the Hebrew conception of God as an absolute unity. Boole considered converting to Judaism but in the end was said to have chosen Unitarianism.[reference?] Boole came to speak against what he saw as \"prideful\" scepticism, and instead favoured the belief in a \"Supreme Intelligent Cause\".[66] He  also declared \"I firmly believe, for the accomplishment of a purpose of the Divine Mind.\"[67][68] In addition, he stated that he perceived \"teeming evidences of surrounding design\" and concluded that \"the course of this world is not abandoned to chance and inexorable fate.\"[69][70]/nTwo influences on Boole were later claimed by his wife, Mary Everest Boole: a universal mysticism tempered by Jewish thought, and Indian logic.[71] Mary Boole stated that an adolescent mystical experience provided for his life's work:/nMy husband told me that when he was a lad of seventeen a thought struck him suddenly, which became the foundation of all his future discoveries. It was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge [...] For a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of \"the Bible\" as a whole, and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the English Church. But by the help of a learned Jew in Lincoln he found out the true nature of the discovery which had dawned on him. This was that man's mind works by means of some mechanism which \"functions normally towards Monism.\"[72]/nIn Ch. 13 of Laws of Thought Boole used examples of propositions from Baruch Spinoza and Samuel Clarke. The work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion, but they are slight and cryptic.[73] Boole was apparently disconcerted at the book's reception just as a mathematical toolset:/nGeorge afterwards learned, to his great joy, that the same conception of the basis of Logic was held by Leibniz, the contemporary of Newton. De Morgan, of course, understood the formula in its true sense; he was Boole's collaborator all along. Herbert Spencer, Jowett, and Robert Leslie Ellis understood, I feel sure; and a few others, but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored [953] the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind; and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact.[72]/nMary Boole claimed that there was profound influence \u2013 via her uncle George Everest \u2013 of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on George Boole, as well as on Augustus De Morgan and Charles Babbage:[74]/nThink what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830\u201365. What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?[72]/nBoole maintained that:/nNo general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise, not only the special numerical bases of the science, but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning, and which, whatever they may be as to their essence, are at least mathematical as to their form.[75]/nIn 1855, Boole married Mary Everest (niece of George Everest), who later wrote several educational works on her husband's principles./nThe Booles had five daughters:", "19633564": "Mikhail Mikhailovich Postnikov (Russian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u0301\u043b \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u043e\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432; 27 October 1927 \u2013 27 May 2004) was a Soviet mathematician, known for his work in algebraic and differential topology./nHe was born in Shatura, near Moscow.

He was a founding member of the Bourbaki group./nHis father, Abel Chevalley, was a French diplomat who, jointly with his wife Marguerite Chevalley n\u00e9e Sabatier, wrote The Concise Oxford French Dictionary.[1] Chevalley graduated from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1929, where he studied under \u00c9mile Picard. He then spent time at the University of Hamburg, studying under Emil Artin and at the University of Marburg, studying under Helmut Hasse. In Germany, Chevalley discovered Japanese mathematics in the person of Shokichi Iyanaga. Chevalley was awarded a doctorate in 1933 from the University of Paris for a thesis on class field theory./nWhen World War II broke out, Chevalley was at Princeton University. After reporting to the French Embassy, he stayed in the U.S., first at Princeton and then (after 1947) at Columbia University. His American students included Leon Ehrenpreis and Gerhard Hochschild. During his time in the U.S., Chevalley became an American citizen and wrote a substantial part of his lifetime's output in English./nWhen Chevalley applied for a chair at the Sorbonne, the difficulties he encountered were the subject of a polemical piece by his friend and fellow Bourbakiste Andr\u00e9 Weil, titled \"Science Fran\u00e7aise?\" and published in the Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise. Chevalley was the \"professeur B\" of the piece, as confirmed in the endnote to the reprint in Weil's collected works, Oeuvres Scientifiques, tome II. Chevalley eventually did obtain a position in 1957 at the faculty of sciences of the University of Paris and after 1970 at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII./nChevalley had artistic and political interests, and was a minor member of the French non-conformists of the 1930s. The following quote by the co-editor of Chevalley's collected works attests to these interests:/n\"Chevalley was a member of various avant-garde groups, both in politics and in the arts... Mathematics was the most important part of his life, but he did not draw any boundary between his mathematics and the rest of his life.\"[2]/nIn his PhD thesis, Chevalley made an important contribution to the technical development of class field theory, removing a use of L-functions and replacing it by an algebraic method. At that time use of group cohomology was implicit, cloaked by the language of central simple algebras. In the introduction to Andr\u00e9 Weil's Basic Number Theory, Weil attributed the book's adoption of that path to an unpublished manuscript by Chevalley./nAround 1950, Chevalley wrote a three-volume treatment of Lie groups. A few years later, he published the work for which he is best remembered, his investigation into what are now called Chevalley groups. Chevalley groups make up 9 of the 18 families of finite simple groups./nChevalley's accurate discussion of integrality conditions in the Lie algebras of semisimple groups enabled abstracting their theory from the real and complex fields. As a consequence, analogues over finite fields could be defined. This was an essential stage in the evolving classification of finite simple groups. After Chevalley's work, the distinction between \"classical groups\" falling into the Dynkin diagram classification, and sporadic groups which did not, became sharp enough to be useful. What are called 'twisted' groups of the classical families could be fitted into the picture./n\"Chevalley's theorem\" (also called the Chevalley\u2013Warning theorem) usually refers to his result on the solubility of equations over a finite field. Another theorem of his concerns the constructible sets in algebraic geometry, i.e. those in the Boolean algebra generated by the Zariski-open and Zariski-closed sets. It states that the image of such a set by a morphism of algebraic varieties is of the same type. Logicians call this an elimination of quantifiers./nIn the 1950s, Chevalley led some Paris seminars of major importance: the S\u00e9minaire Cartan\u2013Chevalley of the academic year 1955-6, with Henri Cartan and the S\u00e9minaire Chevalley of 1956-7 and 1957-8. These dealt with topics on algebraic groups and the foundations of algebraic geometry, as well as pure abstract algebra.  The Cartan\u2013Chevalley seminar was the genesis of scheme theory, but its subsequent development in the hands of Alexander Grothendieck was so rapid, thorough and inclusive that its historical tracks can appear well covered.

She was a prominent thinker in Alexandria where she taught philosophy and astronomy.[5] Although preceded by Pandrosion, another Alexandrine female mathematician,[6] she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.[7] Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of Ptolemy's Almagest, based on the title of her father Theon's commentary on Book III of the Almagest./nHypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. She was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.[8][9]/nHypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a \"martyr for philosophy\", leading future Neoplatonists such as the  historian Damascius (c.\u2009458\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009538) to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as \"the last of the Hellenes\". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women's rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.[10]/nHypatia was the daughter of the mathematician Theon of Alexandria (c.\u2009335\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009405 AD).[14][15][16] According to classical historian Edward J. Watts, Theon was the head of a school called the \"Mouseion\", which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion,[15] whose membership had ceased in the 260s AD.[17] Theon's school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Theon rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, Plotinian Neoplatonism.[18] Although he was widely seen as a great mathematician at the time,[11][13][19] Theon's mathematical work has been deemed by modern standards as essentially \"minor\",[11] \"trivial\",[13] and \"completely unoriginal\".[19] His primary achievement was the production of a new edition of Euclid's Elements, in which he corrected scribal errors that had been made over the course of nearly 700 years of copying.[11][12][13] Theon's edition of Euclid's Elements became the most widely used edition of the textbook for centuries[12][20] and almost totally supplanted all other editions.[20]/nNothing is known about Hypatia's mother, who is never mentioned in any of the extant sources.[21][22][23] Theon dedicates his commentary on Book IV of Ptolemy's Almagest to an individual named Epiphanius, addressing him as \"my dear son\",[24][25] indicating that he may have been Hypatia's brother,[24] but the Greek word Theon uses (teknon) does not always mean \"son\" in the biological sense and was often used merely to signal strong feelings of paternal connection.[24][25] Hypatia's exact year of birth is still under debate, with suggested dates ranging from 350 to 370 AD.[26][27][28] Many scholars have followed Richard Hoche in inferring that Hypatia was born around 370. According to Damascius's lost work Life of Isidore, preserved in the entry for Hypatia in the Suda, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, Hypatia flourished during the reign of Arcadius. Hoche reasoned that Damascius's description of her physical beauty would imply that she was at most 30 at that time, and the year 370 was 30 years prior to the midpoint of Arcadius's reign.[29][30] In contrast, theories that she was born as early as 350 are based on the wording of the chronicler John Malalas (c.\u2009491 \u2013 578), who calls her old at the time of her death in 415.[28][31] Robert Penella argues that both theories are weakly based, and that her birth date should be left unspecified.[29]/nHypatia was a Neoplatonist, but, like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus.[18] The Alexandrian school was renowned at the time for its philosophy, and Alexandria was regarded as second only to Athens as the philosophical capital of the Greco-Roman world.[26] Hypatia taught students from all over the Mediterranean.[32] According to Damascius, she lectured on the writings of Plato and Aristotle.[33][34][35][36] He also states that she walked through Alexandria in a tribon, a kind of cloak associated with philosophers, giving impromptu public lectures.[37][38][39]/nAccording to Watts, two main varieties of Neoplatonism were taught in Alexandria during the late fourth century. The first was the overtly pagan religious Neoplatonism taught at the Serapeum, which was greatly influenced by the teachings of Iamblichus.[40] The second variety was the more moderate and less polemical variety championed by Hypatia and her father Theon, which was based on the teachings of Plotinus.[41] Although Hypatia herself was a pagan, she was tolerant of Christians.[42][43] In fact, every one of her known students was Christian.[44] One of her most prominent pupils was Synesius of Cyrene,[26][45][46][47] who went on to become a bishop of Ptolemais (now in eastern Libya) in 410.[47][48] Afterward, he continued to exchange letters with Hypatia[46][47][49] and his extant letters are the main sources of information about her career.[46][47][50][51][52] Seven letters by Synesius to Hypatia have survived,[46][47] but none from her addressed to him are extant.[47] In a letter written in around 395 to his friend Herculianus, Synesius describes Hypatia as \"... a person so renowned, her reputation seemed literally incredible. We have seen and heard for ourselves she who honorably presides over the mysteries of philosophy.\"[46] Synesius preserves the legacy of Hypatia's opinions and teachings, such as the pursuit of \"the philosophical state of apatheia\u2014complete liberation from emotions and affections\".[53]/nThe Christian historian Socrates of Constantinople, a contemporary of Hypatia, describes her in his Ecclesiastical History:[21]/nThere was a woman at Alexandria named Hypatia, daughter of the philosopher Theon, who made such attainments in literature and science, as to far surpass all the philosophers of her own time. Having succeeded to the school of Plato and Plotinus, she explained the principles of philosophy to her auditors, many of whom came from a distance to receive her instructions. On account of the self-possession and ease of manner which she had acquired in consequence of the cultivation of her mind, she not infrequently appeared in public in the presence of the magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in going to an assembly of men. For all men on account of her extraordinary dignity and virtue admired her the more.[33]/nPhilostorgius, another Christian historian, who was also a contemporary of Hypatia, states that she excelled her father in mathematics[46] and the lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria records that, like her father, she was also an extraordinarily talented astronomer.[46][54] Damascius writes that Hypatia was \"exceedingly beautiful and fair of form\",[55][56] but nothing else is known regarding her physical appearance[57] and no ancient depictions of her have survived.[58] Damascius states that Hypatia remained a lifelong virgin[59][60] and that, when one of the men who came to her lectures tried to court her, she tried to soothe his lust by playing the lyre.[56][61][b] When he refused to abandon his pursuit, she rejected him outright,[56][61][63] displaying her bloody menstrual rags and declaring \"This is what you really love, my young man, but you do not love beauty for its own sake.\"[34][56][61][63] Damascius further relates that the young man was so traumatized that he abandoned his desires for her immediately.[56][61][63]/nFrom 382 \u2013 412, the bishop of Alexandria was Theophilus.[65] Theophilus was militantly opposed to Iamblichean Neoplatonism[65] and, in 391, he demolished the Serapeum.[66][67] Despite this, Theophilus tolerated Hypatia's school and seems to have regarded Hypatia as his ally.[21][65][68] Theophilus supported the bishopric of Hypatia's pupil Synesius,[21][69] who describes Theophilus in his letters with love and admiration.[68][70] Theophilus also permitted Hypatia herself to establish close relationships with the Roman prefects and other prominent political leaders.[65] Partly as a result of Theophilus's tolerance, Hypatia became extremely popular with the people of Alexandria and exerted profound political influence.[71]/nTheophilus died unexpectedly in 412.[65] He had been training his nephew Cyril, but had not officially named him as his successor.[72] A violent power struggle over the diocese broke out between Cyril and his rival Timothy. Cyril won and immediately began to punish those who had supported Timothy; he closed the churches of the Novatianists, who had supported Timothy, and confiscated their property.[73] Hypatia's school seems to have immediately taken a strong distrust towards the new bishop,[68][70] as evidenced by the fact that, in all his vast correspondences, Synesius only ever wrote one letter to Cyril, in which he treats the younger bishop as inexperienced and misguided.[70] In a letter written to Hypatia in 413, Synesius requests her to intercede on behalf of two individuals impacted by the ongoing civil strife in Alexandria,[74][75][76] insisting, \"You always have power, and you can bring about good by using that power.\"[74] He also reminds her that she had taught him that a Neoplatonic philosopher must introduce the highest moral standards to political life and act for the benefit of their fellow citizens.[74]/nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus, in 414, following an exchange of hostilities and a Jewish-led massacre, Cyril closed all the synagogues in Alexandria, confiscated all the property belonging to the Jews, and expelled a number of Jews from the city; Scholasticus suggests all the Jews were expelled, while John of Nikiu notes it was only those involved in the massacre.[77][78][73] Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was also a close friend of Hypatia[21] and a recent convert to Christianity,[21][79][80] was outraged by Cyril's actions and sent a scathing report to the emperor.[21][73][81] The conflict escalated and a riot broke out in which the parabalani, a group of Christian clerics under Cyril's authority, nearly killed Orestes.[73] As punishment, Orestes had Ammonius, the monk who had started the riot, publicly tortured to death.[73][82][83] Cyril tried to proclaim Ammonius a martyr,[73][82][84] but Christians in Alexandria were disgusted,[82][85] since Ammonius had been killed for inciting a riot and attempting to murder the governor, not for his faith.[82] Prominent Alexandrian Christians intervened and forced Cyril to drop the matter.[73][82][85] Nonetheless, Cyril's feud with Orestes continued.[86] Orestes frequently consulted Hypatia for advice[87][88] because she was well-liked among both pagans and Christians alike, she had not been involved in any previous stages of the conflict, and she had an impeccable reputation as a wise counselor.[89]/nDespite Hypatia's popularity, Cyril and his allies attempted to discredit her and undermine her reputation.[90][91] Socrates Scholasticus mentions rumors accusing Hypatia of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril.[88][91] Traces of other rumors that spread among the Christian populace of Alexandria may be found in the writings of the seventh-century Egyptian Coptic bishop John of Niki\u00fb,[40][91] who alleges in his Chronicle that Hypatia had engaged in satanic practices and had intentionally hampered the church's influence over Orestes:[91][92][93][94]/nAnd in those days there appeared in Alexandria a female philosopher, a pagan named Hypatia, and she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through her Satanic wiles. And the governor of the city honoured her exceedingly; for she had beguiled him through her magic. And he ceased attending church as had been his custom... And he not only did this, but he drew many believers to her, and he himself received the unbelievers at his house.[92]/nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus, during the Christian season of Lent in March 415, a mob of Christians under the leadership of a lector named Peter, raided Hypatia's carriage as she was travelling home.[95][96][97] They dragged her into a building known as the Kaisarion, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church.[89][95][97] There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using ostraka,[95][98][99][100] which can either be translated as \"roof tiles\" or \"oyster shells\".[95] Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs.[101] They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire.[95][101][100] According to Watts, this was in line with the traditional manner in which Alexandrians carried the bodies of the \"vilest criminals\" outside the city limits to cremate them as a way of symbolically purifying the city.[101][102] Although Socrates Scholasticus never explicitly identifies Hypatia's murderers, they are commonly assumed to have been members of the parabalani.[103] Christopher Haas disputes this identification, arguing that the murderers were more likely \"a crowd of Alexandrian laymen\".[104]/nSocrates Scholasticus presents Hypatia's murder as entirely politically motivated and makes no mention of any role that Hypatia's paganism might have played in her death.[105] Instead, he reasons that \"she fell a victim to the political jealousy which at that time prevailed. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop.\"[95][106] Socrates Scholasticus unequivocally condemns the actions of the mob, declaring, \"Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.\"[95][102][107]/nThe Canadian mathematician Ari Belenkiy has argued that Hypatia may have been involved in a controversy over the date of the Christian holiday of Easter 417 and that she was killed on the vernal equinox while making astronomical observations.[108] Classical scholars Alan Cameron and Edward J. Watts both dismiss this hypothesis, noting that there is absolutely no evidence in any ancient text to support any part of the hypothesis.[109][110]/nHypatia's death sent shockwaves throughout the empire;[40][111] for centuries, philosophers had been seen as effectively untouchable during the displays of public violence that sometimes occurred in Roman cities and the murder of a female philosopher at the hand of a mob was seen as \"profoundly dangerous and destabilizing\".[111] Although no concrete evidence was ever discovered definitively linking Cyril to the murder of Hypatia,[40] it was widely believed that he had ordered it.[40][88] Even if Cyril had not directly ordered the murder himself, his smear campaign against Hypatia had inspired it. The Alexandrian council was alarmed at Cyril's conduct and sent an embassy to Constantinople.[40] The advisors of Theodosius II launched an investigation to determine Cyril's role in the murder.[107]/nThe investigation resulted in the emperors Honorius and Theodosius II issuing an edict in autumn of 416, which attempted to remove the parabalani from Cyril's power and instead place them under the authority of Orestes.[40][107][112][113] The edict restricted the parabalani from attending \"any public spectacle whatever\" or entering \"the meeting place of a municipal council or a courtroom.\"[114] It also severely restricted their recruitment by limiting the total number of parabalani to no more than five hundred.[113] According to Damascius, Cyril himself allegedly only managed to escape even more serious punishment by bribing one of Theodosius's officials.[107] Watts argues that Hypatia's murder was the turning point in Cyril's fight to gain political control of Alexandria.[115] Hypatia had been the linchpin holding Orestes's opposition against Cyril together, and, without her, the opposition quickly collapsed.[40] Two years later, Cyril overturned the law placing the parabalani under Orestes's control and, by the early 420s, Cyril had come to dominate the Alexandrian council.[115]/nHypatia has been described as a universal genius,[116] but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator.[117][118][21][119] No evidence has been found that Hypatia ever published any independent works on philosophy[120] and she does not appear to have made any groundbreaking mathematical discoveries.[117][118][21][119] During Hypatia's time period, scholars preserved classical mathematical works and commented on them to develop their arguments, rather than publishing original works.[117][121][122] It has also been suggested that the closure of the Mouseion and the destruction of the Serapeum may have led Hypatia and her father to focus their efforts on preserving seminal mathematical books and making them accessible to their students.[120] The Suda mistakenly states that all of Hypatia's writings have been lost,[123] but modern scholarship has identified several works by her as extant.[123] This kind of authorial uncertainty is typical of female philosophers from antiquity.[124] Hypatia wrote in Greek, which was the language spoken by most educated people in the Eastern Mediterranean at the time.[26] In classical antiquity, astronomy was seen as being essentially mathematical in character.[125] Furthermore, no distinction was made between mathematics and numerology or astronomy and astrology.[125]/nHypatia is now known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy's Almagest.[126][127][128] It was once thought that Hypatia had merely revised Theon's commentary on the Almagest,[130] based on the title of Theon's commentary on the third book of Almagest, which reads \"Commentary by Theon of Alexandria on Book III of Ptolemy's Almagest, edition revised by my daughter Hypatia, the philosopher\",[130][131] but, based on analysis of the titles of Theon's other commentaries and similar titles from the time period, scholars have concluded that Hypatia corrected, not her father's commentary, but the text of Almagest itself.[130][132] Her contribution is thought to be an improved method for the long division algorithms needed for astronomical computation. The Ptolemaic model of the universe was geocentric, meaning it taught that the Sun revolved around the Earth. In the Almagest, Ptolemy proposed a division problem for calculating the number of degrees swept out by the Sun in a single day as it orbits the Earth. In his early commentary, Theon had tried to improve upon Ptolemy's division calculation. In the text edited by Hypatia, a tabular method is detailed.[129] This tabular method might be the \"astronomical table\" which historic sources attribute to Hypatia.[129] Classicist Alan Cameron additionally states that it is possible Hypatia may have edited, not only Book III, but all nine extant books of the Almagest.[127]/nHypatia wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica, which had been written sometime around the year 250 AD.[19][34][135][136] It set out more than 100 mathematical problems, for which solutions are proposed using algebra.[137] For centuries, scholars believed that this commentary had been lost.[123] Only volumes one through six of the Arithmetica have survived in the original Greek,[19][138][134] but at least four additional volumes have been preserved in an Arabic translation produced around the year 860.[19][136] The Arabic text contains numerous expansions not found in the Greek text,[19][136] including verifications of Diophantus's examples and additional problems.[19]/nCameron states that the most likely source of the additional material is Hypatia herself, since Hypatia is the only ancient writer known to have written a commentary on the Arithmetica and the additions appear to follow the same methods used by her father Theon.[19] The first person to deduce that the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts came from Hypatia was the nineteenth-century scholar Paul Tannery.[133][139] In 1885, Sir Thomas Heath published the first English translation of the surviving portion of the Arithmetica. Heath argued that surviving text of Arithmetica is actually a school edition produced by Hypatia to aid her students.[138] According to Mary Ellen Waithe, Hypatia used an unusual algorithm for division (in the then-standard sexagesimal numeral system), making it easy for scholars to pick out which parts of the text she had written.[133]/nThe consensus that Hypatia's commentary is the source of the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts of the Arithmetica has been challenged by Wilbur Knorr, a historian of mathematics, who argues that the interpolations are \"of such low level as not to require any real mathematical insight\" and that the author of the interpolations can only have been \"an essentially trivial mind... in direct conflict with ancient testimonies of Hypatia's high caliber as a philosopher and mathematician.\"[19] Cameron rejects this argument, noting that \"Theon too enjoyed a high reputation, yet his surviving work has been judged 'completely unoriginal.'\"[19] Cameron also insists that \"Hypatia's work on Diophantus was what we today might call a school edition, designed for the use of students rather than professional mathematicians.\"[19]/nHypatia also wrote a commentary on Apollonius of Perga's work on conic sections,[34][133][134] but this commentary is no longer extant.[133][134] She also created an \"Astronomical Canon\";[34] this is believed to have been either a new edition of the Handy Tables by the Alexandrian Ptolemy or the aforementioned commentary on his Almagest.[140][141][142] Based on a close reading in comparison with her supposed contributions to the work of Diophantus, Knorr suggests that Hypatia may also have edited Archimedes' Measurement of a Circle, an anonymous text on isometric figures, and a text later used by John of Tynemouth in his work on Archimedes' measurement of the sphere.[143] A high degree of mathematical accomplishment would have been needed to comment on Apollonius's advanced mathematics or the astronomical Canon. Because of this, most scholars today recognize that Hypatia must have been among the leading mathematicians of her day.[117]/nOne of Synesius's letters describes Hypatia as having taught him how to construct a silver plane astrolabe as a gift for an official.[52][144][145][146] An astrolabe is a device used to calculate date and time based on the positions of the stars and planets. It can also be used to predict where the stars and planets will be on any given date.[144][147][148] A \"little astrolabe\", or \"plane astrolabe\", is a kind of astrolabe that used stereographic projection of the celestial sphere to represent the heavens on a plane surface, as opposed to an armillary sphere, which was globe-shaped.[129][147] Armillary spheres were large and normally used for display, whereas a plane astrolabe was portable and could be used for practical measurements.[147]/nThe statement from Synesius's letter has sometimes been wrongly interpreted to mean that Hypatia invented the plane astrolabe herself,[37][149] but the plane astrolabe was in use at least 500 years before Hypatia was born.[52][144][149][150] Hypatia may have learned how to construct a plane astrolabe from her father Theon,[129][145][147] who had written two treatises on astrolabes: one entitled Memoirs on the Little Astrolabe and another study on the armillary sphere in Ptolemy's Almagest.[147] Theon's treatise is now lost, but it was well known to the Syrian bishop Severus Sebokht (575\u2013667), who describes its contents in his own treatise on astrolabes.[147][151] Hypatia and Theon may have also studied Ptolemy's Planisphaerium, which describes the calculations necessary in order to construct an astrolabe.[152] Synesius's wording indicates that Hypatia did not design or construct the astrolabe herself, but acted as a guide and mentor during the process of constructing it.[13]/nIn another letter, Synesius requests Hypatia to construct him a \"hydroscope\", a device now known as a hydrometer, to determine the density or specific gravity of liquids.[145][149][153][154] Based on this request, it has been claimed that Hypatia invented the hydrometer herself.[149][155] The minute detail in which Synesius describes the instrument, however, indicates that he assumes she has never heard of the device,[156][157] but trusts she will be able to replicate it based on a verbal description. Hydrometers were based on Archimedes' 3rd century BC principles, may have been invented by him, and were being described by the 2nd century AD in a poem by the Roman author Remnius.[158][159][160] Although modern authors frequently credit Hypatia with having developed a variety of other inventions, these other attributions may all be discounted as spurious.[156] Booth concludes, \"The modern day reputation held by Hypatia as a philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, and mechanical inventor, is disproportionate to the amount of surviving evidence of her life's work. This reputation is either built on myth or hearsay as opposed to evidence. Either that or we are missing all of the evidence that would support it.\"[155]/nNeoplatonism and paganism both survived for centuries after Hypatia's death,[161][162] and new academic lecture halls continued to be built in Alexandria after her death.[163] Over the next 200 years, Neoplatonist philosophers such as Hierocles of Alexandria, John Philoponus, Simplicius of Cilicia, and Olympiodorus the Younger made astronomical observations, taught mathematics, and wrote lengthy commentaries on the works of Plato and Aristotle.[161][162] Hypatia was not the last female Neoplatonist philosopher; later ones include Aedesia, Asclepigenia, and Theodora of Emesa.[163]/nAccording to Watts, however, Hypatia had no appointed successor, no spouse, and no offspring[107][164] and her sudden death not only left her legacy unprotected, but also triggered a backlash against her entire ideology.[165] Hypatia, with her tolerance towards Christian students and her willingness to cooperate with Christian leaders, had hoped to establish a precedent that Neoplatonism and Christianity could coexist peacefully and cooperatively. Instead, her death and the subsequent failure by the Christian government to impose justice on her killers destroyed that notion entirely and led future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to consider Christian bishops as \"dangerous, jealous figures who were also utterly unphilosophical.\"[166] Hypatia became seen as a \"martyr for philosophy\",[166] and her murder led philosophers to adopt attitudes that increasingly emphasized the pagan aspects of their beliefs system[167] and helped create a sense of identity for philosophers as pagan traditionalists set apart from the Christian masses.[168] Thus, while Hypatia's death did not bring an end to Neoplatonist philosophy as a whole, Watts argues that it did bring an end to her particular variety of it.[169]/nShortly after Hypatia's murder, a forged anti-Christian letter appeared under her name.[170] Damascius was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers.[171][172] A passage from Damascius's Life of Isidore, preserved in the Suda, concludes that Hypatia's murder was due to Cyril's envy over \"her wisdom exceeding all bounds and especially in the things concerning astronomy\".[173][174] Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril.[174] At the same time, Damascius was not entirely kind to Hypatia either; he characterizes her as nothing more than a wandering Cynic,[175][176] and compares her unfavorably with his own teacher Isidore of Alexandria,[175][176][177] remarking that \"Isidorus greatly outshone Hypatia, not just as a man does over a woman, but in the way a genuine philosopher will over a mere geometer.\"[178]/nHypatia's death was similar to those of Christian martyrs in Alexandria, who had been dragged through the streets during the Decian persecution in 250.[182][183][184] Other aspects of Hypatia's life also fit the mold for a Christian martyr, especially her lifelong virginity.[179][185] In the Early Middle Ages, Christians conflated Hypatia's death with stories of the Decian martyrs[179][185] and she became part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a virgin martyr said to have been exceedingly wise and well-educated.[179][180][181] The earliest attestation for the cult of Saint Catherine comes from the eighth century, around three hundred years after Hypatia's death.[186] One story tells of Saint Catherine being confronted by fifty pagan philosophers seeking to convert her,[181][187] but instead converting all of them to Christianity through her eloquence.[179][181] Another legend claimed that Saint Catherine had been a student of Athanasius of Alexandria.[183] In the Laodikeia of Asia Minor (today Denizli in Turkey) until late 19th century Hypatia was venerated as identical to St. Catherine.[188][189]/nThe Byzantine Suda encyclopedia contains a very long entry about Hypatia, which summarizes two different accounts of her life.[190] The first eleven lines come from one source and the rest of the entry comes from Damascius's Life of Isidore. Most of the first eleven lines of the entry probably come from Hesychius's Onomatologos,[191] but some parts are of unknown origin, including a claim that she was \"the wife of Isidore the Philosopher\" (apparently Isidore of Alexandria).[34][191][192] Watts describes this as a very puzzling claim, not only because Isidore of Alexandria was not born until long after Hypatia's death, and no other philosopher of that name contemporary with Hypatia is known,[193][194][195] but also because it contradicts Damascius's own statement quoted in the same entry about Hypatia being a lifelong virgin.[193] Watts suggests that someone probably misunderstood the meaning of the word gyn\u0113 used by Damascius to describe Hypatia in his Life of Isidore, since the same word can mean either \"woman\" or \"wife\".[196]/nThe Byzantine and Christian intellectual Photios (c. 810/820\u2013893) includes both Damascius's account of Hypatia and Socrates Scholasticus's in his Bibliotheke.[196] In his own comments, Photios remarks on Hypatia's great fame as a scholar, but does not mention her death, perhaps indicating that he saw her scholarly work as more significant.[197] The intellectual Eudokia Makrembolitissa (1021\u20131096), the second wife of Byzantine emperor Constantine X Doukas, was described by the historian Nicephorus Gregoras as a \"second Hypatia\".[198]/nEarly eighteenth-century Deist scholar John Toland used the murder of Hypatia as the basis for an anti-Catholic tract,[199][200][201] portraying Hypatia's death in the worst possible light by changing the story and inventing elements not found in any of the ancient sources.[199][200] A 1721 response by Thomas Lewis defended Cyril,[199][202] rejected Damascius's account as unreliable because its author was \"a heathen\"[202] and argued that Socrates Scholasticus was \"a Puritan\", who was consistently biased against Cyril.[202]/nVoltaire, in his Examen important de Milord Bolingbroke ou le tombeau de fanatisme (1736) interpreted Hypatia as a believer in \"the laws of rational Nature\" and \"the capacities of the human mind free of dogmas\"[117][199] and described her death as \"a bestial murder perpetrated by Cyril's tonsured hounds, with a fanatical gang at their heels\".[199] Later, in an entry for his Dictionnaire philosophique (1772), Voltaire again portrayed Hypatia as a freethinking deistic genius brutally murdered by ignorant and misunderstanding Christians.[117][203][204] Most of the entry ignores Hypatia herself altogether and instead deals with the controversy over whether or not Cyril was responsible for her death.[204] Voltaire concludes with the snide remark that \"When one strips beautiful women naked, it is not to massacre them.\"[203][204]/nIn his monumental work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the English historian Edward Gibbon expanded on Toland and Voltaire's misleading portrayals by declaring Cyril as the sole cause of all evil in Alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century[203] and construing Hypatia's murder as evidence to support his thesis that the rise of Christianity hastened the decline of the Roman Empire.[205] He remarks on Cyril's continued veneration as a Christian saint, commenting that \"superstition [Christianity] perhaps would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin, than the banishment of a saint.\"[206] In response to these accusations, Catholic authors, as well as some French Protestants, insisted with increased vehemence that Cyril had absolutely no involvement in Hypatia's murder and that Peter the Lector was solely responsible. In the course of these heated debates, Hypatia herself tended to be cast aside and ignored, while the debates focused far more intently on the question of whether Peter the Lector had acted alone or under Cyril's orders.[204]/nIn the nineteenth century European literary authors spun the legend of Hypatia as part of neo-Hellenism, a movement that romanticised ancient Greeks and their values.[117] Interest in the \"literary legend of Hypatia\" began to rise.[203] Diodata Saluzzo Roero's 1827 Ipazia ovvero delle Filosofie suggested that Cyril had actually converted Hypatia to Christianity, and that she had been killed by a \"treacherous\" priest.[208]/nIn his 1852 Hypatie and 1857 Hypathie et Cyrille, French poet Charles Leconte de Lisle portrayed Hypatia as the epitome of \"vulnerable truth and beauty\".[211] Leconte de Lisle's first poem portrayed Hypatia as a woman born after her time, a victim of the laws of history.[206][212] His second poem reverted to the eighteenth-century Deistic portrayal of Hypatia as the victim of Christian brutality,[210][213] but with the twist that Hypatia tries and fails to convince Cyril that Neoplatonism and Christianity are actually fundamentally the same.[210][214] Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia; Or, New Foes with an Old Face was originally intended as a historical treatise, but instead became a typical mid-Victorian romance with a militantly anti-Catholic message,[215][216] portraying Hypatia as a \"helpless, pretentious, and erotic heroine\"[217] with the \"spirit of Plato and the body of Aphrodite.\"[218]/nKingsley's novel was tremendously popular;[219][220] it was translated into several European languages[220][221] and remained continuously in print for the rest of the century.[221] It promoted the romantic vision of Hypatia as \"the last of the Hellenes\"[220] and was quickly adapted into a broad variety of stage productions, the first of which was a play written by Elizabeth Bowers, performed in Philadelphia in 1859, starring the writer herself in the titular role.[221] On 2 January 1893, a much higher-profile stage play adaptation Hypatia, written by G. Stuart Ogilvie and produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London. The title role was initially played by Julia Neilson, and it featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry.[222][223] The novel also spawned works of visual art,[207] including an 1867 image portraying Hypatia as a young woman by the early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron[207][224] and an 1885 painting by Charles William Mitchell showing a nude Hypatia standing before an altar in a church.[207]/nAt the same time, European philosophers and scientists described Hypatia as the last representative of science and free inquiry before a \"long medieval decline\".[117] In 1843, German authors Soldan and Heppe argued in their highly influential History of the Witchcraft Trials that Hypatia may have been, in effect, the first famous \"witch\" punished under Christian authority (see witch-hunt).[225]/nHypatia was honored as an astronomer when 238 Hypatia, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1884, was named for her. The lunar crater Hypatia was also named for her, in addition to craters named for her father Theon. The 180\u00a0km Rimae Hypatia are located north of the crater, one degree south of the equator, along the Mare Tranquillitatis.[226]/nIn 1908, American writer Elbert Hubbard published a putative biography of Hypatia in his series Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Teachers. The book is almost entirely a work of fiction.[228][231] In it, Hubbard relates a completely made-up physical exercise program which he claims Theon established for his daughter, involving \"fishing, horseback-riding, and rowing\".[232] He claims that Theon taught Hypatia to \"Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than to never think at all.\"[232] Hubbard claims that, as a young woman, Hypatia traveled to Athens, where she studied under Plutarch of Athens. All of this supposed biographical information, however, is completely fictional and is not found in any ancient source. Hubbard even attributes to Hypatia numerous completely fabricated quotations in which she presents modern, rationalist views.[232] The cover illustration for the book, a drawing of Hypatia by artist Jules Maurice Gaspard showing her as a beautiful young woman with her wavy hair tied back in the classical style, has now become the most iconic and widely reproduced image of her.[228][229][230]/nAround the same time, Hypatia was adopted by feminists, and her life and death began to be viewed in the light of the women's rights movement.[233] The author Carlo Pascal claimed in 1908 that her murder was an anti-feminist act and brought about a change in the treatment of women, as well as the decline of the Mediterranean civilization in general.[234] Dora Russell published a book on the inadequate education of women and inequality with the title Hypatia or Woman and Knowledge in 1925.[235] The prologue explains why she chose the title:[235] \"Hypatia was a university lecturer denounced by Church dignitaries and torn to pieces by Christians. Such will probably be the fate of this book.\"[226] Hypatia's death became symbolic for some historians. For example, Kathleen Wider proposes that the murder of Hypatia marked the end of Classical antiquity,[236] and Stephen Greenblatt writes that her murder \"effectively marked the downfall of Alexandrian intellectual life\".[237] On the other hand, Christian Wildberg notes that Hellenistic philosophy continued to flourish in the 5th and 6th centuries, and perhaps until the age of Justinian I.[238][239]/nFables should be taught as fables, myths as myths, and miracles as poetic fantasies. To teach superstitions as truths is a most terrible thing. The child mind accepts and believes them, and only through great pain and perhaps tragedy can he be in after years relieved of them. In fact, men will fight for a superstition quite as quickly as for a living truth\u2013often more so, since a superstition is so intangible you can not get at it to refute it, but truth is a point of view, and so is changeable./nFalsehoods and misconceptions about Hypatia continued to proliferate throughout the late twentieth century.[231] Though Hubbard's fictional biography may have been intended for children,[229] Lynn M. Osen relied on it as her main source in her influential 1974 article on Hypatia in her 1974 book Women in Mathematics.[231] Fordham University used Hubbard's biography as the main source of information about Hypatia in a medieval history course.[228][231] Carl Sagan's 1980 PBS series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage relates a heavily fictionalized retelling of Hypatia's death, which results in the \"Great Library of Alexandria\" being burned by militant Christians.[149] In actuality, though Christians led by Theophilus did destroy the Serapeum in 391 AD, the Library of Alexandria had already ceased to exist in any recognizable form centuries prior to Hypatia's birth.[10] As a female intellectual, Hypatia became a role model for modern intelligent women and two feminist journals were named after her: the Greek journal Hypatia: Feminist Studies was launched in Athens in 1984, and Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy in the United States in 1986.[233] In the United Kingdom, the Hypatia Trust maintains a library and archive of feminine literary, artistic and scientific work; and, sponsors the Hypatia-in-the-Woods women's retreat in Washington, United States.[226]/nJudy Chicago's large-scale art piece The Dinner Party awards Hypatia a table setting.[240][241] The table runner depicts Hellenistic goddesses weeping over her death.[234] Chicago states that the social unrest leading to Hypatia's murder resulted from Roman patriarchy and mistreatment of women and that this ongoing unrest can only be brought to an end through the restoration of an original, primeval matriarchy.[242] She (anachronistically and incorrectly) concludes that Hypatia's writings were burned in the Library of Alexandria when it was destroyed.[234] Major works of twentieth century literature contain references to Hypatia,[243] including Marcel Proust's volume \"Within a Budding Grove\" from In Search of Lost Time, and Iain Pears's The Dream of Scipio.[216]/nHypatia has continued to be a popular subject in both fiction and nonfiction by authors in many countries and languages.[244] In 2015, the planet designated Iota Draconis b was named after Hypatia.[245]/nIn Umberto Eco's 2002 novel Baudolino, the hero's love interest is a half-satyr, half-woman descendant of a female-only community of Hypatia's disciples, collectively known as \"hypatias\".[246] Charlotte Kramer's 2006 novel Holy Murder: the Death of Hypatia of Alexandria portrays Cyril as an archetypal villain, while Hypatia is described as brilliant, beloved, and more knowledgeable of scripture than Cyril.[247] Ki Longfellow's novel Flow Down Like Silver (2009) invents an elaborate backstory for why Hypatia first started teaching.[248] Youssef Ziedan's novel Azazeel (2012) describes Hypatia's murder through the eyes of a witness.[249] Bruce MacLennan's 2013 book The Wisdom of Hypatia presents Hypatia as a guide who introduces Neoplatonic philosophy and exercises for modern life.[250] In The Plot to Save Socrates (2006) by Paul Levinson and its sequels, Hypatia is a time-traveler from the twenty-first century United States.[251][252][253] In the TV series The Good Place, Hypatia is played by Lisa Kudrow as one of the few ancient philosophers eligible for heaven, by not having defended slavery.[254]/nThe 2009 film Agora, directed by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar and starring Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, is a heavily fictionalized dramatization of Hypatia's final years.[10][255][256] The film, which was intended to criticize contemporary Christian fundamentalism,[257] has had wide-ranging impact on the popular conception of Hypatia.[255] It emphasizes Hypatia's astronomical and mechanical studies rather than her philosophy, portraying her as \"less Plato than Copernicus\",[255] and emphasizes the restrictions imposed on women by the early Christian church,[258] including depictions of Hypatia being sexually assaulted by one of her father's Christian slaves,[259] and of Cyril reading from 1 Timothy 2:8\u201312 forbidding women from teaching.[259][260] The film contains numerous historical inaccuracies:[10][259][261] It inflates Hypatia's achievements[149][261] and incorrectly portrays her as finding a proof of Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric model of the universe, which there is no evidence that Hypatia ever studied.[149][262] It also contains a scene based on Carl Sagan's Cosmos in which Christians raid the Serapeum and burn all of its scrolls, leaving the building itself largely intact. In reality, the Serapeum probably did not have any scrolls in it at that time,[c] and the building was demolished in 391 AD.[10] The film also implies that Hypatia is an atheist, directly contradictory to the surviving sources, which all portray her as following the teachings of Plotinus that the goal of philosophy was \"a mystical union with the divine.\"[149]", "64525807": "Oscar Carruth McGehee (cited as O.

He was initially assigned to Naval Enigma in Hut 8. Hilton commented on his experience working with Alan Turing, whom he knew well for the last 12 years of his life, in his \"Reminiscences of Bletchley Park\" from A Century of Mathematics in America:[12]/nIt is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement./nHilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets (UK Station X, Channel 4, 1999).[13]/nIn late 1942, Hilton transferred to work on German teleprinter ciphers.[10] A special section known as the \"Testery\" had been formed in July 1942 to work on one such cipher, codenamed \"Tunny\", and Hilton was one of the early members of the group.[14] His role was to devise ways to deal with changes in Tunny, and to liaise with another section working on Tunny, the \"Newmanry\", which complemented the hand-methods of the Testery with specialised codebreaking machinery.[14] Hilton has been counted as a member of the Newmanry, possibly on a part-time basis.[15]/nA convivial pub drinker at Bletchley Park, Hilton also spent time with Turing working on chess problems and palindromes.[16] He there constructed a 51-letter palindrome:[17]/n\"Doc note, I dissent.

He was continued 7 December 1610 but resigned some time before 1614, when the name of William Smith appears as minister of the parish.

He received a degree in mathematics, physics, and philosophy from the University of Debrecen in 1944. In March 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary, and Lakatos along with \u00c9va R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, formed soon after that event a Marxist resistance group. In May of that year, the group was joined by \u00c9va Izs\u00e1k, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist. Lakatos, considering that there was a risk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, decided that her duty to the group was to commit suicide. Subsequently, a member of the group took her to Debrecen and gave her cyanide.[7]/nDuring the occupation, Lakatos avoided Nazi persecution of Jews by changing his surname to Moln\u00e1r.[8]  His mother and grandmother were murdered in Auschwitz. He changed his surname once again to Lakatos (Locksmith) in honor of G\u00e9za Lakatos./nAfter the war, from 1947, he worked as a senior official in the Hungarian ministry of education. He also continued his education with a PhD at Debrecen University awarded in 1948 and also attended Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's weekly Wednesday afternoon private seminars. He also studied at the Moscow State University under the supervision of Sofya Yanovskaya in 1949. When he returned, however, he found himself on the losing side of internal arguments within the Hungarian communist party and was imprisoned on charges of revisionism from 1950 to 1953. More of Lakatos' activities in Hungary after World War II have recently become known. In fact, Lakatos was a hardline Stalinist and, despite his young age, had an important role between 1945 and 1950 (his own arrest and jailing) in building up the Communist rule, especially in cultural life and the academia, in Hungary.[9]/nAfter his release, Lakatos returned to academic life, doing mathematical research and translating George P\u00f3lya's How to Solve It into Hungarian. Still nominally a communist, his political views had shifted markedly, and he was involved with at least one dissident student group in the lead-up to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution./nAfter the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in November 1956, Lakatos fled to Vienna and later reached England. He lived there for the rest of his life however he never achieved a British citizenship.[10] He received a PhD in philosophy in 1961 from the University of Cambridge; his doctoral thesis was entitled Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery, and his doctoral advisor was R. B. Braithwaite. The book Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery, published after his death, is based on this work./nIn 1960, he was appointed to a position in the London School of Economics (LSE), where he wrote on the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science. The LSE philosophy of science department at that time included Karl Popper, Joseph Agassi and J. O. Wisdom.[11] It was Agassi who first introduced Lakatos to Popper under the rubric of his applying a fallibilist methodology of conjectures and refutations to mathematics in his Cambridge PhD thesis./nWith co-editor Alan Musgrave, he edited the often cited Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, the Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965. Published in 1970, the 1965 Colloquium included well-known speakers delivering papers in response to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions./nIn January 1971, he became editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, which J.\u00a0O. Wisdom had built up before departing in 1965, and he continued as editor until his death in 1974,[12] after which it was then edited jointly for many years by his LSE colleagues John W.\u00a0N. Watkins and John Worrall, Lakatos's ex-research assistant./nLakatos and his colleague Spiro Latsis organized an international conference in Greece in 1975, and went ahead despite his death. It was devoted entirely to historical case studies in Lakatos's methodology of research programmes in physical sciences and economics. These case studies in such as Einstein's relativity programme, Fresnel's wave theory of light and neoclassical economics, were published by Cambridge University Press in two separate volumes in 1976, one devoted to physical sciences and Lakatos's general programme for rewriting the history of science, with a concluding critique by his great friend Paul Feyerabend, and the other devoted to economics.[13]/nHe remained at LSE until his sudden death in 1974 of a heart attack[14] at the age of 51. The Lakatos Award was set up by the school in his memory. His last lectures along with some correspondance were published in Against Method. His last lectures along with parts of his correspondence with Paul Feyerabend have been published in For and Against Method.[15]/nLakatos' philosophy of mathematics was inspired by both Hegel's and Marx's dialectic, by Karl Popper's theory of knowledge, and by the work of mathematician George P\u00f3lya./nThe 1976 book Proofs and Refutations is based on the first three chapters of his 1961 four-chapter doctoral thesis Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery. But its first chapter is Lakatos' own revision of its chapter\u00a01 that was first published as Proofs and Refutations in four parts in 1963\u201364 in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. It is largely taken up by a fictional dialogue set in a mathematics class. The students are attempting to prove the formula for the Euler characteristic in algebraic topology, which is a theorem about the properties of polyhedra, namely that for all polyhedra the number of their vertices V minus the number of their edges E plus the number of their faces F is 2 (V \u2212 E + F = 2). The dialogue is meant to represent the actual series of attempted proofs that mathematicians historically offered for the conjecture, only to be repeatedly refuted by counterexamples. Often the students paraphrase famous mathematicians such as Cauchy, as noted in Lakatos's extensive footnotes./nLakatos termed the polyhedral counterexamples to Euler's formula monsters and distinguished three ways of handling these objects: Firstly, monster-barring, by which means the theorem in question could not be applied to such objects. Secondly, monster-adjustment, whereby by making a re-appraisal of the monster it could be made to obey the proposed theorem. Thirdly, exception handling, a further distinct process. These distinct strategies have been taken up in qualitative physics, where the terminology of monsters has been applied to apparent counterexamples, and the techniques of monster-barring and monster-adjustment recognized as approaches to the refinement of the analysis of a physical issue.[16]/nWhat Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no counterexample has yet been found. Once a counterexample is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those axioms were tautological, i.e. logically true.)[17]/nLakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on the idea of heuristics. In Proofs and Refutations the concept of \"heuristic\" was not well developed, although Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical \"thought experiments\" are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs, and sometimes called his philosophy \"quasi-empiricism\"./nHowever, he also conceived of the mathematical community as carrying on a kind of dialectic to decide which mathematical proofs are valid and which are not. Therefore, he fundamentally disagreed with the \"formalist\" conception of proof prevailed in Frege's and Russell's logicism, which defines proof simply in terms of formal validity./nOn its first publication as an article in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science in 1963\u201364, Proofs and Refutations became highly influential on new work in the philosophy of mathematics, although few agreed with Lakatos' strong disapproval of formal proof. Before his death he had been planning to return to the philosophy of mathematics and apply his theory of research programmes to it. Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar use Poincar\u00e9 (1893)[18] to answer one of the major problems perceived by critics, namely that the pattern of mathematical research depicted in Proofs and Refutations does not faithfully represent most of the actual activity of contemporary mathematicians.[19]/nIn a 1966 text Cauchy and the continuum, Lakatos re-examines the history of the calculus, with special regard to Augustin-Louis Cauchy and the concept of uniform convergence, in the light of non-standard analysis. Lakatos is concerned that historians of mathematics should not judge the evolution of mathematics in terms of currently fashionable theories. As an illustration, he examines Cauchy's proof that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous.  Lakatos is critical of those who would see Cauchy's proof, with its failure to make explicit a suitable convergence hypothesis, merely as an inadequate approach to Weierstrassian analysis. Lakatos sees in such an approach a failure to realize that Cauchy's concept of the continuum differed from currently dominant views./nLakatos's second major contribution to the philosophy of science was his model of the \"research programme\",[20] which he formulated in an attempt to resolve the perceived conflict between Popper's falsificationism and the revolutionary structure of science described by Kuhn. Popper's standard of falsificationism was widely taken to imply that a theory should be abandoned as soon as any evidence appears to challenge it, while Kuhn's descriptions of scientific activity were taken to imply that science is most fruitful during periods in which popular, or \"normal\", theories are supported despite known anomalies. Lakatos' model of the research programme aims to combine Popper's adherence to empirical validity with Kuhn's appreciation for conventional consistency./nA Lakatosian research programme[21] is based on a hard core of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. More modest and specific theories that are formulated in order to explain evidence that threatens the \"hard core\" are termed auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme\u2014they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to \"protect\" the \"hard core\". Whereas Popper was generally read as hostile toward such ad hoc theoretical amendments, Lakatos argued that they can be progressive, i.e. productive, when they enhance the programme's explanatory and/or predictive power, and that they are at least permissible until some better system of theories is devised and the research programme is replaced entirely. The difference between a progressive and a degenerative research programme lies, for Lakatos, in whether the recent changes to its auxiliary hypotheses have achieved this greater explanatory/predictive power or whether they have been made simply out of the necessity of offering some response in the face of new and troublesome evidence. A degenerative research programme indicates that a new and more progressive system of theories should be sought to replace the currently prevailing one, but until such a system of theories can be conceived of and agreed upon, abandonment of the current one would only further weaken our explanatory power and was therefore unacceptable for Lakatos. Lakatos's primary example of a research programme that had been successful in its time and then progressively replaced is that founded by Isaac Newton, with his three laws of motion forming the \"hard core\"./nThe Lakatosian research programme deliberately provides a framework within which research can be conducted on the basis of \"first principles\" (the \"hard core\"), which are shared by those involved in the research programme and accepted for the purpose of that research without further proof or debate. In this regard, it is similar to Kuhn's notion of a paradigm. Lakatos sought to replace Kuhn's paradigm, guided by an irrational \"psychology of discovery\", with a research programme no less coherent or consistent, yet guided by Popper's objectively valid logic of discovery./nLakatos was following Pierre Duhem's idea that one can always protect a cherished theory (or part of one) from hostile evidence by redirecting the criticism toward other theories or parts thereof. (See Confirmation holism and Duhem\u2013Quine thesis). This aspect of falsification had been acknowledged by Popper./nPopper's theory, falsificationism, proposed that scientists put forward theories and that nature \"shouts NO\" in the form of an inconsistent observation. According to Popper, it is irrational for scientists to maintain their theories in the face of nature's rejection, as Kuhn had described them doing. For Lakatos, however, \"It is not that we propose a theory and Nature may shout NO; rather, we propose a maze of theories, and nature may shout INCONSISTENT\".[22] The continued adherence to a programme's \"hard core\", augmented with adaptable auxiliary hypotheses, reflects Lakatos's less strict standard of falsificationism./nLakatos saw himself as merely extending Popper's ideas, which changed over time and were interpreted by many in conflicting ways. In his 1968 article \"Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes\",[23] Lakatos contrasted Popper0, the \"naive falsificationist\" who demanded unconditional rejection of any theory in the face of any anomaly (an interpretation Lakatos saw as erroneous but that he nevertheless referred to often); Popper1, the more nuanced and conservatively interpreted philosopher; and Popper2, the \"sophisticated methodological falsificationist\" that Lakatos claims is the logical extension of the correctly interpreted ideas of Popper1 (and who is therefore essentially Lakatos himself). It is, therefore, very difficult to determine which ideas and arguments concerning the research programme should be credited to whom./nWhile Lakatos dubbed his theory \"sophisticated methodological falsificationism\", it is not \"methodological\" in the strict sense of asserting universal methodological rules by which all scientific research must abide. Rather, it is methodological only in that theories are only abandoned according to a methodical progression from worse theories to better theories\u2014a stipulation overlooked by what Lakatos terms \"dogmatic falsificationism\". Methodological assertions in the strict sense, pertaining to which methods are valid and which are invalid, are, themselves, contained within the research programmes that choose to adhere to them, and should be judged according to whether the research programmes that adhere to them prove progressive or degenerative. Lakatos divided these \"methodological rules\" within a research programme into its \"negative heuristics\", i.e., what research methods and approaches to avoid, and its \"positive heuristics\", i.e., what research methods and approaches to prefer. While the \"negative heuristic\" protects the hard core, the \"positive heuristic\" directs the modification of the hard core and auxiliary hypotheses in a general direction.[24]/nLakatos claimed that not all changes of the auxiliary hypotheses of a research programme (which he calls \"problem shifts\") are equally productive or acceptable. He took the view that these \"problem shifts\" should be evaluated not just by their ability to defend the \"hard core\" by explaining apparent anomalies, but also by their ability to produce new facts, in the form of predictions or additional explanations.[25] Adjustments that accomplish nothing more than the maintenance of the \"hard core\" mark the research programme as degenerative./nLakatos' model provides for the possibility of a research programme that is not only continued in the presence of troublesome anomalies but that remains progressive despite them. For Lakatos, it is essentially necessary to continue on with a theory that we basically know cannot be completely true, and it is even possible to make scientific progress in doing so, as long as we remain receptive to a better research programme that may eventually be conceived of. In this sense, it is, for Lakatos, an acknowledged misnomer to refer to \"falsification\" or \"refutation\", when it is not the truth or falsity of a theory that is solely determining whether we consider it \"falsified\", but also the availability of a less false theory. A theory cannot be rightfully \"falsified\", according to Lakatos, until it is superseded by a better (i.e. more progressive) research programme. This is what he says is happening in the historical periods Kuhn describes as revolutions and what makes them rational as opposed to mere leaps of faith or periods of deranged social psychology, as Kuhn argued./nAccording to the demarcation criterion of pseudoscience proposed by Lakatos, a theory is pseudoscientific if it fails to make any novel predictions of previously unknown phenomena or its predictions were mostly falsified, in contrast with scientific theories, which predict novel fact(s).[26] Progressive scientific theories are those that have their novel facts confirmed, and degenerate scientific theories, which can degenerate so much that they become pseudo-science, are those whose predictions of novel facts are refuted. As he put it:/nLakatos's own key examples of pseudoscience were Ptolemaic astronomy, Immanuel Velikovsky's planetary cosmogony, Freudian psychoanalysis, 20th-century Soviet Marxism,[27] Lysenko's biology, Niels Bohr's quantum mechanics post-1924, astrology, psychiatry, and neoclassical economics./nIn his 1973 Scientific Method Lecture 1[28] at the London School of Economics, he also claimed that \"nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific\"./nAlmost 20 years after Lakatos's 1973 challenge to the scientificity of Darwin, in her 1991 The Ant and the Peacock, LSE lecturer and ex-colleague of Lakatos, Helena Cronin, attempted to establish that Darwinian theory was empirically scientific in respect of at least being supported by evidence of likeness in the diversity of life forms in the world, explained by descent with modification. She wrote that/nour usual idea of corroboration as requiring the successful prediction of novel facts... Darwinian theory was not strong on temporally novel predictions. ... however familiar the evidence and whatever role it played in the construction of the theory, it still confirms the theory.[29]/nIn his 1970 article \"History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions\"[3] Lakatos proposed a dialectical historiographical meta-method for evaluating different theories of scientific method, namely by means of their comparative success in explaining the actual history of science and scientific revolutions on the one hand, whilst on the other providing a historiographical framework for rationally reconstructing the history of science as anything more than merely inconsequential rambling. The article started with his now renowned dictum \"Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind\"./nHowever, neither Lakatos himself nor his collaborators ever completed the first part of this dictum by showing that in any scientific revolution the great majority of the relevant scientific community converted just when Lakatos's criterion \u2013 one programme successfully predicting some novel facts whilst its competitor degenerated \u2013 was satisfied. Indeed, for the historical case studies in his 1968 article \"Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes\"[23] he had openly admitted as much, commenting: \"In this paper it is not my purpose to go on seriously to the second stage of comparing rational reconstructions with actual history for any lack of historicity.\"/nPaul Feyerabend argued that Lakatos's methodology was not a methodology at all, but merely \"words that sound like the elements of a methodology\".[30] He argued that Lakatos's methodology was no different in practice from epistemological anarchism, Feyerabend's own position. He wrote in Science in a Free Society (after Lakatos's death) that:/nLakatos realized and admitted that the existing standards of rationality, standards of logic included, were too restrictive and would have hindered science had they been applied with determination. He therefore permitted the scientist to violate them (he admits that science is not \"rational\" in the sense of these standards). However, he demanded that research programmes show certain features in the long run \u2014 they must be progressive... I have argued that this demand no longer restricts scientific practice. Any development agrees with it.[31]/nLakatos and Feyerabend planned to produce a joint work in which Lakatos would develop a rationalist description of science, and Feyerabend would attack it. The correspondence between Lakatos and Feyerabend, where the two discussed the project, has since been reproduced, with commentary, by Matteo Motterlini.[32]", "65410617": "Ronny Hadani is an Israeli-American mathematician, specializing in representation theory and harmonic analysis, with applications to signal processing.[1][2]   He is known for developing Orthogonal Time Frequency and Space (OTFS) modulating techniques, a method used for making wireless 5G communications faster,[3] that is also being considered for use in 6G technology.[4] The technology is being used by several wireless 5G related companies and Cohere Technologies, a company he has co-founded.[5][6][7][8][9]/nHadani received his MS degree in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1999 under the supervision of David Harel.

His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1890\u20131945), was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of Gaylord High School.[14] Claude Sr. was a descendant of New Jersey settlers, while Mabel was a child of German immigrants.[1] Shannon's family was active in their Methodist Church during his youth.[15]/nMost of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home, he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire telegraph system to a friend's house a half-mile away.[16] While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the Western Union company./nShannon's childhood hero was Thomas Edison, whom he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden (1609\u20131682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.[17][18]/nIn 1932, Shannon entered the University of Michigan, where he was introduced to the work of George Boole. He graduated in 1936 with two bachelor's degrees: one in electrical engineering and the other in mathematics./nIn 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in electrical engineering at MIT, where he worked on Vannevar Bush's differential analyzer, an early analog computer.[19] While studying the complicated ad hoc circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed switching circuits based on Boole's concepts. In 1937, he wrote his master's degree thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.[20] A paper from this thesis was published in 1938.[21] In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the electromechanical relays that were used during that time in telephone call routing switches. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.[20]/nUsing this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Shannon's work became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ad hoc methods that had prevailed previously. Howard Gardner called Shannon's thesis \"possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.\"[22]/nShannon received his PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940.[17] Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, in order to develop a mathematical formulation for Mendelian genetics. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.[23]/nIn 1940, Shannon became a National Research Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann, and he also had occasional encounters with Albert Einstein and Kurt G\u00f6del. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical information theory.[24]/nShannon then joined Bell Labs to work on fire-control systems and cryptography during World War II, under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)./nShannon is credited with the invention of signal-flow graphs, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.[25]/nFor two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the U.S. Navy's cryptanalytic service the methods used by the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park to break the cyphers used by the Kriegsmarine U-boats in the north Atlantic Ocean.[26] He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria.[26] Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the \"universal Turing machine\".[27][28] This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own./nIn 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems, coauthored by Shannon, Ralph Beebe Blackman, and Hendrik Wade Bode, formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with \"the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.\"[29] In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of data and signal processing and thus heralded the coming of the Information Age./nShannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on communication theory.[30] At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for Bell Telephone Labs entitled \"A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography\", dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\" in the Bell System Technical Journal. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously, and that \"they were so close together you couldn't separate them\".[31] In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to \"develop these results \u2026 in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.\"[32]/nWhile he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the cryptographic one-time pad is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in 1949. The same article also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret.[33]/nIn 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\", an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the message a sender wants to transmit. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message. In so doing, he essentially invented the field of information theory./nThe book The Mathematical Theory of Communication reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Warren Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Weaver pointed out that the word \"information\" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise./nInformation theory's fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in 1951, in his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English \u2013 giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating space as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition./nAnother notable paper published in 1949 is \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\", a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable cyphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of sampling theory, which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later./nHe returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956./nIn 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978./nShannon developed Alzheimer's disease and spent the last few years of his life in a nursing home; he died in 2001, survived by his wife, a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.[34][35]/nOutside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in juggling, unicycling, and chess. He also invented many devices, including a Roman numeral computer called THROBAC, and juggling machines.[36][37] He built a device that could solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle.[17]/nShannon designed the Minivac 601, a digital computer trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the Scientific Development Corp starting in 1961.[38]/nHe is also considered the co-inventor of the first wearable computer along with Edward O. Thorp.[39] The device was used to improve the odds when playing roulette./nShannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married Ben Barzman.[40]/nShannon met his second wife, Betty Shannon (n\u00e9e Mary Elizabeth Moore), when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949.[34] Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions.[41]  They had three children.[42]/nShannon presented himself as apolitical and an atheist.[43]/nThere are six statues of Shannon sculpted by Eugene Daub: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the University of California, San Diego; one at Bell Labs; and another at AT&T Shannon Labs.[44] The statue in Gaylord is located in the Claude Shannon Memorial Park.[45] After the breakup of the Bell System, the part of Bell Labs that remained with AT&T Corporation was named Shannon Labs in his honor./nAccording to Neil Sloane, an AT&T Fellow who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called information theory) is the foundation of the digital revolution, and every device containing a microprocessor or microcontroller is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948:[46] \"He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him.\"[47] The cryptocurrency unit shannon (a synonym for gwei) is named after him.[48]/nA Mind at Play, a biography of Shannon written by Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman, was published in 2017.[49] They described Shannon as \"the most important genius you\u2019ve never heard of, a man whose intellect was on par with Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton\".[50]/nOn April 30, 2016, Shannon was honored with a Google Doodle to celebrate his life on what would have been his 100th birthday.[51][52][53][54][55][56]/nThe Bit Player, a feature film about Shannon directed by Mark Levinson premiered at the World Science Festival in 2019.[57] Drawn from interviews conducted with Shannon in his house in the 1980s, the film was released on Amazon Prime in August 2020./nShannon's The Mathematical Theory of Communication,[58] begins with an interpretation of his own work by Warren Weaver. Although Shannon's entire work is about communication itself, Warren Weaver communicated his ideas in such a way that those not acclimated to complex theory and mathematics could comprehend the fundamental laws he put forth. The coupling of their unique communicational abilities and ideas generated the Shannon-Weaver model, although the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings emanate entirely from Shannon's work after Weaver's introduction. For the layman, Weaver's introduction better communicates The Mathematical Theory of Communication,[58] but Shannon's subsequent logic, mathematics, and expressive precision was responsible for defining the problem itself./n\"Theseus\", created in 1950, was a mechanical mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a labyrinth of 25 squares.[59] The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions.[59] The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.[59] Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.[59]/nIn 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the game-tree complexity of chess, which is approximately 10120. This number is now often referred to as the \"Shannon number\", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to solving the game of chess using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. brute force analysis).[60][61]/nOn March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called \"Programming a Computer for playing Chess\". The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in Philosophical Magazine, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to solve the game.[60][62]/nHis process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure, based on an evaluation function of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. Material was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).[63] He considered some positional factors, subtracting \u00bd point for each doubled pawn, backward pawn, and isolated pawn; mobility was incorporated by adding 0.1 point for each legal move available./nShannon formulated a version of Kerckhoffs' principle as \"The enemy knows the system\". In this form it is known as \"Shannon's maxim\"./nThe Shannon centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916.

The parish register of St. Mary's, Newington, London, shows that Babbage was baptised on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.[10][11][12]/nBabbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801.[13] In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth. Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time, he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.[14]/nBabbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood Academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman.[15] The academy had a library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed.[16] He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.[17] The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by the University of Cambridge./nBabbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810.[18] He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;[19] he had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie Agnesi. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university.[8]/nBabbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 1812; they were also close to Edward Ryan.[20] As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.[21][22]/nIn 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge.[18] He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.[8]/nConsidering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816.[23] After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of a career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter.[24] In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists.[25] That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace.[26][27][28]/nWith Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday. The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Amp\u00e8re's force law.[29]/nBabbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives.[30] This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.[31] Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.[32]/nDuring this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a home in Marylebone in London and established a large family.[33] On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around \u00a3100,000, equivalent to \u00a39.21\u00a0million or $12.6\u00a0million today), making him independently wealthy.[8] After his wife's death in the same year he spent time travelling. In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont.[23] In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become a professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).[34]/nBabbage was instrumental in founding the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820, initially known as the Astronomical Society of London.[35] Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data.[36] These directions were closely connected with Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its Gold Medal, cited \"for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables\".[37]/nBabbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation had been a commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance).[38][39] The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation.[40] The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.[41]/nBabbage studied the requirements to establish a modern postal system, with his friend Thomas Frederick Colby, concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the Uniform Fourpenny Post supplanted by the Uniform Penny Post[42] in 1839 and 1840. Colby was another of the founding group of the Society.[43] He was also in charge of the Survey of Ireland. Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey, the remeasuring of the Lough Foyle baseline.[44]/nThe Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation. During this period it had some more substantial achievements. In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Sylvestre Lacroix, which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.[45]/nReference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called formal power series. British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced, they were not simply applied as notations in differential calculus. They opened up the fields of functional equations (including the difference equations fundamental to the difference engine) and operator (D-module) methods for differential equations.  The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing \u0394 to D, as a \"finite\" difference becomes \"infinitesimal\". These symbolic directions became popular, as operational calculus, and pushed to the point of diminishing returns. The Cauchy concept of limit was kept at bay.[46] Woodhouse had already founded this second \"British Lagrangian School\" with its treatment of Taylor series as formal.[47]/nIn this context function composition is complicated to express, because the chain rule is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from Louis Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Arbogast what is now called Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula. In essence it was known to Abraham De Moivre (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by Ada Lovelace as compatible with the analytical engine.[48] In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional finite differences and Arbogast's approach (in which \u0394 and D were related by the simple additive case of the exponential map). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of iteration, i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times.[47] Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the Philosophical Transactions (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of Gaspard Monge.[49]/nFrom 1828 to 1839, Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to his teaching responsibilities, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.[50] Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,[51] thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage's reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years.[52] He never did give a lecture.[53]/nIt was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics. Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders.[54] He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of Finsbury. In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote.[55][56] In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days.[57] In 1834 Babbage finished last among four.[58][59][60] In 1832, Babbage, Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order, however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor to entitle them to the prefix Sir, which often came with appointments to that foreign order (though Herschel was later created a baronet).[61]/nBabbage now emerged as a polemicist. One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a \"campaigning element\". His Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes (1830) stands out, however, for its sharp attacks. It aimed to improve British science, and more particularly to oust Davies Gilbert as President of the Royal Society, which Babbage wished to reform.[62] It was written out of pique, when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society, as Herschel was the senior, but failed because of his antagonism to Humphry Davy.[63] Michael Faraday had a reply written, by Gerrit Moll, as On the Alleged Decline of Science in England (1831).[64] On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact, with the bland election of the Duke of Sussex to succeed Gilbert the same year. As a broad manifesto, on the other hand, his Decline led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS).[64]/nThe Mechanics' Magazine in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage. In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out David Brewster writing in the Quarterly Review as another leader; with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money.[65]/nIn the debate of the period on statistics (qua data collection) and what is now statistical inference, the BAAS in its Statistical Section (which owed something also to Whewell) opted for data collection. This Section was the sixth, established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and John Elliot Drinkwater as secretary. The foundation of the Statistical Society followed.[66][67][68] Babbage was its public face, backed by Richard Jones and Robert Malthus.[69]/nBabbage published On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures (1832), on the organisation of industrial production. It was an influential early work of operational research.[71] John Rennie the Younger in addressing the Institution of Civil Engineers on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage's book was first an article in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by John Farey Jr., Peter Barlow and Andrew Ure.[72] From An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts (1827), which became the Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book. The second part considered the \"domestic and political economy\" of manufactures.[73]/nThe book sold well, and quickly went to a fourth edition (1836).[74] Babbage represented his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories, British and abroad. It was not, in its first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy; the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on piece rate.[75] The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and profit sharing.[76]/nIn Economy of Machinery was described what is now called the \"Babbage principle\". It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful division of labour. As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of Melchiorre Gioia in 1815.[77] The term was introduced in 1974 by Harry Braverman.[78] Related formulations are the \"principle of multiples\" of Philip Sargant Florence, and the \"balance of processes\".[79][80]/nWhat Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers.[81] He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that returns to scale are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the factory system.[82] His view of human capital was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.[83]/nAnother aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing. Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers' perspective, of exposing the trade's profitability.[84] He went as far as to name the organisers of the trade's restrictive practices.[85] Twenty years later he attended a meeting hosted by John Chapman to campaign against the Booksellers Association, still a cartel.[86]/nIt has been written that \"what Arthur Young was to agriculture, Charles Babbage was to the factory visit and machinery\".[87] Babbage's theories are said to have influenced the layout of the 1851 Great Exhibition,[88] and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary George Julius Poulett Scrope.[89] Karl Marx argued that the source of the productivity of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery, building on Adam Smith, Babbage and Ure.[90] Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer: as Babbage did, he wrote that it was for the sake of profitability, rather than productivity, and identified an impact on the concept of a trade.[91]/nJohn Ruskin went further, to oppose completely what manufacturing in Babbage's sense stood for.[92] Babbage also affected the economic thinking of John Stuart Mill.[93] George Holyoake saw Babbage's detailed discussion of profit sharing as substantive, in the tradition of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier, if requiring the attentions of a benevolent captain of industry, and ignored at the time.[94]/nWorks by Babbage and Ure were published in French translation in 1830;[95] On the Economy of Machinery was translated in 1833 into French by \u00c9douard Biot, and into German the same year by Gottfried Friedenberg.[96] The French engineer and writer on industrial organisation L\u00e9on Lalanne was influenced by Babbage, but also by the economist Claude Lucien Bergery, in reducing the issues to \"technology\".[97] William Jevons connected Babbage's \"economy of labour\" with his own labour experiments of 1870.[98] The Babbage principle is an inherent assumption in Frederick Winslow Taylor's scientific management.[99]/nMary Everest Boole claimed that there was profound influence \u2013 via her uncle George Everest \u2013 of Indian thought in general and Indian logic, in particular, on Babbage and on her husband George Boole, as well as on Augustus De Morgan:/nThink what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830\u201365. What share had it in generating the Vector Analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?[100]/nIn 1837, responding to the series of eight Bridgewater Treatises, Babbage published his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise, under the title On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation. In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of uniformitarianism in a current debate.[101] He preferred the conception of creation in which a God-given natural law dominated, removing the need for continuous \"contrivance\".[102]/nThe book is a work of natural theology, and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with Charles Lyell.[103] Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator.  In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion; on the one hand, he insisted that \"there exists no fatal collision between the words of Scripture and the facts of nature;\" on the other hand, he wrote that the Book of Genesis was not meant to be read literally in relation to scientific terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote \"that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of Moses remains unimpeached, we may also be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses.\"[104]/nThe Ninth Bridgewater Treatise was quoted extensively in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.[105] The parallel with Babbage's computing machines is made explicit, as allowing plausibility to the theory that transmutation of species could be pre-programmed.[106]/nJonar Ganeri, author of Indian Logic, believes Babbage may have been influenced by Indian thought; one possible route would be through Henry Thomas Colebrooke.[107] Mary Everest Boole argues that Babbage was introduced to Indian thought in the 1820s by her uncle George Everest:/nSome time about 1825, [Everest] came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young. I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) \u2013 from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book![100]/nBabbage was raised in the Protestant form of the Christian faith, his family having inculcated in him an orthodox form of worship.[108] He explained:/nMy excellent mother taught me the usual forms of my daily and nightly prayer; and neither in my father nor my mother was there any mixture of bigotry and intolerance on the one hand, nor on the other of that unbecoming and familiar mode of addressing the Almighty which afterwards so much disgusted me in my youthful years.[109]/nRejecting the Athanasian Creed as a \"direct contradiction in terms\", in his youth he looked to Samuel Clarke's works on religion, of which Being and Attributes of God (1704) exerted a particularly strong influence on him. Later in life, Babbage concluded that \"the true value of the Christian religion rested, not on speculative [theology] \u2026 but \u2026 upon those doctrines of kindness and benevolence which that religion claims and enforces, not merely in favour of man himself but of every creature susceptible of pain or of happiness.\"[110]/nIn his autobiography Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (1864), Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of religion, where he identified three sources of divine knowledge:[111]/nHe stated, on the basis of the design argument, that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence, and the one which led him to actively profess the existence of God.[112][113] Advocating for natural theology, he wrote:/nIn the works of the Creator ever open to our examination, we possess a firm basis on which to raise the superstructure of an enlightened creed. The more man inquires into the laws which regulate the material universe, the more he is convinced that all its varied forms arise from the action of a few simple principles ...  The works of the Creator, ever present to our senses, give a living and perpetual testimony of his power and goodness far surpassing any evidence transmitted through human testimony. The testimony of man becomes fainter at every stage of transmission, whilst each new inquiry into the works of the Almighty gives to us more exalted views of his wisdom, his goodness, and his power.[114]/nLike Samuel Vince, Babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine miracles.[115] Against objections previously posed by David Hume, Babbage advocated for the belief of divine agency, stating \"we must not measure the credibility or incredibility of an event by the narrow sphere of our own experience, nor forget that there is a Divine energy which overrides what we familiarly call the laws of nature.\"[116] He alluded to the limits of human experience, expressing: \"all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation, and whose cause is concealed. The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation, and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature; but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature. The limits of man's observation lie within very narrow boundaries, and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of man's power is to form the limits of the natural world.\"[117]/nThe British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche Naturforscher-Versammlung, founded in 1822.[119] It rejected romantic science as well as metaphysics, and started to entrench the divisions of science from literature, and professionals from amateurs.[120] Belonging as he did to the \"Wattite\" faction in the BAAS, represented in particular by James Watt the younger, Babbage identified closely with industrialists. He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership. Indeed, he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel). A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement.[121][122] At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell. His interests became more focussed, on computation and metrology, and on international contacts.[123]/nA project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all physical constants (referred to as \"constants of nature\", a phrase in itself a neologism), and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information. He was a pioneer in the field of \"absolute measurement\".[124] His ideas followed on from those of Johann Christian Poggendorff, and were mentioned to Brewster in 1832. There were to be 19 categories of constants, and Ian Hacking sees these as reflecting in part Babbage's \"eccentric enthusiasms\".[125] Babbage's paper On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art was reprinted by the Smithsonian Institution in 1856, with an added note that the physical tables of Arnold Henry Guyot \"will form a part of the important work proposed in this article\".[126]/nExact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools. Here again Babbage is considered a pioneer, with Henry Maudslay, William Sellers, and Joseph Whitworth.[127]/nThrough the Royal Society Babbage acquired the friendship of the engineer Marc Brunel. It was through Brunel that Babbage knew of Joseph Clement, and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures.[128] Babbage provided an introduction for Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1830, for a contact with the proposed Bristol & Birmingham Railway.[129] He carried out studies, around 1838, to show the superiority of the broad gauge for railways, used by Brunel's Great Western Railway.[130][131]/nIn 1838, Babbage invented the pilot (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles;[132] he also constructed a dynamometer car.[130] His eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.[133]/nBabbage also invented an ophthalmoscope, which he gave to Thomas Wharton Jones for testing. Jones, however, ignored it. The device only came into use after being independently invented by Hermann von Helmholtz.[134][135]/nBabbage achieved notable results in cryptography, though this was still not known a century after his death. Letter frequency was category 18 of Babbage's tabulation project. Joseph Henry later defended interest in it, in the absence of the facts, as relevant to the management of movable type.[125]/nAs early as 1845, Babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew Henry Hollier, and in the process, he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigen\u00e8re tables.  Specifically, he realised that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to modular arithmetic.[136] During the Crimean War of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigen\u00e8re's autokey cipher as well as the much weaker cipher that is called Vigen\u00e8re cipher today.[137] His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published. Credit for the result was instead given to Friedrich Kasiski, a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later.[138] However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigen\u00e8re cipher, which had been published previously in the Journal of the Society of Arts.[136][139] In 1855, Babbage also published a short letter, \"Cypher Writing\", in the same journal.[140] Nevertheless, his priority was not established until 1985.[136][141]/nBabbage involved himself in well-publicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances. He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a \"Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows\": Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by \"drunken men, women or boys\".[142][143][144]/nBabbage's distaste for commoners (the Mob) included writing \"Observations of Street Nuisances\" in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 \"nuisances\" over a period of 80 days. He especially hated street music, and in particular the music of organ grinders, against whom he railed in various venues. The following quotation is typical:/nIt is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons, and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time, destroyed by organ-grinders and other similar nuisances.[145]/nBabbage was not alone in his campaign. A convert to the cause was the MP Michael Thomas Bass.[146]/nIn the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-hoop-rolling campaign. He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.[147] Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for \"commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops.\"[148]/nBabbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers. That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal.[149]/nBabbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to \u00a317,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.[150]/nWhile Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to that of a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate I/O unit.[150]/nIn Babbage's time, printed mathematical tables were calculated by human computers; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.[53]/nAt Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion:/nIn 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.[151]/nThere was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by Gaspard de Prony, and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the Napoleonic Wars came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 Charles Blagden was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.[152][153]/nBabbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.[154]/nFor a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in Joseph Clement to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his machine tools were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.[155]/nSome parts of the prototype survive in the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.[156] This prototype evolved into the \"first difference engine\". It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the Science Museum in London. This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen short tons (13,600\u00a0kg), and would have been 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) tall. Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847\u20131849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,\"Difference Engine No. 2\", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989\u20131991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, returning results to 31 digits.[citation needed]/nNine years later, in 2000, the Science Museum completed the printer Babbage had designed for the difference engine.[157]/nThe Science Museum has constructed two Difference Engines according to Babbage's plans for the Difference Engine No 2. One is owned by the museum. The other, owned by the technology multimillionaire Nathan Myhrvold, went on exhibition at the Computer History Museum[158] in Mountain View, California on 10 May 2008.[159] The two models that have been constructed are not replicas./nAfter the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through, Babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the Analytical Engine. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman.[160] The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.[161]/nThe major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations.[162][163] The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.[citation needed]/nAda Lovelace, who corresponded with Babbage during his development of the Analytical Engine, is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the Engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers.[164] Despite documentary evidence in Lovelace's own handwriting,[164] some scholars dispute to what extent the ideas were Lovelace's own.[165][166][167] For this achievement, she is often described as the first computer programmer;[168][failed verification] though no programming language had yet been invented.[164][169]/nLovelace also translated and wrote literature supporting the project.  Describing the engine's programming by punch cards, she wrote: \"We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.\"[163]/nBabbage visited Turin in 1840 at the invitation of Giovanni Plana, who had developed in 1831 an analog computing machine that served as a perpetual calendar. Here in 1840 in Turin, Babbage gave the only public explanation and lectures about the Analytical Engine.[170][171] In 1842 Charles Wheatstone approached Lovelace to translate a paper of Luigi Menabrea, who had taken notes of Babbage's Turin talks; and Babbage asked her to add something of her own. Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini.[172]/nPer Georg Scheutz wrote about the difference engine in 1830, and experimented in automated computation. After 1834 and Lardner's Edinburgh Review article he set up a project of his own, doubting whether Babbage's initial plan could be carried out. This he pushed through with his son, Edvard Scheutz.[173] Another Swedish engine was that of Martin Wiberg (1860).[174]/nIn 2011, researchers in Britain proposed a multimillion-pound project, \"Plan 28\",[175] to construct Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Since Babbage's plans were continually being refined and were never completed, they intended to engage the public in the project and crowd-source the analysis of what should be built.[176] It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory, and run at a clock speed of about 7\u00a0Hz.  They hoped to complete it by the 150th anniversary of Babbage's death, in 2021.[177]/nAdvances in MEMS and nanotechnology have led to recent high-tech experiments in mechanical computation. The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments.[178] These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in The Economist in its special \"end of the millennium\" black cover issue in an article entitled \"Babbage's Last Laugh\".[179]/nDue to his association with the town Babbage was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 5 Totnes pound note.[180] An image of Babbage features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015.[181]/nOn 25 July 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore, sister of British parliamentarian William Wolryche-Whitmore, at St. Michael's Church in Teignmouth, Devon.[20] The couple lived at Dudmaston Hall,[182] Shropshire (where Babbage engineered the central heating system), before moving to 5 Devonshire Street, London in 1815.[183]/nCharles and Georgiana had eight children,[184] but only four \u2013 Benjamin Herschel, Georgiana Whitmore, Dugald Bromhead and Henry Prevost \u2013 survived childhood. Charles' wife Georgiana died in Worcester on 1 September 1827, the same year as his father, their second son (also named Charles) and their newborn son Alexander./nHis youngest surviving son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824\u20131918), went on to create six small demonstration pieces for Difference Engine No. 1 based on his father's designs,[186] one of which was sent to Harvard University where it was later discovered by Howard H. Aiken, pioneer of the Harvard Mark I. Henry Prevost's 1910 Analytical Engine Mill, previously on display at Dudmaston Hall, is now on display at the Science Museum.[187]/nBabbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley, Babbage died \"of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis.\"[188] He had declined both a knighthood[failed verification] and baronetcy. He also argued against hereditary peerages, favouring life peerages instead.[189]/nIn 1983, the autopsy report for Charles Babbage was discovered and later published by his great-great-grandson.[190][191] A copy of the original is also available.[192] Half of Babbage's brain is preserved at the Hunterian Museum in the Royal College of Surgeons in London.[193] The other half of Babbage's brain is on display in the Science Museum, London.[194]/nThere is a black plaque commemorating the 40 years Babbage spent at 1 Dorset Street, London.[195] Locations, institutions and other things named after Babbage include:/nBabbage frequently appears in steampunk works; he has been called an iconic figure of the genre.[206] Other works in which Babbage appears include:", "64427588": "Bobby Wilson is a mathematician and assistant professor at the University of Washington.[1]/nWilson obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 2015 under the supervision of Wilhelm Schlag.[2] He was an undergraduate at Morehouse College.[3] He was a CLE Moore Instructor at MIT 2015\u20132018.[4] He was twice an MSRI Postdoctoral Fellow (New Challenges in PDE and Harmonic Analysis) and will participate in the MSRI program Mathematical problems in fluid dynamics in 2021.[5] His research \"has been primarily concerned with questions concerning structure theory of measures and the dynamics of dispersive evolutionary equations.\"[6]/nIn 2020, he was awarded one of three Karen EDGE Fellowships[6] and he was profiled in Mathematically Gifted & Black.[7]/n/nThis article about an American mathematician is a stub.

He was born at Nicomedia in Bithynia in 1260, but the greater part of his life was spent in Constantinople, where as a monk he devoted himself to study and teaching. On entering the monastery he changed his original name Manuel to Maximus./nPlanudes possessed a knowledge of Latin remarkable at a time when Rome and Italy were regarded with some hostility by the Greeks of the Byzantine Empire. To this accomplishment he probably owed his selection as one of the ambassadors sent by emperor Andronikos II in 1295\u201396 to remonstrate with the Venetians for their attack upon the Genoese settlement in Galata near Constantinople. A more important result was that Planudes, especially by his translations, paved the way for the revival of the study of Greek language and literature in western Europe./nHe was the author of numerous works, including: a Greek grammar in the form of question and answer, like the Erotemata of Manuel Moschopulus, with an appendix on the so-called \"Political verse\"; a treatise on syntax; a biography of Aesop and a prose version of the fables; scholia on certain Greek authors; two hexameter poems, one a eulogy of Claudius Ptolemaeus\u2014 whose Geography was rediscovered by Planudes,[5] who translated it into Latin\u2014 the other an account of the sudden change of an ox into a mouse; a treatise on the method of calculating in use amongst the Indians;[6] and scholia to the first two books of the Arithmetic of Diophantus./nHis numerous translations from the Latin included Cicero's Somnium Scipionis with the commentary of Macrobius; Ovid's Heroides and Metamorphoses; Boethius' De consolatione philosophiae; and Augustine's De trinitate. Traditionally, a translation of Julius Caesar's De Bello Gallico has been attributed to Planudes, but this is a much repeated mistake.[7][8] These translations were not only useful to Greek speakers but were also widely used in western Europe as textbooks for the study of Greek./nIt is, however, for his edition of the Greek Anthology that he is best known.

Among Zelditch's other research topics are Bergman kernels, K\u00e4hler metrics, Gaussian analytic functions, and random metrics. In a famous paper, Zelditch applied semiclassical methods to complex algebraic geometry with the semiclassical parameter playing the role of the reciprocal power of an ample line bundle over a K\u00e4hler manifold.

The family was well off and later Jarl Waldemar would prefer to be a reader than a full professor. Lindeberg's career centred on the University of Helsinki. His early interests were in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations but from 1920 he worked in probability and statistics. In 1920 he published his first paper on the central limit theorem. His result was similar to that obtained earlier by Lyapunov whose work he did not then know. However, their approaches were quite different; Lindeberg's was based on a convolution argument while Lyapunov used the characteristic function. Two years later Lindeberg used his method to obtain a stronger result: the so-called Lindeberg condition. His work on probability led to him becoming involved in applied fields. He developed what we know as Kendall's \u03c4 and he found the first two moments of its sampling distribution. Lindeberg used line transect methods in forestry, and when in 1926 determining the necessary number of transects to obtain a sufficiently precise confidence interval, he seems to have rediscovered Student's t-distribution./nThe Swedish mathematician Harald Cram\u00e9r met Lindeberg in 1922.

Apple provided a program to copy files from DOS 3.3 volumes to new ProDOS volumes; however, programs written for DOS 3.3 did not run on ProDOS volumes. DOS.MASTER enabled a widely installed base of previously ProDOS incompatible programs written for DOS 3.3 to be run under ProDOS. DOS.MASTER took a large ProDOS partition, formatted it as a file, and then created a series of DOS 3.3 volumes within that file. The program allowed the user to create one of four DOS 3.3 volume sizes: 140 KB (the standard capacity of an Apple II 5\u00bc\" floppy disk), 160 KB, 200 KB, or 400 KB (the maximum that DOS 3.3 could address).

He later did research into the function-level programming paradigm, presenting his findings in his influential 1977 Turing Award lecture \"Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?\"[1]/nThe IEEE awarded Backus the W. W.

He died at his home in Ashland, Oregon on March 17, 2007.[5]/nBackus was born in Philadelphia and grew up in nearby Wilmington, Delaware.[6] He studied at The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, but he was apparently not a diligent student.[5] He entered college at the University of Virginia to study chemistry, but struggled with his classes there, and he was expelled after less than a year for poor attendance.[7] He was subsequently conscripted into the U.S. Army during World War II,[5] and eventually came to hold the rank of corporal, being put in command of an anti-aircraft battery stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.[7]/nAfter receiving high scores on a military aptitude test, the Army sent him to study engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.[7] He later transferred to a pre-medical program at Haverford College.[8] During an internship at a hospital, he was diagnosed with a cranial bone tumor, which was successfully removed, and a plate was installed in his head. He then moved to the Flower and Fifth Avenue Medical School for medical school, but found it uninteresting and dropped out after nine months.[7] He soon underwent a second operation to replace the metal plate in his head with one of his own design,[9] and received an honorable medical discharge from the U.S. Army in 1946.[7]/nAfter moving to New York City he trained initially as a radio technician and became interested in mathematics. He graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor's degree in 1949 and a master's degree in 1950, both in mathematics,[7][10] and joined IBM in 1950. During his first three years, he worked on the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC); his first major project was to write a program to calculate positions of the Moon. In 1953 Backus developed the language Speedcoding, the first high-level language created for an IBM computer, to aid in software development for the IBM 701 computer.[11]/nProgramming was very difficult at this time, and in 1954 Backus assembled a team to define and develop Fortran for the IBM 704 computer. Fortran was the first high-level programming language to be put to broad use. This widely used language made computers practical and accessible machines for scientists and others without requiring them to have deep knowledge of the machinery.[12]/nBackus served on the international committees that developed ALGOL 58 and the very influential ALGOL 60, which quickly became the de facto worldwide standard for publishing algorithms. Backus developed the Backus\u2013Naur form (BNF), published in the UNESCO report on ALGOL 58. It was a formal notation able to describe any context-free programming language, and was important in the development of compilers. A few deviations from this approach were tried (notably in Lisp and APL), but by the 1970s, Backus\u2013Naur context-free specifications for computer languages had become quite standard, following the development of automated compiler generators such as yacc./nThis contribution helped Backus win the Turing Award in 1977./nBackus later worked on a function-level programming language known as FP, which was described in his Turing Award lecture \"Can Programming be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?\".[1] Sometimes viewed as Backus's apology for creating Fortran, this paper did less to garner interest in the FP language than to spark research into functional programming in general. When Backus publicized the function-level style of programming, his message was mostly misunderstood[13] as being the same as traditional functional programming style languages./nFP was strongly inspired by Kenneth E. Iverson's APL, even using a non-standard character set. An FP interpreter was distributed with the 4.2BSD Unix operating system, but there were relatively few implementations of the language, most of which were used for educational purposes./nBackus spent the latter part of his career developing FL (from \"Function Level\"), a successor to FP. FL was an internal IBM research project, and development of the language stopped when the project was finished. Only a few papers documenting it remain, and the source code of the compiler described in them was not made public. FL was at odds with functional programming languages being developed in the 1980s, most of which were based on the lambda calculus and static typing systems instead of, as in APL, the concatenation of primitive operations. Many of the language's ideas have now been implemented in versions of the J programming language, Iverson's successor to APL.", "58693284": "Ailsa Horton Land (n\u00e9e\u00a0Dicken; 14 June 1927 \u2013 16 May 2021)[1] was a Professor of Operational Research in the Department of Management at the London School of Economics and was the first woman professor of  Operational Research in Britain.

In March 1950, he and other researchers were given short notice to move, again under tight security, to what was known as KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11') or Arzamas-16, the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (today it is the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF))./nThe purpose was to develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb.

Klimov did not get on well with Bogolyubov (who had a more fruitful professional relationship with both Shirkov and Zubarev), and once Bogolyubov was given permission to leave \"the Installation\", Andrei Sakharov took Klimov into his group.[4] The RDS-6 bomb, Sakharov's 'layer cake' design on which Klimov had done a part of the theoretical work, was tested in 1953. Klimov was one of the fifteen authors of the design report detailing the configuration and calculations for the RDS-6's successor, the first Soviet two-stage nuclear device, the RDS-37.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13]/nKlimov regularly ridiculed perceived lies in press reports. He was regarded as a pioneer of different thinking by some, supporting people's rights, and was openly defiant, to the surprise and dismay of his colleagues who considered such behaviour perilous. He was often called to the gorkom (political committee) to receive warnings.[14]/nAt KB-11, Klimov quickly became the outdoor activities leader in the group in swimming, walking, running at the local stadium and any other athletic pursuits.[4] He was killed before his thirtieth year in a snow avalanche in the Caucusus mountains.[2][14]", "8918696": "Alexander of Villedieu[1] was a French author, teacher and poet, who wrote text books on Latin grammar and arithmetic, everything in verse.

He was interested in higher dimensions, particularly the fourth dimension. He is known for coining the word \"tesseract\" and for his work on methods of visualising the geometry of higher dimensions./nHinton's father, James Hinton, was a surgeon and advocate of polygamy. Charles Hinton was born in the United Kingdom. His siblings included the costume designer Ada Nettleship (1856 \u2013 1932).[1]/nHinton taught at Cheltenham College[2] while he studied at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained his B.A. in 1877.  From 1880 to 1886, he taught at Uppingham School in Rutland, where Howard Candler, a friend of Edwin Abbott Abbott's, also taught.[3] Hinton also received his M.A. from Oxford in 1886./nIn 1880 Hinton married Mary Ellen Boole, daughter of Mary Everest Boole and George Boole, the founder of mathematical logic.[4] The couple had four children: George (1882\u20131943), Eric (born 1884), William (1886\u20131909)[5] and Sebastian (1887\u20131923) (inventor of the jungle gym and father of William and Joan Hinton)./nIn 1883 he went through a marriage ceremony with Maud Florence Weldon, by whom he had had twin children, under the assumed identity of John Weldon.  He was subsequently convicted of bigamy and spent three days in prison, losing his job at Uppingham.[6] His father James Hinton was a radical advocate of polygamous relationships,[7] and according to Charles' mother James had once remarked to her: \"Christ was the saviour of Men but I am the saviour of Women and I don't envy him a bit.\"[8]/nIn 1887 Charles moved with Mary Ellen to Japan to work in a mission before accepting a job as headmaster of the Victoria Public School. In 1893 he sailed to the United States on the SS Tacoma to take up a post at Princeton University as an instructor in mathematics.[6]/nIn 1897, he designed a gunpowder-powered baseball pitching machine for the Princeton baseball team's batting practice.[6][9] The machine was versatile, capable of variable speeds with an adjustable breech size, and firing curve balls by the use of two rubber-coated steel fingers at the muzzle of the pitcher.[10] He successfully introduced the machine to the University of Minnesota, where Hinton worked as an assistant professor until 1900, when he resigned to move to the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.[6]/nAt the end of his life, Hinton worked as an examiner of chemical patents for the United States Patent Office.  At age 54, he died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage on 30 April 1907 in Washington, D.C.[11][12] After Hinton's sudden death his wife, Mary Ellen, committed suicide, also in Washington, D.C., in May 1908.[13]/nIn an 1880 article entitled \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\", Hinton suggested that points moving around in three dimensions might be imagined as successive cross-sections of a static four-dimensional arrangement of lines passing through a three-dimensional plane, an idea that anticipated the notion of world lines. Hinton's explorations of higher space had a moral basis:/nHinton argues that gaining an intuitive perception of higher space required that we rid ourselves of the ideas of right and left, up and down, that inheres in our position as observers in a three-dimensional world. Hinton calls the process \"casting out the self\", equates it with the process of sympathizing with another person, and implies the two processes are mutually reinforcing.[14]/nHinton created several new words to describe elements in the fourth dimension. According to the OED, he first used the word tesseract in 1888 in his book A New Era of Thought. Alicia Boole Stott, his sister in law who knew him at Oxford, supervised the publication of the book whilst he was abroad.[15] He also invented the words kata (from the Greek for \"down from\") and ana (from the Greek for \"up toward\") to describe the additional two opposing fourth-dimensional directions (an additional 4th axis of motion analogous to left-right (x), up-down (y), and forwards-backwards (z)).[16]/nHinton's Scientific romances, including \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\" and \"A Plane World\", were published as a series of nine pamphlets by Swan Sonnenschein & Co. during 1884\u20131886.  In the introduction to \"A Plane World\", Hinton referred to Abbott's recent Flatland as having similar design but different intent. Abbott used the stories as \"a setting wherein to place his satire and his lessons. But we wish in the first place to know the physical facts.\" Hinton's world existed along the perimeter of a circle rather than on an infinite flat plane.[17] He extended the connection to Abbott's work with An Episode of Flatland: Or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension (1907)./nAn Episode of Flatland or How a Plane Folk Discovered the Third Dimension, to which is bound up An Outline of the History of Un\u00e6a [18] made its public debut in 1907, even receiving a paragraph review (though not particularly flattering) in the British scientific journal Nature (1907).[19] The action plays out in the planar world of two-dimensional Astria with the primary characters partaking in various adventures, scientific and romantic. Ultimately, some Astrians come to accept and comprehend the reality and fullness of three-dimensions in a world beyond their immediate comprehension. The book consists of a Preface, Introduction, a post-introductory section titled The History of Astria, and the Episode (referred to in the title) composed of twenty short chapters. Overall, it is longer than Edwin A. Abbott's novella Flatland\u2026 (1884); Hinton's narrative contains approximately 53,720 words./nHinton's work combines various literary and scientific features, with the author intent on popularizing the idea of higher dimensions among educated Edwardian readers including such diverse groups as religious thinkers and believers, experimental scientists, artists, stodgy academics, engineers, politicians, and others of various persuasions and agendas. Recognizing the existence of, and even reaching, a higher dimension was not simply part and parcel to a strictly mathematical game; for Charles H. Hinton (1907), during an era when spiritualism (with the obligatory s\u00e9ances) was running rampant, it was important to point the way toward a higher realm of existence in both intellectual and genuinely spiritual terms./nHinton's advocacy of the tesseract as a means to perceive higher dimensions spawned a long lineage of science fiction, fantasy, and spiritual works that similarly refer to the tesseract as a way to understand\u2014or even access\u2014higher dimensions, including Charles Leadbeater's Clairvoyance (1899), Claude Bragdon's A Primer of Higher Space (1913), Algernon Blackwood's Victim of Higher Space (1914), H. P. Lovecraft's  The Shadow Out of Time (1935), Robert Heinlein's \"\u2014And He Built a Crooked House\u2014\" (1941), Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time (1962), and Christopher Nolan's film Interstellar (2014).[20]/nHinton was one of the many thinkers who circulated in Jorge Luis Borges's pantheon of writers.  Hinton is mentioned in Borges' short stories \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\", \"There Are More Things\" and \"El milagro secreto\" (\"The Secret Miracle\"):/nHe judged A Vindication of Eternity to be less unsatisfactory, perhaps. The first volume documents the diverse eternities that mankind has invented, from Parmenides' static Being to Hinton's modifiable past; the second denies (with Francis Bradley) that all the events of the universe constitute a temporal series.[21]/nHinton influenced P. D. Ouspensky's thinking.  Many of ideas Ouspensky presents in \"Tertium Organum\" mention Hinton's works./nHinton's \"scientific romance\", the \"Unlearner\", is cited by John Dewey in Art as Experience, chapter 3. The story described by John Dewey is actually titled \"An Unfinished Communication\" and is part of the second series of \"Scientific Romances\".

The play premiered in Madrid during May 2015, and was published in May 2017./nHinton is mentioned several times in Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell; his theories regarding the fourth dimension form the basis of the book's final chapter.

Four years later he received the Moscow Mathematical Society Award for young mathematicians. In the same year he defended a dissertation for the Candidate of Science in Physics and Mathematics degree (equivalent to the PhD) at Moscow State University. In 1965 he defended a dissertation for the Doctor of Science in Physics and Mathematics degree there. In 1966 he became a Corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union./nNovikov's early work was in cobordism theory, in relative isolation. Among other advances he showed how the Adams spectral sequence, a powerful tool for proceeding from homology theory to the calculation of homotopy groups, could be adapted to the new (at that time) cohomology theory typified by cobordism and K-theory. This required the development of the idea of cohomology operations in the general setting, since the basis of the spectral sequence is the initial data of Ext functors taken with respect to a ring of such operations, generalising the Steenrod algebra. The resulting Adams\u2013Novikov spectral sequence is now a basic tool in stable homotopy theory.[2][3]/nNovikov also carried out important research in geometric topology, being one of the pioneers with William Browder, Dennis Sullivan, and C. T. C. Wall of the surgery theory method for classifying high-dimensional manifolds. He proved the topological invariance of the rational Pontryagin classes, and posed the Novikov conjecture. This work was recognised by the award in 1970 of the Fields Medal. He was not allowed to travel to Nice to accept his medal, but he received it in 1971 when the International Mathematical Union met in Moscow. From about 1971 he moved to work in the field of isospectral flows, with connections to the theory of theta functions. Novikov's conjecture about the Riemann\u2013Schottky problem (characterizing principally polarized abelian varieties that are the Jacobian of some algebraic curve) stated, essentially, that this was the case if and only if the corresponding theta function provided a solution to the Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili equation of soliton theory. This was proved by Takahiro Shiota (1986),[4] following earlier work by Enrico Arbarello and Corrado de Concini (1984),[5] and by Motohico Mulase (1984).[6]/nSince 1971 Novikov has worked at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences.
