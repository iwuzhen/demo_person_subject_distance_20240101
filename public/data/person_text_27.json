{"63437817": "David Cranston or Cranstoun (c.\u20091480\u20131512) was a Scottish scholastic philosopher and theologian among the circle of John Mair./nCranston was certainly born in Scotland, possibly in the diocese of Glasgow, c.\u20091480; nothing else is known of his early life. The first record of him comes when he matriculated from the University of Paris in 1495, attending the Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu. He had access to a healthy supply of money during his time at the university, though he indicates in his will he was a \"poor student\". At the college, Cranston was a student of Scottish philosopher John Mair.[1]/nCranston graduated with an MA in 1499.[1] He subsequently worked as an instructor in arts at the college; among his pupils was the fellow Scotsman and pupil of Mair, George Lokert.[2] At this time, he also undertook a course in theology. The first fruit of this study was published in 1500 as Positiones phisicales. Cranston next published a set of Questiones on Aristotle's Prior Analytics in 1506, which he dedicated to the first Archbishop of Glasgow, Robert Blackadder.[1] Cranston also edited Mair's Termini (1502) and the Quartus Sententiarum (1509), the second edition (1503) of the former containing his own additions.[1][3] He was apparently among the pupils who urged Mair to issue the many textbooks in logic he did at the University of Paris, which were ultimately collated together in one volume in 1506.[4]/nAccording to biographer J. H. Burns, by 1506 Cranston was \"a prominent member of the circle around Mair\", who together played a large part in reviving scholastic philosophy in the early 16th century.[1] As Alexander Broadie put it, \"Cranston was in many ways close to Mair, particularly in respect to their deep commitment to the scholastic tradition in logic and theology.\"[3] Cranston was a diligent defender of scholastic philosophy against the criticism of humanist philosophers. In 1510, Mair transcribed and published a dialogue between Cranston and the young aristocrat and poet Gavin Douglas, in which Cranston gives a potent defense of Mair's scholasticism against the humanist scepticism of Douglas.[1][5][6] But, like his teacher, Cranston maintained an open mind around humanism. Both were happy to attend humanist scholar Girolamo Aleandro's lectures on Ancient Greek at the university, which introduced the language to the Paris;[1][3] Aleandro later credited Cranston among his \"most faithful auditors\" and \"illustrious friends\" in France.[3][7]/nIn 1506, Cranston published another theological work, the Tractatus noticiarum. According to Burns, this work demonstrates Cranston's lifelong \"preponderant theological interest\" in human activity.[1] He thus analyses the truth of religious faith, which he judges to be decided upon by \"inevident assent\"[1]\u2014in which the truth of a proposition is not immediately obvious to the intellect, but must rather be accepted on God's authority.[8] By May 1512, Cranston had finished his education in theology and took his doctorate. His subsequent works show a preoccupation with moral philosophy; he made major additions to the Questiones morales of Martin Le Maistre and minor ones to the Moralia of Jacques Almain, a peer at the university.[1]/nIn August 1512, two versions of Cranston's Insolubilia were printed. This treatise concerned unsolvable problems and the logical rules of disputations. However, the second of these was published with an elegy De immatura magistri nostri Davidis Cranston Scoti morte [On the premature death of our master David Cranston the Scot], indicating Cranston had died during the treatise's publication.[9][3] Thus, Cranston died between 7 and 14 August 1512,[1] a premature death while he was only in his early to mid-thirties.[10] Cranston had apparently suffered poor health through his course in theology. He left 450 livres tournois for a scholarship to the Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu.[1] Cranston was buried in the chapel of the Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu, beside his former principal at the college Jan Standonck.[1][11]/nCranston was apparently prone to anger, especially when defending his home nation. Mair's 1521 History of Greater Britain records an episode where the Continental theologians Almain and Pieter Crockaert teased Cranston in the Sorbonne over his nation's diet of oat bread, which he \"strove to deny as an insult to his native country\".[1] In a similar bout of patriotic anger, a brief intermission between the dry philosophical discourse of the Questiones is afforded when Cranston attempts to discredit a passage in Jerome, which described cannibalism among the Scots, as owing to a corrupted manuscript of the original.[1]", "7437310": "John of Paris OP (in French Jean de Paris), also called Jean Quidort and Johannes de Soardis (c. 1255 \u2013 September 22, 1306), was a French philosopher, theologian, and Dominican friar./nJohn of Paris was born in Paris at an unknown date. Having obtained the degree of Master of Arts with distinction, he joined the Dominican Order, when about twenty years of age, at the Convent of St. James in his native city. There he taught philosophy and theology, and obtained the degree of Master of Theology. He was endowed with great ability, possessed great literary and linguistic attainments, and was considered one of the best theologians of the university and one of the most subtle dialecticians of the age.\"[1]/n\"In his work on the temporal and spiritual power, De potestate regia et papali, written during the controversy between Boniface VIII and Philip the Fair, he favours the king.\"[1]/nAfter John wrote a treatise contradicting the normal Church doctrine on transubstantiation, the faculty of the university reported his ideas to William of Baufet, Bishop of Paris, who forbade John under penalty of excommunication to defend such a doctrine, and deprived him of the offices of lecturing, preaching, and hearing confessions. John appealed to the Holy See, but died soon after in Bordeaux, and the case was dropped.[2]/nSome ten of his works on theology, physics, and metaphysics still exist in manuscript; two others, De Antichristo and De modo existendi corporis Christi in sacramento altaris, appeared in print centuries after his death. A treatise, Contra corruptorem Sancti Thomae, published in 1516 under the name of Aegidius Romanus (Giles of Rome), is commonly attributed to John of Paris; it was certainly not written by Aegidius. All these show vast erudition.[1]/nMore troublesome in the eyes of the Church was John's treatise on the Blessed Sacrament, in which he maintains that the Body of Christ is, or might be, present by assumption (i.e. by the body of Christ assuming the bread and wine), and that the doctrine of transubstantiation is not of faith. It must be said, however, that he advances these propositions tentatively; in the beginning of the treatise he writes that he believes in the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and that if it is shown that transubstantiation is of faith, or should it be so defined, he will willingly retract./nThe following works are among those authored by him:/nJohn's name re-appeared in the early 20th century, when Distributist writers such as the Catholics Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton attributed to him the earliest statement of the capitalist philosophy in De potestate regia et papali.", "19823615": "Boris Porena (Rome, 27 September 1927 - Cantalupo in Sabina, 3 May 2022) was an Italian thinker, music composer and didactical expert. He was married to Paola Bu\u010dan, a famous Croatian cellist and teacher who, until her retirement in 2014 was a tenured professor at the Conservatorio di Musica in Perugia (Italy).[1]/nHe was a disciple of  Goffredo Petrassi \u2013 alongside other distinguished musicians such as Ennio Morricone, Aldo Clementi, and Sergio Cafaro. Although he was initially influenced by neoclassical poetics, he later evolved towards the use of the harmonic language of the late Renaissance period, which he has used with originality in order to build his own musical research which directly influenced his later compositional processes./nHe started composing when only 12 years old. His career is effectively in two distinct and different periods \u2013 the first being up until 1967 during which time he gained a wide national and international success. From 1968, as consequence of the evolution of both his thought and his social involvement, he abstained from composing, a period which lasted for the next twenty years. During that time he devoted himself to a grassroots cultural practice and set up the Metacultural Centre, located at Cantalupo in Sabina (Rieti, Italy). In 1988 he began to compose again with renewed enthusiasm, starting on a new and different compositional phase./nAs a musical critic he has written essays about his master, Goffredo Petrassi along with several other important texts about music; among them Musica/Societ\u00e0 (Einaudi, 1975) stands out, going beyond purely musical issues and authoritatively examines and explores the fields of social and political analysis./nHe has taught new didactics of composition at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome and he has been director of the Research and Experimental Centre \"Musica in Sabina\".

He was a pupil of Alexander of Hales[1] and was the first Franciscan to receive a bachelor's degree of theology from the University of Paris.  He produced multiple treatises, sermons, commentaries on scripture, and also played a large role in the Summa fratris Alexandri, a theological Summa written by Alexander.  \u201cHales left the beginnings of the theological Summa, and it was completed by John of la Rochelle and others\u201d.[2]\nBy 1238, he was a master of theology, with his own pupils, for his name is found in the list of masters convoked in that year by William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris, to discuss the question of ecclesiastical benefices./n\u201cFor Jean de la Rochelle, theology is essentially wisdom\u2026Jean deems that three things are required for a theologian: knowledge, a holy life, and teaching.  Someone who teaches Scripture should have a solid doctoral formation, but should also embody in himself sacred knowledge by his good will and moral actions, before practicing his profession upon others through teaching and preaching\u201d.[3]/nIn dissensions which rent the Franciscan order, John was one of the opponents of Brother Elias, and with Alexander of Hales was involved in discussions that led to the plot which brought about Elias' downfall in 1239. When the 1241 Chapter of Definitors called for comments on disputed questions on the Franciscan Rule, the Province of Paris asked John of La Rochelle, together with Alexander of Hales, Robert of Bascia and Odo of Rigaud, to furnish an explanation of the Rule of St. Francis. The work received the approbation of the General Chapter of the Order held at Bologna in 1242, and subsequently became known as the \"Exposition of the Four Masters.\"/nHe died in 1245, the same year as his teacher Alexander of Hales./nHis works, the Tractatus de divisione potentiarum animae (A Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul\u2019s Power), written c. 1233, and Summa de anima (Summa on the Soul), written c. 1235, were arguably some of his best. Father Fidelis of Fanna says (on the Summa) that no subject is to be found so frequently in manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries in the many European libraries he searched./nThere also exist summae on the virtue, vices, the articles of the faith, and the ten commandments; many biblical commentaries; sermons, and disputed questions on grace and other theological topics./nJohn was among those who declared against the general lawfulness of plurality. He appears to have enjoyed a favorable reputation, and is described by Bernard of Besse as a professor of great fame for holiness and learning, whose writings were both solid and extremely useful./nThe main aim of the Summa de anima is to set out Jean's position on being and essence in the context of the debate between those who defend the theory that all of created being is composed of matter and form, and those who, like Thomas Aquinas later would, rejected the doctrine which attributed a composite nature to the soul.[4]  Jean investigates the soul according to the four Aristotelian causes: material, efficient, formal, and final.  \nHe states what he believes to be intellectual cognition, \u201cwhile nonetheless retaining certain Avicennian doctrines\u201d.[3]  Going deeper into the investigation of the soul, Jean introduces a doctrine that distinguishes the soul into two levels of reason: higher and lower.  The levels of the soul are distinguished according to their objects: the objects of higher reasoning can be classified as a spiritual being, and the objects of lower reasoning are classified as corporeal.\n\u201cFollowing Augustine, Jean classifies the objects of knowledge further by dividing them into four categories: beings above, beside, in, or beneath the soul\u201d.[5]  He also proposes a different agent intellect for each class of objects: the immanent agent intellect suitable for corporeal beings, and two further agent intellects: one for beings outside the soul, such as angels, and one for the being above the soul, God himself. The distinction between the agent intellect outside the soul and the one above the soul, also shows Augustine's heavy influence on Jean, since similar doctrines are found in Augustine's work On Spirit and the Soul.  Jean's idea here is similar to Avicenna's views on separate intelligence, in relation to a separate angelic agent intellect that acts upon the soul's immanent agent intellect./nJohn's Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul\u2019s Power (Tractatus) gives another detailed view of his conception of the soul. \"Fortunately it shows more clearly than his Summa how he appropriates and begins to transform his philosophical sources\u201d.[6]  The Tractatus is divided into three parts that correspond to the three ways of looking at the soul: definition, division, and completion or perfection. \u201cJean\u2019s typical procedure in each of the three parts of the Tractatus is to assemble authoritative texts on the point at hand and then to analyze their competing vocabularies\u201d.[6] His analysis of competing vocabularies of the soul includes a wide range of sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, the book of Genesis, Nemesius of Emesa, and Avicenna. Jean's Tractatus was a great example of how challenging it was for theologians to organize and clarify much of the newly translated material of the 13th century./nJean made significant progress as a philosopher in a time when Parisian theologians abstained from philosophical studies. Jean had many influences and referenced many works from theologians and philosophers alike; however, much of his work, especially that in philosophy of the soul, indicates much originality.", "74054657": "Abu'l-Fawaris Ahmad ibn Ya'qub was an early 11th-century Isma'ili scholar and missionary (da'i) active in Syria, which at the time was largely under the rule of the Fatimid Caliphate.[1] Abu'l-Fawaris was active in the reign of the Fatimid imam-caliph al-Hakim (r.\u2009996\u20131021),[2] and a contemporary of the fellow Isma'ili scholars, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Naysaburi and Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani.

He is best known for his biography of Serbian despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, which George Ostrogorsky described as \"the most important historical work of old Serbian literature\",[2] and for writing the first Serbian philological study, Skazanije o pismeneh (A History on the Letters). He followed the writing style of the Old Serbian vita, first made popular in the Serbian scriptoria of the 12th century./nConstantine was born in Bulgaria, probably in Kostenets. In his youth, he attended school in the capital Veliko Tarnovo, and was taught by Andronik, a pupil of Patriarch Evtimiy of Bulgaria. He continued his studies on Mount Athos and in Constantinople. The Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in 1393 drove him away and he settled in Stefan Lazarevi\u0107's Serbian Despotate, probably around 1402. He was warmly welcomed by the Despot, also a man of letters and a benefactor of education, and was given the position of educator at his palace in Belgrade. Constantine also frequented the Manasija monastery, where he helped establish the Serbian \"Resava School\" of literature. His high education, life experience and traveling earned him the nickname of \"Filozof\" (Philosopher), after Saint Cyril the Philosopher. On top of the travels in his youth, he traveled to the Holy Land and, judging by his description of three missions to the palaces of eastern rulers (Timur, Musa and Mehmed I), he may also have participated.[3][4]/nAfter the Despot's death in 1427, Constantine left Belgrade and entered into the service of kesar Uglje\u0161a Vlatkovi\u0107, in the area of Vranje, where he later died.[4]/nConstantine's work had a tremendous impact on medieval Serbian literature and education. He introduced many classical Greek elements of literature and philosophy. His frequent citing of ancient philosophers and comparisons of the Despot in the Biography caused many to consider him a precursor to the Renaissance which, due to the Ottoman conquest, never occurred in Serbian culture.[4]/nAfter Despot Stefan's death in 1427, Nikon I, Serbian Patriarch ordered Constantine to write the Despot's biography. That order was only fulfilled four years later, after Stefan himself allegedly appeared in Constantine's dream and restated Nikon's order. The biography is one of the most interesting in the old Serbian literature because it contains not only facts about the Despot's life, but also geographic information and thorough descriptions of numerous historical events. He was apparently inspired by the imperial chronicles of Byzantine historians.

An exhaustive story of court events and the Despot's life follows, with numerous Biblical and classical references and numerous historical data which have proven invaluable to later historians. On several occasions, Constantine used acrostics, with three masterpiece instances: in the introduction verses, in the titles of central chapters, and in the verses telling of his sorrow for the deceased Despot.[5][4][6][7]/nConstantine of Kostenets, Pachomius the Serb, Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, and Gregory Tsamblak were able to continue their literary activities virtually unhampered by any linguistic barrier when moving from the Balkans to Imperial Russia, no different than the role of Latin literature in the Roman Catholic part of medieval Europe. Constantine spoke and wrote a language which could not be identified with either the Bulgarian or Serbian vernaculars. Therefore, it was only natural for medieval Serbian biographers to turn for models to the body of existing vitae written in either Slavonic-Serbian or Church Slavonic language.", "8354839": "Durs Gr\u00fcnbein (born 1962) is a German poet and essayist./nDurs Gr\u00fcnbein was born in Dresden in 1962 and grew up there.[1]  He studied Theater Studies in East Berlin, to which he moved in 1985./nSince the Peaceful Revolution nonviolently toppled the Berlin Wall and Communism in the German Democratic Republic in 1989, Gr\u00fcnbein has traveled widely in Europe, South-West Asia, and North America, and sojourned in various places, including Amsterdam, Paris, London, Vienna, Toronto, Los Angeles, New York City, and St. Louis.

After completing his early \nstudies at a local monastery near his home, at about the age of fourteen, he went to the University of Paris to study philosophy, theology, and jurisprudence, which latter subject he later taught in the same city.[1]/nIn 1225, he entered the Dominican priory there and took the religious habit of the recently founded Order. Soon after his admission, he was appointed as Prior Provincial of the Order for France. In 1230 he became Master of Theology and was elected prior of the Paris monastery. During those years, he contributed largely to the Order's success, and won the confidence of Pope Gregory IX, who sent him as a papal legate to Constantinople in 1233.[1]/nPope Innocent IV made Hugh a Cardinal Priest as the first of the Dominican order[2] in 1244, with his titular church being Santa Sabina, the mother church of the Dominican Order. He then played an important part in the First Council of Lyons, which took place the following year. He contributed to the institution of the Feast of Corpus Christi on the General Roman Calendar. In 1247, upon instructions of Pope Innocent, Hugh revised the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert, which the Saint Albert Avogadro, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, had given the first Carmelite friars on Mount Carmel. The Holy See felt it necessary to mitigate some of the Rule's more demanding elements to make it more compatible with conditions in Europe. The same pope approved these changes,[3] and this revision remains the Rule for the Carmelite Order. After the death in 1250 of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Pope Innocent sent Hugh to Germany as his legate for the election of a successor.[1]/nUnder the authority of Pope Alexander IV, in 1255 Hugh supervised the commission that condemned the Introductorius in Evangelium aeternum of Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, which promoted the teachings of Abbot Joachim of Fiore. These teachings worried the bishops as they had become widespread among the \"Spiritual\" wing of the Franciscan friars, to which Gherardino belonged.[4]/nHe also supervised the condemnation of William of St Amour's De periculis novissimorum temporum. This work was an expression of the attack on the mendicant Orders, who were becoming so successful in the lives of the universities, by the secular clergy who had previously had unchallenged authority there.

His work, entitled \"Correctio Biblie\", survives in more than a dozen manuscripts.[6]/nIn the preface to the \"Correctio Biblie\", Hugh writes that he has collated various Latin versions and biblical commentaries, as well as the Hebrew manuscripts.[7] For his approach to the text of the Bible, he was criciticsed by William de la Mare, author of another correctorium.[8]/nHis commentary on Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences exercised significant influence over subsequent generations of theologians.[9] The works introduced for the first time the distinction between God's unconditioned potence (in Latin: potentia absoluta) and his conditioned one (potentia conditionata). The latter belongs to the divine kingship, but is also limited by the goodness and love of God, as well as by the law he had given to mankind.[10][11] The distinction influenced the theology of John Duns Scotus who distinguished the unconditioned potence of God (potentia absoluta) from the ordained potence (potentia ordinata).[12][13]\nThe distinction was forged in his commentary on the Sentences.[14] This new theological notion was rejected by William of Auxerre, Thomas Aquinas, Albert the Great, Saint Bonaventure and John of La Rochelle.[14] William Courtenay (1342-1396) and Lawrence Moonan identified its origin in the Summa Theologiae of Geoffrey of Poitiers.[15]/nHugh of Saint-Cher also wrote the Postillae in sacram scripturam juxta quadruplicem sensum, litteralem, allegoricum, anagogicum et moralem, published frequently in the 15th and 16th centuries. His Sermones de tempore et sanctis are apparently only extracts.

He is an Emeritus Professor in the philosophy department at La Trobe University in Victoria, Australia, and Professional Fellow in philosophy at the University of Melbourne.[2] He was the Editor of the Australasian Journal of Philosophy for twelve years.[3] He is one of the major proponents of the New Essentialist school of philosophy of science.  In later years he has brought his understanding of scientific realism to the Social Sciences, developing the philosophy of Social Humanism./nThe new essentialism is a comprehensive philosophy of nature. Philosophers around the world, including Sydney Shoemaker, Charles Martin, George Molnar, George Bealer, John Bigelow, Caroline Lierse, Evan Fales, Crawford Elder, Nicholas Maxwell, Nancy Cartwright and John Heil, have contributed to in various ways to its development. The new essentialism is an emerging metaphysical perspective that is the culmination of many different attempts to arrive at a satisfactory post-Humean philosophy of nature./nHowever, this list of claimed allies has been disputed by Stephen Mumford, at least with regard to Shoemaker, Martin, Molnar, Heil and Cartwright.[4]/nIn the chapter \"Causal Powers and Categorical Properties\" of The Metaphysics of Powers: Their Grounding and Their Manifestations, Ellis argues that categorical properties and causal powers are distinct from one another, and that categorical properties are not dispositional, but quiddities.[5]\u00a0Quidditism accounts for identity of a property based only on what it is rather than what it disposes its bearer to do. Although categorical properties do not necessarily dispose their bearers to do anything, they do determine where active properties of things may exist, or be distributed, and thus where the effects of such activities can be observed.[5]\u00a0He gives a detailed logical account of how a causal power can be defined. Ellis defines a causal power as a quantitative property that positions its bearer in specific circumstances to take part in a physical causal process with a certain outcome.\u00a0 Such powers are to either act or resist change within the bearer (e.g. temperature, elasticity)./nAll causal powers must meet two criteria.\u00a0 First, they must all have contingent locations, since they have to act from somewhere.\u00a0 Second, they all must have laws of action outlining their nature.\u00a0Such laws reference both the location of the object that possesses the power, as well as the location of things it interacts with. Locations, however, are impotent. Ellis argues that neither locations nor categorical properties such as shape and size are causal powers, yet they can make a difference in outcomes.[5]", "1276977": "Karol Libelt (8 April 1807, neighborhood of Chwaliszewo in Pozna\u0144, Duchy of Warsaw - 9 June 1875, Brdowo) was a Polish philosopher, writer, political and social activist, social worker and liberal, nationalist politician, and president of the Pozna\u0144 Society of Friends of Learning./nLibelt took part in the failed November Uprising against Russia in 1830, and was imprisoned for nine months at Magdeburg. Since 1839 he became the head of a secret committee started to organise yet another uprising against the partitioning powers, which was nicknamed the Libelt Committee - Komitet Libelt). He was sentenced by the Prussian authorities to 20 years of imprisonment in a fortress for taking part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1846). However, he was amnestied in 1848 and returned to Posen (Pozna\u0144), where he took part in the Greater Poland Uprising (1848) and joined various organisations supporting the independence of Poland (Polish National Committee and Revolutionary Committee). During the Spring of Nations he was elected as one of the members of the Frankfurt Parliament; he also took part in the Slavic Congress in Prague in June 1848./nIn 1849 he was elected a member of the Prussian parliament and became the director of the liberal Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily). The following year Libelt began to establish various scientific and social organisations in Greater Poland, including the Society of Friends of the Sciences in Posen (Pozna\u0144), which became a de facto university. Between 1868 and 1875 he headed the Society and gave lectures in aesthetics.  In 1873, he was elected to the Prussian Lower House./nIn his philosophical works, Libelt described the so-called Polish messianism, or a belief that the history of the world would be redeemed by the Polish people, who gained moral excellence because of the suffering of their fatherland.

He became a Franciscan and was educated at Oxford, where he graduated D.D.[1]/nWoodford taught in the schools and came into friendly contact with Wycliffe. \"When I was lecturing concurrently with him on the Sentences\", he says, \"Wycliffe used to write his answers to the arguments, which I advanced to him, in a notebook which I sent him with my arguments, and to send me back the notebook\".[b] With the development of Wycliffe's views, however, Woodford became increasingly hostile, and when, in his Confessio in 1381, the reformer repudiated transubstantiation, Woodford wrote his earliest extant work in reply. It was entitled Septuaginta Qu\u00e6stiones de Sacramento Eucharisti\u00e6, and is thought to have been composed as a course of lectures delivered in the Grey Friars' church, London, as a preparation for the Feast of Corpus Christi on 10 June 1381;[c] five manuscripts at least of this work are extant.[d] This was the first of a series of works in which Woodford attacked Wycliffe and his followers, and his writings occasionally throw light on Wycliffe's career, though his statements (e.g. that Wycliffe was expelled from Canterbury Hall) are not always to be accepted if lacking corroboration.[e] He also replied to the attacks of Richard Fitzralph on the mendicant orders.[2]/nThere is little doubt that Woodford is the William de Wydford whom Margaret, Countess of Norfolk, described in 1384 as her \"well-beloved father in God\", and for the term of whose life she granted the Minoresses of Aldgate Without a yearly rent of twenty marks from \"le Brokenwharf\", London.[f] In 1389 he was regent-master in theology among the minorites at Oxford, and in 1390 was vicar of the provincial minister; in both years he lectured against Wycliffe, and Thomas Netter was one of his pupils.[g] Henceforth he seems to have resided principally at the Grey Friars, London, and in 1396 he obtained from Boniface IX sanction for the special privileges he enjoyed in this convent. Bale, Pits, and Wadding state that he died in 1397 and was buried at Colchester, but Sbaralea pointed out that in one of his works Henry was referred to as King; he also says that Woodford was deputed from Oxford to attend a council in London in 1411. Probably he died soon after; he was buried in the choir of Grey Friars church, London.[h][3]/nBale and subsequent bibliographers give a long list of works by Woodford, many of which are lost, and some of which can only be doubtfully attributed to Woodford;[i] but the numerous copies extant of the others indicate that Woodford's works were widely read, and he was considered \"acerrimus hereticorum extirpator\".

Al-'Amiri argued that revealed truth must be superior to philosophy. Al-'Amiri believed that the ancient Greeks did not have a final say on philosophy because, as a society, the Greeks lacked a prophet who had a final say in all its forms.

He suggested that in having dialogue with the Jews and Christians, Muslims should avoid such approaches that may cause bitterness or arouse hostility.[60]/nAccording to Qaradawi, the verses in the Quran that tell Muslims to break ties with Jews and Christians (Al-Maidah 5:54-55) refer to those people who were hostile to Islam and waged war against Muslims. This means that Muslims are not allowed to help or be friends with people who are hostile towards Islam, even if it means going against their own interests.[60]/nIn his book titled The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, al-Qaradawi wrote, \"Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur'an never addresses them without saying, 'O People of the Book' or 'O You who have been given the Book', indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and the Muslims.\"[61]/nIn August 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradawi was president, had used the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations.[62] Al-Qaradawi's remarks were sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.[63][64][65][66]/nIn a 9 January 2009 sermon during the Gaza War, shown on Al-Jazeera, Qaradawi prayed for Allah to take revenge on the \"enemies of Islam\", specifically the Jews, whom he described as treacherous, aggressors who have spread much tyranny and corruption. He asked Allah to annihilate them completely, without sparing any of them.[67]/nIn his Friday sermon broadcast on Qatar TV on 26 April 2013, Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in next year's interfaith dialogue if Jews were invited, stating that there should be no debate with those who have committed injustice. He cited a verse from the Quran which says that there should be no debate with the People of the Book except in a way that is best, and went on to say that the Jews have committed great injustice and that \"their hands are soiled with blood\".[68]/nQaradawi's statements were described as incitement to genocide in a Jewish Political Studies Review article, which connected his belief in Jewish conspiracies to the appeals to violence against them. Qaradawi asserted that Hitler meted out divinely sanctioned punishment to the Jews and called for Muslims to impose a similar punishment, calling openly for genocide. His appeals for genocide were coupled with paranoid conspiracy thinking that identifies the Jews as the greatest enemies of Islam; alleging a Jewish plot to take over the entire Middle East, including Mecca and Medina; blaming the Jews for the abolition of the Islamic Caliphate in 1924 and the spread of communism; and accusing the Jews of planning to tear down the al-Aqsa Mosque so as to build a Jewish Temple in its place.[69]/nAl-Qaradawi said that apostasy in Islam \u2013 Muslims leaving Islam \u2013 is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that the duty of all Muslims \"is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world\".[70] In February 2013, Qaradawi stated on Egyptian television that the death penalty is a necessity for those who leave Islam, citing several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers. He explains that many hadiths state that any apostate should be killed, and that this is necessary to preserve Islam.[71][72]/nIn 2011, Al-Qaradawi wrote that execution is a valid penalty for apostasy, but only in cases where the apostate has also committed another crime. He advocates giving apostates a chance to repent before carrying out the sentence, and says that hidden apostates should not be punished by the Muslim community, but left to the judgement of God.[73][74]/nAl-Qaradawi spoke in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically.[75][76] On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: \"On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. We are not a state for mullahs.\"[77]/nAfter the September 11 attacks, al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said:[78]/nIslam, the religion of tolerance, holds the human soul in high esteem, and considers the attack against innocent human beings a grave sin; this is backed by the Qur'anic verse that reads: \"Who so ever kills a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he has killed all mankind, and who so ever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind,\" (Al-Ma'idah:32). The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is reported to have said, 'A believer remains within the scope of his religion as long as he doesn't kill another person illegally.' Islam never allows a Muslim to kill the innocent and the helpless./nHe denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, \"when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians,\" but qualifies that with \"I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories.\"/nAl-Qaradawi suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) suicide bombings against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants have no other means of self-defense.[79] The Oxford-based Malaysian Islamic Scholar, Dr. Afifi al-Akiti, rules that there is no Islamic legal precedent for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat. With regards to suicide bombings he says that they are \"breaching the scholarly consensus ... because to endanger one's life is one thing and to commit suicide during the attack is obviously another\".[80] With regards to male soldiers he states, \"It goes without saying that they are considered combatants as soon as they arrive on the battlefield even if they are not in direct combat \u2013 provided of course that the remaining conventions of war have been observed throughout, and that all this is during a valid war when there is no ceasefire.\"[81]/nWestern governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier wrote to al-Qaradawi: \"With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam.\"[82]/nAl-Qaradawi supported suicide attacks on all Israelis, including women[83][84] since he viewed the Israeli society as a \"completely military\" society that did not include any civilians.[85] He also considered pregnant women and their unborn babies to be valid targets on the grounds that the babies could grow up to join the Israeli Army.[86]/nDefending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told BBC Newsnight in 2005 that:/nIn an interview with the newspaper Al Raya in April 2001, al-Qaradawi declared that suicide (or \"martyrdom\") bombings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis  \"are not suicide operations. These are heroic martyrdom operations, and the heroes who carry them out don't embark on this action out of hopelessness and despair but are driven by an overwhelming desire to cast terror and fear into the hearts of the oppressors.\"[87]/nOn 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited Gaza and gave a speech in support of Hamas. He asked all of the Palestinian people to work with other Arab people and Muslims around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as \"Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death\" and \"We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch.\"[88]/nAn Anti-Defamation League report in 2011 said that al-Qaradawi had voiced his desire to see Jerusalem conquered in a fatwa in which he claimed that it was the Muslims' duty to \"defend\" Jerusalem with \"their lives, their money and all they possess, or else they will be subject to Allah's punishment.\"[89]/nIn 2004 the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organization chaired by al-Qaradawi which counts a great number of prominent individuals affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and/or Hamas among its members,[relevant?] ruled that \"resisting occupation troops in Iraq is a 'duty' on able Muslims in and outside the war-torn country and that aiding the occupier is impermissible.\"[90]/nIn an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of Saddam Hussein under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people \"after liberating Iraq from American colonialism\". He also suggested that the trial was \"an act of vengeance by the Americans\" for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged:[91]/nA human soul must be respected. These people did not respect the human soul. The man was calm and kept his cool. He refused to be blindfolded, and insisted upon facing death with open eyes.. and said the two parts of the shahada ... The man died saying: 'There is no God but Allah' ... Anybody whose last words are 'There is no God but Allah' goes to Paradise. The thing that improves [the record] of Saddam Hussein is that in his final years \u2013 as the brothers in Iraq tell us \u2013 he was a changed man. He began to strictly observe the prayers, to read the Quran, and to do charitable work. He would hasten to do anything that may help people. He would help build mosques, and would say that if anybody wants to build a mosque, the government should pay half the cost of the building materials. When they entered his secret hideout and caught him, they found a prayer carpet and an open Quran./nIn 2006, in response to Muslim scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen's fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for Hezbollah because they are Shia, al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added \"Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches\" and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of Iraq to end the civil war.[92]/nSeven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to fight Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran: \"The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis ... Now we know what the Iranians want ... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis.\"[93] Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah.[93]/nQaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the National Transitional Council in the 2011 Libyan civil war, urging Arab nations to recognize them and \"to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli\". He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist them, and said \"Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi.\"[94]/nIn response to the 2011 Bahrain protests, Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: \"The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis.\" He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: \"I want them to be real citizens of their country.\"[95]/nQaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the 2011 Syrian uprising, saying \"Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station,\" and \"It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community.\"[96] He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria's \"oppressive regime\", claiming \"atrocities\" were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba'ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian government, someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya, saying \"The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi's tyranny\" and slamming Arab League leader Amr Moussa for criticism of it.[97]/nCommenting on the role women played in social active issues:/nAlthough over sixty years have passed since the Movement emerged into existence, no women leaders have appeared that can confront secular and Marxist trends single-handedly and efficiently. This has come about as a result of men's unrelenting attempts to control women's movement, as men have never allowed women a real chance to express themselves and show special leadership talents and abilities that demonstrate their capability of taking command of their work without men's dominance./nI believe that women's Islamic work will succeed and prove itself in the arena of the Islamic Movement only when it gives birth to female Islamic leaders in the fields of Call, thought, science, literature and education./nAccordingly, women as well as men can dedicate themselves to Allah, and play a role in jihad.[98]/nI do not think that this is impossible or even difficult. There are genius women just as there are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys./nAl-Qaradawi defended the mass murder of millions during the Holocaust as a \"punishment.\" In a statement that aired on Al-Jazeera TV on 28 January 2009 during the Gaza War, al-Qaradawi said the following regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust (as translated by MEMRI):[99]/nThroughout history, Allah has imposed upon the Jews people who would punish them for their corruption ... The last punishment was carried out by Hitler. By means of all the things he did to them \u2013 even though they exaggerated this issue \u2013 he managed to put them in their place. This was divine punishment for them ... Allah Willing, the next time will be at the hand of the believers./nAl-Qaradawi told The Guardian that wife beating was neither \"obligatory nor desirable\" but that he \"accepts it as a method of last resort \u2013 though only lightly\".[100] He stated on Channel 4 News that it was justifiable in certain circumstances[101] but the \"ideal was for Muslim men never to beat their wives, and if husbands wrongly beat their wives, they have the right to fight back\".[102] The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote that al-Qaradawi, in his book The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam, stated that wife-beating is permissible after the failure of all other means of persuasion. In such circumstances, a husband may beat his wife \"lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive areas\".[101][103][104][105]/nQaradawi said that female genital mutilation surgery is forbidden in Islam. He called for the termination and ban of \"female circumcision\" in some parts of the Muslim world, especially in rural Africa where most still practice it. His views were supported by Sheikhs in Al-Azhar.[106]/nQaradawi urged women to not masturbate and stated that it is dangerous to insert things into the vagina.[107]/nOn 5 June 2006, on the Al Jazeera program Sharia and Life, al-Qaradawi (a regular on the program) reiterated orthodox views on homosexuality.[108] When asked about the punishment for people who \"practise liwaat (sodomy) or sihaaq (lesbian activity)\", al-Qaradawi replied: \"The same punishment as any sexual pervert \u2013 the same as the fornicator.\" (MEMRI translation).[109] The punishment for fornication is lashing./nIn an interview with Der Spiegel, Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, \"One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn't me who came up with this mindset. It's part of God's order spoken of by Moses and even mentioned by Jesus.\"[110]/nRigorous scholarly debates among the Islamic School of Law (Fiqh) question whether LGBT people are defined by genetic disorders and that it may be permissible or not for those who're scientifically medically proven to be part of the LGBT category as with hermaphrodite denoting whether a person is inclined towards the naturality of female or male instinct. Same for Mukhannathun (transgender), in which there are many prophetic Hadith that allow males who have inclinations towards being female (effeminate) that occurred during the Islamic prophet Muhammad's time and that they were accepted as part of the larger community in Madinah having equal rights.[111] Qaradawi was one of many leading Islamic scholars to weigh in on this ongoing debate.[112]/nAl-Qaradawi called \"stoning\" un-Islamic for it has nothing to do with Islam at all but laws made by the religion of Judaism; Jewish Religious Laws. He said there are more than dozens of verses in the Torah that support stoning for adulterers, fornicators, LGBT people, and for many other reasons.[113]/nAl-Qaradawi said that honor killing is a tradition that was carried out thousands of years ago by ancient civilization; the Romans, the Dark Ages, Chinese Emperors, etc. He said it has nothing to do with Islam; neither Qur'an nor Sunnah (Prophetic Hadith). He called on those who do it to be punished with death for their crime; a life for a life.[114]/nAl-Qaradawi fully supported and advocated Mawlid. He said that to use the birth date of Muhammad in remembrance of his life story is not bid'ah. In fact, it is encouraged in Islam to do good action (Man Sanna Sunnatun Hassanah) based on a Sahih Hadith. And that Allah (God) himself has said in Al-Qur'an, Chapter 21, Verse 107:/nAnd We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except for mercy (rahmah) to all mankind./nAl-Qaradawi explained that Allah (God) is talking about Muhammad's miracle birth as the verse mentions \"sent you\". In other words, his presence, his birth, his coming. A \"mercy\" (rahmah) to the worlds. Means mercy to all mankind. It means everything; all of his creations (all creatures)./nWhoever starts a good action (sunnah) in Islam. He will be rewarded for his actions as well as getting the reward of those who've followed it successively until the Day of Judgment./nIt's in this Sahih Hadith that al-Qaradawi emphasizes that good innovative actions are strongly encouraged as long as it doesn't go against the Sharia. What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person's hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It's encouraging for both. He said these are the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more good than just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till the End of Time.[118]/nAl-Qaradawi said that niqab (veil) is not obligatory in Islam. He pointed out that a woman's face is not an awrah. He called those who don the niqabs as following tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time, had to cover their faces from the dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorms. Al-Azhar's Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, have also pointed out that niqab has nothing to do with Islam.[119][120]/nAt the same time Qaradawi issued a fatwa (edict) that organ transplantation from a living person to a living person is permissible in Islam but through donation as donation is considered charity. As for a dead person, only when the brain stops, the transplantation can then be carried out.[121]/nIn April 2008, at a conference in Qatar titled \"Mecca: the Center of the Earth, Theory and Practice\", al-Qaradawi advocated the implementation of Mecca Time to replace the Greenwich Meridian as the basis of the world time zone system.[122]/nAl-Qaradawi called for a \"Day of Anger\" over the cartoons,[123] but condemned violent actions in response to them./nAl-Qaradawi was one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy.[124]/nAl-Qaradawi said, \"Rushdie disgraced the honor of the Prophet and his family and defiled the values of Islam,\" but he never backed the fatwa calling for his death.[125]/nIn 1997, Qaradawi's affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood led to his expulsion from Egypt, where the organisation was prohibited at the time.[126]/nAl-Qaradawi was a follower of Hasan al-Banna during his youth and a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood.[79] He twice turned down offers to be its leader.[127] In an interview on the Dream channel, al-Qaradawi stated the following about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB):[128]/nI joined the Muslim Brotherhood Group and worked with Imam al-Banna. I was influenced by al-Banna's moderate thoughts and principles ... (Later) MB asked me to be a chairman, but I preferred to be a spiritual guide for the entire nation ... MB consider me their Mufti, but I don't have a relation with the organization, because being an MB chairman is something difficult requiring a highly sophisticated wisdom, and I prefer to be devoted to the entire nation, and I feel comfortable with this decision. I like MB and consider them the nearest group to be righteous./nOn 16 May 2015 al-Qaradawi was sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court along with the ousted President Mohamed Morsi and over 100 other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.[129] As reported by the Interpol website,[130] Qaradawi was wanted by the judicial authorities of Egypt for \"agreement, incitement and assistance to commit intentional murder, helping prisoners to escape, arson, vandalism and theft.\"[131]/nQaradawi criticised reality television programs, saying that the aim of these is to 'mislead the [Muslim] nation'.[132]/nAl-Qaradawi was at the forefront of contemporary Muslim thinkers and scholars. His vast contributions include more than 80 books and hundreds of articles on different Islamic issues, ranging from the fundamental principles and laws of Islam to the needs and challenges of modern Muslim societies. His knowledge, intellect, moderation and unrelenting efforts to bring Islam to a larger audience gained him the respect of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide. His television program Ash-Shariah wal-Hayat (Sharia and Life) had an estimated 700\u2013800\u00a0million viewers worldwide.[133]/nIn 2012, Qaradawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qaradawi during the Arab Spring,[134] a charge he denied.[citation needed]/nPakistani scholar, Muhammad Taqi Usmani stated, \"There is no doubt that I\u2014as the lowest student of Islamic Fiqh\u2014with my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-Qarad\u0101w\u012b to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of [his works], have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results that he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtil\u0101f) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtih\u0101d\u012b) are natural, and cannot be the [sole] basis for judging [their author] so long as the people of knowledge do not deem [the bearers of such opinions] to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and [in any case] the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da'wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree.\"[citation needed]/nIn addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, \"What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman\" but exempts Qaradawi by saying, \"As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Y\u016bsuf al-Qarad\u0101w\u012b, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [From this] I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (d\u0101'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist.\"[135]/nThe Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan B\u00fclteni Haber Ajans\u0131, which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party, attacked al-Qaradawi and called his creed \"perverted\" and claimed that he was followed by \"democratic polytheists\".[136] Qaradawi was attacked by Hani Al-Siba'i.[137]/nQaradawi stated that Russia was an \"enemy of Islam\" due to the country's military relations with the Syrian regime.[138]/nHis remarks drew harsh criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov,  \"Qaradawi's statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia.\" Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi's statements were mainly \"directed against the Muslims of Russia, who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country\".[139]/nKadyrov claimed that \"It is not Russia that is supplying weapons and money for the thousands of mercenaries from all over the world who have flooded Syria and are committing daily terrorist attacks, in which the blood of women, old people and children is shed.\"[139]/nAl-Qaradawi was banned from entering the United States since 1999 and the United Kingdom since 2008,[23] though he visited London in 2004.[140] The lobby group MEMRI said it helped play a role in the measures.[141] In July 2003, he visited Stockholm, Sweden, for a conference at the Stockholm Mosque arranged by the Muslim Association of Sweden. During the conference al-Qaradawi expressed his support for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, calling the fight against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories a \"necessary Jihad\".[142] France announced in March 2012 it will not let him enter.[143]/nThe Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) (citing Asharq Al-Awsat), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the Iraqi insurgency, saying,/nAll of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and killing of Americans in Iraq is a [religious] obligation so as to cause them to leave Iraq immediately.

At the Egyptian Journalists' Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question \u2013 are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word \"killing\" but rather I say \"struggle\", which is a more comprehensive word than the word \"killing\" and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill.

Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was \"the duty of every Muslim family\"[citation needed]./nHis book Fiqh al-Zakat is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of zakat. Abul Ala Maududi commented on it as \"the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)\".[19][163]\nThe prominent Deobandi Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani, said this about the work:[174]/nThe first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh and its jurisprudential theory./nHis book Fiqh al-Jihad has been widely commented on. The Guardian writes:[175]/nInstead Qaradawi encourages a \"middle way\" conception of jihad: \"solidarity\" with the Palestinians and others on the front line, rather than violence, is an obligatory form of jihad. Financial jihad, which corresponds with the obligation of alms giving (zakat), counts as well. And Muslims should recognise that technological change means that media and information systems are as much a part of the jihadist repertoire as are guns. Indeed, as long as Muslims are free to use media and other resources to press their case, there is no justification for using force to \"open\" countries for Islam./nThis book has also been analyzed by University of Southern California professor Sherman Jackson and Tunisian Islamist scholar-politician Rachid Ghannouchi.[176]/nHis views on jihad have attracted criticism from some hard line groups.[citation needed]/nYusuf al-Qaradawi wrote many books, some of which were translated into English:/nAmongst his dozens of works in Arabic, we cite:/nHe also published some excerpts of his poetry in the book Nafahat wa Lafahat. Al-Qaradawi was also the subject of the book The Global Mufti: The Phenomenon of Yusuf al-Qaradawi published by Columbia University Press.[177] He is also profiled as one of the leading liberal voices in contemporary Islam in Charles Kurzman's book Liberal Islam: A Sourcebook, published by Oxford University Press.[178]", "228428": "Heinrich Gotthard Freiherr von Treitschke (German: [\u02c8ha\u026a\u032fn.\u0281\u026a\u00e7 f\u0254n \u02c8t\u0281a\u026a\u032f.t\u0361\u0283k\u0259]; 15 September 1834 \u2013 28 April 1896) was a German historian, political writer and National Liberal member of the Reichstag during the time of the German Empire. He was an extreme nationalist,[1] who favored German colonialism and opposed the British Empire. He also opposed Catholics, Poles, Jews and socialists inside Germany./nTreitschke was born in Dresden. He was the son of an officer of the Kingdom of Saxony's army who became governor of K\u00f6nigstein and military governor of Dresden. Treitschke developed an increasing hearing problem at a young age, and so was prevented from entering public service. After studying at the universities of Leipzig and Bonn, where he was a student of Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, he established himself as a Privatdozent at Leipzig, lecturing on history and politics. At one time he became very popular with the students, but his political opinions made it impossible for the Saxon government to appoint him to a professorship.[2][3]/nAt that time Treitschke was a strong Liberal; he hoped to see Germany united into a single state with a parliamentary government, and all the smaller states annexed.[4] He praised colonialism, stating:/nEvery virile people has established colonial power. All great nations in the fullness of their strength have desired to set their mark upon barbarian lands and those who fail to participate in this great rivalry will play a pitiable role in time to come.[5]/nTreitschke also endorsed Social Darwinian theories of brutal competition among races. In an essay published in 1862, Treitschke praised the \"pitiless racial struggle\" of Germans against Lithuanians, Poles and Old Prussians; he claimed that \"magic\" emanated from \"eastern German soil\" which had been \"fertilised\" by \"noble German blood\". While his main objective was to give historical legitimisation to the Germanising of Poles in Prussia, the praise of a legendary migration eastward performed by German ancestors would eventually become a means of legitimising claims to further eastern territories.[6]/nHe was appointed professor at the University of Freiburg in 1863; in 1866, at the beginning of the Austro-Prussian War, his sympathies with the Kingdom of Prussia were so strong that he went to Berlin, became a Prussian subject, and was appointed editor of the Preussische Jahrb\u00fccher. His violent article, in which he demanded the annexation of the Kingdoms of Hanover and Saxony, and attacked with great invective the Saxon royal house, caused an estrangement from his father, a personal friend of the king. It was only equalled in its ill humour by his attacks on Bavaria during 1870.[7] After possessing appointments at the University of Kiel and the University of Heidelberg, he was made professor at Friedrich Wilhelm University (what is now named Humboldt University) in Berlin in 1874.[8]/nDefunct/nTreitschke became a member of the Reichstag in 1871 and until his death was one of the best known people in Berlin. He was largely deaf during this period and had an aide sit by his side to transcribe discussion into writing so that he could participate.[9]/nOn Heinrich von Sybel's death, Treitschke succeeded him as editor of the Historische Zeitschrift. He had outgrown his early Liberalism and become the chief panegyrist of the House of Hohenzollern. He made violent and influential attacks on all opinions and all parties which seemed in any way to be injurious to the increasing power of Germany. He endorsed Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his program to subdue the Socialists, Poles and Catholics[7] (Kulturkampf), but the attempts were unsuccessful because the victims organized themselves and used universal male suffrage to their advantage in the Reichstag until Bismarck finally relented./nA strong proponent of German colonialism, Treitschke was a strong critic of the British Empire, and his condemnations were favoured by some German imperialists. His increasingly-chauvinistic Anglophobia in the late-19th century increasingly considered England as the strongest potential adversary of the rapidly-industrialising German Empire./nIn the Reichstag, he had originally been a member of the National Liberal Party, but in 1879, he was the first to accept the new commercial policy of Bismarck. During his later years, he joined the Moderate Conservatives though his deafness prevented him from taking a prominent part in debate.[7]/nTreitschke rejected the concern of the Enlightenment and liberalism for individual rights and the separation of powers, in favour of an authoritarian monarchist and militarist concept of the state.[10][11][12] He deplored the \"penetration of French liberalism\" (Eindringen des franz\u00f6sischen Liberalismus) within the German nation.[13]/nTreitschke was one of the few celebrities who endorsed anti-Semitic attacks which became prevalent from 1879 onwards. He accused German Jews of refusing to assimilate into German culture and society and attacked the flow of Jewish immigrants from Russian Poland. Treitschke popularised the phrase \"Die Juden sind unser Ungl\u00fcck!\" (\"The Jews are our misfortune!\"), which would be adopted as a motto by the Nazi publication Der St\u00fcrmer several decades later. He made several anti-Semitic remarks such as the following:/nThe Jews at one time played a necessary role in German history, because of their ability in the management of money. But now that the Aryans have become accustomed to the idiosyncrasies of finance, the Jews are no longer necessary. The international Jew, hidden in the mask of different nationalities, is a disintegrating influence; he can be of no further use to the world.[14]/nBecause of his prominent status, Treitschke's remarks aroused widespread controversy.[15]/nTreitschke was considered favorably by the political elites of Prussia, and Chancellor Bernhard von B\u00fclow personally declared that he kept a copy of von Treitschke's book for \"several years\" on his desk.[16]/nIn 1896, Treitschke died in Berlin at 61 and is buried at the Alter St.-Matth\u00e4us-Kirchhof Berlin./nThroughout his life, Treitschke endorsed militarism and racism, praised the conquest of other nations and eradication of inferior peoples (\"Brave peoples expand, cowardly peoples perish\") and claimed that people of African heritage were \"inferior\".[17][18][19]/nEndorsing the idea of exterminating conquered nations, he wrote:/nIn the unhappy clash between races, inspired by fierce mutual enmity, the blood-stained savagery of quick war of annihilation is more humane, less revolting, than the specious clemency of sloth which keeps the vanquished in a state of brute beasts.[20]/nTreitschke considered political history as a German nationalist and emphasized periods of great political change. He was a patriotic historian devoted to Prussia. His great achievement was the History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century. The first volume was published in 1879, and for 26 years, four more volumes appeared. At his death, he had only advanced to 1847.[7]/nHe also wrote biographical and historical essays, as well as essays concerning contemporary politics. The most important essays were collected as Historische und politische Aufsatze.[21] A selection from his more controversial writings was made with the title Zehn Jahre deutscher K\u00e4mpfe. In 1896 a new volume was published, Deutsche K\u00e4mpfe, neue Folge. After his death his lectures on political subjects were published with the title Politik.[7]/nHe also published in 1856 a short volume of poems named Vaterl\u00e4ndische Gedichte and another volume the next year. His first works to be translated into English were two pamphlets on the War of 1870, What we demand from France (London, 1870) and The Baptism of Fire of the North German Confederation (1870).[7]/nTreitschke's students included Heinrich Class, Hans Delbr\u00fcck, W. E. B. Du Bois, Otto Hintze, Max Lenz, Erich Marcks, Friedrich Meinecke, Karl Peters, Gustav Schn\u00fcrer, Georg Simmel and Friedrich von Bernhardi. During World War I, many writers in the West, particularly in Britain, blamed Bernhardi for creating attitudes among the political class of Germany that were considered an incitement to war. This opinion was repeated by historians such as Fritz Fischer, who deemed him a major influence on decision-makers before World War I./nA complete translation of both volumes of Treitschke's Politics was published in London in 1916.

He spent his early years as a teacher and a village organist. At the outbreak of the French Revolution he viewed it with favor, but was soon disgusted at the violence of its methods. A critical pamphlet drew upon him the hatred of the revolutionists, and it was not until 1806 that he was able to settle in Paris. In 1809 he published his great work, Des Compensations dans les destines humaines (5th ed. 1846), which pleased Napoleon so much that he made its author professor at St Cyr. In 1811 he became inspector of the public library at Avignon, and from 1812 to 1815 he held the same position at Nancy. The Restoration government at first suspected him as a Bonapartist, but at length granted him a pension. From that time he occupied himself in lecturing and the publication of philosophical works.[1]/nIn the Compensations he sought to prove that, on the whole, happiness and misery are equally balanced, and therefore that men should accept the government which is given them rather than risk the horrors of revolution. Le principe de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 naturelle et essentielle dans les destin\u00e9es humaines conduit inevitablement au fanatisme revolutionnaire ou au fanatisme religieux.; The principles of compensation and equilibrium are found also in the physical universe, the product of matter and force, whose cause is God. Force, naturally expansive and operating on the homogeneous atoms which constitute elemental matter, is subject to the law of equilibrium, or equivalence of action and reaction. The development of phenomena under this law may be divided into three stages: the physical, the physiological, the intellectual and moral. The immaterial in man is the expansive force inherent in him. Moral and political phenomena are the result of the opposing forces of progress and preservation, and their perfection lies in the fulfilment of the law of equilibrium or universal harmony. This may be achieved in seven thousand years, when man will vanish from the world. In an additional five thousand, a similar equilibrium will obtain in the physical sphere, which will then itself pass away.[1]/nIn addition to his philosophical work, Aza\u00efs studied music under his father, Pierre Hyacinthe Aza\u00efs (1743-1796), professor of music at Sor\u00e8ze and Toulouse, and composer of sacred music in the style of Gossec.

This led him into conflict with both Christian and rabbinic institutions and caused his books to be included in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, the List of Prohibited Books by the Catholic Church./nMany details about his life appear in his short autobiography, but over the past two centuries documents uncovered in Portugal, Amsterdam, Hamburg and more have changed and added much in the picture./nDa Costa was born in Porto with the name Gabriel da Costa Fiuza. His ancestors were Crist\u00e3os-novos, or New Christians, converted from Judaism to Catholicism by state edict at 1497.[1] His father, Bento da Costa, was a well-off international merchant and tax-farmer.[2] His mother, Branca, \"seems to have been a Judaizer\", a false convert to Christianity.[3]/nStudying Catholic canon law in the University of Coimbra intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the Hebrew Bible and contemplate it seriously. Da Costa also held a benefice, an ecclesiastical office, in the Catholic Church. In his autobiography da Costa pictured his family as devout Catholics. However, they had been subjects to several investigations by the Inquisition, suggesting they were Conversos, more or less close to Jewish customs. Gabriel explicitly supported the adherence to Mosaic prescriptions as well as traditional ones.[4]/nAfter his father died, the da Costa family fell into greater financial difficulty due to unpaid debts. In 1614 they changed this predicament as they left Portugal with a significant sum of money they previously collected as tax-farmers for Jorge de Mascarenhas. Then the family headed to two major Sephardic diaspora communities. Newly circumcised, and with new Jewish names, two brothers settled in Amsterdam, and two with their mother in Hamburg. Gabriel was in Hamburg and became Uriel for the Jewish neighbors, and Adam Romez for outside relations, presumably because he was wanted in Portugal. All resumed their international trade business.[5] Upon arriving there, da Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the rabbinic leadership was too consumed by ritualism and legalistic posturing. His earliest known written message is known as Propostas contra a Tradi\u00e7\u00e3o (Propositions against the Tradition).[6] In eleven short theses he called into question the disparity between certain Jewish customs and a literal reading of the Law of Moses, and more generally tried to prove from reason and scripture that this system of law is sufficient./nIn 1616 the text was dispatched to the leaders of the prominent Jewish community in Venice. The Venetians ruled against it and prompted the Hamburg community to sanction da Costa with a herem, or excommunication. The Objections are extant only as quotes and paraphrases in Magen \u1e7fe-tsinah (\u05de\u05d2\u05df \u05d5\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4; \"Shield and Buckler\"), a longer rebuttal by Leon of Modena, of the Venice community,[7] who responded to religious queries about Costa sent by the Hamburg Jewish authorities.[8]/nDa Costa's 1616 attempts resulted in official excommunication in Venice and Hamburg. It is not known what effect this had on his life. He barely mentions it in his autobiography, and he continued his international business. In 1623 he moved to Amsterdam for unknown reasons.[9] The leaders of the Amsterdam Sephardic community were troubled by the arrival of a known heretic,[10] staged a hearing and approved the excommunication set by the previous authorities./nAt about the same time (in Hamburg or Amsterdam) da Costa was working on a second treatise. Three chapters of the unpublished manuscript were stolen, and formed the target for a traditionalist rebuttal quickly published by Semuel da Silva of Hamburg; so da Costa enlarged his book and the printed version already contains responses and revisions to the crux of the tract./nIn 1623 da Costa published the book Exame das tradi\u00e7\u00f5es phariseas (Examination of Pharisaic Traditions) in Portuguese.[12]  Da Costa's second work, more than 200 pages, is in two parts. In the first part it develops his earlier Propositions, taking into account Modena's responses and corrections. In the second part he adds his newer views that the Hebrew Bible, especially the Torah, does not support the idea of immortality of the soul. Da Costa believed that this was not an idea deeply rooted in biblical Judaism, but rather had been formulated primarily by later Pharisaic rabbis and promoted to a Jewish principles of faith. The work also pointed to discrepancies between biblical Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism. He declared the latter to be an accumulation of mechanical ceremonies and ritual practices. In his view, it was thoroughly devoid of spiritual and philosophical concepts. Da Costa was relatively early in teaching to Jewish readership in favor of the mortality of the soul, and in appealing exclusively to direct reading of the bible. He cites neither rabbinic authorities nor philosophers of the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.[13]/nThe book became very controversial among Jews in Amsterdam, whose leaders reported to the (Christian) city authorities that this was an attack on Christianity as well as on Judaism, and it was burned publicly. He was fined a significant sum. In 1627 Da Costa was a denizen of Utrecht. The Amsterdam community still had an uncomfortable relationship with him; they queried a Venetian rabbi, Yaakov Ha-Levi, whether Da Costa's elderly mother was eligible for a burial lot in the Jewish cemetery in their city; the next year the mother died and Uriel went back to Amsterdam./nUltimately, the loneliness was too much for him to handle,[14] Around 1633 he accepted the terms of reconciliation with the Jewish authorities, which he does not detail in his autobiography. He was reaccepted into the Jewish community./nShortly after that da Costa was tried again; he encountered two Christians who expressed to him their desire to convert to Judaism. In accordance with his views, he dissuaded them from doing so. Based on this and earlier accusations regarding kashrut, he was excommunicated. As he describes it, for seven years he lived in virtual isolation, shunned by his family and embroiled in civil-financial disputes with them. In search for legal help, he decided to go back being \"an ape amongst the apes\"; he would follow the traditions and practices, but with little real conviction. He sought a way of reconciliation. As a punishment for his heretical views, da Costa was publicly given 39 lashes at the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam. He was then forced to lie on the floor while the congregation trampled over him. This left him both demoralized and seeking revenge against the man (a cousin or nephew) who brought about his trial, seven years previously./nThe humiliating ritual makes the final dramatic point of his autobiography. This document is a few pages long and was transmitted to print in Latin some decades after his death, with the title Exemplar Humanae Vitae (Example of a Human Life). It tells the story of his life and intellectual development, his experience as a victim of intolerance. It also expresses rationalistic and skeptical views: It doubts whether biblical law was divinely sanctioned or whether it was simply written down by Moses. It suggests that all religion was a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. It sketches a religion to be based only on natural law, as God has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife./nTwo reports agree that da Costa committed suicide[15] in Amsterdam in 1640: Johannes M\u00fcller, a Protestant theologian of Hamburg gives the time as April, and Amsterdam Remonstrant preacher Philipp van Limborch adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself. Seeing his relative approach one day, he grabbed a pistol and pulled the trigger, but it misfired. Then he reached for another, turned it on himself, and fired, dying a reportedly terrible death./nIn his lifetime, his book Examinations inspired not only da Silva's answer, but also Menasseh ben Israel's more lasting De Resurrectione Mortuorum (1636) directed against the \"Sadducees\",[16] and a listing in the Index of Prohibited Books.[17][18]/nAfter his death, Da Costa's name became synonymous with the Exemplar Humanae Vitae. M\u00fcller publicized Da Costa's excommunication, to make an anachronistic point that some Sephardic Jews of his days are Sadducees.[19] Johann Helwig Willemer made the same point, and implied that this extreme heresy leads to suicide.[20] Pierre Bayle reported the contents of the Exemplar quite fully, to demonstrate among other things that questioning religion without turning to revelation would bring one to miserable faithlessness.[21]/nThe later Enlightenment saw Da Costa's rational religion more tolerantly. Herder eulogized him as a crusader of authentic belief.[22] Voltaire noted that he left Judaism for philosophy.[23][24] Reimarus embraced da Costa's appeal to have legal status based on the Seven Laws of Noah, when he made an analogous argument that Christian states should be at least as tolerant toward modern Deists as ancient Israelites had been.[25]/nInternally to Judaism, Da Costa has been seen as both a heretic or as martyr against the intolerance of the Rabbinic establishment. He has also been seen as a precursor to Baruch Spinoza and to modern biblical criticism.  Da Costa had a connection to the Spinoza family, through Baruch's mother, Hanna, with both families coming from Porto, in northern Portugal, and might have known each other there. The Spinozas would have known of Da Costa in the Jewish community of Amsterdam, of his troubles with authorities, and his suicide. There is a 1901 imagined portrait of da Costa and the young Spinoza, but a Spinoza biographer, Steven Nadler describes the painting as \"overwrought\" and its depiction of Spinoza being instructed by da Costa as \"pure fantasy.\"[26] Spinoza was just eight years old when Da Costa committed suicide, and he might not have known then about his family's connection to him. However, as an adolescent he likely learned the details of the public and family scandal.[27]/nDa Costa is also indicative of the difficulty that many New Christians who sought to return to their ancestral Jewish roots when faced upon their arrival in an organized Jewish community. As a Crypto-Jew in Iberia, he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the Oral Law.  As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional Pharisee and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the Sadducees and the present by the Karaites.", "57932889": "Mahmoud Amin El Alem (1922\u20132009) (alternative spelling: Mahmud Amin al-'Alim) was an award-winning Egyptian cultural critic and leading Marxist theorist.[1][2] He was a leading public intellectual in Egypt in his day.[3] El Alem was also the head of the administrative board of Akhbar el-Yom[4] and  editor of several newspapers and magazines, including Rose al-Y\u016bsuf, ar-Risala al-gadida, Magallat al-musawwir, and Qadaya fikriyya.[5]/nIn the 1940s, El Alem rose to public prominence as a famous Egyptian communist leader.[6] However, due to his political activism, he was arrested and convicted multiple times.[citation needed]/nEl Alem was expelled from the King Fuad University in 1954 for his political positions, which prevented from defending his doctoral thesis.[6][5] Thereafter, he became a political prisoner from 1959\u20131963 because of his refusal to dissolve the Egyptian Communist Party into the Socialist Union set up by then President Gamal Abdel Nasser.[6] Alongside Ismael Sabri Abdallah and Fouad Mursi, Al Elem later sought to support Arab nationalism through building an alliance between communists and nationalists to face the economic and political challenges of the Arab world.[6]/nHis 1955 book Fi al-Thaqafa al-Misriyya (On Egyptian Culture), co-authored with 'Abd al-'Azim 'Anis, applied Marxist literary criticism to contemporary Egyptian cultural works.[7]/nEl Alem was later appointed head of the National Theater Committee and became  Director of Akhbar el-Yom Press Company.[6]/nOnce Anwar Sadat assumed the presidency of Egypt, El Alem strongly opposed the Egyptian \"Infitah\" (policy of economic liberalization).

He was survived by his wife, Betty Jane, and children, Jeffrey and Jennifer. A public memorial service in Nash's honor was held at the Orlando campus of the Reformed Theological Seminary.[5]/nNash was a proponent of Biblical Christianity in regard to salvation. He argued that one had to possess explicit belief in Jesus in order to obtain salvation. He argues that John 3:16\u201318 makes it explicit that all who believe in Jesus will be saved and all who fail to believe will not be saved.[6]/nNash was the editor of On Liberation Theology, as well as one of its contributors. In this book he argues that liberation theology consists of 3 claims./nNash agrees with the first claim, but argues that attacking capitalism and seeing it replaced by socialism will achieve precisely the opposite goals sought out by liberation theologians, arguing that socialism as a means of liberation is both tragic and ironic. Liberation theologians have rejected the one system that offers real economic hope for the masses they wish to assist. Instead, they have taken a path that will not only deny their people food but also deprive them of liberty due to socialism's central control. According to Nash, when such a movement calls itself liberation theology, the label is truly ironic.[8]/nNash states that the majority of academics in his day had a strong bias against capitalism. People blamed capitalism for nearly every evil in contemporary society including greed, selfishness, materialism, fraudulent behavior, the debasement of society's tastes, the pollution of the environment, alienation, despair, and the vast disparities of wealth. Even racism and sexism are treated as effects of capitalism.[9]/nNash argued that criticisms of capitalism were really just slogans unsupported by anything resembling evidence. An undesirable feature is noted in an alleged capitalistic society, and one where a market economy supposedly functions. Then it is simply asserted that capitalism is the cause of this problem. This is known in logic as the fallacy of false cause. Mere coincidence does not prove a causal connection. Such critics of capitalism conveniently overlook the fact that the features of capitalist societies they find so offensive also exist in socialist societies.[10]/nSocialism is an umbrella term, often referring to economies with centralized control. Nash argued that the main flaw in all forms of socialism has been recognized in the 1920s by Ludwig von Mises. Mises argued that a fully centrally controlled economy can never attune to what people want unless there is a free market. Without markets, there is no way of doing cost accounting. Without cost accounting, there is no way to determine whether a good's value is worth its cost of production. This results in chaos for the economy. The way that socialist countries have been able to avoid this collapse is through monitoring the pricing information in existing free markets, and then applying this information to set prices in their own economies.[11]/nThe great paradox of socialism is the fact that socialism needs capitalism in order to survive. Unless socialist economies allow for some free markets which provide the pricing information possible, socialist economies would soon collapse. Von Mises' claims were strengthened by the fact that this is exactly what happened in cases such as the Soviet Union, where socialist states attempted to abolish all markets. The result is that no socialism in practice can dispense with market exchanges. Consequently, socialism attacks the market at the same time it is forced to utilize the market process.[12]/nSometimes called interventionism, the mixed economy is a compromise or mix, between capitalism and socialism. Most countries that we identify as \"capitalist\" and \"socialist\" are really different degrees of a mixed economy. Nash argues that there can never be a sustainable mixed economy. Any economy that tries to mix socialism and capitalism will inevitably collapse into one of the two.[13]/nNash is a critic of the Christian left, particularly Jim Wallis, Ron Sider, and Tony Campolo.[14] He argues that this group has good intentions for helping the poor, but flawed economic theory.[15] He states that the criticisms generally leveled against capitalism are in fact criticisms of government intrusion into market activities. He argues that economic exchanges come in two varieties: by peaceful means and by violent means. The former can be stated as \"if you do something good for me, I will do something good for you.\" The latter can be stated as \"if you do not do something good for me, I will do something bad for you.\" Government intervention into the economy, such as by income taxes, are part of the latter system, and not the former.[16] He states that socialism, by definition, cannot be voluntary, since under socialism, capital is either owned or controlled by the state.[17] Nash states that the problem with this system is that it shuts off important signals that entrepreneurs might otherwise use in making economic decisions. When the government owns the land, labor, utilities, factory, and other factors of production, it becomes impossible to tell how much it costs to produce a good or service. The Soviet Union was able to function because it sent spies to capitalist nations to obtain pricing information.[18]/nCapitalism, Nash argues, is not economic anarchy. He states that capitalism is a system of voluntary relationships which protect people's rights against force, fraud, theft, and violations of contract.[19] Nash states that the Christian left argues that capitalism encourages greed. Nash retorts that capitalism is the one mechanism that neutralizes greed, as it forces people to find ways of serving the needs of those with whom they wish to exchange. As long as greedy people are prohibited from introducing force, fraud, and theft into the exchange process and as long as they cannot secure special privileges from the state under interventionist or socialist arrangements, their greed must be channeled into the discovery of products or services for which people are willing to trade.[20]/nNash has criticized Jim Wallis for celebrating what Wallis called the American defeat in the Vietnam War. While Wallis identified as anti-war, Wallis criticized those who protested against the North Vietnamese military campaign and human rights violations.[21] Nash writes \"Wallis's response to the Cambodian Communists' slaughter of two million men, women, and children was to deny the bloodbath and blame whatever else might happen on the United States.  Wallis, Nash argues, did the same for the Soviet Union, refusing to condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, instead believing that America posed the greatest threat to world peace.[22]/nNash argued that despite claiming to be a moderate, Wallis actually holds a Marxist worldview, since Wallis argued in his document The Road To Damascus that anti-Communist Christians are members of the forces of darkness and should convert to Marxism./nAccording to Nash, Ron Sider influenced the leadership of evangelical Christian colleges. One college president stated publicly that he would not hire any faculty for his school who were not in sympathy with Sider's position on Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger.[23]/nNash, Ronald. \"What is Money?\".

He had served in the states of Lu and Wei (\u9b4f, not to be confused with W\u00e8i, currently spelled as Wey as in previous note). In the state of Wei he commanded many great battles and was appointed Xihe Shou (Mayor of Xihe county). Xihe was the area between the Yellow and Luo Rivers that Wei had just taken from Qin. Later, after he became estranged from the lord of Wei and was forced into exile, Wu Qi went to the State of Chu where he was appointed Prime minister by King Dao of Chu (\u695a\u60bc\u738b). His reforms made Chu a strong state at that time. The reforms he instituted enraged the old nobility of Chu and he was killed after the death of King Dao./nWu's reforms, which started around 389 BC, were generally aimed at changing the corrupt and inefficient government. The nobility and officialdom were terribly corrupt and the government was burdened with the costs of paying them and a horde of other minor officials. Wu first lowered the annual salary of Chu officials, then dismissed officials who were useless or incompetent. He also eliminated hereditary privileges after three generations. The money saved by cutting costs was used to create and train a more professional army./nAnother of Wu's actions was to move all the nobles to the borders on the frontier, away from the capital, in order to reduce their power and at the same time populate those areas, making them more useful to the state government. He is also credited with devising a set of building codes in Ying, in order to make the city look less \"barbaric\", and more in line with 'civilized' Chinese architectural aesthetics./nAlthough his reforms soon started to make Chu a powerful country, the nobles and Daoists of Chu hated him. Nobles accused him of trying to change the old ways, and even managed to find fault with the building codes. Daoists accused him of being a \"warmonger\" and an \"admirer of force and weaponry\", even going as far as to say that he was \"a threat to humanity\". He was accused of not returning for the mourning period of his mother's death and for murdering his own wife (who was the daughter of a noble from the rival state of Qi) in order to gain trust from the ruler of the state of Lu.  There is no definitive evidence to the truth of these accusations, and it is possible  they were manufactured by Wu Qi's political enemies to slander him./nIn the wake of Wu Qi's reforms, Chu's prowess was quickly manifest: Chu defeated the Yue state in the south and the Wei in the north, dealing with each in quick succession. However, King Dao died that same year. The old nobles plotted to assassinate Wu Qi at King Dao's funeral, where he would be separated from the army. Wu Qi spotted the assassins armed with bows, and rushed to the side of King Dao's body. He was killed, but many arrows struck the dead King. The new King Su (\u695a\u8083\u738b), furious at his father's body being mutilated, ordered all nobles involved to be executed, along with their families./nAccording to the Wei Liaozi, a treatise on military matters dating from the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, the general Wu Qi was once offered a sword by his subordinates on the eve of battle. However Wu Qi refused to accept the weapon on the basis that banners and drums, the tools to lead and command, were the only instruments a general required. In his words, \"to command the troops and direct their blades, this is the role of a commander. To wield a single sword is not his role.\"[1] The point here is to highlight the idea that the general was the brain of the army, whereas the soldiers were to behave as the limbs. Heroic individual actions were disincentivized in preference to complete obedience and perfect coordination as a unit, a concept which the Wei Liaozi elucidates upon in another parable concerning Wu Qi: Prior to the beginning of a battle, one of Wu's soldiers broke from his ranks in his enthusiasm and charged the enemy line, slaying two men, and trotted back to his former position along with their heads as trophies. Wu immediately ordered the man to be put to death. When his officers protested that he was a fine warrior, Wu Qi answered, \"He is indeed a fine warrior, but he disobeyed my orders.\"[1] As with Sun Tzu and his Art of War, Wu Qi emphasized discipline and obedience before bravery as the most important traits in soldiery./nHe and Sun Zi are often mentioned in the same sentence (Sun-Wu, \u5b59\u5434) as great military strategists of similar if not equal importance./nHis military treatise, the Wuzi, is included as one of the Seven Military Classics. It is said there were two books on the art of war by Wu Qi, but one was lost, hence leaving the Wuzi as the only existing book carrying Wu Qi's military thoughts./nWu Qi is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game series Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game) by Koei.", "4553868": "David Neil Corfield is a British philosopher specializing in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of psychology.

Magee was educated at Christ's Hospital school on a London County Council scholarship. During this formative period, he developed a keen interest in socialist politics, while during the school holidays he enjoyed listening to political orators at Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park, London, as well as regular visits to the theatre and concerts.[3][5]/nDuring his National Service he served in the British Army, in the Intelligence Corps,[3] seeking possible spies among the refugees crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Austria. After demobilisation he won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied History as an undergraduate and then Philosophy, Politics and Economics in one year.[6] His friends at Oxford included Robin Day, William Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Thorpe and Michael Heseltine. While at university, Magee was elected president of the Oxford Union. He later became an honorary fellow at Keble College.[7]/nAt Oxford, Magee had mixed with poets as well as politicians and in 1951 published a volume of verse through the Fortune Press. The publisher did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves \u2013 a similar deal had been struck with such writers as Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin for their first anthologies.

It has always been a dimension of what I do.\"[3] (Later he would also publish fiction, including a spy novel To Live in Danger in 1960 and then a long work Facing Death.

His deep admiration of the country's equality of opportunity was expressed in a swift series of books, Go West, Young Man (1958), The New Radicalism (1963) and The Democratic Revolution (1964).[11] He taught philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford for a period but was not enamoured of the  analytical philosophy then in vogue there.[4]/nMagee returned to Britain with hopes of becoming a Labour Member of Parliament (MP). He twice stood unsuccessfully for Mid Bedfordshire, at the 1959 general election and the 1960 by-election, and instead took a job presenting the ITV current affairs television programme This Week. He made documentary programmes about subjects of social concern such as prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion and homosexuality (illegal in Britain at the time).[3] Interviewed in 2003, Magee said:/nBritish society was illiberal in a number of areas that are now taken for granted... Roy Jenkins changed them and he was bitterly opposed by the Tories. But if you were liberal with a small L there was a menu of social change and I believed very strongly in that whole liberal agenda.[12]/nHe was eventually elected MP for Leyton at the February 1974 general election, but from 1981 found himself out of tune with the Labour Party's direction under Michael Foot.[12] On 22 January 1982 he resigned the Labour whip and in March joined the defection of centrist Labour MPs to the newly founded Social Democratic Party. He lost his seat at the 1983 general election.[12]/nMagee returned to writing and broadcasting which, indeed, he had continued during his parliamentary career and would also serve on various boards and committees.

The series began with an introductory conversation between Magee and Anthony Quinton. Other programmes included discussions on Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore and J. L. Austin, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the relationship between philosophy and religion, among others. Extracts of each of the conversations were printed in The Listener shortly after broadcast.[16] And extensively revised versions of all the discussions would be made available in the 1971 book Modern British Philosophy.[14][3] Karl Popper would appear in the series twice and Magee would soon after write an introductory book on his philosophy that was first published in 1973.[17]/nIn 1978 Magee presented 15 dialogues with noted philosophers for BBC Television in a series called Men of Ideas. This was a series that, as noted in The Daily Telegraph, \"achieved the near-impossible feat of presenting to a mass audience recondite issues of philosophy without compromising intellectual integrity or losing ratings\" and \"attracted a steady one million viewers per show.\"[2] Following an \"Introduction to Philosophy\", presented by Magee in discussion with Isaiah Berlin, Magee discussed topics like Marxist philosophy, the Frankfurt School, the ideas of Noam Chomsky and modern Existentialism in subsequent episodes. During the broadcast run, edited shorter versions of the discussions were published weekly in The Listener magazine.[18] Extensively revised versions of the dialogues within the Men of Ideas series (which featured Iris Murdoch)[19] were originally published in a book of the same name[20] that is now sold under the title of Talking Philosophy.[15] DVDs of the series are sold to academic institutions with the title Contemporary Philosophy.[21] Neither this series nor its 1987 'sequel' are available for purchase by home users but most of the episodes are freely available on Youtube.[22][23]/nAnother BBC television series, The Great Philosophers, followed in 1987. In this series, Magee discussed the major historical figures of Western philosophy with fifteen contemporary philosophers. The series covered the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, among others, including a discussion with Peter Singer on the philosophy of Marx and Hegel,[24] and ending with a discussion with John Searle on the philosophy of Wittgenstein.[25] Extensively revised versions of the dialogues were published in a book of the same name that was published that same year.[26] Magee's 1998 book The Story of Thought (also published as The Story of Philosophy) would also cover the history of Western philosophy.[11]/nBetween the two series, Magee released the first edition of the work he regarded as closest to his \"academic magnum opus\": The Philosophy of Schopenhauer (first published in 1983, substantially revised and extended, 1997).[27][28] This remains one of the most substantial and wide-ranging treatments of the thinker and assesses in-depth Schopenhauer's influence on Wittgenstein, Wagner and other creative writers. Magee also addresses Schopenhauer's thoughts on homosexuality and the influence of Buddhism on his thought.[27]/nIn 1997 Magee's Confessions of a Philosopher was published.[29][30][31] This essentially offered an introduction to philosophy in autobiographical form. The book was involved in a libel lawsuit as a result of Magee repeating the rumour that Ralph Schoenman, a controversial associate of Bertrand Russell during the philosopher's final decade, had been planted by the CIA in an effort to discredit Russell. Schoenman successfully sued Magee for libel in the UK, with the result that the first printing of the British edition of the book was pulped.[32] A second defamation suit, filed in California against Random House, was settled in 2001. The allegations were expunged by settlement, and a new edition was issued and provided to more than 700 academic and public libraries.[33] In Confessions of a Philosopher, Magee charts his own philosophical development in an autobiographical context. He also emphasizes the importance of Schopenhauer's philosophy as a serious attempt to solve philosophical problems. In addition to this, he launches a critique of analytic philosophy, particularly in its linguistic form over three chapters, contesting its fundamental principles and lamenting its influence.[34]/nMagee had a particular interest in the life, thought and music of Richard Wagner and wrote two notable books on the composer and his world, Aspects of Wagner (1968; rev. 1988),[35] and Wagner and Philosophy (2000).[36][37] In Aspects of Wagner Magee \"outlines the range and depth of Wagner's achievement, and shows how his sensational and erotic music expresses the repressed and highly charged contents of the psyche. He also examines Wagner's detailed stage directions, and the prose works in which he formulated his ideas, and sheds interesting new light on his anti-semitism.\" The revised edition includes a fresh chapter on \"Wagner as Music\".[38]/nIn 2016, approaching his 86th birthday, Magee had his book Ultimate Questions published by Princeton University. Writing in The Independent, Julian Baggini said \"Magee doesn't always match his clarity of expression with rigour of argument, sometimes ignoring his own principle that the feeling 'Yes, surely this must be right' is 'not a validation, not even a credential'. But this can be excused. Plato and Aristotle claimed that philosophy begins with wonder. Magee is proof that for some, the wonder never dies, it only deepens.\"[39]/nIn 2018 Magee, who was then living in one room in a nursing hospital in Oxford, was interviewed by Jason Cowley of New Statesman and discussed his life and his 2016 book Ultimate Questions. Magee said that he believed he lacked originality and, until Ultimate Questions, had struggled to make an original contribution to philosophy, saying:/nPopper had this originality, Russell had it, and Einstein had it in spades. Einstein created a way of seeing things which transformed the way we see the world and the way we even understand such fundamental things as time and space. And I fundamentally understand that I could never do that, never. I wish I was in that class \u2013 not because I want to be a clever chap but because I want to do things that are at a much better level than I've done them./nHe explained that he followed the news and politics closely and that he considered the vote for Brexit to have been a \"historic mistake\".[40]/nIn 1953, Magee was appointed to a teaching job in Sweden and while there met Ingrid S\u00f6derlund, a pharmacist in the university laboratory. They married and had one daughter, Gunnela and, in time, three grandchildren. Magee later said:/nThe marriage broke up pretty quickly and it was a fairly disastrous period of my life. I came back to Oxford as a postgraduate. But since then Sweden has been a part of my life. I go there every year and my daughter visits me. I always assumed that sooner or later I'd get married again but it never quite happened, although I had some very long relationships. And now I don't want to get married again. I like the freedom.[3]/nHis memoir, Clouds of Glory: A Hoxton Childhood, won The Ackerley Prize in 2004.[41]/nMagee died on 26 July 2019, at the age of 89, at St Luke's Hospital in Headington, Oxford.[4] He is survived by his Swedish daughter Gunnela and her children and grandchildren.[42][2][4] His funeral took place on 15 August.[43][44]/nThe last of Magee's books to be published during his lifetime \u2013 Making the Most of It (2018) \u2013 closes:[45][43]/nIf it could be revealed to me for certain that life is meaningless, and that my lot when I die will be timeless oblivion, and I were then asked: \"Knowing these things, would you, if given the choice, still choose to have been born?\", my answer would be a shouted \"Yes!\" I have loved living. Even if the worst-case scenario is the true one, what I have had has been infinitely better than nothing. In spite of what has been wrong with my life, and in spite of what has been wrong with me, I am inexpressibly grateful to have lived. It is terrible and terrifying to have to die, but even the prospect of eternal annihilation is a price worth paying for being alive./nA celebration of his life was held in the chapel of Keble College, Oxford, on 29 October 2019. The event was opened by Sir Jonathan Phillips, Warden of Keble College, and was introduced by Magee's executor, the academic, author and editor Henry Hardy. It included audio and video clips of Magee, music chosen by him and played by the Amherst Sextet, and addresses by David Owen and Simon Callow. The music choices were the sextet from Strauss's Capriccio, the largo from Elgar's Serenade for Strings and the prelude to Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.[46] The addresses by Owen and Callow were published together with a notice of Magee's life by Hardy in the Oldie.[47]/n(Some available for loan on Open Library)/nAt JSTOR \u2013 free to read online with registration:[74]/nOther written works", "195726": "Rose Wilder Lane (December 5, 1886 \u2013 October 30, 1968) was an American writer and daughter of American writer Laura Ingalls Wilder. Along with two other female writers, Ayn Rand and Isabel Paterson, Lane is one of the more influential advocates of the American libertarian movement./nLane was the first child of Laura Ingalls Wilder and Almanzo Wilder and the only child of her parents to survive into adulthood. Her early years were a difficult time for her parents because of successive crop failures, illnesses and chronic economic hardships. During her childhood, the family moved several times, living with relatives in Minnesota and then Florida and briefly returning to De Smet, South Dakota, then settling in Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894. There, her parents eventually established a dairy farm and fruit orchards. She attended secondary school in Mansfield and Crowley, Louisiana while living with her aunt Eliza Jane Wilder, graduating in 1904 in a class of seven.[1] Her intellect and ambition were demonstrated by her ability to compress three years of Latin into one and by graduating at the top of her high school class in Crowley. Despite her academic success, she was unable to attend college as a result of her parents' financial situation.[2][3]/nAfter high school graduation, Lane returned to her parents' home in Mansfield and learned telegraphy at the Mansfield railroad station. Not satisfied with the options open to young women in Mansfield, by early 1905 she was working for Western Union in Sedalia, Missouri.[4] By 1906, Lane was working as a telegrapher at the Midland Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri].[5] Over the next five years, Lane worked as a telegrapher in Missouri, Indiana and California.[3][6]/nIn 1908, Lane moved to San Francisco, where she worked as a telegrapher at the Fairmont Hotel. In March 1909, Lane married salesman, promoter and occasional newspaperman Claire Gillette Lane. Evidence exists that suggests the Lanes had met back in Kansas City and Lane's diary hints that she moved to San Francisco to join her future husband. Shortly after they wed, Lane quit her job with Western Union and the couple embarked on travels across the United States to promote various schemes.[clarification needed] Lane soon became pregnant. While staying in Salt Lake City the following November, Lane gave birth to a premature, stillborn son, according to public records.[7] Subsequent surgery in Kansas City likely left her unable to bear children. The topic is mentioned only briefly in a handful of existing letters written by Lane years after the infant's death in order to express sympathy and understanding to close friends who were also dealing with the loss of a child./nFor the next few years, the Lanes continued to live a nomadic lifestyle, including stays in Missouri, Ohio, New York and Maine to work together and separately on various promotional and advertising projects. While letters to her parents described a happy-go-lucky existence, Lane's subsequent diary entries and numerous autobiographical magazine articles later described her mindset at this time as depressed and disillusioned with her marriage.  She felt her intellectual interests did not mesh with the life she was living with her husband. One account even had her attempting suicide by drugging herself with chloroform only to awake with a headache and a renewed sense of purpose in life.[8]/nDuring these years, Lane, keenly aware of her lack of a formal education, read voraciously and taught herself several languages. Her writing career began around 1908, with occasional freelance newspaper jobs that earned much-needed extra cash.[9] In 1913 and 1914, the Lanes sold farm land in what is now the San Jose/Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Conditions often required them to work separately to earn greater commissions and of the two, Lane turned out to be the better salesperson.[clarification needed] The marriage foundered as there were several periods of separation and eventually an amicable divorce. Lane's diaries reveal subsequent romantic involvements with several men in the years following her divorce, but she never remarried and eventually chose to remain single and free of romantic attachments./nThe threat of America's entry into World War I had seriously weakened the real estate market, so in early 1915 Lane accepted a friend's offer of a stopgap job as an editorial assistant on the staff of the San Francisco Bulletin.[10] The stopgap turned into a watershed. She immediately caught the attention of her editors not only through her talents as a writer in her own right, but also as a highly skilled editor for other writers. Before long, her photo and byline were running in the Bulletin daily, churning out formulaic romantic fiction serials that ran for weeks at a time. Lane's first-hand accounts of the lives of Henry Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack London and Herbert Hoover were published in book form./nLater in 1915, Lane's mother visited San Francisco for several months. Together they attended the Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition. Details of this visit and Wilder's daily life in 1915 are preserved in Wilder's letters to her husband in West from Home, published in 1974. Although Lane's diaries indicate she was separated from her husband in 1915, her mother's letters do not indicate this. Lane and her husband are recorded as living together with him unemployed and looking for work during her mother's two-month visit. It seems the separation was either covered up, or had not yet involved separate households.[citation needed]/nBy 1918, Lane's marriage officially ended and she had quit her job with the San Francisco Bulletin following the resignation of managing editor, Fremont Older. It was at this point that Lane launched her career as a freelance writer. From this period through the early 1940s, her work regularly appeared in leading publications such as Harper's, Saturday Evening Post, Sunset, Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal. Several of her short stories were nominated for O. Henry Prizes, and a few novels became top sellers./nLane became the first biographer of Herbert Hoover, writing The Making of Herbert Hoover in 1920 in collaboration with Charles K. Field, editor of Sunset magazine. The book was published well before Hoover became president in 1929. A friend and defender of Hoover's for the remainder of her life, many of her personal papers would later be included in the Rose Wilder-Lane Collection at the Herbert Hoover Library in West Branch, Iowa. While Lane's papers contain little actual correspondence between them, the Hoover Post-Presidential Individual series contains a file of Rose's correspondence that spans from 1936 to 1963.[11]/nIn the late 1920s, Lane was reputed to be one of the highest-paid female writers in America and along with Hoover counted among her friends well-known figures such as Sinclair Lewis, Isabel Paterson, Dorothy Thompson, John Patric and Lowell Thomas. Despite this success, her compulsive generosity with her family and friends often found her strapped for cash and forced to work on material that paid well, but thus did not engage her growing interests in political theory and world history. She suffered from periodic bouts of self-doubt and depression in mid-life, diagnosing herself as having bipolar disorder.[citation needed] During these times of depression, Lane was unable to move ahead with her own writing, but she would easily find work as a ghostwriter or silent editor for other well-known writers. In 1928, Lane returned to the United States to live on her parents' farm. Confident in her sales of her books and short stories as well as her growing stock market investments, she spent freely, building a new home for her parents on the property and modernizing the farmhouse for herself and a steady stream of visiting literary friends./nLane's occasional work as a traveling war correspondent began with a stint with the American Red Cross Publicity Bureau in post-World War I Europe. She continued with the Red Cross through 1965, reporting from Vietnam at the age of 78 for Woman's Day magazine to provide \"a woman's point of view\". She traveled extensively in Europe and Asia as part of the Red Cross. In 1926, Lane, Helen Dore Boylston and their French maid traveled from France to Albania in a car they had named Zenobia. An account of the journey called Travels With Zenobia: Paris to Albania by Model T Ford was published in 1983. Lane became enamored with Albania and lived there for several long periods during the 1920s, spaced between sojourns to Paris and her parents' Rocky Ridge Farm in Missouri. She informally adopted a young Albanian boy named Rexh Meta (pronounced [r\u025bd\u0361\u0292 m\u025bta]), who she claimed saved her life on a dangerous mountain trek.[12] She later sponsored his education at Cambridge University.[13] He served in the Albanian government and was imprisoned for over thirty years by both the Italian fascists and the Albanian communists, dying in Tirana in 1985.[14][15]/nLane's role in her mother's Little House book series has remained unclear.[16] Her parents had invested with her broker upon her advice and when the market crashed the Wilders found themselves in difficult times. Lane came to the farm at 46 years old, divorced and childless, with minimal finances to keep her afloat.[17]/nIn late 1930, Lane's mother approached her with a rough, first-person narrative manuscript outlining her hardscrabble pioneer childhood, Pioneer Girl. Lane took notice and started using her connections in the publishing world. Despite Lane's efforts to market Pioneer Girl through her publishing connections, the manuscript was rejected time and again. One editor recommended crafting a novel for children out of the beginning. Wilder and Lane worked on the idea[18] and the result was Little House in the Big Woods. Accepted for publishing by Harper and Brothers in late 1931, then hitting the shelves in 1932, the book's success resulted in the decision to continue the series, following young Laura into young adulthood. The First Four Years was discovered as a manuscript after Lane's death in 1968. Wilder had written the manuscript about the first four years of her marriage and the struggles of the frontier, but she never had intended for it to be published. However, in 1971 it became the ninth volume in the Little House series.[19]/nThe collaboration between the two is believed by literary historians to have benefited Lane's career as much as her mother's. Lane's most popular short stories and her two most commercially successful novels were written at this time and were fueled by material which was taken directly from Wilder's recollections of Ingalls-Wilder family folklore. Let the Hurricane Roar (later titled Young Pioneers) and Free Land both addressed the difficulties of homesteading in the Dakotas in the late 19th century and how the so-called \"free land\" in fact cost homesteaders their life savings. The Saturday Evening Post paid Lane top fees to serialize both novels, which were later adapted for popular radio performances. Both books represented Lane's creative and literary peak. The Saturday Evening Post paid her $30,000 in 1938 to serialize her best-selling novel Free Land ($623,688 by today's standards). Let the Hurricane Roar saw an increasing and steady sale, augmented by its adaptation into popular radio dramatization that starred Helen Hayes./nIn 1938, with the proceeds of Free Land in hand, Lane was able to pay all of her accumulated debts. She moved to Danbury, Connecticut and purchased a rural home there with three wooded acres, on which she lived for the rest of her life. At this same time, the growing royalties from the Little House books were providing Lane's parents with an assured and sufficient income. Lane bought her parents an automobile and financed construction of the Rock House near the Wilder homestead. Her parents resided in the Rock House during much of the 1930s./nDuring World War II, Lane enjoyed a new phase in her writing career. From 1942 to 1945, she wrote a weekly column for The Pittsburgh Courier, at the time the most widely read African-American newspaper.[citation needed]/nRather than hiding or trimming her laissez-faire views, Lane seized the chance to sell them to the readership. She sought out topics of special interest to her audience. Her first entry characterized the Double V campaign as part of the more general fight for individual liberty in the United States, writing: \"Here, at last, is a place where I belong. Here are the Americans who know the value of equality and freedom\". Her columns highlighted success stories of blacks to illustrate broader themes about entrepreneurship, freedom and creativity. In one, she compared the accomplishments of Robert Lee Vann and Henry Ford. Vann's rags to riches story illustrated the benefits in a \"capitalist society in which a penniless orphan, one of a despised minority can create The Pittsburgh Courier and publicly, vigorously, safely, attack a majority opinion\" while Ford's showed how a poor mechanic can create \"hundreds of jobs, [...] putting even beggars into cars\".[20]/nLane combined advocacy of laissez faire and anti-racism. The views she expressed on race were similar to those of Zora Neale Hurston, a fellow individualist and writer who was black. Her columns emphasized the arbitrariness of racial categories and stressed the centrality of the individual. Instead of indulging in what she referred to as the \"ridiculous, idiotic and tragic fallacy of race, [by] which a minority of the earth's population has deluded itself during the past century\", Lane believed it was time for all Americans. black and white, to \"renounce their race\". Judging by skin color was comparable to the communists who assigned guilt or virtue on the basis of class. In Lane's view, the fallacies of race and class hearkened to the \"old English-feudal 'class' distinction\". She further believed that the collectivists, including those who embraced President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, were to blame for filling \"young minds with fantasies of 'races' and 'classes' and 'the masses,' all controlled by pagan gods, named Economic Determinism or Society or Government\".[21]/nAlong with Hurston and Paterson, Lane was critical of Roosevelt on his foreign policy and was against drafting young men into a foreign war.[22]/nFor a few months in 1940, Lane's growing zeal for libertarianism united her with the well-known vagabond free-lance writer John Patric, a like-minded political thinker whose advocacy of libertarian themes culminated in his 1943 work Yankee Hobo in the Orient. They spent several months traveling across the country in Patric's automobile to observe the effects of the Great Depression on the nation and to exchange ideas. The trip culminated in a two-month stay in Bellingham, Washington.[23]/nIn the early 1940s, despite continuing requests from editors for both fiction and non-fiction material, Lane turned away from commercial fiction writing, save for her collaboration on her mother's books. At this time, she became known among libertarians as influential in the movement. She vehemently opposed the New Deal, eschewed \"creeping socialism\", Social Security, wartime rationing, and all forms of taxation. Lane ceased writing highly paid commercial fiction to protest paying income taxes. Living on a small salary from her newspaper column and no longer needing to support her parents or adopted sons, she cut expenses to the bare minimum, living a modern-day version of her ancestors' pioneer life on her rural land near Danbury. She gained some media attention for her refusal to accept a ration card, instead working cooperatively with her rural neighbors to grow and preserve fruits and vegetables and to raise chickens and pigs for meat. Literary critic and political writer Isabel Paterson had urged Lane to move to Connecticut, where she would be only \"up country a few miles\" from Paterson, who had been a friend for many years.[24]/nAfter experiencing it first hand in the Soviet Union during her travels with the Red Cross, Lane was a staunch opponent of communism. As a result, Lane's initial writings on individualism and conservative government began while she was still writing popular fiction in the 1930s, culminating with The Discovery of Freedom (1943). After this point, Lane promoted and wrote about individual freedom and its impact on humanity. The same year also saw the publication of Paterson's The God of the Machine and Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead. Because of these writings, the three women have been referred to as the founding mothers of the American libertarian movement.[25][26]/nWriter Albert Jay Nock wrote that Lane and Paterson's nonfiction works were \"the only intelligible books on the philosophy of individualism that have been written in America this century\". The two women had \"shown the male world of this period how to think fundamentally...[T]hey don't fumble and fiddle around \u2013 every shot goes straight to the centre\". Journalist John Chamberlain credits Rand, Paterson and Lane with his final \"conversion\" from socialism to what he called \"an older American philosophy\" of libertarian and conservative ideas.[27]/nIn 1943, Lane came into the national spotlight through her response to a radio poll on Social Security. She mailed in a post-card with a response likening the Social Security system to a Ponzi scheme that would, she felt, ultimately destroy the United States. Wartime monitoring of mail eventually resulted in a Connecticut State Trooper being dispatched to her home to question her motives. Her strong response to this infringement on her right of free speech resulted in a flurry of newspaper articles and the publishing of a pamphlet, \"What is this, the Gestapo?\", that was meant to remind Americans to be watchful of their rights despite the wartime exigencies.[28]  The pamphlet was distributed by the National Economic Council, Inc, an anti-Semitic organization that supported the fascist government in Spain.[29]  During this time period, an FBI file was compiled on Lane./nAs Lane aged, her political opinions solidified as a stalwart libertarian. Her defense of what she considered to be basic American principles of liberty and freedom were seen by some as harsh and abrasive in the face of disagreement. It is documented that during this time period that she broke with her old friend and political ally Isabel Paterson in 1946.[30] During this time period and into the 1950s, Lane also had an acrimonious correspondence with socialist writer Max Eastman.[31]/nLane played a hands-on role during the 1940s and 1950s in launching the libertarian movement[25][26] and began an extensive correspondence with figures such as DuPont executive Jasper Crane and writer Frank Meyer as well as her friend and colleague Ayn Rand.[32] She wrote book reviews for the National Economic Council and later for the Volker Fund, out of which grew the Institute for Humane Studies. Later, she lectured at and gave generous financial support to the Freedom School headed by libertarian Robert LeFevre.[20]/nWith her mother's death in 1957, ownership of the Rocky Ridge Farm house reverted to the farmer who had earlier bought the property on a life lease, allowing her to remain in residence. The local population put together a non-profit corporation to purchase the house and its grounds for use as a museum. After some wariness at the notion of seeing the house rather than the books themselves be a shrine to Lane's mother, she came to believe that making it into a museum would draw long-lasting attention to the books and sustain the theme of individualism she and her mother wove into the series. She donated the money needed to purchase the house and make it a museum, agreed to make significant contributions each year for its upkeep and also gave many of the family's belongings to the group.[33] Lane's lifetime inheritance of Wilder's growing Little House royalties enabled her to again travel extensively and thoroughly renovated and remodeled her Connecticut home. Also during the 1960s, she revived her own commercial writing career by publishing several popular magazine series, including one about her tour of the Vietnam War zone in late 1965./nIn later years, Lane wrote a book detailing the history of American needlework for Woman's Day. She edited and published On the Way Home, providing an autobiographical setting around her mother's original 1894 diary of their six-week journey from South Dakota to Missouri. Intended to serve as the capstone to the Little House series, the book was the result of Wilder's fans who were writing to Lane asking \"what happened next?\". She contributed book reviews to the William Volker Fund and continued to work on revisions of The Discovery of Freedom, which she never completed./nLane was the adoptive grandmother and mentor to Roger Lea MacBride, later the Libertarian Party's 1976 candidate for president.[34] The son of one of her editors with whom she formed a close bond when he was a boy, Lane later stated she was grooming him to be a future Libertarian thought leader. In addition to being her close friend, MacBride became her attorney and business manager and ultimately the heir to the Little House series and the multimillion-dollar franchise that he built around it after her death./nThe last of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to be taken under Lane's wing was the sister of her Vietnamese interpreter. Impressed by the young girl's intelligence, Lane helped to bring her to the United States and sponsored her enrollment in college.[35]/nLane died in her sleep at age 81 on October 30, 1968, just as she was about to depart on a three-year world tour. She was buried next to her parents at Mansfield Cemetery in Mansfield, Missouri.[citation needed]/nLane was portrayed in the television adaptations of Little House on the Prairie by:/nThere are eight novels written by MacBride, telling of her childhood and early youth. Despite assertions of the accuracy of the locations, dates and people mentioned, there is heavy debate on the degree of authenticity. At least some events may be accurately represented as he was a close friend of hers./nIn the novel Pioneer Girl by Bich Minh Nguyen, a young Vietnamese-American Lee Lien researches Lane's life based on an old family story. Lee's grandfather claims that Lane became friendly with the family while visiting Vietnam in 1965 and gifted them with a gold brooch, suspected to be the one Almanzo gave to Lane's mother as described in These Happy Golden Years.[36]/nIn the novel A Wilder Rose by Susan Wittig Albert, Lane tells the story of her work on the Little House books and her years at the Wilder farm (1928\u20131935) to Norma Lee Browning, a young friend. The novel is based on Lane's diaries and journals of the period and letters exchanged with her mother./nIn the alternate history novel The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith in which the United States becomes a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, Lane served as the 21st president of the North American Confederacy from 1940 to 1952.", "63962257": "Jean-Paul Gagnon is a social and political philosopher, director of the Foundation for the Philosophy of Democracy[1] and a senior lecturer of politics at the University of Canberra.[2] He specialises in democratic theory and the philosophy of democracy.

On one occasion, he secretly smuggled a briefcase to a man in Vienna he later found to be Josip Broz Tito. After finishing grammar school in Zagreb in 1934, he continued pursuing his education in Vienna for a brief period, then moved to Z\u00fcrich studying mathematics, physics, biology and philosophy.[1] Increasingly interested in quantum physics and its philosophical consequences, he moved to Leipzig where in 1940 he obtained his PhD in physics under Werner Heisenberg. He worked on problems of superconductivity, but ultimately his doctoral dissertation was on electrical conductivity in metals in low temperatures. In March 1941 he was arrested by the Gestapo for being involved in antifascist activity and held in prison for many months. His professors, Heisenberg, Hund and von Weizs\u00e4cker intervened to release him from prison. Immediately after being released, instead of returning to Leipzig, he went back to Independent State of Croatia and joined the communist antifascist Yugoslav Partisans movement.[1] He would not return to physics research again, focusing on his philosophical and literary work./nSupek was a proponent of total and unconditional nuclear disarmament, having already in 1944, fourteen months before the bombing of Hiroshima warned on the danger of misuse of atomic energy./nIn 1946 he became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zagreb. His main contribution to physics was the discovery of the differential equation for electrical conductivity at low temperatures. In 1950 he advocated the construction of the Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 institute in Zagreb and became one of its founders. He was excluded from it in 1958 due to his disagreement with the Yugoslav Federal Commission for Nuclear Energy and his unwillingness to participate in a project for building the atomic bomb (an idea Josip Broz Tito himself did not like much, and which was subsequently abandoned). After that, he stopped active research in theoretical physics and continued researching philosophy and literature./nIn 1960 he was accepted into the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (since 1991 the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) of which he was president from 1991 to 1997, and in 1968 he became the rector of the University of Zagreb, serving two terms until 1972, during the turbulent times of the Croatian Spring. In 1960 he founded the Institute for the Philosophy of Science and Peace, as a section of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. The Institute was also a center of the nuclear disarmament movement, the Pugwash Conference for Yugoslavia, of which he was one of the founders and a member of its Permanent Committee. In 1970 he initiated the establishing of the Interuniversity Centre in Dubrovnik (IUC). He was also one of the founders of the international organization World without the Bomb.

According to Supek, he was informed in confidence by Bohr's wife Margrethe about the meeting. In his interview, Supek claimed that the main figure of the meeting was neither Heisenberg nor Bohr but Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker. \"Heisenberg and von Weizs\u00e4cker came to Bohr in German army uniforms. Von Weizs\u00e4cker's idea, probably originating from his father who was Ribbentrop's deputy, was to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany.\"/nAlthough Margrethe allegedly thought Supek will never bring these details into public, Supek felt it was \"his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Heisenberg \u2013 Bohr meeting\"./nSupek had many disputes with the first president of independent Croatia, Franjo Tu\u0111man. In a 1997 \"open letter\" which he also read on the national television and published in all the major dailies, president Tu\u0111man accused Supek, then President of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, of supporting forces that allegedly plotted his assassination after Supek made public statements critical of presidential policies: he called for Tu\u0111man to submit to public scrutiny his financial assets before and after the war. Supek had been a critic of Tu\u0111man's political faux pas since Tu\u0111man took office in 1990. Following the publication of the letter, Supek and his family suffered numerous death threats./nBeside his scientific and humanist work, Supek wrote numerous novels and plays, with themes spanning from philosophy, science fiction to politics. His novel Proces stolje\u0107a (translated to The Process of the Century) is about the process against the physicist Robert Oppenheimer.

He was born Paul Heinrich Dietrich in Edesheim, near Landau in the Rhenish Palatinate, but lived and worked mainly in Paris, where he kept a salon. He helped in the dissemination of \"Protestant and especially German thought\", particularly in the field of the sciences,[3] but was best known for his atheism[4] and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being The System of Nature (1770) and The Universal Morality (1776)./nSources differ regarding d'Holbach's dates of birth and death. His exact birthday is unknown, although records show that he was baptised on 8 December 1723.[citation needed] Some authorities incorrectly give June 1789 as the month of his death./nD'Holbach's mother, Catherine Jacobina (n\u00e9e Holbach; 1684\u20131743), was the daughter of Johannes Jacobus Holbach (died 1723). His father, Johann Jakob Dietrich (with other notations: ger.: Johann Jakob Dirre; fr.: Jean-Jacques Thiry; 1672\u20131756), was a wine-grower./nD'Holbach wrote nothing of his childhood,[citation needed] though it is known he was raised in Paris by his uncle Franz Adam Holbach (or Adam Fran\u00e7ois d'Holbach or Messire Fran\u00e7ois-Adam, Baron d'Holbach, Seigneur de Heeze, Leende et autres Lieux)[5] (approx. 1675\u20131753), who had become a millionaire by speculating on the Paris stock-exchange. With his financial support, d'Holbach attended Leiden University from 1744 to 1748, where he became a friend of John Wilkes.[6] In 1750, he married his second cousin, Basile-Genevi\u00e8ve d'Aine (1728\u20131754), and in 1753 a son was born to them, Francois Nicholas, who left France before his father died. In 1753 both d'Holbach's uncle and father died, leaving him with an enormous inheritance, including Heeze Castle, Kasteel Heeze te Heeze./nD'Holbach remained wealthy throughout his life.[7] In 1754, his wife died from an unknown disease. The distraught d'Holbach moved to the provinces for a brief period with his friend Baron Grimm and in the following year received a special dispensation from the Pope to marry his deceased wife's sister, Charlotte-Suzanne d'Aine (1733\u20131814).[8] They had a son, Charles-Marius (1757\u20131832), and two daughters, Am\u00e9lie-Suzanne (13 January 1759) and Louise-Pauline (19 December 1759 \u2013 1830).[9]/nDuring the summer months, when Paris was hot and humid, Baron d'Holbach retreated to his country estate at Grandval, Le Ch\u00e2teau de Grand-Val[10] (Sucy-en-Brie today N\u00b0 27 rue du Grand-Val on the outskirts of Paris (D\u00e9partement Val-de-Marne).[11][12] There he would invite friends to stay for a few days or weeks, and every year he invited Denis Diderot whom he joined at a Anglican chapel service at the opening of the English Embassy led by Laurence Sterne.[13][14][15]/nD'Holbach was known for his generosity, often providing financial support discreetly or anonymously to his friends, amongst them Diderot. It is thought that the virtuous atheist Wolmar in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Julie, ou la nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse is based on d'Holbach.[7]/nHolbach died in Paris on 21 January 1789, a few months before the French Revolution.[16] The authorship of his various anti-religious works did not become widely known until the early 19th century. Ironically, he was buried in the Church of Saint-Roch, Paris. The exact location of the grave is unknown.[17]/nFrom c. 1750 to c. 1790, Baron d'Holbach used his wealth to maintain one of the more notable and lavish Parisian salons, which soon became an important meeting place for the contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die./nMeetings were held regularly twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays, in d'Holbach's home in rue Royale.[18][19] Visitors to the salon were exclusively males, and the tone of discussion highbrow, often extending to topics more extensive than those of other salons.[20] This, along with the excellent food, expensive wine, and a library of over 3000 volumes, attracted many notable visitors. Among the regulars in attendance at the salon\u2014the coterie holbachique\u2014were the following: Diderot, Grimm, Condillac, Condorcet, D'Alembert, Marmontel, Turgot, La Condamine, Raynal, Helv\u00e9tius, Galiani, Morellet, Naigeon and, for a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau.[21] The salon was also visited by prominent British intellectuals, amongst them Adam Smith, David Hume, John Wilkes, Horace Walpole, Edward Gibbon, David Garrick, Laurence Sterne; the Italian Cesare Beccaria; and the American Benjamin Franklin.[22][23]/nMorellet, a regular attendee at D'Holbach's salon, described it as:/nthe place to hear the freest, most animated, and most instructive conversation that ever was...in regard to philosophy, religion, and government; light pleasantries had no place there.[24]/nIn a frequently narrated story about a discussion that had taken place in D'Holbach's salon, David Hume had questioned whether atheists actually existed whereupon D'Holbach had clarified that Hume was sitting at a table with seventeen atheists.[25]/nFor the Encyclop\u00e9die d'Holbach authored and translated a large number of articles on topics ranging from politics and religion to chemistry and mineralogy. As a German who had become a naturalised Frenchman, he undertook the translation of many contemporary German works of natural philosophy into French. Between 1751 and 1765, D'Holbach contributed some four hundred articles to the project, mostly on scientific subjects, in addition to serving as the editor of several volumes on natural philosophy. D'Holbach might also have written several disparaging entries on non-Christian religions, intended as veiled criticisms of Christianity itself.[26]/nDespite his extensive contributions to the Encyclop\u00e9die, d'Holbach is better known today for his philosophical writings, all of which were published anonymously or under pseudonyms and printed outside France, usually in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey. His philosophy was expressly materialistic and atheistic and is today categorised into the philosophical movement called French materialism. In 1761 Christianisme d\u00e9voil\u00e9 (Christianity Unveiled)[a] appeared, in which he attacked Christianity and religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity. The deistic Voltaire, denying authorship of the work, made known his aversion to d'Holbach's philosophy, writing that \"[the work] is entirely opposed to my principles. This book leads to an atheistic philosophy that I detest.\"[27] Christianity Unveiled was followed by others, notably La Contagion sacr\u00e9e,[b] Th\u00e9ologie portative[c] and Essai sur les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s.[d] D'Holbach was helped in these endeavours by Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Naigeon, who would later become his literary executor.[citation needed]/nIn 1770, d'Holbach published his most famous book, The System of Nature (Le Syst\u00e8me de la nature), under the name of Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud, the secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie who had died ten years previously. Denying the existence of a deity, and refusing to admit as evidence all a priori arguments, d'Holbach saw the universe as nothing more than matter in motion, bound by inexorable natural laws of cause and effect. \"There is\", he wrote, \"no necessity to have recourse to supernatural powers to account for the formation of things.\"[28]/nThe System of Nature is a long and extensive work presenting a thoroughly naturalistic view of the world. Some d'Holbach scholars have pointed out that Denis Diderot was a close personal friend of d'Holbach's, and that it is unclear to what extent d'Holbach was influenced by him. Indeed, Diderot may possibly have been the author of parts of the System of Nature.[29] Regardless, however, of the extent of Diderot's contribution to the System of Nature, it is on the basis of this work that d'Holbach's philosophy has been called \"the culmination of French materialism and atheism\".[30]/nD'Holbach's objectives in challenging religion were primarily moral: he saw the institutions of Christianity as a major obstacle to the improvement of society. For him, the foundation of morality was to be sought not in Scripture or the moral teachings of the Catholic Church, but in happiness: \"It would be useless and almost unjust to insist upon a man's being virtuous if he cannot be so without being unhappy. So long as vice renders him happy, he should love vice.\"[31] D'Holbach's radicalism posited that humans were fundamentally motivated by the pursuit of enlightened self-interest, which is what he meant by \"society\", rather than by empty and selfish gratification of purely individual needs. Chapter 15 of Part I of System of Nature is titled \"Of Man's true Interest, or of the Ideas he forms to himself of Happiness. \u2013 Man cannot be happy without Virtue.\"[32]/nIt is quite natural in man, it is extremely reasonable, it is absolutely necessary, to desire those things which can contribute to augment the sum of his felicity. Pleasure, riches, power, are objects worthy his ambition, deserving his most strenuous efforts, when he has learned how to employ them; when he has acquired the faculty of making them render his existence really more agreeable. It is impossible to censure him who desires them, to despise him who commands them, but when to obtain them he employs odious means; or when after he has obtained them he makes a pernicious use of them, injurious to himself, prejudicial to others; let him wish for power, let him seek after grandeur, let him be ambitious of reputation, when he can show just pretensions to them; when he can obtain them, without making the purchase at the expense of his own repose, or that of the beings with whom he lives: let him desire riches, when he knows how to make a use of them that is truly advantageous for himself, really beneficial for others; but never let him employ those means to procure them of which he may be ashamed; with which he may be obliged to reproach himself; which may draw upon him the hatred of his associates; or which may render him obnoxious to the castigation of society: let him always recollect, that his solid happiness should rest its foundations upon its own esteem \u2013 upon the advantages he procures for others; above all, never let him for a moment forget, that of all the objects to which his ambition may point, the most impracticable for a being who lives in society, is that of attempting to render himself exclusively happy.[33]/nThe explicitly atheistic and materialistic The System of Nature presented a core of radical ideas which many contemporaries, both churchmen and philosophes found disturbing, and thus prompted a strong reaction./nThe Catholic Church in France threatened the crown with withdrawal of financial support unless it effectively suppressed the circulation of the book. The list of people writing refutations of the work was long. The prominent Catholic theologian Nicolas-Sylvestre Bergier wrote a refutation titled Examen du mat\u00e9rialisme (\"Materialism examined\"). Voltaire hastily seized his pen to refute the philosophy of the Syst\u00e8me in the article \"Dieu\" in his Dictionnaire philosophique, while Frederick the Great also drew up an answer to it. Its principles are summed up in a more popular form in d'Holbach's Good Sense, or Natural Ideas Opposed to Supernatural.[e]/nIn his last works, D'Holbach's attention largely shifted away from religious metaphysics towards moral and political questions. In the Syst\u00e8me social (1773), the Politique naturelle (1773\u20131774) and the Morale universelle (1776) he attempted to describe a system of morality in place of the Christian one he had so fiercely attacked, but these later writings were not as popular or influential as his earlier work.[citation needed] D'Holbach was critical towards abuses of power in France and abroad. Contrary to the revolutionary spirit of the time however, he called for the educated classes to reform the corrupt system of government and warned against revolution, democracy, and mob rule./nHis political and ethical views were influenced by British materialist Thomas Hobbes. D'Holbach personally translated Hobbes' work De Homine (\"Of Man\") into French.[34]/nIn his Syst\u00e8me de la nature, the three-volume Syst\u00e8me social (1772), two-volume Politique naturelle (1772) and Ethocratie (1776), d'Holbach gave his economic views. Following Locke, d'Holbach defended private property, and stated that wealth is generated from labor and all should have the right to the product of their labor.[35] He endorsed the theory of laissez-faire, arguing:/nThe government should do nothing for the merchant except to leave him alone. No regulations can guide him in his enterprise so well as his own interest. [...] The state owes commerce nothing but protection. Among commercial nations those that allow their subjects the most unlimited liberty may be sure of soon excelling all others.[36]/nHowever, D'Holbach also believed that the state should prevent a dangerous concentration of wealth amongst a few individuals from taking place.[35] According to him hereditary aristocracy should be abolished on the ground that it breeds indolence and incompetence.[36] He criticized the then prevailing policy of the French government to let private individuals collect tax on the ground that the tax collectors often extort double the money they are supposed to collect from the citizens.[37] He also believed that religious groups should be voluntary organizations without any government support.[35] In addition, D'Holbach is counted among the fiercest critics of luxury in the 18th-century debate.[38]/nD'Holbach is believed to have died shortly before the French Revolution. He was buried on 21 January 1789, in the ossuarium beneath the altar in the parish church of Saint-Roch, Paris. This ossuarium has been ransacked twice, once during the French Revolution, and again during the 1871 Paris Commune.[39]/nIt is not clear when d'Holbach and Diderot first met, but by 1752 they definitely knew each other. This was the year when Volume II of the Encyclop\u00e9die, containing contributions by d'Holbach, appeared. The two were in substantial agreement on questions related to religion and philosophy. They also shared similar interests like gourmandizing, taking country walks and collecting fine prints, and beautiful paintings.[40]/nWhen d'Holbach's radically atheistic and materialistic The System of Nature was first published, many believed Diderot to be the actual author of the book. Based on the writing style, the Durants opine that the book was not written by Diderot although he may have composed the flowery address to Nature towards the end of the book.[41]/nThe attendees at d'Holbach's dinners included Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau stopped attending the salon for some time after an incident in February 1754. Diderot had arranged for an acquaintance of his, the Abb\u00e9 Petit, to read a tragedy composed by the Abb\u00e9 at d'Holbach's. When the Abb\u00e9 presented his work, he preceded it by reading his treatise on theatrical composition which the attendees at d'Holbach's found so absurd that they could not help being amused. The attendees\u2014Diderot, Marmontel, Grimm, Saint-Lambert, and others\u2014then proceeded to direct lavish praise at the Abb\u00e9 which made him happy.[42][43] D'Holbach later narrated what happened:/nI will confess that, half-laughingly, half-soberly, I myself strung the poor cur\u00e9 along. Jean-Jacques hadn't said a word, hadn't smiled an instant, hadn't moved from his armchair. Suddenly he rose up like a madman and, springing towards the cur\u00e9, took his manuscript, threw it on the floor, and cried to the appalled author, \"Your play is worthless, your dissertation an absurdity, all these gentlemen are making fun of you. Leave here, and go back to do curate's duty in your village.\" Then the cur\u00e9 got up, no less furious, spewed forth all imaginable insults against his too sincere advisor, and from insults would have passed to blows and to tragic murder if we had not separated them. Rousseau left in a rage, which I believed to be temporary, but which has never ceased and which has done nothing but increase since that time.[43]/nLater in 1754, when he learnt that Mme d'Holbach had died,[44][note 1] Rousseau wrote a tender condolence letter to d'Holbach, and the friendship between the two men was rekindled. For three more years, Rousseau would frequent the salon of d'Holbach.[45]/nD'Holbach later arranged, along with Grimm and Diderot, for an annuity of 400 livres for Rousseau's common-law wife Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Levasseur and her mother, pledging them not to reveal this to Rousseau for fear of wounding Rousseau's pride. When Rousseau eventually found out about this, he was furious with his friends for humiliating him.[46][note 2]/nAccording to Marmontel, d'Holbach \"had read everything and never forgotten anything of interest.\"[47] Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented that d'Holbach could hold his own among scholars since he was learned and knowledgeable.[47] Diderot enthusiastically endorsed d'Holbach's book System of Nature.[48]/nD'Holbach's philosophy influenced Marat, Danton, and Camille Desmoulins. According to Faguet: \"d'Holbach, more than Voltaire, more than Diderot, is the father of all the philosophy and all the anti-religious polemics at the end of the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century.\"[49]/nDuring the French Directory, a book of d'Holbach was circulated to all departmental heads in a bid to rein in religious revivalism. In England, d'Holbach's views influenced Priestley, Godwin, and Shelley. In Germany, d'Holbach's views influenced Immanuel Kant.[49][note 3] It is speculated that d'Holbach's views influenced the historical materialism of Karl Marx.[49][50]/nAsteroid (6956) Holbach is named in honour of d'Holbach.", "49970355": "Avary William Holmes Forbes (1853\u20131938) was a religious philosopher, teacher, and writer./nForbes received his MA from Trinity College, Dublin,[1] and then studied law at Lincoln's Inn in London.

His family were ethnic Mongolians of Guilin and Guangxi origin. He was the son of a famous intellectual who committed suicide apparently in despair at the state of the Chinese nation. He had a modern education and exposure to Western writings. Liang was always fascinated by Buddhism, but never joined a monastery due to the opposition of his father. At the age of sixteen, he refused to allow his mother to discuss marriage on his behalf and at nineteen he became a vegetarian, remaining so for the rest of his life.[1]/nIn 1917 he was recruited by Cai Yuanpei to the philosophy department of Beijing University, where he produced an influential book based on his lectures entitled Eastern and Western Cultures and their Philosophies, which expounded some of the doctrines of a modern Confucianism. He also displayed the influence of Henri Bergson, then popular in China, as well as Buddhist Yogachara philosophy. Although Liang had abandoned his determination to become a monk in 1920 and his celibacy in 1921, Buddhism influenced him for the rest of his life.[1]/nRegarding Western civilization as doomed to eventual failure, Liang did not advocate complete reform and adoption of Western institutions. He nonetheless believed that reform was needed to make China equal to the rest of the world. It was his view that the required prerequisites for these institutions did not exist in China, so they would not succeed if introduced. Instead, he pushed for change to socialism starting at the grassroots level. To this end, he founded the Shandong Rural Reconstruction Institute and helped to found the China Democratic League./nLiang was famous for his critique of Marxist class theory, stating that, despite obvious disparities of wealth, Chinese rural society could not be unambiguously classified along class lines. One and the same family (particularly the large patriarchal lineages found in many regions) would commonly have some members among the \"haves\" and others among the \"have-nots\". The class struggle advocated by the Maoists would necessitate kinsmen attacking each other./nAfter the Sino-Japanese War, he mediated disputes between the Communist and Nationalist parties. After the victory of the Communists in 1949, he was occasionally persecuted in ideological campaigns, but refused to admit any error. He died in Beijing./nReleased in 1921, \"Eastern and Western Cultures and their Philosophies\" put forth Liang's theory of three cultures.[2]  This was one of four main Neo-Confucian responses to Scientism.[3] His theory stemmed from Yogachara Buddhism's three natures.[4]  His theory was based in his definition of the formation of distinct cultures.  In Liang's book he states:\n\t\"What is culture? It is the life-style of a people.  What is life?  It is the expression of inexhaustible will\u2014something quite close to the will in Schopenhauer\u2014always being satisfied and yet not fully satisfied\"./nAccording to Liang, will decides life and life decides culture, so cultures are different when the wills and desires of the people who populate them differ.[3]  Liang saw three orientations of the will: the desire 1) to change and affect your surroundings to bend to your will  2) to change your will so you do not desire to change your surroundings 3) to eliminate will entirely so one no longer desires anything because of his understanding that much of the world is an illusion.[5]  To Liang, the three orientations of will were not unconnected but a progression.[3]  He says that since knowledge starts with applying reason to your surroundings the first orientation is the most formative.  This leads to an imbalance, where one must start to use intuition to relate morally to the world.  Finally, as intuition develops, it leads to hardship instead of relieving it.  This leads to direct perception, which is the third orientation.  Liang maintained that the West held the first orientation, while China held the second and India held the third.[3]/nIn his book \"The Substance of Chinese Culture\", Liang contrasted Chinese culture with that of Western culture.  He did this by exploring the relationship between the social structures in the two regions. Social structure, he asserted, created the cultural factors determining everything about the two cultures.[6]  He said Social structure is heavily influenced by cultural viewpoint, which in turn is defined by the social foundation of the society (its means of existence). Liang believed society had three forms: communities, families and individuals. A cultural viewpoint that heavily emphasizes one combination of these will differ greatly from a viewpoint that emphasizes different ones.[6]/nLiang believed that while China had stressed the importance of family, the West focused on the relationship of the individual to the community.[6]  He said this led China down a path dedicated to an ethics-based society, while the West produced an individual-based society instead.  China was led down its path because of feelings of kinship and emotional bonds, which dominated their society. The West, due to their emphasis on mutual rights, proceeded down a path revolving around class distinction, economic independence and laws. The Chinese, however, had a society of professional divisions due to greater social mobility, mutual responsibility and personal bonds to maintain order.[6] Finally, Liang brings up his three cultures theory and China's position in it.  He states that although China was in the second stage, it had skipped the first, and consequently lacked the development of profit and power. Rather than suggesting China go back to the first cultural stage, Liang suggests the introduction of Western science and democracy into Chinese society to promote development in those areas.[7]/nLiang Shuming believed that the rural village was the most important aspect of Chinese society and that for the last hundred years Chinese history had been characterized by its destruction.[8] Between the years of 1931 and 1937 Liang was instructing the rural reconstruction in Zouping County of the Shandong Province. Many people assert that he was the reason for the great improvements witnessed there.[8] His main emphases in rural reconstruction were the cultivation of group unity, development of science and technology, and the elimination of outdated traditions./nLiang, appointed by Han Fuju to engage in rural reconstruction in Zouping County, was convinced the most effective method would be to integrate county and village schools and the local government.  Between 1931 and 1933 Liang trained 800 people to run schools all over Shandong and in 1932 the Guomindang said that every province should have one of these rural research reconstruction institutions.[8]/nLiang's Rural Research Reconstruction Institution had three departments. The first was the Research Department on Rural Reconstruction, headed by Liang Himself.  This department trained students who already had a university education to become science advisors. The Training Department of Service personnel took students with a middle-school education to become the villages\u2019 service personnel. The final department, called the Rural Reconstruction District, was implemented to integrate local governance into the university.[8]\u2019/nAt the age of 89 in an interview with Guy Alitto, Liang proclaimed himself a Buddhist.[9] He had been interested in Buddhism since his youth, which he often attributed to his feelings that many of the mistakes of the past had been made due to a focus on the external world for answers that come from within.[9]  In his article \u2018\u2019DOUBT\u2019\u2019, Liang expounded on the theory of ether in physics to maintain that much of the world is illusory and one must simply be conscious of this fact in order to see the world as it truly is and attain freedom.[9]  Liang wrote an \u2018\u2019Introduction to Indian Philosophy\u2019\u2019 where he explored many of the key concepts in Buddhism to reveal what he saw as its foundations.[9] In \u2018\u2019CONC\u2019\u2019, he explored the history of consciousness in Buddhism and attributed the Consciousness-Only school to Asanga.  He also maintained that people only get an illusory image through observations and opposed the idea of logical inference on the basis that it only explains conceptual questions.[9]/nLiang, like many intellectuals of the time was very critical of Chinese folk religion.  He believed that it was too primitive to allow society to reach a high level of socialization, while at the same time promoting conservatism that impeded social development and promoted low moral standards and selfishness.[9]  He felt that Confucianism was China\u2019s answer to religion as it provided a way to harmonize with the cosmos instead of being isolated from that which you worship.[10]/nIn contrasting Confucianism with religions he came to two conclusions. First that unlike western religion everyone is thought to have innate moral reason, which means they must not all have uniform morals dictated by an institution like the church.[11] And, Second, in his \"Treatise on the Differences and Similarities between Confucianism and Buddhism\" that the two were not unrelated, but while Confucianism is based on the person and talks about moral character, that Buddhism transcends the person to talk about a final understanding.[9]  When ordered in 1974 to criticize Confucius and Lin Biao, he refused and instead wrote Human mind and Human Life.  He was often considered a beacon of intellectual freedom as well as China's conscience.[12]", "58752195": "Marguerite La Caze (born 1964[1]) is an Australian philosopher and Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Queensland.\nShe is an Australian Research Fellow and a former Chair of the Australasian Society for Continental Philosophy (2010\u20132013).[2]\nLa Caze is known for her research on feminist philosophy and aesthetics.[3][4]/n/nThis biography of an Australian academic is a stub.

His most prominent work was the Gothic novel Geschichte eines Geistersehers. Aus den Papieren des Mannes mit der eisernen Larve, translated into English by Peter Will as The Victim of Magical Delusion./nCajetan Tschink was born on 22 April 1763 in Vienna.[1] He was of Hungarian background.[2] Tschink joined the Carmelite Order in 1780, but left before receiving his ordination and in 1792 attended the University of Jena to study philosophy.[1][3] Tschink's philosophical focus was the work of Immanuel Kant, and he held a position as professor of philosophy at the University in Olm\u00fctz (modern day Olomouc, Czech Republic) where he taught and wrote on logic, metaphysics, and practical philosophy. He stayed in this position until his death on 26 August 1813.[1]/nTschink worked within the Gothic fiction genre that was popular in Germany in the 1790s. He was an early adopter of the Gothic form of Geisterseherroman (\"Necromancer novel\" lit. ghost-seer novel\"), which was invented by Friedrich Schiller with his unfinished 1789 novel Der Geisterseher.[4] Geisterseherroman is characterized by fraudsters and charlatans trick the gullible by using seemingly supernatural means, the machinations of which are revealed to the audience to have mundane explanations through phantasmagoria-style stage effects such as trap doors, hidden mirrors, translucent veils, and pyrotechnics, and through technologies such as the moving panorama, eidophusikon, and magic lantern.[2][4]/nTschink's most prominent novel was Geschichte eines Geistersehers. Aus den Papieren des Mannes mit der eisernen Larve, which was translated into English by Peter Will as The Victim of Magical Delusion.[5] The novel describes supposed spiritual apparitions that are shown to be images produced by a simple magic lantern projector.[6] The various tricks presented are performed by a mysterious figure called Alumbrado (a reference to the Alumbrados, a Spanish mystic sect suppressed by the Inquisition) who makes miracles to convince people God speaks and acts through him, serving his ends of an Illuminati conspiracy.[7]/nMuch of Tschink's work is didactic, with clear lessons, where the credulous characters are mocked for falling for the delusions. This contrasts with the fact that the popularity of the Gothic genre comes from incredulous elements, and relied on them for sales.[8]/nThe quick adoption of Geisterseherroman by Tschink was followed by other imitations of Schiller, including Karl Friedrich Kahlert's Der Geisterbanner [The Necromancer], Carl Grosse's Der Genius [Horrid Mysteries], G. B\u00fccher's Der Geisterseher. Eine venetianische Geschichte wundervollen Inhalts, and C. A. G. Seidel's Die Geisterseherinn, all of which were written in the mid-1790s.[4] Unlike Schiller, who emphasized the psychological elements of the supernatural delusions, Tschink was interested in the machinery of the delusions, providing exhaustive detail of his explanations.[9] Tschink's description of a magic lantern-induced spectral image predates the famous illusion Pepper's Ghost by more than fifty years.[10]/nThrough The Victim of Magical Delusion, Tschink (as well as Schiller, Kahlert, and Grosse through their novels) was influential to William Godwin, who read Will's English translation, and wrote Lives of the Necromancers.[11] Charles Brockden Brown was introduced to Gothic fiction through Tschink's work, and was influenced by him when writing Wieland: or, The Transformation: An American Tale, the first American gothic novel.[12] The preferred intellectual ambience of early American literature favoured Tschink and Schiller over English Gothic writers Horace Walpole and Matthew Lewis due to the rational explanations behind supposedly supernatural phenomena.[13]/nThe prominence of \"explained supernatural\" stories in German gothic stories lasted from 1780 to 1799 was strongly influenced by two Tschink works: Geschichte eines Geistersehers and another novel entitled Wundergeschichten sammt dem Schl\u00fcssel zu ihrer Erkl\u00e4rung.[9] Due to the translation into English by Peter Will, Tschink also influenced the English Gothic literary scene./nThe Victim of Magical Delusion was outsold by the similar works from Kahlert and Grosse in England.[9] Contemporary reviews were mixed: the August 1795 edition of The Monthly Review called it \"one of those numberless imitations to which the Ghost-Seer of the celebrated Schiller has given rise in Germany,\" while The Critical Review was positive, noting how Tschink showed \"how easily a mind addicted to superstition may be deceived by the most common appearances at certain times and under certain impressions.\"[14]", "2391256": "Titus Burckhardt (24 October 1908 \u2013 15 January 1984) was a Swiss writer and a leading member of the Perennialist or Traditionalist School. He was the author of numerous works on metaphysics, cosmology, anthropology, esoterism, alchemy, Sufism, symbolism and sacred art./nScion of a patrician family of Basel, Switzerland,[1] Titus Burckhardt was the son of the sculptor Carl Burckhardt (1878\u20131923) and the grand-nephew of Jacob Burckhardt (1818\u20131897), an art historian and Renaissance specialist. His genealogical tree also includes John Lewis Burckhardt (1784\u20131817), the explorer who discovered the Nabatean city of Petra and the Egyptian temples of Abu Simbel.[2] He was born in Florence, Italy, on October 24, 1908. The following year his family settled in Basel.[3] He attended the same primary school as Frithjof Schuon, who became a lifelong friend.[4] In 1920, his family left Basel for Ligornetto in the Swiss canton of Ticino, where his father died three years later.[5]/nAround 1927, Burckhardt began studying painting, sculpture and art history in Munich and Paris.[6] Drawn to a traditional lifestyle that the West could not offer him, he took advantage of a break in his studies to visit Morocco (1928 or 1929), where he dedicated himself to drawing and painting. He was captivated by this sojourn, which marked the beginning of his spiritual quest. On his return, he discovered the works of the French metaphysician Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, in whom \"he found the key to the world that had entranced him\".[7]/nIn early 1933, Burckhardt returned to Morocco in search of a spiritual master.[8] He converted to Islam and learned Arabic,[9] enabling him to assimilate the Sufi classics in their original language.[10] After some disappointments, his search led him to Fez, where he met Sheikh Ali al-Darqawi,[8] the grandson and spiritual successor of Muhammad al-Arabi al-Darqawi (\u20201823), the reformer of the Shadhili order.[11] He was initiated by the Sheikh and received into the Tariqa Darqawiya.[12] In a bid to meet his material needs, he acquired a flock of sheep and pastured them in the countryside of the Middle Atlas, but this did little to improve his precarious finances.[13] Parallel with this, he took up an apprenticeship in zellij tile-making with a master craftsman from Fez, who urged him to memorize the Alfiyya of Ibn Malik, a didactic poem of a thousand verses which sets out all the rules of Arabic grammar; Burckhardt remained ever grateful to him for this.[14]/nIn early 1935, he was visited in Fez by Frithjof Schuon, who was on his way back to Europe from the zawiya of the late Sheikh al-Alawi of Mostaganem.[15] Schuon had received initiation from this Shadhili Sheikh in 1932.[16] Burckhardt soon realized that his predestined guide was none other than his childhood friend.[17] Burckhardt's complete integration into local life made him suspect in the eyes of the French authorities, who ordered him to leave the country. Thus in the spring of 1935, he returned to Basel.[18] This marked the beginning of his correspondence with Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non,[19] as well as his affiliation with Schuon's tariqa. Schuon, who was living in France at that time, charged Burckhardt with the spiritual direction of his disciples in Basel.[17]/nFrom 1936 to 1938 Burckhardt studied art history and Oriental languages at the University of Basel.[19] 1937 marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Gu\u00e9nonian-inspired journal \u00c9tudes Traditionnelles,[20] in which he published articles on traditional art (in particular Hindu, Christian and Muslim art), alchemy, traditional cosmology and astrology, folklore and various symbolisms. Many of these articles were later collected into two volumes.[a] The journal also published his translations of Sufi treatises by Al-Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, Abd al-Karim al-Jili and al-Arabi al-Darqaw\u00ee.[21] In the view of the Pakistani professor Muhammed Suheyl Omar, Burckhardt is one of the few authors who has not only expounded, but also assimilated, Ibn Arabi's metaphysics,[22] a view confirmed by the Iranian Islamologist Seyyed Hossein Nasr,[23] who has also said that Burckhardt's opus has contributed to the West's interest in Ibn Arabi since the second half of the 20th century.[9]/nBurckhardt married in 1939.[24] Shortly thereafter, he was appointed artistic director and director of publications by the Swiss German publishing house Urs Graf, headquartered in Olten and Basel and specializing in the reproduction of medieval illuminated manuscripts. He remained there until his retirement in 1968.[25] His working languages were German, French, Arabic, Latin, English and Italian.[26] He and his wife settled in Bern, halfway between Olten and Lausanne, where Schuon resided.[27] The quality of Urs Graf's publications brought it a worldwide reputation in its domain,[28] and in October 1950, in a private audience, Burckhardt presented Pope Pius XII[b] with a quadrichromic facsimile in three volumes of the celebrated Book of Kells (Evangeliorum quatuor codex Cenannensis), a gospel in the Celtic tradition dating from 800 A.D., published by his company.[29]/nIn 1952, Burckhardt and his wife moved to Lausanne,[27] where he founded the French-Swiss branch of Urs Graf[30] and created the collection St\u00e4tten des Geistes (\"Cities of the Spirit\") for which he wrote and illustrated three volumes: Siena, City of the Virgin, Fez, City of Islam, and Chartres and the Birth of the Cathedral. These completed the collection, which already included volumes on Mount Athos, Mount Sinai, Celtic Ireland, Constantinople and Kyoto.[31] In 1951, 1958 and 1960 other publishing houses brought out the original editions of Burckhardt's Introduction to Sufi Doctrine, Sacred Art in East and West and Alchemy, Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul.[32]  Following Gu\u00e9non, Coomaraswamy and Schuon, Burckhardt became identified as one of the great 20th century spokesmen of the philosophia perennis, \"that 'uncreated wisdom' expressed in Platonism, the Vedanta, Sufism, Taoism and other authentic esoteric and sapiential teachings\".[33] According to the philosopher William Stoddart, Burckhardt \u2014 historian and philosopher of art,[34] esoterist initiated in a Sufi path, metaphysician and artist[35] \u2014 devoted his work as a writer to expounding \"the different aspects of Wisdom and Tradition.\"[36]/nMorocco having recovered its independence in 1956, Burckhardt returned there regularly from 1960.[37] In 1972, UNESCO, together with the Moroccan government, delegated him to Fez to take charge of the plan for restoration and rehabilitation of the medina and its religious patrimony, as well as its handcrafts.[38] He remained there for five years, aware that the old city was probably the best preserved model of Islamic urbanism,[39] and that once rehabilitated, Fez \"could become a reference for the continuity of a traditional urban model, capable of evolution yet still conserving its intrinsic qualities.\"[40] For the first two years Burkhardt, with drawing board and camera, singlehandedly made an inventory of the outstanding buildings, religious and secular, from the exterior and the interior, to evaluate their state of conservation.[41] Over the three following years he led an interdisciplinary team tasked with establishing a master plan for the rehabilitation of the monuments and the urban fabric, including handcrafts \"whose role is to create an ambiance that allows spiritual values to shine through.\"[42] The \"Master Plan of Urbanism for the City of Fez\" was adopted and published by UNESCO in 1980.[43]/nDuring his mission to Fez, Burckhardt edited a general work on Islamic art,  Art of Islam: Language and Meaning, at the request of the organisers of the Festival of the Islamic World (London, 1976), of which he became one of the guiding forces.[44] He was regularly invited as a specialist on traditional art and urbanism to give lectures, in both the Orient and the West, and to host or participate in seminars.[45] The islamologist Jean-Louis Michon, who knew him well, described his qualities as a speaker thus:/nAs a lecturer, he had a rare pedagogical gift. Thanks to his natural humility, he knew how to make himself accessible to the average man. Without ever erring into simplification or vulgarization, he managed to present key ideas clearly: fundamental notions that he developed from several angles with a benevolent deliberateness.... In one hour of conversation in a calm tone, punctuated by silences that had nothing hesitant about them but on the contrary facilitated reflection and assimilation, he would set forth several major topics, each illustrated by particularly striking examples.[46]/nFor Prof. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Burckhardt is the first Westerner \"to seriously expound the inner meaning of Islamic art\"[47] and, according to Nasr, it is in large part due to his influence that European and American universities began offering courses on Islamic art and architecture.[48] His capacities in this domain prompted Saudi Arabia to mandate him as adviser in the development of plans for a university campus in Mecca. So it was that in 1978 and 1979, together with the Egyptian Right Livelihood Award laureate Hassan Fathy and Jean-Louis Michon, he oversaw the office of the American architects tasked with these plans, in order that the principles and spirit of traditional Muslim architecture be respected.[49]/nBurckhardt's empathy for Native American spirituality led him to the American West in 1979 to visit the medicine man Thomas Yellowtail; they had met in Paris in 1953 and again in Lausanne in 1954, and had maintained a deep friendship.[50] His interest in the Native Americans was manifested in two published works: the German version of Black Elk Speaks (1955) and, eleven years later, Der wilde Westen (\"The Wild West\"), an illustrated compilation of quotes from famous Indian chiefs and 19th century settlers and cowboys.[51]/nIn 1981, despite a debilitating neuropathy, Burckhardt went for the last time to Fez as guest of honour at the inauguration by the Director-General of UNESCO of the international campaign for the conservation of the medina.[52]/nHe died in Lausanne on January 15, 1984.[53]/nwith introduction and commentaries", "9403616": "Casimir Lewy (Polish: Kazimierz Lewy; 26 February 1919 \u2013 8 February 1991) was a Polish philosopher of Jewish descent./nHe worked in philosophical logic but published scantly.

Samuel Brown (died 1779) (minister of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale) and Mary Smith./nTheir son was a wide reader and an eager student. Educated at several schools in London, he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1792, where he attended Dugald Stewart's moral philosophy class, but does not appear to have completed his course. After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis De Somno was well received. But his strength lay in metaphysical analysis.[1]/nBrown set an answer to the objections raised against the appointment of Sir John Leslie to the mathematical professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of David Hume, was attacked by the clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the opportunity to defend Hume's doctrine of causality as in no way inimical to religion.[2] His defence, at first only a pamphlet, became in its third edition a lengthy treatise entitled Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect, and is a fine specimen of Brown's analytical faculty.[1][3]/nIn 1806, Brown became a medical practitioner in partnership with James Gregory (1753\u20131821), but, though successful, preferred literature and philosophy. After twice failing to gain a professorship in the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in the session of 1808\u20131809, to act as his substitute, and during the following session he undertook much of Stewart's work. The students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid rhetoric and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the rest of his life.  Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.[4] He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he had written at various times during his life. He was also preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work.[1]/nHe was advised to take a trip to London, where he died in 1820 aged 42.[1] His body was returned to Kirkmabreck for burial.[5]/nOne of Brown's notable works included a critique of Erasmus Darwin's theory of transmutation. The philosopher published it in the form of a detailed study Observations on the zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin (1798), which was recognized as a mature work of criticism.[6]/nThere, Brown wrote:/nAs the earth, to a considerable depth, abounds with the recrements of organic life, Dr. Darwin adopts the opinion, that it has been generated, rather than created; the original quantity of matter having been continually increased, by the processes of animalization, and vegetation. This production of the causes of effects he considers, as affording a more magnificent idea of the infinite power of the Creator, than if he had simply caused the effects themselves; and, if the inconceivable be the source of the magnificent, the opinion is just. It is contrary, however, to all the observations, which prove the processes of animal, and vegetable growth, to be the result of new combinations of matter, previously existing; and it is also in direct opposition to the opinions, which Dr. Darwin has himself advanced. A body can increase in bulk, only by the farther separation of its parts, in expansion, or by the accretion of new parts. In the former case, no addition is made to the original quantity of matter; and it will surely be admitted, that nothing can accresce, which does not exist. The parts accreted, existing before their junction with the animal, must have formed a portion of the original matter of the world, or been called into being, in a new creation, not by the animal, to which they accresce, but by the great fource of animal existence.The immense beds of limestone, chalk, and marble, may have been, at one time, the shells of fish, and may thus have received a difference of form; but, unless the calcareous earth, of which they are composed, if that earth be a simple body, or its ingredients, if it be compound, had previously existed, all the powers of animation which the ocean contains would have been insufficient to create a single shell...The process of generation is said to consist in the secretion by the male of a living filament, and by the female of a nutritive fluid, which stimulates the filament, to absorb particles, and thus to add to its bulk: At the earliest period of its existence the embryon, as secreted from the blood of the male, would seem to consist of a living filament, with certain capabilities of irritation, sensation, volition and association,\" p. 484. To say, that the filament is living, and that it possesses these powers, is to say, that it possess sensorial power, which is considered by Dr. Darwin, as the source of animation...Dr. Darwin seems to consider the animals of former times, as possessing powers, much superior to those of their posterity. They reasoned on their wants: they wished: and it was done. The boar, which originally differed little from the other beasts of the forest, first obtained tusks, because he conceived them to be useful weapons, and then, by another process of reasoning, a thick shield-like shoulder, to defend himself from the tusks of his fellows. The stag, in like manner, formed to himself horns, at once sharp, and branched, for the different purposes of offence, and defence. Some animals obtained wings, others fins, and others swiftness of foot; while the vegetables exerted themselves, in inventing various modes of concealing, and defending their feeds, and honey. These are a few of many instances, adduced by Dr. Darwin, which are all objectionable, on his own principles; as they require us to believe the various propensities, to have been the cause, rather than the effect, of the difference of configuration... If we admit the supposed capacity of producing organs, by the mere feeling of a want, man must have been greatly degenerated, or been originally inferior, in power. He may wish for wings, as the other bipeds are supposed to have done with success; but a century of wishes will not render him abler to take flight. It is not, however, to man that the observation must be confined. No improvements of form have been observed, in the other animals, since the first dawnings of zoology; and we must, therefore, believe them, to have lost the power of production, rather than to have attained all the objects of their desire./nNoteworthy, Brown's criticism of the Darwinian thesis, like that of Rudolf Virchow, did not come from any religious feeling. In fact, Brown's critique bears an uncanny resemblance to Thomas Robert Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) in which Malthus's main objection against Darwin's thesis, like that of Brown, was epistemological rather than religious.[7]/nBrown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged. Later criticism of Brown's philosophy lessened its popularity, a severe attack being made by Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet in his Discussions and Lectures on Metaphysics. A high estimate of his merits was shown in John Stuart Mill's Examination of Hamilton. Also, in David Welsh's Account of the Life and Writings (1825) and James McCosh's Scottish Philosophy. Friedrich Eduard Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines.[1][8]/nThe philosopher Schopenhauer wrote of him in 1844:/nQuite recently Thomas Brown has taught ... in his extremely tedious book Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect (4th ed., 1835), ... that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive conviction; he is therefore essentially on the right path. However, the crass ignorance is unpardonable by which, in this book of 476 pages, 130 of which are devoted to the refutation of Hume, no mention at all is made of Kant, who cleared up the matter seventy years ago.|The World as Will and Representation, Vol. II, Chapter IV/nIn his On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, \u00a7 20, Schopenhauer claimed that Brown intended to provide support for the Cosmological Proof of God's Existence. \"\u2026 sometimes there is an intention\u2026a theological design flirting with the Cosmological Proof\u2026. We find the clearest instance of this in Thomas Browne's [sic] book, On the Relation of Cause and Effect\u2026this Englishman rightly recognizes, that the causal law has invariably to do with changes, and that every effect is accordingly a change. Yet\u2026he is unwilling to admit that every cause is likewise a change and that the whole process is therefore nothing but the uninterrupted connection of changes succeeding one another in time. On the contrary, he persists in clumsily calling the cause an object or substance, which precedes the change\u2026in order that his definition may on no account stand in the way of the Cosmological Proof\u2026.\"/nHis friend and biographer, David Welsh (1793\u20131845), superintended the publication of Brown's text-book, the Physiology of the Human Mind, and his Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind,[9] which was published by his successors, John Stewart and Edward Milroy. The Lectures were well received both in England (where it reached a 19th edition)[1][10] and in the USA./nAmong Brown's  poems, which were influenced by Alexander Pope and Akenside were: Paradise of Coquettes (1814); Wanderer in Norway (1815); Warfiend (1816); Bower of Spring (1817); Agnes (1818); Emily (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols. appeared in 1820.[1] His poetry, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.[citation needed]/nBrown was one of the first contributors to the Edinburgh Review.

He completed his education at Athens, whence he was summoned to Constantinople in 362 by the emperor Julian, possibly to act as his private secretary. After the death of Julian in the following year Himerius returned to Athens, where he established a school of rhetoric, which he compared with that of Isocrates and the Delphic oracle, owing to the number of those who flocked from all parts of the world to hear him. Amongst his pupils were Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil the Great, bishop of Caesarea.[1]/nIn recognition of his merits, civic rights and the membership of the Areopagus were conferred upon him. The death of his son Rufinus (his lament for whom, called the \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, is extant) and that of a favourite daughter greatly affected his health; in his later years he became blind and he died of epilepsy.[1] In his lament for Rufinus he identifies himself as a descendant of Plutarch and Sextus of Chaeronea.[2]/nAlthough a pagan, who had been initiated into the mysteries of Mithras by Julian, his works show no attacks against the Christians.[1]/nHimerius is a typical representative of the later rhetorical schools. Photius (cod. 165, 243 Bekker) had read 71 speeches by him, of 36 of which he has given an epitome; 24 have come down to us complete and fragments of 12 others.

Other declamations, only known from the excerpts in Photius, were imaginary orations put into the mouth of famous persons--Demosthenes advocating the recall of Aeschines from banishment, Hypereides supporting the policy of Demosthenes, Themistocles inveighing against the king of Persia, an orator unnamed attacking the philosopher Epicurus for denying the doctrine of divine providence before a court in Athens.[1]/nHimerius is more of a poet than a rhetorician, and his declamations are valuable as giving prose versions or even the actual words of lost poems by Greek lyric writers. The prose poem on the marriage of his pupil Severus and his greeting to Basil at the beginning of spring are quite in the spirit of the old lyric. Himerius possesses vigour of language and descriptive powers, though his productions are spoilt by too frequent use of imagery, allegorical and metaphorical obscurities, mannerism and ostentatious learning.

In English, he is best known for his popular 1980 novel The Name of the Rose, a historical mystery combining semiotics in fiction with biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory, as well as Foucault's Pendulum, his 1988 novel which touches on similar themes.[6]/nEco wrote prolifically throughout his life, with his output including children's books, translations from French and English, in addition to a twice-monthly newspaper column \"La Bustina di Minerva\" (Minerva's Matchbook) in the magazine L'Espresso beginning in 1985, with his last column (a critical appraisal of the Romantic paintings of Francesco Hayez) appearing 27 January 2016.[7][8] At the time of his death, he was an Emeritus professor at the University of Bologna, where he taught for much of his life.[9] In the 21st century, he has continued to gain recognition for his 1995 essay \"Ur-Fascism\", where Eco lists fourteen general properties he believes comprise fascist ideologies./nEco was born on 5 January 1932 in the city of Alessandria, in Piedmont in northern Italy. The spread of Italian Fascism throughout the region influenced his childhood. At the age of ten, he received the First Provincial Award of Ludi Juveniles after responding positively to the young Italian fascist writing prompt of \"Should we die for the glory of Mussolini and the immortal destiny of Italy?\"[10] His father, Giulio, one of thirteen children, was an accountant before the government called him to serve in three wars. During World War II, Umberto and his mother, Giovanna (Bisio), moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside.[11] His village was liberated in 1945, and he was exposed to American comic books, the European Resistance, and the Holocaust.[10] Eco received a Salesian education and made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews.[12]/nTowards the end of his life, Eco came to believe that his family name was an acronym of ex caelis oblatus (from Latin: a gift from the heavens). As was the custom at the time, the name had been given to his grandfather (a foundling) by an official in city hall. In a 2011 interview, Eco explained that a friend happened to come across the acronym on a list of Jesuit acronyms in the Vatican Library, informing him of the likely origin of the name.[13]/nUmberto's father urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the University of Turin (UNITO), writing his thesis on the aesthetics of medieval philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas under the supervision of Luigi Pareyson, for which he earned his Laurea degree in philosophy in 1954./nAfter graduating, Eco worked for the state broadcasting station Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI) in Milan, producing a variety of cultural programming. Following the publication of his first book in 1956, he became an assistant lecturer at his alma mater. In 1958, Eco left RAI and the University of Turin to complete 18 months of compulsory military service in the Italian Army./nIn 1959, following his return to university teaching, Eco was approached by Valentino Bompiani to edit a series on \"Idee nuove\" (New Ideas) for his eponymous publishing house in Milan. According to the publisher, he became aware of Eco through his short pamphlet of cartoons and verse Filosofi in libert\u00e0 (Philosophers in Freedom, or Liberated Philosophers), which had originally been published in a limited print run of 550 under the James Joyce-inspired pseudonym Daedalus.[14]/nThat same year, Eco published his second book, Sviluppo dell'estetica medievale (The Development of Medieval Aesthetics), a scholarly monograph building on his work on Aquinas. Earning his libera docenza in aesthetics in 1961, Eco was promoted to the position of lecturer in the same subject in 1963, before leaving the University of Turin to take a position as lecturer in Architecture at the University of Milan in 1964.[15]/nAmong his work for a general audience, in 1961 Eco's short essay \"Phenomenology of Mike Bongiorno\", a critical analysis of a popular but unrefined quiz show host, appeared as part of a series of articles by Eco on mass media published in the magazine of the tyre manufacturer Pirelli. In it, Eco, observed that \"[Bongiorno] does not provoke inferiority complexes, despite presenting himself as an idol, and the public acknowledge him, by being grateful to him and loving him. He represents an ideal that nobody need strive to reach because everyone is already at his level.\"  Receiving notoriety among the general public thanks to widespread media coverage, the essay was later included in the collection Diario minimo (1963).[16][17]/nOver this period, Eco began seriously developing his ideas on the \"open\" text and on semiotics, writing many essays on these subjects. In 1962 he published Opera aperta (translated into English as \"The Open Work\"). In it, Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning; and that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields. Literature which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line, the closed text, remains the least rewarding, while texts which are the most active between mind, society and life (open texts) are the liveliest and best\u2014although valuation terminology was not his primary focus. Eco came to these positions through the study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as Wolfgang Iser, on the one hand, and Hans Robert Jauss, on the other)./nIn his 1964 book Apocalittici e integrati, Eco continued his exploration of popular culture, analyzing the phenomenon of mass communication from a sociological perspective./nFrom 1965 to 1969, he was Professor of Visual Communications at the University of Florence, where he gave the influential[18] lecture \"Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare\", which coined the influential term \"semiological guerrilla\", and influenced the theorization of guerrilla tactics against mainstream mass media culture, such as guerrilla television and culture jamming.[19] Among the expressions used in the essay are \"communications guerrilla warfare\" and \"cultural guerrilla\".[20][21] The essay was later included in Eco's book Faith in Fakes./nEco's approach to semiotics is often referred to as \"interpretative semiotics\". In his first book-length elaboration, his theory appears in La struttura assente (1968; literally: The Absent Structure)./nIn 1969 he left to become Professor of Semiotics at Milan Polytechnic, spending his first year as a visiting professor at New York University.[15] In 1971 he took up a position as associate professor at the University of Bologna and spent 1972 as a visiting professor at Northwestern University. Following the publication of A Theory of Semiotics in 1975, he was promoted to Professor of Semiotics at the University of Bologna.[15][22] That same year, Eco stepped down from his position as senior non-fiction editor at Bompiani./nFrom 1977 to 1978 Eco was a visiting professor at Yale University and then at Columbia University. He returned to Yale from 1980 to 1981, and Columbia in 1984. During this time he completed The Role of the Reader (1979) and Semiotics and Philosophy of Language (1984)./nEco drew on his background as a medievalist in his first novel The Name of the Rose (1980), a historical mystery set in a 14th-century monastery. Franciscan friar William of Baskerville, aided by his assistant Adso, a Benedictine novice, investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is to host an important religious debate. The novel contains many direct or indirect metatextual references to other sources which require the detective work of the reader to \"solve\". The title is unexplained in the body of the book, but at the end, there is a Latin verse \"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus\"\u00a0[it; la] (transl.\u2009\"about a rose that used to exist, all we can learn is its empty name\"). The rose serves as an example of the destiny of all remarkable things. There is a tribute to Jorge Luis Borges, a major influence on Eco, in the character Jorge of Burgos: Borges, like the blind monk Jorge, lived a celibate life consecrated to his passion for books, and also went blind in later life. The labyrinthine library in The Name of the Rose also alludes to Borges's short story \"The Library of Babel\".  William of Baskerville is a logical-minded Englishman who is a friar and a detective. His name evokes both William of Ockham and Sherlock Holmes (by way of The Hound of the Baskervilles); several passages which describe him are strongly reminiscent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's descriptions of Holmes.[23][24] The underlying mystery of the murder is borrowed from the \"Arabian Nights\".[citation needed]/nThe Name of the Rose was later made into a motion picture, which follows the plot, though not the philosophical and historical themes of the novel and stars Sean Connery, F. Murray Abraham, Christian Slater and Ron Perlman[25] and a made-for-television mini-series./nIn Foucault's Pendulum (1988), three under-employed editors who work for a minor publishing house decide to amuse themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory. Their conspiracy, which they call \"The Plan\", is about an immense and intricate plot to take over the world by a secret order descended from the Knights Templar. As the game goes on, the three slowly become obsessed with the details of this plan. The game turns dangerous when outsiders learn of The Plan and believe that the men have really discovered the secret to regaining the lost treasure of the Templars./nIn 1988, Eco founded the Department of Media Studies at the University of the Republic of San Marino, and in 1992 he founded the Institute of Communication Disciplines at the University of Bologna, later founding the Higher School for the Study of the Humanities at the same institution.[26][27]/nIn 1988, at the University of Bologna, Eco created an unusual program called Anthropology of the West from the perspective of non-Westerners (African and Chinese scholars), as defined by their own criteria. Eco developed this transcultural international network based on the idea of Alain le Pichon in West Africa. The Bologna program resulted in the first conference in Guangzhou, China, in 1991 entitled \"Frontiers of Knowledge\". The first event was soon followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on \"Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal\" along the silk trade route from Guangzhou to Beijing. The latter culminated in a book entitled The Unicorn and the Dragon,[28] which discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe. Scholars contributing to this volume were from China, including Tang Yijie, Wang Bin and Yue Daiyun, as well as from Europe: Furio Colombo, Antoine Danchin, Jacques Le Goff, Paolo Fabbri and Alain Rey.[29]/nEco published The Limits of Interpretation in 1990./nFrom 1992 to 1993, Eco was a visiting professor at Harvard University and from 2001 to 2002, at St Anne's College, Oxford.[15][30]/nThe Island of the Day Before (1994) was Eco's third novel. The book, set in the 17th century, is about a man stranded on a ship within sight of an island which he believes is on the other side of the international date-line. The main character is trapped by his inability to swim and instead spends the bulk of the book reminiscing on his life and the adventures that brought him to be stranded./nHe returned to semiotics in Kant and the Platypus in 1997, a book which Eco reputedly warned his fans away from, saying, \"This a hard-core book. It's not a page-turner. You have to stay on every page for two weeks with your pencil. In other words, don't buy it if you are not Einstein.\"[31]/nIn 2000, a seminar in Timbuktu was followed up with another gathering in Bologna to reflect on the conditions of reciprocal knowledge between East and West. This, in turn, gave rise to a series of conferences in Brussels, Paris and Goa, culminating in Beijing in 2007. The topics of the Beijing conference were \"Order and Disorder\", \"New Concepts of War and Peace\", \"Human Rights\" and \"Social Justice and Harmony\". Eco presented the opening lecture. Among those giving presentations were anthropologists Balveer Arora, Varun Sahni, and Rukmini Bhaya Nair from India, Moussa Sow from Africa, Roland Marti and Maurice Olender from Europe, Cha Insuk from Korea, and Huang Ping and Zhao Tinyang from China. Also on the program were scholars from the fields of law and science including Antoine Danchin, Ahmed Djebbar and Dieter Grimm.[32] Eco's interest in east\u2013west dialogue to facilitate international communication and understanding also correlates with his related interest in the international auxiliary language Esperanto./nBaudolino was published in 2000. Baudolino is a much-travelled polyglot Piedmontese scholar who saves the Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates during the sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade. Claiming to be an accomplished liar, he confides his history, from his childhood as a peasant lad endowed with a vivid imagination, through his role as adopted son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, to his mission to visit the mythical realm of Prester John. Throughout his retelling, Baudolino brags about his ability to swindle and tell tall tales, leaving the historian (and the reader) unsure of just how much of his story was a lie./nThe Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana (2005) is about Giambattista Bodoni, an old bookseller specializing in antiques who emerges from a coma with only some memories to recover his past. Bodoni is pressed to make a very difficult choice, one between his past and his future. He must either abandon his past to live his future or regain his past and sacrifice his future.[citation needed]/nThe Prague Cemetery, Eco's sixth novel, was published in 2010. It is the story of a secret agent who \"weaves plots, conspiracies, intrigues and attacks, and helps determine the historical and political fate of the European Continent\". The book is a narrative of the rise of Modern-day antisemitism, by way of the Dreyfus affair, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and other important 19th-century events which gave rise to hatred and hostility toward the Jewish people.[citation needed]/nIn 2012, Eco and Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re published a book of conversations on the future of information carriers.[33] Eco criticized social networks, saying for example that \"Social media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine, without harming the community\u00a0... but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It's the invasion of the idiots.\"[34][35]/nFrom the Tree to the Labyrinth: Historical Studies on the Sign and Interpretation (2014)./nNumero Zero was published in 2015. Set in 1992 and narrated by Colonna, a hack journalist working on a Milan newspaper, it offers a satire of Italy's kickback and bribery culture[36] as well as, among many things, the legacy of Fascism.[citation needed]/nA group of avant-garde artists, painters, musicians and writers, whom he had befriended at RAI, the Neoavanguardia or Gruppo '63, became an important and influential component in Eco's writing career.[citation needed]/nIn 1971, Eco co-founded Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici (known as VS among Italian academics), a semiotic journal. VS is used by scholars whose work is related to signs and signification. The journal's foundation and activities have contributed to semiotics as an academic field in its own right, both in Italy and in the rest of Europe. Most of the well-known European semioticians, including Eco, A. J. Greimas, Jean-Marie Floch, and Jacques Fontanille, as well as philosophers and linguists like John Searle and George Lakoff, have published original articles in VS. His work with Serbian and Russian scholars and writers included thoughts on Milorad Pavi\u0107 and a meeting with Alexander Genis.[37]/nBeginning in the early 1990s, Eco collaborated with artists and philosophers such as Enrico Baj, Jean Baudrillard, and Donald Kuspit to publish a number of tongue-in-cheek texts on the imaginary science of 'pataphysics.[38][39]/nEco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with many translations. His novels are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to literature and history. Eco's work illustrates the concept of intertextuality, or the inter-connectedness of all literary works. Eco cited James Joyce and Jorge Luis Borges as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most.[40]/nEco was also a translator: he translated into Italian Raymond Queneau's Exercices de style (1947). Eco's translation was published under the title Esercizi di stile in 1983. He was also the translator of Sylvie, a novella by G\u00e9rard de Nerval.[citation needed]/nAs an academic studying philosophy, semiotics, and culture, Eco divided critics as to whether his theorizing should be seen as brilliant or an unnecessary vanity project obsessing over minutiae, while his fiction writing stunned critics with its simultaneous complexity and popularity. In his 1980 review of The Role of the Reader, philosopher Roger Scruton, attacking Eco's esoteric tendencies, writes that, \"[Eco seeks] the rhetoric of technicality, the means of generating so much smoke for so long that the reader will begin to blame his own lack of perception, rather than the author's lack of illumination, for the fact that he has ceased to see.\"[41] In his 1986 review of Faith in Fakes and Art and Beauty in the Middle Ages, art historian Nicholas Penny, meanwhile, accuses Eco of pandering, writing \"I suspect that Eco may have first been seduced from intellectual caution, if not modesty, by the righteous cause of 'relevance' (a word much in favour when the earlier of these essays appeared) \u2013 a cause which Medievalists may be driven to embrace with particularly desperate abandon.\"[42]/nAt the other end of the spectrum, Eco has been praised for his levity and encyclopedic knowledge, which allowed him to make abstruse academic subjects accessible and engaging. In a 1980 review of The Name of the Rose, literary critic and scholar Frank Kermode refers to Theory of Semiotics, as \"a vigorous but difficult treatise\", finding Eco's novel, \"a wonderfully interesting book \u2013 a very odd thing to be born of a passion for the Middle Ages and for semiotics, and a very modern pleasure.\"[43] Gilles Deleuze cites Eco's 1962 book The Open Work approvingly in his seminal 1968 text Difference and Repetition,  a book which poststructuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida is said to have also taken inspiration from.[44][45] In an obituary by the philosopher and literary critic Carlin Romano, meanwhile, Eco is described as having \"[become], over time, the critical conscience at the center of Italian humanistic culture, uniting smaller worlds like no one before him.\"[45]/nIn 2017, a retrospective of Eco's work was published by Open Court as the 35th volume in the prestigious Library of Living Philosophers, edited by Sara G. Beardsworth and Randall E. Auxier, featuring essays by 23 contemporary scholars.[46]/nFollowing the publication of The Name of the Rose in 1980, Eco was awarded the Strega prize in 1981, Italy's most prestigious literary award, receiving the Anghiari prize the same year. The following year, he received the Mendicis prize, and in 1985 the McLuhan Teleglobe prize.[15] In 2005, Eco was honoured with the Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement, along with Roger Angell.[47] In 2010, Eco was invited to join the Accademia dei Lincei.[48]/nEco was awarded honorary doctorate degrees by the University of Odense in 1986, Loyola University Chicago in 1987, the University of Glasgow in 1990, the University of Kent in 1992, Indiana University Bloomington in 1992, University of Tartu in 1996, Rutgers University in 2002, and the University of Belgrade in 2009.[15][49][50] Additionally, Eco was an honorary fellow of Kellogg College, Oxford.[51]/nIn 2014 he was awarded the Gutenberg Prize of the International Gutenberg Society and the City of Mainz.[citation needed]/nDuring his university studies, Eco ceased to believe in God and left the Catholic Church, later helping co-found the Italian skeptic organization Comitato Italiano per il Controllo delle Affermazioni sulle Pseudoscienze (Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences) CICAP.[52][53][54]/nIn September 1962 he married Renate Ramge\u00a0[de], a German graphic designer and art teacher with whom he had a son and a daughter./nEco divided his time between an apartment in Milan and a vacation house near Urbino.

An important educator during the modernization of Japan during the Meiji Era, Fenollosa was an enthusiastic Orientalist who did much to preserve traditional Japanese art./nFenollosa was born in 1853 as the son of Manuel Francisco Ciriaco Fenollosa, a Spanish pianist[1] born in M\u00e1laga in 1818, and Mary Silsbee, a member of a prominent family in\nBoston.[2] He attended public schools in his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts before studying philosophy and sociology at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1874./nHe studied for a year at the art school of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, during which time he married Elizabeth Goodhue Millett. In 1878 he was invited to Japan by American zoologist and Orientalist Edward S. Morse.[3] Fenollosa taught political economy and philosophy at the Imperial University at Tokyo. There he also studied ancient temples, shrines and art treasures with his assistant, Okakura Kakuz\u014d./nDuring his time in Japan, Fenollosa helped create the nihonga (Japanese) style of painting with Japanese artists Kan\u014d H\u014dgai (1828\u20131888) and Hashimoto Gah\u014d (1835\u20131908). In May 1882 he delivered a lecture on \"An Explanation of the Truth of Art\", which was widely circulated and quoted.[4]/nAfter eight years at the university, Fenollosa helped found the Tokyo School of Fine Arts and the Tokyo Imperial Museum. He served as director of the latter in 1888. In this period, he helped to draft the text of a law for the preservation of temples and shrines and their art treasures.[5]/nDeeply influenced by living in Japan, Fenollosa converted to Buddhism; he was given the name Teishin. He was also granted the name Kano Eitan Masanobu, placing him in the lineage of the Kan\u014d school, who had served as painters to the Tokugawa shoguns. While resident in Japan, Fenollosa conducted the first inventory of Japan's national treasures. This resulted in the discovery of ancient Chinese scrolls, which had been brought to Japan by traveling monks centuries earlier. He was able to rescue many Buddhist artifacts that would otherwise have been destroyed under the Haibutsu kishaku movement. For these achievements, the Emperor Meiji of Japan decorated Fenollosa with the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasures./nFenollosa amassed a large personal collection of Japanese art during his stay in Japan. In 1886, he sold his art collection to Boston physician Charles Goddard Weld (1857\u20131911) on the condition that it go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In 1890 he returned to Boston to serve as curator of the department of Oriental Art.[6] There Fenollosa was asked to choose Japanese art for display at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also organized Boston's first exhibition of Chinese painting in 1894. In 1896, he published Masters of Ukiyoe, a historical account of Japanese paintings and ukiyo-e prints exhibited at the New York Fine Arts Building.[7]/nWhen he divorced his wife, his immediate remarriage in 1895 to writer Mary McNeill Scott (1865\u20131954) outraged Boston society.[8] Fenollosa was dismissed from the Museum in 1896./nHe returned to Japan in 1897 to accept a position as Professor of English Literature at the Tokyo Higher Normal School at Tokyo. Lafcadio Hearn considered Fenollosa a friend; and Hearn almost believed that he visited the professor's home too often.[9]/nIn 1900, Fenollosa returned to the United States to write and lecture on Asia. His 1912 work in two volumes concentrates on art before 1800. He offers Hokusai's prints as a window of beauty after Japanese art had become too modern for his own taste: \"Hokusai is a great designer, as Kipling and Whitman are great poets. He has been called the Dickens of Japan.\" Arthur Wesley Dow said of Fenollosa that \"he was gifted with a brilliant mind of great analytical power, this with a rare appreciation gave him an insight into the nature of fine art such as few ever attain\".[10]/nAfter his death in London in 1908, Fenollosa's widow entrusted his unpublished notes on Chinese poetry and Japanese Noh drama to noted American poet Ezra Pound. Together with William Butler Yeats, Pound used the notes to stimulate the growing interest in Far Eastern literature among modernist writers. Pound subsequently finished Fenollosa's work with the aid of Arthur Waley, the noted British sinologist.[11]/nFenollosa's body was briefly interred on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, in London, but later cremated. According to his wishes, his ashes were returned for burial to the H\u014dmy\u014d-in chapel of Mii-dera (where he had been tonsured), high above Lake Biwa. His tombstone was paid for by the Tokyo School of Fine Arts.[12]/nAt a Harvard lecture of 2011, Benjamin Elman refers to the Epochs of the Chinese and Japanese Art (1912) where Fenollosa compares \"degeneration\" of the late imperial Chinese art to that which befell the high antique art of Europe in Byzantium (\"the poorest of the Byzantine mosaics\"; \"the only hope for the hopeless is to perceive itself to be hopeless\"). According to Elman, Fenollosa's perception was influenced by the political and military defeats of the Qing empire.[13]", "65076487": "Eug\u00e9nie Ginsberg or Eug\u00e9nie Ginsberg-Blaustein (1905-1944[1][2]) was a Polish philosopher and psychologist noted for her works on descriptive psychology and her analysis of existential dependence, independence, and related concepts as applied in the area of psychology./nGinsberg was the wife of the Polish psychologist Leopold Blaustein.

Sotion was the teacher of Seneca the Younger, who \"sat as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion.\"[3] Seneca derived from him his admiration of Pythagoreanism,[4] and quotes Sotion's views concerning vegetarianism and the migration of the soul:/nYou do not believe that souls are assigned, first to one body and then to another, and that our so-called death is merely a change of abode? You do not believe that in cattle, or in wild beasts, or in creatures of the deep, the soul of him who was once a man may linger?  You do not believe that nothing on this earth is annihilated, but only changes its haunts? And that animals also have cycles of progress and, so to speak, an orbit for their souls, no less than the heavenly bodies, which revolve in fixed circuits?  Great men have put faith in this idea; therefore, while holding to your own view, keep the whole question in abeyance in your mind.  If the theory is true, it is a mark of purity to refrain from eating flesh; if it be false, it is economy.  And what harm does it do to you to give such credence?  I am merely depriving you of food which sustains lions and vultures.[5]/nIt was perhaps this Sotion who was the author of a treatise on anger, quoted by Stobaeus.[6] Plutarch also quotes a Sotion[7] as the authority for certain statements respecting towns founded by Alexander the Great in India, which he had heard from his contemporary Potamo of Mytilene.

Motahhari is considered to have an important influence on the ideologies of the Islamic Republic, among others.[4] He was a co-founder of Hosseiniye Ershad and the Combatant Clergy Association (J\u0101me'e-ye Rowh\u0101niyat-e Mob\u0101rez). He was a disciple of Ruhollah Khomeini during the Shah's reign and formed the Council of the Islamic Revolution at Khomeini's request. He was chairman of the council at the time of his assassination.[5]/nMotahhari was born in Fariman. The year of birth is uncertain; with some sources giving 1919 and others giving it as 1920.[6] He attended the Hawza of Qom from 1944 to 1952 and then left for Tehran.[7] His grandfather was an eminent religious scholar in Sistan province and since he traveled with his family to Khorasan Province, there is little information about his origin as Sistanian.[8] His father Shaykh Mohammad Hosseini was also an eminent figure in his village, Fariman, who was respected by the people. He was considered as one of the pupils of Akhund Khorasani and besides he was admired by Ayatollah Mara'shi Najafi.[9]/nAt the age of 5, Morteza Motahhari went to school without informing his parents. By the age of twelve he learned the preliminary Islamic sciences from his father. He also went to the seminary of Mashhad and studied for two years there in the school of Abd ul-Khan along with his brother. But his studies remained unfinished in Mashhad seminary because of problems faced by his family which obliged him to return to Fariman to help them.[10]/nAccording to Motahhari's own account, in this period he could study a great number of historical books. It was in this period that he was confronted with questions on worldview such as the problem of God. He considered Agha Mirza Mahdi Shahid Razavi as an eminent master in rational sciences. He decided to go to Qom in 1315 (Solar Hijri calendar).[11]/nHe finally took up residence in the school of Feyzieh in Qom. He studied the books Kifayah and Makaseb in Shia jurisprudence under the instruction of Ayatollah Sayyed Mohaqeq Yazdi popularly known as Damad. He also participated in the lectures of Hojjat Kooh Kamarehei and sought knowledge from Sadr al-Din al-Sadr, Mohammad Taqi Khansari, Golpaygani, Ahmad Khansari and Najafi Marashi.[11]/nWhen Ayatollah Boroujerdi emigrated to Qom, Motahari could take part in his courses on Principles of Jurisprudence. Ayatollah Montazeri was his classmate in this period.[11]/nLater, Motahhari emigrated to Isfahan because of hot climate of Qom. There he became familiar with Haj Ali Agha Shirazi who was the teacher of Nahj al-Balagha in 1320 (Solar Hijri calendar) whom Motahhari always described with honor.[11]\nLater, he joined the University of Tehran, where he taught philosophy for 22 years. Between 1965 and 1973 he also gave regular lectures at the Hosseiniye Ershad in Northern Tehran./nMotahhari wrote several books on Islam, Iran, and historical topics. His emphasis was on teaching rather than writing. However, after his death, some of his students worked on writing down his lectures and publishing them as books. As of the mid-2008, the \"Sadra Publication\" published more than sixty volumes by Motahhari. Nearly 30 books were written about Motahhari or quoted from his speeches./nMorteza Motahhari opposed what he called groups who \"depend on other schools, especially materialistic schools\" but who present these \"foreign ideas with Islamic emblems\". In a June 1977 article he wrote to warn \"all great Islamic authorities\" of the danger of \"these external influential ideas under the pretext and banner of Islam.\" It is thought he was referring to the People's Mujahideen of Iran and the Furqan Group.[12]/nMotahhari was the father-in-law of Iran's former secretary of National Security Council Ali Larijani.[13] It was by Motahari's advice that Larijani switched from computer science to Western Philosophy for graduate studies./nA major street in Tehran formerly known as Takhte Tavoos (Peacock Throne) was renamed after him. Morteza Motahari Street connects Sohrevardi Street and Valiasr Street, two major streets in Tehran./nDuring the struggle with Shah's regime, Morteza Motahhari contributed in creating new Islamic discourses.[14] Besides, he was among those who had discussed the conditions of Marja' after the death of Ayatollah Broujerdi. He wrote the book Mutual services of Iran and Islam in such a[clarification needed]condition. Also his works had an important impact on expanding the movement of religious reform in early days of revolution. His works primarily consisted of traditional Islamic and Shia thoughts.[15] He wrote an essay about revitalization of religious thought in the occasion. Writing the \"need for Candidness in religious leadership\", he aimed to show the youth the attractiveness of Islam.[16][17]/nMorteza Motahhari expressed his opinions in different majors and disciplines such as philosophy, religion, economic, politics, etc. Motahhari and Shariati were counted as two prominent figures during Islamic revolution of Iran. He emphasized on Islamic democracy for suitable political structure.[18]/nMotahhari also recognized fitra as the truth of human. According to him, fitra is a permanent and unchangeable quality in human nature. In fact, he believed that fitra played the role of a mediator in God-human beings relation. Also, he believed that Imam was a perfect man who shows the high rank of human spirituality. Imam also is characterized as a religious leader. His lengthy footnote on the \"book of principles of philosophy and method of realism\" by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i was against the historical Marxism.[19] Also he believed that Wali-e faqih only had the right of supervisory not governing.[20] He also maintained that the ruling was one of the political aspect of Imam in society.[21] He maintained that there was no conflict between science and religion since he believed that Science qua science had no conflict and challenge with metaphysics. He believed that the quasi-conflict between science and religion was in terms of their language not themselves.[22]/nMotahhari also expressed views on development and relevant ideology. According to him, freedom, culture and mental-cultural revolution are principles of development. He also refers to some elements for characterizing a developed society. These factors are independence, knowledge and transcendence. Also, according to Motahhari, development originates from cultural self-reliance, purification of cultural sources and logical and cautious communication with west. Motahhari believed in the development of human resources but he also thought that economy was not an aim but only is a condition for development.[18]/nAs outlined by Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari in 1975, the phrase 'equal rights' means something different from what is commonly understood by western world. He clarified that men and women were innately different and therefore enjoyed different rights, duties and punishments.[23]/nMotahhari believed that the eternality of Islam is provided by Fiqh. He thought that fiqh along with the character of ijtihad could be an important thing for confronting with the problem of different times and places. Using ijtihad, there is no need to a new prophet.[20]/nMotahhari defined freedom as nonexistence of obstacles. According to him, obstacles were of two characters. The first one was that obstacle could limit human and besides counted as a something get human not to do something. In simple word, obstacle could has the dignity of limiting and declining humans. The second one is to thing which decline the perception and introspection of subject in terms of knowledge. According to Motahhari, aside from the realization of putting away obstacles we need to give the spirit of freedom. He analyze the concept of freedom as both right and obligation. He believes that the freedom has necessity for human. Human must be free to choose voluntarily his path. He believes that, contrary to liberalists, inborn right has an ultimate for transcending of human beings.[24]/nLike other men of thought, Motahhari thinks that we have to define the concepts first of all. Therefore, he defines right as a dominance or score on something. According to right the human is merit to possess something and other human ought to respect him. Some of rights are such as the right of parents on their children or the rights of husband and wife in relation to each other. Motahhari divided the right into two groups. First group is existential rights or takwini and the second is religious rights or tashriei. former is a real relation between person and object and the latter determined according to former. He knew the right as a potential score for persons. In fact the right concerned with the priority of somebody on something. He concerned with the question in that is the right and possession predicated on human as such or predicated on human in terms of being in society? He believes that undoubtedly the right existed prior to society. Contrary to John Austin (legal philosopher), Motahhari believes that there is a mutual relation between right and responsibility (Haq va Taklif). Motahhari believes that the natural law theory is a rational one that is of importance for human kind. According to him, the foundation of natural theory of law is to world has a goal and aim finally. On the basis of principle of having goal, the God creates the world for the sake of human kind and they have potential right to change the world therefore human kind have right prior to introducing in society.[25]/nMotahhari refers to the concept of 'maktab' or school when he intends to define the word of religion. According to him maktab is a thoughtful disciplined system including ideology and View in terms of ethics, politics, economy and civil law, etc. Finally, he defines religion as a collection of knowledge bestowed to human for the sake of guiding him and also religion is a collection of beliefs, moralities and individual and collective judgments. Therefore, he knows religion and its teaching as beliefs, moralities and judgments. Also Motahhari believes that the domain of religion at all is not limited to life but concerned with after afterlife. He believes that Islam as a religion is consistent with life of human and there is no room for denying it.[26]/nDariush Shayegan believes that Motahhari confused the Hegelian thought and Stace's quotations in confronting with Hegel. According to Shaygan since each of Motahhari and Hegel belong to different paradigms, there is no common world between them.[27]/nHe considered Marxism as a great threat for youths and revolution of Iran therefore he tried to criticize Marxism along with pioneer figures like Ali Shariati. Also his commentary on the book of Mulla Sadra influenced many scholars. Besides, he also emphasized on the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge. Motahhari argued that if someone compares fatwas belong to different jurists and at the same time considers their lives and states of knowledge then it is clear that the presuppositions of jurists and its knowledge affected their knowledge. According to him, because of this reason, we observe that the fatwa belong to Arab has an Arab flavor and the fatwa belong to non-Arab has an Ajam flavor. Also He tried to compare Quran with nature. He also believed that the contemporary interpretations of Quran were considerable than Ancient rendition of Islam because the future generation has a better understanding of Quran and Also a deeper appreciation of it. But at the same Time he doesn't believe in epistemological pluralism.[28]/nOn 1 May 1979 Morteza Motahhari was assassinated in Tehran by gunshot after leaving a late meeting at the house of Yadollah Sahabi.[29] The Furqan Group claimed responsibility for the assassination.[29] The alleged assassin was the group's founder, Akbar Goudarzi.[30]/nOn the occasions of Morteza Motahari's death (assassinated by Forqan Group), 12-Ordibehesht (the second month of the Solar Hijri calendar) has been named at the calendar of Islamic Republic of Iran as \"Teachers' Day\".[31][32][33] An honoring of \"Teachers' Day\" is held annually in Iran for a week.[34]/nIn 1346, due to the establishment of Hosseinieh Ershad and with the insistence of his friends to get closer to Hosseinieh, he moved to Dolat Street, Gholhak neighborhood. During his 9 years of residence in this house (from 1346 to 1355), which had the longest time compared to the rest of his years of residence in Tehran, he wrote most of his works in this house. The house is built on two floors, on the first floor of which are the manuscripts and personal belongings of Shahid Motahari and on the second floor are the books of that martyr. The Shahid Motahari Museum was established in 2007. Identifying, collecting, organizing, introducing and preserving the works of the master is one of the main goals of becoming a museum of this historical house. Providing a suitable space and environment for researchers who intend to study the works of Master Motahhari has also been one of the reasons for reading the second floor of this house. Holding seminars and meetings on the subject of the master's works is one of the most important group programs of this museum house, which is held several times during the year.[35]/nHe \"authored over fifty books, which dealt with theology and philosophy as well as practical issues such as sexual ethics, usury, and insurance\",[37] some of which include:", "20086025": "John A. Mackay (May 17, 1889 \u2013 June 9, 1983) was a Presbyterian theologian, missionary, and educator. He was a strong advocate of the Ecumenical Movement and World Christianity./nJohn A. Mackay was born on May 17, 1889, in Inverness, Scotland, the eldest of five children. The family attended the Free Presbyterian Church, a very small denomination. At the age of 14 at a communion service at Rogart, Scotland, Mackay had a profound religious experience that influenced the remainder of his life.[1]/nAs a youth he attended the Inverness Royal Academy, where he was a good student, winning several academic prizes upon graduation in 1907. Mackay then studied philosophy and logic at the University of Aberdeen, leaving for a time to pursue theological studies for the Free Presbyterian Church ministry. He returned to Aberdeen to complete his honors degree which he received in 1913. That same year Mackay crossed the Atlantic and enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary. When he was graduated in 1915, he won a fellowship in didactic and polemic theology, which he used toward studies in Spanish culture at Madrid, Spain, to prepare for missionary work in Latin America.[2]/nIn 1916 Mackay and Jane Logan Wells, who had been recently married, sailed to Peru where they founded a school, Colegio Anglo Peruano, in Lima, Peru, under the auspices of the Free Church of Scotland.[3] The school was a center for progressive ideas during a period when social and educational reforms were sweeping through Latin America. Haya de la Torre, a political leader in Latin America, taught at the school. The mission also started a mission station at Cajamarca in the northern Peru./nFrom his position as school master, Mackay entered intellectual circles and became a member of a literary group that included Victor Andres Belaunde, Professor of Philosophy at San Marcos University. Francisco Garcia Calderon Rey and his brother, Ventura, were the group's European correspondents. Five members were corresponding members of the Spanish Academy. In 1925 Mackay was appointed to the Chair of Modern Philosophy at San Marcos and also accepted the chair in Metaphysics.[4]/nIn 1926 the Colegio was sufficiently rooted to survive without his leadership. Mackay joined the Y.M.C.A. as an evangelist and religious teacher moving his family to Montevideo, Uruguay, where the Y.M.C.A. operated a leadership institute. During the next seven and one-half years, he traveled widely through Chile, Brazil, and Argentina as an evangelistic speaker. He attended the Jerusalem Conference of 1928 and traveled extensively in Europe during his furlough in 1930. From April to July 1930 Mackay and his family lived in Bonn, Germany where he attended the lectures of Karl Barth and began a friendship with him. Under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A. Mackay made many significant addresses in Mexico during the revolutionary period of religious persecution, including an address to over 2,000 men and women in the largest theatre in the town of Chihuahua. Over the years he was invited to speak at 35 Latin American universities./nIn 1936, Mackay reluctantly left the foreign mission field to become the third president of Princeton Theological Seminary which had recently been weakened by the secession of several professors, including his own former teacher, J. Gresham Machen. For the next 24 years as both president and professor of ecumenics, Mackay worked on many fronts to revive the institution's health, inspiring it to evangelical dynamism and leaving it on a sound footing, with expanded faculty, student body, and campus plant.[5] In 1944, Mackay founded the journal Theology Today to provide insights \"into the life of man in the light of God\". The editorial board included Robert Elliott Speer, Richard Niebuhr, and J. Harvey Cotton. By 1952 Theology Today was the most widely distributed religious quarterly in the world. After retirement from the seminary, he served from 1961 to 1964 as adjunct professor of Hispanic thought at American University, Washington, D.C./nAn eloquent and charismatic platform speaker and preacher, Mackay was often called upon to present keynote addresses at conferences, assemblies, and gatherings. As the holder of leadership roles in church organizations, his constituency included tens of millions of Christians. Five leadership roles were particularly significant, the presidency of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions from 1944 to 1951, after which he continued serving as a member of the Mission Board; membership on the Provisional Committee of the World Council of Churches in 1946 and from 1948 membership on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; the chairmanship of the International Missionary Council from January 1, 1948, to 1958; membership on the executive committee of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and from 1954 the presidency of its executive committee; and moderator of the 165th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, USA, 1953\u20131954.[6]/nThese leadership roles gave Mackay platforms that enhanced his spiritual influence and authority. In addition to writing the influential \"Letter to Presbyterians\", which fortified resistance to McCarthyism in the United States, Mackay was also the primary draftsman of a number of other church statements and messages on behalf of various ecclesiastical councils and conferences.[7]/nAlthough known primarily for his mission work in Latin America, Mackay worked to advance World Christianity through travels and at conferences in Asia, Europe, and Africa. These included the Eastern Asia Christian Conference in Bangkok in 1949, the Asia Study Conference in Lucknow, India in 1952, the All Africa Church Conference, Ibadan, Nigeria, 1958, and the Joseph Cook Lectureship which took him around the world during, 1960\u20131961./nThus, as a fellow Presbyterian leader correctly concluded, Mackay exerted influential leadership in three broad areas: Missions, the Ecumenical Movement, and social and political thought and action.[8]/nMackay strongly emphasized sensitivity to and experience of the reality of God in Christ and authentic conscious experience of life in Christian community. Frequently asked to preach, his sermons called for response on the part of his hearers. Mackay wrote devotional literature in English and Spanish. He believed in a personal and incarnational approach to foreign missions by which the missionary would become a member of the community and earn the right to be heard through particular service that met specific needs within the receiving culture. These might include the demonstration of authentic Christianity in action through educational, medical, or agricultural service. This gift of service offered a platform through which the missionary could effectively proclaim the faith that he held./nAt the Oxford Conference on Church and State in 1937, Mackay coined the phrase that became the byword of the conference, \"Let the Church be the Church.\" He yearned for the Church \"to become in its historical existence the dynamic instrument of God's will, which it actually was in its eternal essence,\"[9] He influenced historical development within the ecumenical movement by his strong advocacy, as at the Central Committee meeting of the World Council of Churches at Rolle in August, 1951.[10] For him \"the church is the fellowship of those for whom Jesus Christ is Lord.\"[11] He believed the Church was truly the Church when it was a missionary Church, and he worked to bring into balance the Church universal, the Una Sancta, with confessional movements within various faith traditions. Mackay advocated visible unity of the Church. His high Christology also stressed a unity of spirit with a diversity of treasures from the various Christian traditions. In this way Mackay helped to lay the foundation for spiritual ecumenism among fellow Christians across denominational lines. Travelling in Chile in 1965 Mackay agreed with Fr. Juan Ochagaria, dean of the Catholic University of Chile's faculty of theology, that the task of both Catholics and Presbyterians is to \"make Christians.\"[12]/nIn 1964 in Lima, Mackay was presented with the Palmas Magisteriales, a civic honor and the highest government award for educational services to Peru./nIn his final years Mackay moved to a Presbyterian retirement community in Hightstown, New Jersey, and died early on June 9, 1983. Coincidentally, the General Assembly of his denomination voted to join the Southern Presbyterian Church later that same morning. It would have pleased Mackay because he had worked for many years for the reunion of the Northern and Southern Presbyterian Churches./nEach of the Mackays' three daughters married Presbyterian clergyman, and their son, Duncan Alexander Duff Mackay, named for the Scottish Free Church missionary to India, Alexander Duff, was an active layman and elder, while working for the U.S. Foreign Service and later the Inter-American Development Bank.", "15170825": "Raymond Brassier (born December 22, 1965) is a British philosopher. He is member of the philosophy faculty at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, known for his work in philosophical realism. He was formerly Research Fellow at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Middlesex University, London, England./nBrassier is the author of Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction and the translator of Alain Badiou's Saint Paul: The Foundation of Universalism and Theoretical Writings and Quentin Meillassoux's After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency. He first attained prominence as a leading authority on the works of Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle./nBrassier is of mixed French-Scottish ancestry, and his family name is pronounced in the French manner./nHe received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of North London in 1995 and Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of Warwick in 1997 and 2001 respectively.[2]/nAlong with Quentin Meillassoux, Graham Harman, and Iain Hamilton Grant, Brassier is one of the foremost philosophers of contemporary speculative realism interested in providing a robust defence of philosophical realism in the wake of the challenges posed to it by post-Kantian critical idealism, phenomenology, post-modernism, deconstruction, or, more broadly speaking, what they refer to as \"correlationism\". Brassier is generally credited with coining the term speculative realism, though Meillassoux had earlier used the phrase speculative materialism  (French: mat\u00e9rialisme sp\u00e9culatif) to refer to his own position./nBrassier himself, however, does not identify with the speculative realist movement, and, further, debates that there even is such a movement, stating:/nThe \"speculative realist movement\" exists only in the imaginations of a group of bloggers promoting an agenda for which I have no sympathy whatsoever: actor\u2013network theory spiced with pan-psychist metaphysics and morsels of process philosophy. I don't believe the internet is an appropriate medium for serious philosophical debate; nor do I believe it is acceptable to try to concoct a philosophical movement online by using blogs to exploit the misguided enthusiasm of impressionable graduate students. I agree with Deleuze's remark that ultimately the most basic task of philosophy is to impede stupidity, so I see little philosophical merit in a \"movement\" whose most signal achievement thus far is to have generated an online orgy of stupidity.[3]/nBrassier is strongly critical of much of contemporary philosophy for what he regards as its attempt \"to stave off the 'threat' of nihilism by safeguarding the experience of meaning \u2013 characterized as the defining feature of human existence \u2013 from the Enlightenment logic of disenchantment\". According to Brassier, this tendency is exemplified above all by philosophers strongly influenced by Heidegger and Wittgenstein. Unlike philosophers such as John McDowell, who would press philosophy into service in an attempt to bring about a \"re-enchantment of the world\", Brassier's work aims to \"push nihilism to its ultimate conclusion\"./nAccording to Brassier, \"the disenchantment of the world understood as a consequence of the process whereby the Enlightenment shattered the 'great chain of being' and defaced the 'book of the world' is a necessary consequence of the coruscating potency of reason, and hence an invigorating vector of intellectual discovery, rather than a calamitous diminishment\".[4] \"Philosophy\", exhorts Brassier, \"would do well to desist from issuing any further injunctions about the need to re-establish the meaningfulness of existence, the purposefulness of life, or mend the shattered concord between man and nature. It should strive to be more than a sop to the pathetic twinge of human self-esteem. Nihilism is not an existential quandary but a speculative opportunity.\"[4]/nBrassier's work attempts to fuse elements of post-war French philosophy with ideas arising from the (largely Anglo-American) traditions of philosophical naturalism, cognitive science, and neurophilosophy. Thus, along with French philosophers such as Fran\u00e7ois Laruelle, Alain Badiou, and Quentin Meillassoux, he is also heavily influenced by the likes of Paul Churchland, Thomas Metzinger and Stephen Jay Gould. He also draws heavily, albeit often negatively, on the work of Gilles Deleuze, Edmund Husserl, and Martin Heidegger./nBrassier's work has often been associated with contemporary philosophies of nihilism and pessimism. In an interview True Detective creator and writer Nic Pizzolatto gave he cited Brassier's Nihil Unbound as an influence on the TV series, along with Thomas Ligotti's The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, Jim Crawford's Confessions of an Antinatalist, Eugene Thacker's In The Dust of This Planet, and David Benatar's Better Never to Have Been.[5]/nBooks/nBook chapters", "49544464": "Danielle Monique Macbeth (born 1954, Edmonton) is a Canadian philosopher whose work focuses on the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, metaphysics, and the philosophy of logic.

Rather than treating Begriffsschrift (Frege's logic) as a notational variant of quantificational logic, Macbeth proposes that reasoning in Begriffsschrift is more like the diagrammatic reasoning of the geometrician or algebraicist. She argues that philosophers and mathematicians alike have failed to recognize the revolutionary powers of Begriffsschrift in its expressive and demonstrative capacities.[2]/nRealizing Reason, her most recent book, takes a Hegelian approach to the philosophy of mathematics and traces developments in philosophy, logic, mathematics, and physics beginning with Aristotle in order to illuminate how (pure) reason has come to be realized as a power of knowing. She focuses on three periods: Ancient Greece, early modern mathematics, physics, and philosophy (Descartes to Kant), and late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century mathematics and physics. Macbeth argues that with her new reading of Frege, we can finally break out of the Kantian framework that remains in place even in twentieth-century analytic philosophy and thereby finally understand how contemporary mathematics enables real extensions of our knowledge on the basis of strictly deductive reasoning.

His work appears in six published volumes, including The Paradox of Cause (1978) and most recently The Task of Criticism (2006). His principal philosophical ambitions were 1) to reconcile the idealism of Josiah Royce and the pragmatism of William James and 2) to integrate philosophical thought and historical thought. As testimony to the integrative nature of his thinking, Miller referred to his philosophy as a \"historical idealism\u201d and a \u201cnaturalistic idealism.\u201d/nJohn William Miller was born on January 8, 1895, in Rochester, New York. He began his undergraduate education at Harvard University in 1912, transferred to the University of Rochester for his sophomore and junior years, and then returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for his senior year. Miller received his A. B. from Harvard in 1916. At the onset of American involvement in the First World War, Miller declared himself a conscientious objector and served as a volunteer in the ambulance corps in France with Base Hospital 44./nAfter the war, Miller returned to Harvard to begin graduate studies in philosophy. Among his teachers were philosophical realists such as Ralph Barton Perry and Edwin Bissell Holt as well as idealists such as William Ernest Hocking and Clarence Irving Lewis.  It is still fair to say, however, that Miller\u2019s strongest philosophical influences dated from the 19th century and were, most prominently, the German idealists Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Ralph Waldo Emerson was also an important influence on the American side. In 1921 Miller received his master's degree and, under the direction of Hocking, went on to compose a work on the fundamental connection among epistemology, semiotics, and ontology. This work, titled \"The Definition of the Thing,\" earned him the doctorate in 1922./nMiller's teaching career began in 1922 with an appointment at Connecticut College. During this time he married Katherine S. Gisel (1897\u20131993). In the fall of 1924 he took a position at Williams College in the Berkshire Mountains of northwest Massachusetts./nApart from two summer sessions and a one-year visiting appointment at the University of Minnesota in 1937\u20131938, Miller\u2019s teaching career was spent at Williams College until his retirement in 1960. He served as chair of the philosophy department from 1931 to 1955 and influenced three generations of students. (Miller was often selected by graduating classes as the most influential professor at Williams and twice the college yearbook was dedicated to him.) From 1945 on he was Mark Hopkins Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, a title inherited from his colleague and predecessor as chair, the critical realist James Bissett Pratt./nDuring his early years at Williams, Miller and Katherine raised their two sons, Eugene (born 1925) and Paul (born 1928)./nAt Williams, Miller taught courses across the whole philosophical curriculum\u2014i.e., epistemology, metaphysics, aesthetics, semiotics, and political philosophy. Perhaps his greatest innovation in the classroom was the introduction of a course in the philosophy of history at a time when positivism was further separating philosophical reflection from historical thinking./nThere was also no separating Miller\u2019s historical idealism from his pedagogical philosophy. He was known to say, \"I cannot understand a man unless I take him at his word.\" Classroom discussion, the civil exchange of ideas, and having a personal stake in each philosophical conversation were essential. For Miller philosophy was a mode of utterance wherein one actually speaks (i.e., expresses himself) and takes responsibility for what is said (i.e., reflects upon himself).  Short of making both of these commitments\u2014i.e., to expression and reflection\u2014honest conversation is no more possible than is philosophy. The speech of the classroom serves to highlight the philosophical bases of conversation./nIt was as a teacher and not as a scholar that Miller was best known initially. Indeed, his reputation as a thinker spread via his teaching practice and the modest fame that came to him by means of the accounts of his former students. (See George Brockway\u2019s essay on Miller, first published in the journal of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, The American Scholar, and later reprinted in Masters: Portraits of Great Teachers wherein Miller was grouped with educators of renown such as Hannah Arendt and Morris Raphael Cohen.) However, because he focused on his teaching and did most of his writing in the context of preparing lecturers and philosophical correspondence, Miller did not focus on formal scholarly publication./nIn the 1930s he published two important articles in The Journal of Philosophy: \"The Paradox of Cause\" (1935) and \"Accidents Will Happen\" (1937). After these two publications, he presented four public papers: \"Freedom as a Characteristic of Man in a Democratic Society\" (American Political Science Association, Chicago, 1938), \"History and Humanism\" (Harvard Philosophy Club, 1948), \"The Midworld\" (Harvard Philosophy Club, 1952), and \"The Scholar as Man of the World\" (Phi Beta Kappa Society, Hobart College, 1952). This small number of essays and statements made available to public audiences belied the fact that in private Miller was a prodigious writer who was actively at work developing a coherent philosophical system organized around his central concept, the midworld. It would not be until his retirement that he would gather his writings and begin to make his historical idealism known to people other than his students and occasional auditors./nUpon his retirement in 1960, Miller remained in Williamstown and continued his practice of philosophical conversation. However, the years of his retirement found Miller faced with the strong encouragement of a handful of former students who urged him to publish the four public addresses just mentioned and some of the many essays that he had penned over the years. In 1961 Miller published \"The Ahistoric and the Historic\" as an Afterword to a volume of translated essays by Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, History as a System and Other Essays Toward a Philosophy of History. Finally, by the late 1970s, Miller gathered a collection of his essays, which were published just before his death under the title The Paradox of Cause and Other Essays./nThe philosophy that one finds in The Paradox of Cause and such posthumous works as The Philosophy of History (1981), The Midworld of Symbols and Functioning Objects (1982), and In Defense of the Psychological (1983) is a hybrid. Miller consciously sought a middle route through the oppositions of realism and idealism as well as pragmatism and idealism.  It is a synthesis and revision of those contesting positions. For Miller philosophy was not the means of removing strife but, rather, the recognition and thoughtful organization of conflict. \"To philosophize,\" Miller wrote, \"is to be in thoughtful control of a problem.\" One important way of describing his thinking, then, is to say that Miller's philosophical synthesis does not effectively resolve the conflicts of his predecessors but shows the philosophical import of their disputes and the way in which their contests outline what must be ingredient in any worthwhile philosophy. His conception defines philosophy as the activity of criticism in the Kantian sense of that term\u2014i.e., to be aware of the conditions of one's endeavors./nAs stated above, Miller\u2019s philosophy unites philosophical thinking and historical thinking. In doing so he fully integrated concepts of action and symbolism into his epistemology and metaphysics. The fruits of this approach are seen in his ethical and political philosophy./nIn his dissertation and subsequent book The Definition of the Thing With Some Notes on Language (1980), Miller tied together epistemology and ontology via an examination of the process of definition. Here the possibility of \u201cstatic definition\u201d was attacked\u2014i.e., a definition that has no connection to action and a defined thing that is fundamentally ahistorical. Unless definition is considered in this manner, Miller argued, we cannot make sense of 1) our own participation in the process and the establishment of meaning, and 2) the evolution and constant refinement of our understanding of things in the world. There is a dynamic relationship between the universal and particular, the terms of definition (predicates) and the thing defined./nThe process of definition is founded on human action and meaning understood as \"meaning for a human actor.\" At the bottom of definition is, Miller contended, an unending search for local control\u2014i.e., an understanding of oneself and one\u2019s world that was adequate to support a plan of action. Definition thus ties in with pragmatism. But Miller was careful to underscore that his appropriation of pragmatism was not a crude pragmatism of simple means\u2013ends thinking. Rather Miller saw the fundamental practicality of universal ideas and fundamental concepts which provide general order to our world (e.g., mathematics, language) but which are, on their face, not useful in any immediate sense. Definition links together individual actors and universal concepts in an existential dialectic in which meaning is established and revised./nThe midworld was one of Miller\u2019s central ideas and also one of his most difficult to understand. First it needs to be stated that the midworld of symbols and what Miller called \u2018\u2019functioning objects\u2019\u2019, is part of his answer to the problem of universals. What are these universals that are part of the process of definition? How do they arise? How do they relate to particulars? Miller\u2019s response to these age-old questions was to say that universals are always embodied and they are always applied (and so made evident) in action. Just so, the idea of space is established in measuring devices like rulers. Instruments such as clocks determine the idea of time. The idea of justice is founded in judicial courts. Rulers, clocks, courts\u2014these are all symbolic objects or practices. They are also functioning objects in the sense that a ruler is only different from another piece of wood in terms of what one does with it; they are symbolic objects that exist in use and in no other way./nAs Miller made clear in The Midworld of Symbols and Functioning Objects, the midworld is not a world proper but rather the totality of all functioning objects (understanding object to have enough flexibility to include regularized practices and natural bodies such as the human organism). This open-ended collection of symbols is also not truly between anything. The midworld is not halfway between subjectivity and objectivity, the ideal and the real, or the natural and the artificial. It is more accurate to say that the functioning object is that thing which allows for one to disclose the subjective and the objective; it is not between these two worlds of experience but is in fact their condition of appearance. The symbols of the midworld are the vehicles by which we define ourselves, define our world, and engage in the ongoing process by which those definitions are revised in light of our discoveries about the world and our new demands for local control/nDefinition is a historical process and the symbols of the midworld have historical careers. The need to generate, maintain, and revise meanings is one way of understanding history, and it is on such terms that we see the unity of epistemology, ontology, and metaphysics that provides a deep context in which we can grasp what Miller writes regarding definition, action, and symbol./nMiller embraced history in all his works but it is in The Philosophy of History that he drew a close connection between historical thinking and philosophical thinking. He did this in contrast to an ancient tradition (beginning at least with Plato) which joins philosophy with the timeless. However, as Miller noted, if philosophy is ahistoric then all philosophy can produce are observations. Philosophy cannot be related to or relevant for action. Of course, for proponents of the contemplative life this was something that recommended the ahistoricism of philosophy. Miller not only questioned the fundamental premises of ahistoric philosophy by arguing that every observation or thought is an action and thus an engagement in history but he also cast doubt on the relevance of a philosophy that does not derive from and speak to our pressing concerns for personal order, meaning, and right action. Because Miller\u2019s philosophy is fundamentally a philosophy of criticism, if we are to grasp the conditions of our endeavors (and thus have self-conscious and responsible lives) then our philosophy must be historical and go to the midworld as the historical career of those very conditions. Philosophy and history not only must come together but also, considered in the appropriate light, are the same./nA critical philosophy becomes a political philosophy by virtue of our involvement in a community. Historical and philosophical thought can be individual and the sort of responsibility about which Miller wrote is in an important sense a responsibility of an individual to and for herself. However, the concept of the individual begs its pair in society and political institutions, and so critical ethics must become critical politics. It is in this fashion that Miller\u2019s historical idealism can be understood as a metaphysics of democracy (a term he borrowed from Walt Whitman\u2019s Democratic Vistas)./nThe ideal community provides people with the chance to act, the chance to be effective and become historical actors who maintain or revise the conditions of their endeavors. As one can see in The Task of Criticism, in order for that to be so we need to support something not unlike Karl Popper\u2019s idea of an open society. Here Miller revisited the traditional connection between liberal democratic politics and the scientific community in which free and respectful speech is licensed, formal modes of criticism are supported, and orderly change and development is a key goal. In order to affect that, in both politics and science, Miller maintained that, as noted above, a historical and symbolic conception of rationality has to be endorsed./nUltimately, for Miller, there is a convergence of historical study and political action. Scholarship and citizenship are two sides of the same coin in that they are two facets of an active and responsible life\u2014i.e., understanding and then engaging with conditions of one\u2019s endeavors./nWhile retirement did eventuate in the publication of The Paradox of Cause, Miller passed his latter years quietly, conducting philosophy in the form of conversation and correspondence much as he had during his teaching career. Miller continued to write and clarify his philosophical position right up until his death on December 25, 1978. He was buried in the Westlawn Cemetery just west of the Williams College campus.", "228637": "Rudolf Christoph Eucken (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0281u\u02d0d\u0254lf \u02c8\u0294\u0254\u028fkn\u0329] \u24d8; 5 January 1846\u00a0\u2013 14 September 1926[3]) was a German philosopher. He received the 1908 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his earnest search for truth, his penetrating power of thought, his wide range of vision, and the warmth and strength in presentation with which in his numerous works he has vindicated and developed an idealistic philosophy of life\", after he had been nominated by a member of the Swedish Academy.[4]/nEucken was born on 5 January 1846 in Aurich, then in the Kingdom of Hanover (now Lower Saxony). His father, Ammo Becker Eucken (1792\u20131851) died when he was a child, and he was brought up by his mother, Ida Maria (1814\u20131872, n\u00e9e Gittermann).[5] He was educated at Aurich, where one of his teachers was the classical philologist and philosopher Ludwig Wilhelm Maximilian Reuter (1803\u20131881).[6] He studied at G\u00f6ttingen University (1863\u201366), where Hermann Lotze was one of his teachers, and Berlin University.[5] In the latter place, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg was a professor whose ethical tendencies and historical treatment of philosophy greatly attracted him./nEucken received his PhD in classical philology and ancient history at G\u00f6ttingen University in 1866 with a dissertation under the title De Aristotelis dicendi ratione.[7] However, the inclination of his mind was definitely towards the philosophical side of theology.[6] In 1871, after five years working as a school teacher at Husum, Berlin und Frankfurt, he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Basel, Switzerland, succeeding another of his former teachers at G\u00f6ttingen, Gustav Teichm\u00fcller, and beating Friedrich Nietzsche in competition for the position. He stayed there until 1874 when he took up a similar position at the University of Jena.[6] He stayed there until he retired in 1920. In 1912\u201313, Eucken spent half of the year as an exchange professor at Harvard University, and in 1913 he served as a Deem lecturer at New York University.[8][9] During World War I, Eucken, like many of his academic colleagues, took a strong line in favour of the causes with which his country had associated itself.[5][10]/nEucken's philosophical work is partly historical and partly constructive, the former side being predominant in his earlier, the latter in his later works. Their most striking feature is the close organic relationship between the two parts. The aim of the historical works is to show the necessary connection between philosophical concepts and the age to which they belong; the same idea is at the root of his constructive speculation. All philosophy is philosophy of life, the development of a new culture, not mere intellectualism, but the application of a vital religious inspiration to the practical problems of society. This practical idealism Eucken described by the term \"ethical activism.\"[1] In accordance with this principle, Eucken gave considerable attention to social and educational problems.[6]/nHe maintained that humans have souls, and that they are therefore at the junction between nature and spirit. He believed that people should overcome their non-spiritual nature by continuous efforts to achieve a spiritual life, another aspect of his ethical activism and meaning of life./nRudolf Eucken married Irene Passow (1863\u20131941) in 1882 and had a daughter and two sons.

The judge decided that due to these last words in Payne's will, it had not been his intention to create a trust and therefore Thomas had inherited from him an absolute title in his property, which thus passed by law to his daughter./nNotoriously, Knight's first book, A Discourse on the Worship of Priapus (1786), sought to recover the importance of ancient phallic cults. Knight's apparent preference for ancient sacred eroticism over Judeo-Christian puritanism led to many attacks on him as an infidel and as a scholarly apologist for libertinism. This ensured the persistent distrust of the religious establishment. The central claim of The Worship of Priapus was that an international religious impulse to worship 'the generative principle' was articulated through genital imagery, and that this imagery has persisted into the modern age. In some ways the book was the first of many later attempts to argue that Pagan ideas had persisted within Christian culture, a view that would eventually crystallise into the neo-Pagan movement over a century later./nAnother book of interest to the neo-Pagan movement was Knight's Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology./nAn Analytical Inquiry into the Principles of Taste, 1805, was, however, Knight's most influential work in his lifetime. This book sought to explain the experience of 'taste' within the mind and to clarify the theorisation of the concept of the picturesque, following from the writings of William Gilpin and Uvedale Price on the subject. Knight's views on the aesthetics of the picturesque are also formed in engagement with Edmund Burke's emphasis on the importance of sensation, which Knight partly rejects in favour of a modified associationism. The philosophical basis of Knight's theories have implications for his account of the relationship between the 'beautiful' and the 'picturesque'. For Knight, aesthetic concepts cannot be formed directly from optical sensations, because these must be interpreted within the mind before they can be recognised as beautiful. Thus a Classical architecture Roman temple is beautiful because of the proportions of its parts, but these proportions can never be perceived directly by the senses, which will simply encounter a mass of confused impressions. 'Beauty' is thus a product of internal mental acts. It is therefore proper to speak of moral, mathematical and other non-sensuous forms of beauty, contrary to Burke, Hogarth and others who claimed such usages were metaphorical. In all cases 'the particular object [e.g. proportion] is an abstract idea.\u2019/nFor Knight \"picturesque\" means simply \"after the manner of painting\", a point which is important to his further discussion of sensation, which in Knight's view is central to the understanding of painting and music which are \"addressed to the organs of sight and hearing\", while poetry and sculpture appeal \"entirely to the imagination and passions.\" The latter must be understood in terms of associations of ideas, while the former rely on the \"irritation\" or friction of sensitive parts of the body. Knight's view was that artists should seek to reproduce primal visual sensations, not the mental interpretative processes which give rise to abstract ideas./nFor Knight, colour is experienced directly as pleasurable sensation. A pure blue is not pleasurable because it reminds us of clear skies, as Price supposed, but because of the experience itself. Interpretation of impressions follows chains of association following from this primal sensory experience. However, the pleasures of sense may be 'modified by habit', so that the pure stimulus of colour may be experienced as pleasurable when 'under the influence of mind' which perceives its meaningful use within a painting. Excess of pure colour is painful, like any other sensory excess. Variety and combination of colours is most pleasurable./nKnight makes much of the need to fragment an image into tonal and colouristic \"masses\", a view that has been claimed to anticipate the late work of Turner, or even Impressionism. However, it most directly justifies the practices of contemporary painters of picturesque landscapes, such as Girtin, whose stippling effects are comparable to Knight's account of pleasing colour combinations.  Knight commissioned landscape artist, Thomas Hearne to produce several drawings of the grounds of his home, Downton Castle in Herefordshire.[14]/nOn sculpture \u2013 typically for him, colourless form \u2013 generates in the mind the idea of shape which we must conceptualise, as with 'proportion'.  The literary arts, like sculpture, deal with thoughts and emotions, though in a more complex form. Knight's account of these arts therefore falls under the heading of 'association of ideas'. Here Knight shows the influence of the contemporary cult of sensibility, arguing that these arts engage our sympathies, and in so doing demonstrate the inadequacy of 'rules and systems' in both morality and aesthetics. These teach 'men to work by rule, instead of by feeling and observation.' Rule-based knowledge of wrong cannot prevent wrongdoing, because it is thought not felt. Therefore, 'it is impossible that tragedy should exhibit examples of pure and strict morality, without becoming dull and uninteresting.\u2019/nKnight's discussion of 'the passions' engages with both Classical and recent theorisations of sentiments. His discussion of the sublime is directed against Burke's emphasis on feelings of terror and powerlessness. Knight defends Longinus's original account of sublimity, which he summarises as the 'energetic exertion of great and commanding power.' Again he intertwines social and aesthetic reasoning, asserting that the power of a tyrant cannot be sublime if the tyrant inspires fear by mere arbitrary whim, like Nero. However, it may be sublime if his tyranny, like Napoleon's, derives from the exercise of immense personal capacities. A Nero may be feared, but would also be despised. A Napoleon may be hated, but will nevertheless inspire awe. In art, the mind experiences the sublime as it experiences the exercise of its own powers, or sympathises with the exercises of the powers of others. Fear itself can never engender the sublime./nKnight's emphasis on the roles of sensation and of emotion were constitutive of later Romantic and Victorian aesthetic thinking, as was his vexed struggle with the relation between moral feeling and sensuous pleasure. Though some contemporaries condemned the basis of his thought as an aestheticised libertinism, or devotion to physical sensation, they influenced John Ruskin's attempts to theorise the Romantic aesthetic of Turner, and to integrate political and pictorial values.", "74087757": "Vasile Tonoiu (3 February 1941 \u2013 9 June 2023) was a Romanian philosopher and professor of philosophy at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Bucharest and member of the Romanian Academy since 2003.[1][2]/nTonoiu died on 9 June 2023, at the age of 82.[3]", "49249631": "John Goldie, Goudie or Gowdie (1717\u20131811) the 'Philosopher'[2] was a friend of the poet Robert Burns who was born the son of a miller at Craigmill on the Cessnock Water in East Ayrshire, Scotland. He was a miller, mechanic, cabinet maker, later a wine merchant and had interests ranging from the study of mathematics and astronomy to that of theology, publishing several books, in particular in 1780 the popular three volume Essays on various Important Subjects Moral and Divine, being an attempt to distinguish True from False Religion, a publication that became generally known as 'Goudie's Bible' and raised him to national prominence.[3][4] The name John Goldie will be used throughout for consistency./nOften referred to as the philosopher[5] Goldie was born in 1717 at Craigmill (NS 482 329), a flour mill on the Cessnock Water that had once been the mill of the Barony of Haining-Ross, worked by his family for nearly 400 years.[6] His parents were Anna Farquhar and John Goudie who married at Craigie in Ayrshire on 6 November 1714. He had four brothers and sisters two of which may have died in infancy.[7]/nHe was one of the most remarkable men of his time and place.[8] Craigmill, situated on the Cessnock Water near the barony wood of Craigenconnor, was demolished by 1908 and nothing substantial remains on site.[9] He is said to have died in 1808 aged 92,[10] some authors say 1809[11] or 1811./nAt the age of 14 (1735), and with basic tools and materials, he designed and constructed a miniature corn mill at Craigmill on the Cessnock Water. Mr Wallace of Kelly, then living at Cessnock House near Galston was so impressed with the novel design of this mill that brought Earl of Marchmont to see it. The Earl gave Goldie three shillings as a reward with which to buy an iron spindle for the wheel.[12]/nHe moved to Kilmarnock and became a cabinet maker without undergoing an apprenticeship, later a successful wine and spirit merchant in a large and popular store at Kilmarnock Cross[13] and as stated had interests ranging from the study of astronomy and science to that of theology. He also speculated in canals, railways and coal mines.[14][15] As a cabinet maker he made a highly carved ornate clock case of mahogany, showing the whole five orders of architecture and of such artistry that its price was beyond that of most people, however the Duke of Hamilton came to hear of it, purchased it for \u00a330, a large sum at that time, and placed in Hamilton Palace.[16][17]/nGoldie was largely educated by his mother Anna, as well as being self-educated, as he was of a studious nature from boyhood reading many books and becoming conversant with \"some of the more abstruse sciences.\"[18]/nHis upbringing was decidedly Calvinistic[19] but he later travelled regularly on Sundays the 20 mile round trip from his father's house at Craigmill to Kilmaurs to hear Mr Smeaton the famous anti-burgher minister of that parish preach.[20][21] He had developed a strong 'free thinking' attitude through his reading of Dr Taylor of Norwich's publication 'On Original Sin'.[22]/nHe is recorded to have been a man of unblemished character who had many good friends, many of whom were the leading lights of Kilmarnock and he also corresponded with literary men of celebrity.[23]/nSome confusion exists in the literature as to the dates and titles of his works. His first publication, printed in Glasgow was Essays on various Important Subjects Moral and Divine, being an attempt to distinguish True from False Religion. and this expressed his then unorthodox views on original sin and upon the interpretation of many of the scriptures greatly concerned the 'Auld Lichts' or more fundamentalist presbyterians.[24] In 1785 he published a second edition now titled \"Essays on Various Subjects, Moral and Divine, in one volume, by John Goldie; to which is added, the gospel recovered from a Captive State, in five volumes. By a Gentle Christian.\"[25]/nIn 1786 he published The Gospel Recovered from its Captive State which confirmed his full and formidable opposition to the 'Auld Licht' order that he had supported as a younger man.[26] In 1808 he had printed at Kilmarnock a book titles Conclusive Evidences Against Atheism.[27] His last published work in 1809 was A Treatise upon the Evidences of a Deity.[28] Dougal states that in 1811, aged over ninety and therefore just a few years before his death he published his last work Evidences against Atheism.[29] He died before completing his work on a book to be titled A Revise, or Reform of the Present System of Astronomy.[30]/nAn unusual story has John Goldie at its heart and that is the tale of the 'Beanscroft Devil' set at the time of the poet Robert Burns:/nBeanscroft Farm lies on Grassyards Road in the parish of Fenwick in East Ayrshire a few miles to the west of Kilmarnock and the farmer there was known as a good, honest, hard work and God fearing member of the community, however strange happenings at the farmhouse and in the byres slowly convinced him and his family that he was being regularly tormented by none other a personage than the Devil himself. The other worldly disturbances had started in a minor way with sounds and movements that could be ascribed to the wind or the cat, however shifting furniture, strange shrieks and howls, etc. could not be so easily dismissed and the strange appearance of moving lights of different colours and the breaking of the ropes that tethered the cattle without signs of cutting were beyond any straight forward explanation. The farmer's son and heir had apparently done his best without success to solve the riddle, but his parents had always stayed rooted to the spot with fear in the farmhouse whilst the son ventured forth.[31]/nJohn Goldie the 'Philosopher' was God fearing, but had no truck with the presence on Earth of the Devil and made it known that he could solve this riddle in a Sherlock Holmes style of logical investigation. Despite his reservations the farmer invited him to the farm, accompanied by his friends, Mr Gillies of Kilmaurs the 'New Licht' minister and Robert Muir a Kilmarnock merchant and Kirk elder. After a number of questions relating to possible enemies and an inspection of the broken ropes he declared that this was the work of man and not the Devil. Swearing the farmer to secrecy he advised him to hide in the byre that night. Once darkness had fallen the farmer, hiding in the byre as instructed, became aware of the usual disturbances and suddenly saw a shadowy figure of a man holding a trumpet-like instrument with which he was making the unnatural sounds that had scared him so, rushing forward he seized the culprit only to find that it was his own son.[32]/nIt transpired that the son had some knowledge of chemistry and had made what we would call coloured fireworks and that the ropes had been severed with Nitric Acid, then known as Aqua Fortis (strong water). Goudie had logically deducted that the son, hoping to scare his father into retirement so that he could run the farm, was the 'Devil on Earth'. The 'philosophers' reputation was greatly enhanced whilst the son was mortified and humiliated to the extent that he left Ayrshire and was never seen in these parts again.[33]/nGoldie was 40 years older than Robert Burns;[34] they were on good terms, and Burns wrote the Epistle to John Goldie in 1785 following the publication of a new edition of \"Goudie's Bible\"./nEpistle to John Goldie in Kilmarnock/nGoldie wrote against the \"lying vanities\" of those people who interpreted the Bible literally, being called upon as \"Terror o'the Whigs\":[35] here \"Whig\" means a Presbyterian of the Auld Licht school, the poet being of the New Licht/nTradition states that Goldie visited Robert Burns in 1785 at Mossgiel Farm while on a business trip to Mauchline during harvest time, the two men sat down behind a stook (sheaf) while the poet recited a few of his compositions. Goldie had first become aware of Burns through the circulation of manuscript copies of Burns' poem and satire The Twa Herds'.[36]/nSo impressed was Goldie with Burn's poetry that he encouraged him to publish his work[37][38] and later stood joint surety to the printer John Wilson for the printing of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect as Wilson would not risk publication without payment.[39][40][41] Burns visited Goldie's home where he was introduced to a number of the leading citizens of the town, such as the Town-clerk, Mr William Paterson of Braehead; Mr Robert Muir, a wine merchant; Major Parker of Asslos (banker); Dr William Moore and Thomas Samson, eventually becoming friends with a number of the leading figures in Kilmarnock.[42][43] In the course of the evening Burns recited several of his poems and those present agreed to stand surety for the publication of his poems.[44] Such was their enthusiasm that several of these supporters appear in the subscription list of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (Edinburgh Edition)./nIt is recorded, probably from his son, that Goldie had said \"Robin, I\u2019ll tell you what to do. Come your wa's down to Killie (Kilmarnock)some day next week, and tak' pat-luck wi' me. I ha'e twa or three guid friends that'll be able to set the press a-going.\"[45] Young, the Kilmarnock Edition researcher, states that in 1785 Goldie was influential in persuading Burns to publish his poems and that from the start it was a group project.[46]/nJames Mackay accepts that such a meeting may have taken place but without the immediate result of the publication of Burns' poems,[47] however Burns' literary effusions during 1785-86 were reaching a climax following encouragement to publish from first Richard Brown, then Gilbert Burns, John Goldie and a list of 350 subscribers.[48] Goldie is said to have been a powerful influence in dissuading Robert Burns from his avowed intention of emigrating to Jamaica.[49]/nWilson suggests that the poet originated some of the satirical pieces in the company of these 'leading citizens' and that they were composed in their houses, emphasising that his poems were published with the assistance of these gentlemen.[50]/nBurns was a daily visitor to Goldie's house during the time in 1786 that his manuscripts were at the printing works of John Wilson and he corrected the proofs there and wrote many letters, meeting future patrons as subscribers to his first published work, the Kilmarnock volume.[51][52][53] Goldie lived in the second flat of the building occupied Messrs. Stewart who were ironmongers at the Cross.[54] Next door was the home of Baillie Gregory and Burns also visited their flat on occasions to work on his proofs as well as to listen to Mrs Gregory playing one of the few pianos to be found in the town at that time.[55]/nThe local historian Archibald Mackay noted that significantly in terms of local contacts, the Kilmarnock Cross premises of John Wilson had belonged to John Goudie, his friend and supporter.[56]/nDavid Sillar and Gavin Turnbull both composed verses on John Goldie, Turnbull writing that\u00a0:-/nGoldie's son, Lieutenant Goldie, R.N., many years later recalled the general persona and demeanour of Burns as he first knew him and went on to recount the great change in appearance and confidence that came over the bard after his time in Edinburgh following the publication of his poems.[59]/nIt seems that Goldie's writings had a more than subtle effect upon Robert Burns' thoughts and these influences were recorded in several of his poems.[60]/nGoldie's significance has perhaps been overlooked because the many manuscripts and letters from Burns, Lord Kames, and other celebrated men of the day were destroyed during his son's (Lieutenant Goldie R.N.) time away at sea.[61]/nGoudie's Bible was often the subject of ridicule by his enemies and one incident is recorded that when in Ayr. He was entering a bookshop just as a clergyman, with whom he was acquainted, was leaving with a package of books and he asked him in an offhand friendly manner what he had purchased, the response was \"Just buying a few ballads to make psalms for your bible.\"[62]/nHe took a great interest in the construction of a canal from Kilmarnock to Troon and went so far as to survey a suitable route and indeed in 1796 the Kilmarnock Council considered requesting Parliament for an act to build a canal from Riccarton to Troon.[63]/nIt is said that he lost money in mining speculations and was cheated by his partner towards the end of his life.[64]/nHis portrait, supposedly a good likeness, was painted by Mr Whitehead with a globe in the background.[65]", "56950115": "Damian of Ephesus (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, fl. 2nd century AD) was a member of the Second Sophistic who lived in Ephesus.

After being sold into slavery, and then released, he moved to Athens, where he studied in almost every school of philosophy. It is, however, for his Cynic-style diatribes that he is chiefly remembered. He satirized the foolishness of people, attacked religion, and eulogized philosophy./nBion was from the town of Olbia on the north coast of the Black Sea by the mouth of the river Borysthenes (modern-day Dnieper). He lived c. 325-c. 250 BC, but the exact dates of his birth and death are uncertain. Strabo[1] mentions him as a contemporary of Eratosthenes, who was born 275 BC. Diogenes La\u00ebrtius has preserved an account in which Bion describes his parentage to Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedonia.[2] His father was a freedman and a dealer in salt fish, with which he combined the occupation of smuggling. His mother, Olympia, was a Lacedaemonian prostitute. The whole family were sold as slaves, on account of some offence committed by the father. In consequence of this, Bion fell into the hands of a rhetorician, who made him his heir. Having burnt his patron's library, he went to Athens, and applied himself to philosophy, in the course of which study he embraced the tenets of almost every sect in succession. First he was an Academic studying under Xenocrates[3] and Crates of Athens,[4] then he became a Cynic,[4] (perhaps under Crates of Thebes), afterwards he attached to Theodorus,[5] the Cyrenaic philosopher whose alleged atheism is supposed to have influenced Bion,[6] and finally he became a pupil of Theophrastus the Peripatetic.[5] After the manner of the sophists of the period, Bion travelled through Greece and Macedonia, and was admitted to the literary circle at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.[7] He subsequently taught philosophy at Rhodes,[8] and died at Chalcis in Euboea.[6]/nBecause of his early association with the Academy, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius placed Bion among the Academics, but there is nothing in his life or thought suggesting an affinity with Platonism and modern scholars regard him as a Cynic, albeit an atypical one with strong Hedonistic or Cyrenaic leanings.[9][10] Much of what La\u00ebrtius has to say about Bion seems to have been drawn from hostile sources so care has to be taken in using his account to reconstruct Bion's life and thought.[11] La\u00ebrtius reveals to us a man of considerable intellectual acuteness, but quite ready to attack everyone and everything. He was essentially a popular writer, and in his Diatribes he satirized the foolishness of people. While eulogizing poverty and philosophy, he attacked the gods, musicians, geometricians, astrologers, and the wealthy, and denied the efficacy of prayer. La\u00ebrtius claims Bion was an atheist (which he renounced at the time of his death)[12] but the surviving fragments reveal only a religious skepticism concerning mystery religions, oracles, etc.[11] The quotations of Bion recorded by Teles, and preserved by Stobaeus reveal a man who \"treats of ordinary human problems in a common-sense spirit, though for emphasis employing all the devices of contemporary prose style. ... The situations dealt with are those that may confront any person, from the universalia of old age, poverty, exile, slavery, the fear of death, down to the more particular case of a nagging wife.\"[11]/nHis influence is distinctly traceable in succeeding writers, e.g. in the satires of Menippus.

He claimed the Left was unable to build constructively upon its popular Arab support out of incompetence and greed, while the Right was based upon racist and highly deceived individuals. In 1985, Shakra declared his Atheism, a comment which angered Arab Islamists and lead to death threats and continuous harassment.[3] \nHis views were considered some of the most controversial in the region, even long before his declaration of atheism. He was actively involved in campaigning for universal human rights in the Arab world, whether it was for women, children, refugees, or homosexuals.

He was a strong supporter of Darwinism, and was spiritual in the Humanist sense.[4] His Humanism is seen in the first sentence in his book, \"Masafi\" (Distance) [5] describing humanity's failure to self-actualize./nIn his final speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York City, he criticized the World for allowing itself to be controlled:/nFor all his achievements and intellectual contributions to society, Aous Shakra is also remembered for having quite the peculiar behaviour.

He retired in 2006 as Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Manchester.[3]/nTallis attacked post-structuralism in books such as Not Saussure[4] and Theorrhoea and After,[5] and he contested assumptions of artificial intelligence research in his book Why the Mind is Not a Computer: A Pocket Dictionary on Neuromythology.[6] He denies that our appreciation of art and music can be reduced to scientific terms.[7] His philosophical writings attempt to supply an anthropological account of what is distinctive about human beings. To this end he has written a trilogy of books entitled The Hand;[8] I Am: A Philosophical Inquiry into First-Person Being;[9] and The Knowing Animal.[10] He has also argued extensively about the perceived misuse of scientific language and concepts to explain human experiences.[11]/nIn 2007 Tallis published Unthinkable Thought: The Enduring Significance of Parmenides.

The machismo of the pelado, he argues, is the result of an inferiority complex (based on Alfred Adler's concept) and, since the pelado represents the entire country, the \"character study\" is extended to all of Mexico, and was one of the first post-Revolutionary attempts to define and assess the national character.", "1342858": "Robert Alexy (born 9 September 1945 in Oldenburg, Germany) is a jurist and a legal philosopher./nAlexy studied law and philosophy at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.

With this in mind, I soon realized that Whitehead's key category of \"society\" needed further development. A \"society,\" after all, must be more than an aggregate of actual occasions with a \"common element of form\" (PR 1968, 34) if philosophical atomism is to be avoided. My own solution was to reinterpret a Whiteheadian society as an enduring structured field of activity for successive generations of constituent actual occasions. Thus understood, a Whiteheadian \"society\" serves both to legitimate a trinitarian process-oriented understanding of God and to make Whitehead's philosophy an even stronger social ontology than he himself envisioned. That is, \"the final real things of which the world is made up\" are not simply actual occasions but the societies into which they spontaneously aggregate.[2]", "53902732": "G.

He is considered the most prominent Catalan philosopher of the 20th-century[1] and was the author of over 35 books, including a four-volume Diccionario de filosof\u00eda (Dictionary of Philosophy, 1941) and Being and Death: An Outline of Integrationist Philosophy (1962).[2] Subjects he worked on include ontology, history of philosophy, metaphysics, anthropology, the philosophy of history and culture, epistemology, logic, philosophy of science, and ethics. He also directed several films.[3]/nFerrater Mora was known for his inclusion of humans and non-human animals within the same moral sphere, or continuum, arguing that the difference was one of degree, not kind; the Ferrater Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics is named in his honour.[2]/nFerrater Mora was born in 1912, in Barcelona, Spain. He studied at Santa Maria del Collell, then at the University of Barcelona, where he earned a BA, in 1932, and his BPhil, in 1936.[1]/nDuring the Spanish Civil War, he enlisted in the Republican Army, serving as an intelligence clerk, before escaping the country in 1939.

He argued that irreducible concepts, which are the source of many disputes and divisions in philosophy, do not denote existing realities in themselves but are \"limit concepts\"; that is to say, these \"opposite poles\" do not exist absolutely. They exist only as trends or directions of reality and therefore are complementary and are useful to talk about it.[7]/nHis philosophical work also focused on questions of an ontological nature. He called his ontological position \"monism sui generis\", since it unites monism and pluralism; it is an emergentism in which the elements assemble themselves by virtue of their properties or functions, or properties-functions. Each structure, although it depends to exist on the elements that compose it, is not reducible to them because it acquires new properties-functions that cannot be explained based on those of the element. The structure also becomes an element for a new structure. Self-assembly begins from the physical level to the point where structures acquire more complex properties-functions and of a different order to give rise to a new biological level, and thus the continuum progresses until reaching the social and then the cultural level. It is a continuum that does not break and that goes from matter to reason.[8]/nHe was one of the first philosophers to introduce applied ethics to the Spanish-speaking world and was a staunch supporter of animal rights.[9]/nHis works combine a wide variety of influences, including the Spanish philosophers Miguel de Unamuno, Eugenio d'Ors and Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset and numerous other representatives of both continental and analytic philosophy.[citation needed]/nIn January 1991, Ferrater Mora made public the decision to donate his personal library to the University of Girona.

He studied at the University of Naples Federico II under Antonio Genovesi.  At the age of twenty, he became special lecturer in moral philosophy there, at the same time practising law. He was friend of Gaetano Filangieri, entering the masonry with him, and was elected venerable master of the Neapolitan lodge \"La philantropia\". Pagano was one of the men who powerfully helped Italy in her social and scientific advancement and in the 1790s he had striven more than any other intellectual to give a political form to the 18th century reform tradition in southern Italy.[4]/nHis work Saggi politici (1783\u201385) provided a philosophical history of the Kingdom of Naples, arguing against torture and capital punishment and advocating more benign penal codes. Considerazioni sul processo criminale (Considerations on the criminal trial, 1787), gave him international popularity and was much praised by Le Moniteur Universel, the main newspaper of the revolutionary France.[5]/nIn 1794 he defended Vincenzo Galiani, Vincenzo Vitaliani and Emanuele De Deo\u00a0\u2013 three alleged conspirators against Ferdinand IV; after they were sentenced to death, Pagano was deprived of his professorship, arrested, imprisoned and expelled from the kingdom.[6] After fleeing Naples in 1796, he returned in 1799 and drafted the constitution of the short-lived Neapolitan Republic. The document bore similarities to the French Constitution of 1793 but presented original traits such as the institution of the \"body of ephors\", an authority who would have overseen the maintenance of the law. It is considered the precursor of the modern constitutional court.[7]/nAfter the fall of the republic, Pagano was arrested and imprisoned in the Castel Nuovo. He was executed by hanging at the \"Piazza del Mercato\" in Naples, along with other revolutionaries: Domenico Cirillo, Giorgio Pigliacelli and Ignazio Ciaia./nPagano's other juridical or philosophical works included Progetto di Costituzione della Repubblica napoletana, Sul processo criminale, Esame politico dell\u2019intera legislazione romana, and Discorso sull\u2019origine e natura della poesia.

He was the last born to the family, and regarded by his father as a superfluous addition who was intended to be given away to a salt merchant.[3] For most of his childhood, Tsunetomo was sickly and claimed doctors told him he would not live past twenty years old. Despite his fragile health, he was employed at age 9 to be a page for Nabeshima Mitsuhige. Tsunetomo's skills in literature led Mitsuhige to have him study under noted man of letters Kuranaga Rihei.[3]/nIn his twenties, Tsunetomo studied under the Zen Buddhist priest Tannen and the Confucian scholar Ishida Ittei, both of whom greatly influenced his philosophy.[4] The last major influence in Tsunetomo's education was his nephew Yamamoto Gor\u014dzaemon, who was older than Tsunetomo and helped him get a position as a scribe in Edo and then in the imperial capital Kyoto in 1686. In 1687, Gor\u014dzaemon took responsibility for a large destructive fire, leading to him and Tsunetomo both resigning from their positions. Tsunetomo returned to work for Mitsuhige.[5]/nIn 1695, Mitsushige retired due to ill health, and tasked Tsunetomo with finding a copy of a book of secret poetry instructions called Kokindenju. Tsunetomo obtained a copy in Kyoto and on 1 May 1700, presented it to Mitsuhige, who died two weeks later.[5] Tsunetomo intended to commit suicide to follow his master in death, but both Mitsushige and the shogunate as a whole had banned the practice. Instead of continuing as a samurai seeking minor positions, Tsunetomo became a Buddhist priest and his wife became a nun, living in a hermitage in the mountains.[5]/nLater in life, (between 1709 and 1716), Tsunetomo narrated many of his thoughts to the samurai Tashiro Tsuramoto\u00a0[ja]. Many of these aphorisms concerned his lord's father and grandfather Naoshige and the failing ways of the samurai caste. These commentaries were compiled and published in 1716 under the title of Hagakure (\u8449\u96a0), a word that can be translated as either In the Shadow of Leaves or Hidden Leaves.[6][7]/nThe Hagakure was not widely known during the years following Tsunetomo's death, but by the 1930s it had become one of the most famous representatives of bushido taught in Japan. In 2011 a manga/comic book version was published Hagakure: The Manga Edition, translated by William Scott Wilson, adapted by Sean Michael Wilson and Chie Kutsuwada (Kodansha International Ltd., 2011)./nTsunetomo believed that becoming one with death in one's thoughts, even in life, was the highest attainment of purity and focus.  He felt that a resolution to die gives rise to a higher state of life, infused with beauty and grace beyond the reach of those concerned with self-preservation.  Some viewed him as a man of immediate action due to some of his quotes, and in the Hagakure he criticized the carefully planned Ak\u014d vendetta of the Forty-seven r\u014dnin (a major event in his lifetime) for its delayed response./nDuring Japan's militarist years in the 1930s and 1940s, soldiers hailed Hagakure as a key text for proper samurai behaviour.[8]/nThe Hagakure was the book that the character Ghost Dog reads and lives his life by in the movie Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.", "195994": "John Fiske (March 30, 1842 \u2013 July 4, 1901) was an American philosopher and historian. He was heavily influenced by Herbert Spencer and applied Spencer's concepts of evolution to his own writings on linguistics, philosophy, religion, and history.[1]/nJohn Fiske was born Edmund Fiske Green at Hartford, Connecticut, March 30, 1842. He was the only child of Edmund Brewster Green, of Smyrna, Delaware, and Mary Fiske Bound, of Middletown, Connecticut. His father was editor of newspapers in Hartford, New York City, and Panama, where he died in 1852, and his widow married Edwin W. Stoughton, of New York, in 1855.[2] On the second marriage of his mother, Edmund Fiske Green assumed the name of his maternal great-grandfather, John Fiske./nAs a child, Fiske exhibited remarkable precocity. He lived at Middletown with his grandmother during childhood, and prior to his entering college he had read widely in English literature and history, had excelled in Greek and Latin work, and had studied several modern languages.[3] He then entered Harvard, and graduated from Harvard College in 1863 and from Harvard Law School in 1865. He was admitted to the bar in 1864, but only briefly practiced law.[4] His career as author began in 1861, with an article on \"Mr. Buckle's Fallacies\" published in the National Quarterly Review. Following his failure to earn enough money through law, he frequently contributed freelance articles to American and British periodicals.[2][4]/nFrom 1869 to 1871, he was university lecturer on philosophy at Harvard, in 1870 instructor in history there, and assistant librarian 1872\u20131879. On resigning the latter position in 1879, he was elected a member of the board of overseers, and at the expiration of the six-year term was re-elected in 1885. Beginning in 1881, he lectured annually on American history at Washington University in St. Louis and beginning in 1884 held a professorship of American history at that institution, but continued to make his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He lectured on American history at University College London in 1879, and at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1880. He gave many hundreds of lectures, chiefly upon American history, in the principal cities of the United States and Great Britain.[2] Fiske was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1884.[5]/nThe largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history, but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution, and it was through the popularization of Herbert Spencer's work that he first became known to the public.[2] He applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of Darwin's work and produced many books and essays on this subject. His philosophy was influenced by Herbert Spencer's views on evolution. In a letter from Charles Darwin to John Fiske, dated from 1874, the naturalist remarks: \"I never in my life read so lucid an expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are.\"/nNineteenth-century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance, championed by scientists including Darwin's cousin Francis Galton and the French neurologist Paul Broca, led Fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the \"Anglo-Saxon race\". Fiske's beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes. Indeed, so anti-slavery was he that twenty-three years after the cessation of the American Civil War, he declared the North's victory complete \"despite the feeble wails\" of \"unteachable bigots.\"[6] In his book \"The Destiny of Man\" (1884), he devotes a whole chapter to the \"End of the working of natural selection upon man\", describing it as \"a fact of unparalleled grandeur.\" In his view, \"the action of natural selection upon Man has [...] been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions.\"/nIn books such as Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy (ISBN\u00a00-384-15780-7), Fiske aimed to show that \"in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science, nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed.\" On page 364, he demonstrates his sensitivity to Christianity as a religion:/nWe arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to Christianity, and that which has been assumed by Radicalism and by positivism. It is not merely that we refuse to attack Christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture, not yet passed by the average minds of the community; it is that we still regard Christianity as, in the deepest sense, our own religion.[7]/nFiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career, and many of his books from the 1870s were first given to the public in the form of lectures or magazine articles, revised and collected under a general title.[3] Of these, in The Destiny of Man Viewed in the Light of his Origin (1884), he argues that intellectual force is a later, higher and more potent thing than bodily strength, leading to a moral and non-selfish line of thought. This intellect may or must be enduring, or at its best immortal. In The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge (1885), Fiske discusses the theistic problem, and declares that the mind of man, as developed, becomes an illuminating indication of the mind of God, which as a great immanent cause includes and controls both physical and moral forces.[8]/nLater he turned to historical writings, publishing books such as The Discovery of America (1892). In addition, he edited, with James Grant Wilson, Appletons' Cyclop\u00e6dia of American Biography (1887). He died, worn out by overwork, at Gloucester, Massachusetts, July 4, 1901.", "35552667": "J.

Fainstein is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Her research and writing has focused on the distributive effects of urban development strategies and megaprojects, the role of democracy and community control in local public institutions, and establishing a moral theory of \"the just city.\"[1][2]/nA member of the urban planning faculties of Columbia University and Rutgers University for most of her career, Fainstein is now a research scholar at the Harvard Graduate School of Design./nConducting field research in New York and London, Fainstein has studied the rise of \"pro-growth\" municipal regimes and accelerated real estate development since 1980. Her work charts the growth of public-private partnerships in urban development and increasing reliance on property development as a wholesale economic development strategy.[3] Noting that property-focused growth has weakened urban welfare programs and broad neighborhood revitalization strategies, she has proposed reforms to public-private partnership structures that discourage overbuilding and permit broader community benefits.[4]/nSince 1999 Fainstein has worked to theorize the \"just city,\" a concept for which her 2010 book is named.[5] Fainstein argues that urban planners need a normative theory of justice because their enthusiasm for social and built-environment diversity has not produced alternatives to inequality under pro-growth regimes.[6][7] She maintains that the dominant \"communicative planning\" paradigm\u2014in which sufficiently inclusive and deliberative planning procedures are said to yield just outcomes\u2014cannot produce just outcomes. This is because they cannot resolve structural inequalities among actors, settle rival concepts of the public good, or account for progressive policies achieved in non-deliberative democratic societies.[8] Because of these limitations, planning procedures permit outcomes incompatible with justice such as greater economic inequality, marginalization of social groups, and political domination.[9]/nFainstein proposes an urban theory of justice in which \"equity, \"democracy,\" and diversity are the first-order concerns of urban development, with equity prevailing when such outcomes conflict.[6][10] These principles aim to harmonize the contractarian \"theory of justice\" proposed by John Rawls with its post-liberal criticisms, particularly those of Iris Marion Young, who argues that the recognition of social group differences cannot be subordinated to individual distributive fairness.[11] To reconcile tradeoffs among these priorities, Fainstein endorses the \"capabilities approach\" of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum: all three norms must be upheld sufficiently such that they can be achieved by all moral subjects, while allowing subjects to choose priority among these basic principles.[6][12]/nFainstein has upheld Amsterdam's social housing program as a model of the \"just city\" paradigm because it supports a mix of household types, permits ethnic concentration but not enclavism, and safeguards a basic living standard.[6][13] Other scholars have argued that liberalizing structural reforms since 1980 have eroded the program's claims to provide housing equity and social diversity.[14][15]/nThe topic has been engaged widely by planners and urban theorists since its introduction. Peter Marcuse and Oren Yiftachel have expanded on Fainstein's justice concept, calling for greater focus on property relations and recognition of planning paradigms outside the U.S. and Europe.[16][17] More critical reception has come from urban geographer David Harvey who, extending his Marxist critique of urban planning, has argued that \"just city\" theory does not remedy the inherent injustices of capitalist urbanization but instead palliates them.[18] Fainstein has responded that the approach attempts what is feasible within capitalist development and does not \"depend on revolutionary change.\"[19]/nFainstein is married to urban sociology professor Norman I.

Her mother was a nurse and her father worked in newspaper publishing in addition to running the family farm.  In spite of their limited education, Churchland has described her parents as interested in the sciences, and the worldview they instilled in her as a secular one.  She has also described her parents as eager for her to attend college, and though many farmers in their community thought this \"hilarious and a grotesque waste of money\", they saw to it that she did so.[10]   She took her undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, graduating with honors in 1965.[7]  She received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study at the University of Pittsburgh, where she took an M.A. in 1966.[7][11] Thereafter she studied at Somerville College, Oxford as a British Council and Canada Council Fellow, obtaining a B.

According to her, philosophers are increasingly realizing that to understand the mind one must understand the brain. She applies findings from neuroscience to address traditional philosophical questions about knowledge, free will, consciousness and ethics. She is associated with a school of thought called eliminative materialism, which argues that common sense, immediately intuitive, or \"folk psychological\" concepts such as thought, free will, and consciousness will likely need to be revised in a physically reductionistic way as neuroscientists discover more about the nature of brain function.[25]\n2014 saw a brief exchange of views on these topics with Colin McGinn in the pages of the New York Review Of Books.[26]", "40271273": "Pierre Kaan (French: [pj\u03b5\u0280 k\u0251\u0303] 10 January 1903 \u2013 18 May 1945) was a professor of philosophy, Marxist essayist, and prominent member of the French Resistance during World War II.[1]/nPierre Kaan was born on 10 January 1903 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. After a primary education often interrupted by health problems, Pierre Kaan entered in 1919 into kh\u00e2gne, the preparatory classes for the entrance exams of \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand. While at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand Kaan founded a literary review called la Gerbe du Quartier Latin, alongside fellow students Daniel Gu\u00e9rin, Georges Altman, and Paul Verdier. Pierre Kaan's attendance in the preparatory classes were interrupted when his parents sent him to Brittany to recover from recurring asthma attacks. Nevertheless, Pierre Kaan was awarded a diploma in philosophy by l'Academie de Paris in 1923, with a dissertation titled 'The sociological basis of Nietzsche's thought during his intellectualist period 1876\u20131882'./nFollowing a growing notoriety in French academic and Marxist circles in the early 1920s, Pierre Kaan was spotted by Boris Souvarine who placed him on the editing board of l'Humanit\u00e9 and shortly thereafter requested Kaan contribute as a writer and editor for the Bulletin Communiste.[2]/nDuring the 1920s Pierre Kaan contributed to a number of Jewish literary reviews. In 1925 Kaan began an editorial collaboration with Albert Cohen at the Revue Juive, a literary magazine founded by Cohen to review Jewish literature. And between 1927\u20131928, Pierre Kaan joined another literary review called Palestine, a Zionist literary review presided by Justin Godart, as its secretary.[3]/nHaving passed the agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1928, Pierre Kaan was named associate professor of literature and philosophy at a secondary school in Montargis. However, Kaan resigned from his position in September 1929 in order to fulfill his military obligations, which he completes in November and is thereby named professor in another secondary school, this time in Nogent-le-Rotrou./nAt odds over the party's close relationship with the Soviet Union, Pierre Kaan quit the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1929 and joined Souvarine's new group, the Cercle Communiste D\u00e9mocratique, whose members included Simone Weil, Georges Bataille, and Raymond Queneau.[4][5]/nIn 1931 Pierre Kaan began his involvement with Boris Souvarine's La Critique Sociale joining Bataille, Weil, Queneau, Lucien Laurat and other writers, philosophers and economists to revue letters and ideas for what would become a widely read publication during the 1930s./nShortly after the speech made by Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain on 17 June, Pierre Kaan unsuccessfully attempted to join the resistance group France Libre. Kaan thereby tasked himself of uniting and regrouping all those who shared the will to continue fighting against the Nazis. Alongside former comrades and old friends (Jean Cavaill\u00e8s and Leo Hamon in Toulouse), Kaan participated in the founding of the group Lib\u00e9ration-Sud. In February 1942, Pierre Kaan enlisted in the Forces Fran\u00e7aises Combattantes, handing his engagement personally to Jean Moulin and Leo Morandat when they arrived to visit him at his home in Montlu\u00e7on. Kaan undertook a number of resistance operations with Lib\u00e9ration-Sud around the Montlu\u00e7on area alongside members of the entourage of Montlu\u00e7on's Mayor, Marx Dormoy. Pierre Kaan's resistance activities in Montlu\u00e7on ranged from painting anti-Nazi inscriptions on walls, coordinating the distribution of political tracts, compiling reports destined for headquarters of the Free French Forces in London, and during 1942, Kaan reconnoitered the surrounding territory to find appropriate landing zones for parachute operations and clandestine landings. On 6 January 1942, Kaan plays an important part in \norganising a large demonstration against the departure of workers following a speech made by  Pierre Laval - the Nazi collaborating Prime Minister of the Vichy R\u00e9gime.[6] Following the success of his operations in Montlu\u00e7on, Pierre Kaan is named Jean Moulin's deputy responsible for safeguarding transport and communication links between Lyon and the occupied half of France.[6]/nDenounced by a close collaborator in the winter of 1943, Pierre Kaan was arrested by the Gestapo on 29 December on the steps of Port-Royal m\u00e9tro station in Paris, tortured and then deported to Buchenwald concentration camp. From Buchenwald, Pierre Kaan was deported to Gleina, liberated by Czech anti-fascist fighters, and died a few days later, exhausted and stricken by Typhus and Tuberculosis in Cesk\u00e9 Budejovice hospital on 18 May 1945./nBoris Souvarine on Pierre Kaan:/nI owe a special mention to Pierre Kaan, who had been my close collaborator at l'Humanit\u00e9 after the Tours Congress as well as in other publications I was responsible for. After the disaster of 1940, I discovered in him the first serious r\u00e9sistant, effective and authentic. At that time I did not share his conviction... since I thought the french disaster irreversible. \nHaving returned to France after six years spent living in America, I experienced the pain of learning that Pierre Kaan and Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Dunois, deported to Germany, would never come back, victims of their devotion to a certain vision of France.[7]/nIn recognition of the operations Pierre Kaan led and undertook during the war, Kaan received three French and one British decoration. On 12 May 1948, the official journal of the French Government announced that Kaan had been posthumously decorated with Knight of the Legion of Honour, Medal of the Resistance with Rosette, War Cross with silver palm.

Jia produced the work, arguing that only Zuo Zhuan agreed with the supposedly-prophetic chen, proclaiming that the House of Liu (the Han dynastic family) was destined to rule as successors of the legendary Emperor Yao.[3][2] Impressed by the result, the emperor then commanded Jia to select twenty scholars then studying the Gongyang Zhuan, instruct them in the Zuo Zhuan and compile a new edition and commentary.[3]/nAround 82 CE, he completed three more works in which he compared the \"New Text\" and \"Old Text\" versions (i.e. those saved from the Qin book burnings by Fu Sheng and those discovered in a wall of Confucius' estate and transcribed by Kong Anguo) of the Book of Documents, Rites of Zhou and the Classic of Poetry.[3]/nAccording to Jia's biography in the Book of the Later Han, he wrote over a million words commentary on the Confucian classics, as well as poetry.[3]/nJia was commissioned in 85 CE to produce a report on the fine-tuning of the amended and re-introduced Sifen calendar.[2]/nUnder Emperor He, he was promoted to General of the Household in 91 CE, and Commandant of the Cavalry in 97 CE.

She was born in Mexico City in 1936. She studied in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of the National Autonomous University (UNAM) where she received an ample humanistic education in philosophy, psychology, theater and history. The time she attended university was marked by an intellectual boom due mainly to the presence of the Spanish exiles that arrived in Mexico from 1939 until the end of the Spanish Civil War. They were determinant in her studies, especially the Catalan philosopher Eduardo Nicol. She became his pupil as well as a member of his Seminar on Metaphysics for over 20 years and at the same time she worked in the field of Ethics on her own philosophical inquiries./nShe began her career as a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of UNAM in 1968. She taught Greek Philosophy, Metaphysics and Ethics. She has also been a Professor in the Postgraduate Research Seminars on Metaphysics, Ethics and Bioethics. As part of her formative work she has directed 45 theses (23 in BA, 22 postgraduate). Some of her students are now researchers or professors in different Universities and education centers.\nShe was named Professor Emeritus of the National University in 2000 and also received the distinction of Researcher Emeritus of the National System of Researchers of Mexico.

She has also written 74 chapters in books and 60 articles in magazines./nAs the pupil of Eduardo Nicol, Juliana Gonzalez has dedicated numerous writings to the study of the metaphysical and humanistic works of this author. She wrote a book titled The Dialectic Metaphysics of Eduardo Nicol (1981) and edited three more: Tribute to Eduardo Nicol (1990), Eduardo Nicol. Philosophy as Symbolic Reason (1998) and Eduardo Nicol (1998) as well as writing 16 book chapters and several articles on this subject. In the work of Juliana Gonzalez, Nicol's philosophy has been a constant reference./nHer philosophical works has been centered mainly in the search for a new foundation of Ethics that can give an answer to the new knowledge and needs of our time. This research has led Juliana Gonzalez into some of the philosophical and scientific lines of thinking that have placed our conceptions of reality, life and human nature in crisis. Gonzalez has adopted the view that any historical advancement requires a return to the origins of Philosophy. From her perspective, we need a permanent dialogue with the Greek philosophers, unavoidable sources to use in order to renovate humanism and Ethics. This is especially true of Heraclitus, Socrates and Plato, authors Juliana Gonzalez has worked with in several of her books, mainly Ethics and Freedom (1989) and The Ethos, Destiny of Man (1996)[6] and The Power of Eros: Foundations and Values in Ethics and Bioethics[7]  (2000)./nFrom her earliest work, Juliana Gonzalez has delved in the study of the ontological issues of the being of man, freedom, time and human communication that were raised by the existentialist philosophers, especially Heidegger and Sartre, as well as the literature of the time. These studies form the basis of her Master's dissertation on Philosophy and several essays included in some of her books, markedly Ethics and Freedom. And even though she maintains a critical perspective faced with these authors, she is certain that this is the starting point for any and all future Ethics and Ontology./nJuliana Gonzalez has worked on finding the philosophical foundation of the ethical condition of man and freedom in human nature itself, from an immanent conception of man and critiquing the dualist conceptions that \u2013from her philosophical view- are unsustainable. Also, she believes that free will is necessary for Ethics and it is in this line that she worked on a study from the Greek Philosophers to thinkers like Spinoza and writers such as Dostoyevsky and Kafka, whom she considers crucial to Ethics. This work became the book Ethics and Freedom. Her research on the foundations of ethics and values were collected in the book The Ethos, Destiny of Man and The Power of Eros./nThe Ethos, Destiny of Man is a book that explores and proposes a humanistic foundation of Ethics while acknowledging an Ontology of man capable of explaining the ethical condition as well the axiological one. One of the virtues of this book is that it gets over the clash between the realms of being and value./nIn the Power of Eros, the author proposes an integral view of the moral facts. In this book, Juliana Gonzalez works on the subject of Eros as a vital origin of Ethics and as a way to understand human nature with categories that explain the ambiguity, the temporal condition and the constitutive ethical framework of human beings. In the second part of the book she deals with issues of bioethics, the present and future of the human condition. The main points she holds here are that Bioethics is a philosophical and lay issue, its ontological foundation, centered on human nature, the universal character of humanistic criteria, the relativity of moral decisions as well as the need for a multidisciplinary comprehension of bioethical issues./nIn another cultural context, far from the platonic one, Juliana Gonzalez finds the mythical symbol of Eros in the work of Freud. And it is here, in the study of the Cultural Revolution that Freudian psychoanalysis brought to our attention, that the author finds another relevant subject to understand the crisis of ethical thinking. In her book Freud and the Crisis of Ethics (1986), she proposes a philosophical understanding of Freud's work, highlighting on the one hand the aspects that contribute to questioning the meaning of culture and morality and on the other, the meaningful moment when Freud identifies Eros with the life impulses that are opposed to the death impulses of Thanatos. The erotic impulses are then, for the author, interpreted as the foundation for the ethical condition of man./nFor Juliana Gonzalez, it is impossible to ignore Nietzsche in the analysis of ethical issues, since his work has been determinant to both the crisis of Ethics and the new horizons that it opens for us, as she discusses in her book The Hero in the Soul: Three Essays on Nietszche (1994)./nOther issues Juliana Gonzalez has worked on are the problems of medical ethics in particular and bioethics in general. She has worked on these problems from a philosophical perspective that converges with the advances in life sciences. This view includes matters of praxis, theory and knowledge, all derived from the advancement of genomics and neurosciences especially. She has shown that some of these advancements can create a crisis for our conception of humankind that is focused on freedom and morality. In this sense, what is most important for philosophy is not the principles and norms of bioethics that guide the scientific and technological work, but the impact the new knowledge has on our traditional conceptions of life and the human reality as well as other life forms, and our individual and social life./nFrom her work on the ethical issues stemming from genetics, Juliana Gonzalez wrote Human Genome and Human Dignity)[8] (2005). This book expresses her philosophical awe of the facts revealed by molecular genetics (in particular the unity of life through DNA) and she presents a critical analysis of the ontological issues of dignity and human freedom in face of determinism and genetic manipulation, both of individuals and communities./nJuliana Gonzalez founded the Research Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 1998, which was transformed into the Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 02 and finally into the current Research Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 2009. This Seminar works on multidisciplinary research and has produced several books with the participation of biologists, geneticists, historians, neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers, medical doctors, lawyers, ecologists, economists, etc. The Seminar has published the following books: Bioethical Dilemmas, Bioethical Perspectives, Philosophy and Life Sciences and is working on another one, to be published soon: Rethinking Life and Value.", "6061523": "Bensalem Himmich (Arabic: \u0628\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062d\u0645\u064a\u0634) (born in 1948 in Meknes)[1] is a Moroccan novelist, poet and philosopher with a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Paris,[2] who teaches at the Mohammed V University, Rabat.[3] He served as Minister of Culture from 29 July 2009 to 3 January 2012.[4][5]/nHe has published 26 books, both literary and scientific works, in Arabic and French.

He was professor emeritus of philosophy at the Sorbonne at the end of his career. The study of Chr\u00e9tien increased widely after his death, a posthumous recognition that contrasts with his modest and solitary attitude./nBorn in Paris to Henri and Anna Chr\u00e9tien, Chr\u00e9tien was raised in an agnostic household.[1] His father was a communist activist and doctor in the International Brigades in Spain, and had spent time in the Natzweiler-Struthof and Dachau concentration camps.[2] As a young man in his mid-twenties, Chr\u00e9tien went against his father\u2019s wishes, converted to Catholicism, and was baptized on Pentecost Sunday.[3] Henceforth, his faith would play a fundamental role in the development not only of his life, but his unique brand of philosophy. Chr\u00e9tien studied at the\tLyc\u00e9e Charlemagne in the late 1960s, and graduated with a first from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (1971),[4] as well as a first in the Agr\u00e9gation de philosophie (1974).

Perhaps most centrally, his phenomenology finds its center in the experience of speech (The Ark of Speech), in which we are always trying to make the impossible response to the fundamental excess of reality. Thus, in a 2013 interview, Chr\u00e9tien declared that \"the guiding theme of all of my writings has been a phenomenology of speech as the place where all meaning comes to light and is received.\"[14]/nChr\u00e9tien was throughout his life a confirmed bachelor,[15] as well as a luddite with respect to technology: he never used computers, writing his many books and articles by hand, and preferring personal communication wherever possible.[16] This did not preclude his many deep friendships, and decades of mentoring relationships with students.

His writings cover a wide range of topics: poetry, Nietzsche, political theory, general philosophy and Jewish philosophy./nBorn in Berlin in 1887, Dr Erich Unger was interested, from an early age, in novel ideas and intellectual debate. He attended school in Berlin-Lichterfelde, a wealthy residential area that was heavily influenced by Prussian nobility and members of the Prussian armed forces. At school at \"Friedrich-Gymnasium\" he met Oskar Goldberg who ran a literary club at the age of seventeen. As a young man Unger became one of the founder members of the literary Expressionist movement in Germany. (cf. Richard Sheppard, Die Schriften des Neuen Klubs, 1908\u201314, Hildesheim, 1980, 83). Unger's contributions to journals of the day were frequently sought after. (cf. Manfred Voigts, Vom Expressionismus zum Mythos des Hebraertums, Wurzburg: Koenigshausen und Neumann, 1994)./nThe first World War saw Unger in Switzerland, where he made new friends, among them Walter Benjamin who admired his work and also sought his literary collaboration (cf. G.Scholem, Walter Benjamin. Briefe. Frankfurt-am-Main, 1966). In the 1920s, Unger provided an intellectual forum for a group of young and distinguished scholars who regularly discussed their ideas on science, politics and philosophy. The group rapidly became a centre for the Berlin intelligentsia of the day. (cf. Manfred Voigts, Oskar Goldberg, Berlin 1992)./nThe advent of Hitler ended a promising academic career and Unger took his young family into exile in 1933, first to Paris and later (1936) to London, where he lived to the end of his life in 1950./nThe imagination of reason or systematic imagination in philosophy.  This, in Unger's thinking, is a basic tool in any philosophical enquiry into the world of being \u2013 into reality beyond experience. Speaking of the latter, Unger writes: \"The matter of the world as a whole is not an empirical object, although it is unquestionable real\" ('The Living and the Divine' Ch.1).  In this essay  Unger explains how, in order to apprehend that reality and other, like concepts, such as being or consciousness, we require the imagination of reason. Not unlike astronomers who research heavenly constellations of which they have only a partial direct experience and who then need to complement their experience by using a reasoning imagination to access the aspect that is beyond their direct experience./nMyth.   The imagination of reason is also in evidence in Unger's views on the function of myth in religion. His book, 'Wirklichkeit, Mythos, Erkenntnis' ('Reality, Myth and Cognition') is an early work, yet his preoccupation with myth is still seen in a later essay: 'The Natural Order of Miracles', the English version of which appeared in The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy. Here Unger writes: \"A genuine myth handles one unit: religion, science, politics, social every day life and extends [and is constrained by] the concepts of order and apprehension of natural experience.  This is the source of its rational aspect. As distinct from this, the poetic myth is either pure art or, at least, half religion, half art\"./nUnger's views on Judaism are wide ranging. He notes with regret the gradual shrinking of Jewish culture to the 'mere religion' that it is today and suggests that, in order to revitalise Judaism, it must once again inspire and underpin our society.  This does not mean that there is such a thing as 'Jewish' science or 'Jewish' technology.  But Judaism may have views in other areas, in philosophy, sociology or politics, on topics such as Immortality or a specific Jewish ethical stand in political matters (cf. 'A Restatement of Judaism' in the journal Shofar)./nBooks:/nPosthumously:/nEssays translated into English:/nPosthumously:", "32996853": "Philosopher in Meditation, recently renamed Philosopher in Contemplation by the museum, is the traditional title of an oil painting in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, that is attributed to the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt./nIt is signed \"RHL-van Rijn\" and dated 1632, at the time of Rembrandt's move from Leiden to Amsterdam.[1] Recent scholarship suggests that the painting depicts \"Tobit and Anna waiting for their son Tobias\" instead. This interpretation is given in an auction catalogue from 1738 (see \"Subject matter\"), the earliest known source that clearly refers to this painting./nThe painting was brought to Paris from The Hague in the middle of the 18th century and made the rounds of aristocratic collections before being acquired for the royal collections housed in the Louvre Palace.[2] The presumed subject matter of philosophical meditation, the finely graded chiaroscuro treatment and the intricate composition were widely appreciated in France. The painting is mentioned in the writings of many 19th- and 20th-century literary figures, including George Sand, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Jules Michelet, Marcel Proust, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Gaston Bachelard, Paul Claudel, and Aldous Huxley./nThe ongoing popularity of the painting may be measured by its presence on the internet, where it is often used as an emblem of philosophy, or interpreted along esoteric or occult lines./nPainted in oils on an oak panel measuring about 11 x 13 in. (28 x 34\u00a0cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most \"graphic\" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines.[3] The most conspicuous figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure\u2014a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator\u2014is visible in 18th- and 19th-century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state.[4] As it is, the overall lighting is warm and quite subdued owing to the yellowing of the varnish.[5]/nThe panel is signed \"RHL-van Rijn 163_\" at the bottom and left of the center, at a vertical from the figure of the old man. The signature was traced with a fine brush in light pigment on a dark background and is quite difficult to make out. The last digit is a tiny blob of paint, the form and placing of which would tally with a \"0,\" \"1\" or \"2.\"[6] The type of signature\u2014monogram plus patronymic\u2014would argue for 1632, since the artist is known to have used this type of signature only in that year.[7] This does not mean that the picture was painted in that year or even in Amsterdam, to which Rembrandt had moved in late 1631. In any case, this type of signature is so rare in Rembrandt's oeuvre and date-specific that it argues for authenticity.[8]/nClose consideration of the known provenance explains how a Dutch scene of biblical domesticity could be turned into a French image of philosophical meditation. In this process, the role of the supposed companion piece (see below), with which it was paired for two centuries and which was also attributed to Rembrandt, proved determinant. Summary mentions of a \"Winding stair with a seated old man\" in 17th-century inventories could apply to either painting.[9] The earliest unambiguous reference to the painting is in the catalogue for the sale of the collection of the comte de Fraula in Brussels in 1738. The catalogue gives the measurements of the panel and the description: Een Ordonnantie met Tobias, ende eenen drayenden Trap, door Rimbrant (A Composition with Tobit, and a Winding Stair, by Rembrandt).[10]/nThe painting was bought by Jacques de Roore, an agent bidding on behalf of Willem Lormier, art collector and dealer in The Hague, whose wax seal is still on the back of the panel.[11] On 27 June 1748, Lormier sold the painting for Dfl. 525 to the French collector Marc-Ren\u00e9 Voyer, marquis d'Argenson.[12] In his manuscript list of the 17 paintings that he sold to Voyer on that occasion, Lormier referred to it as Oud Mannetje en wenteltrap (Old Man with a winding stair). His disregard of the Tobit subject cited in the Fraula catalogue may be due to the fact that he did not attend the auction personally and that he did not own the catalogue.[13]\nVoyer appears to be the originator of the old man's philosophical vocation, most likely inspired by the companion piece, which he also owned and which clearly shows a scholar in his study. Today, this former \"pendant\", titled Philosopher with an open book, is attributed to Salomon Koninck.[14]/nAs late as 1982, the two paintings were believed to have shared the same provenance as far back as 1734, but this was disproved by the Rembrandt Research Project.[15] Korthals Altes claims that Voyer already owned the Koninck when he acquired the Rembrandt, but cites no evidence.[16] In fact, nothing is known of the earlier provenance of the Koninck, or which of the two paintings he acquired first. Assuming that it was the Rembrandt, Anne Leclair notes that: \"At an unknown date, Voyer acquired a second 'Philosopher\" that he deemed close enough in style and format to make it a pendant\".[17] In notes on his \"pendants\" set down around 1750, Voyer pointed out that \"chance brought them together\".[18]/nAlthough he waxed enthusiastic about these prized possessions, calling them \"unique\", by 1752, he had already sold them to his friend, Claude-Alexandre de Villeneuve, comte de Vence. The latter had the two reproduced for the catalogue of his collection by Louis Surugue with the titles Philosophe en m\u00e9ditation (Koninck) and Philosophe en contemplation (Rembrandt). Significantly, the engraver reproduced the Koninck picture first and showed it at the Salon of 1753,[19] while he reproduced the Rembrandt in the following year and showed it at the Salon of 1755.[20] This was the beginning of a long series of graphic reproductions, both in France and Great Britain, that spread the fame of the two \"Philosophers\", while catering to the vogue for pendants.[21]/nThe comte de Vence died in 1760, stipulating in his testament that Voyer could choose two paintings from his collection. Interestingly enough, Voyer did not select the two \"pendants\", but only the Philosophe en contemplation (Rembrandt), thus separating the very pair that he had created and further attesting to the arbirariness of their association.[22] At the sale of the comte de Vence's collection in 1761, the Philosophe en m\u00e9ditation (Koninck) was purchased for 2,999 livres by a relative of the deceased, the marquis de Vence, who turned around and sold it to the duc de Choiseul, then Secretary of State for the Navy and War.[23] Wanting to curry favor with the influential duc de Choiseul, Voyer offered to part with his treasured Rembrandt so that the latter could enjoy possession of both \"Philosophers\". And so, for another 3,000 livres the two paintings were reunited in 1762, not to be separated again until 1955./nThe \"Philosophers\" continued their brilliant career in Paris, changing hands every few years: Randon de Boisset in 1772 (14,000 livres), Millon d'Ailly in 1777 (10,900 livres), who then sold it to the comte de Vaudreuil.[24] The culmination came when the two pictures were acquired by Alexandre-Joseph Paillet for the royal collection of Louis XVI in 1784 (13,000 livres) and given the honors of the Louvre Palace./nWhile the traditional title Philosopher in Meditation has to a large extent been responsible for the painting's popularity, it is iconographically untenable. The painting shows none of the conspicuous attributes of scholarship or philosophy\u2014books, globe, scientific instruments, etc.\u2014and the presence of at least one other figure involved in domestic tasks does not fit in with the solitude associated with study and meditation.[25] Though a large book and a quill seem to be among the few objects on the table in front of the main figure, they are summarily depicted and impossible to identify more precisely: a Bible alone would not suffice to make the figure depicted a scholar or \"philosopher.\" Staircases\u2014whether spiral or not\u2014were not an attribute of philosophy in the early 17th century. Similar observations argue against identifying the main figure as an \"alchemist,\" a subject that would allow for other figures, such as an assistant tending a fire./nThe objects depicted suggest a domestic setting, yet the improbable architecture speaks more for a history than a genre subject. The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke[26] argues that the scene is ultimately derived from the Book of Tobit, one of Rembrandt's favorite Old Testament sources.[27] The sole objection to this interpretation is that, apart from the two main figures\u2014the blind Tobit and his wife Anna\u2014 there is no typical iconographic attribute, specifically Anna's spinning wheel. Nevertheless, a plausible interpretation of the scene is Tobit and Anna waiting for the return of their only son, also called Tobias, a scene that Rembrandt had already represented in another version in 1630, in which Anna's spinning gear is minimally indicated.[28] This is supported by an 18th-century source identifying a Rembrandt painting of exactly the same format representing a \"Composition with Tobit and a winding stair.\"[29] The Rembrandt Research Project dismisses this evidence as \"certainly incorrect since there are two women in the picture and there is no specific motif from the story of Tobias-\" [30]/nEarlier inventory mentions of a \"winding stair with an old man sitting on a chair\" or \"winding stair\" attributed to Rembrandt are vague and might even refer to the companion painting long attributed to Rembrandt, but now given to Salomon Koninck.[31]\nAlthough the title in the Louvre's publications remains Philosophe en m\u00e9ditation[32]  catalogues of Rembrandt's painted oeuvre, starting with Bredius (1935) identify the subject more soberly as a \"Scholar in an Interior with a Winding Stair.\"[33] With the rejection of the attribution to Rembrandt by the Rembrandt Research Project in 1986, the title became \"Old Man in an interior with a winding staircase.\"[34]/nThe explanation for the long-standing misinterpretation of the Philosopher in Meditation lies in the fact that, in the second half of the 18th century, it was sold and collected together with a panel of identical size (28 x 33.5\u00a0cm) that presented similar motifs\u2014in particular a spiral staircase\u2014and was also attributed to Rembrandt. The paintings were exhibited together and titled interchangeably Philosophe en m\u00e9ditation and Philosophe en contemplation, or referred to simply as the Philosophes.[35] The companion painting shows an old man in a vaulted interior seated in front of a table at a window on which we can see books, a globe, and a crucifix. These accessories and his solitary condition make him a more plausible candidate for philosophical pursuits than the old man in the so-called Philosopher in Meditation, who occupies a space shared by at least one other person, and maybe even two. In spite of the obvious differences in the composition and execution, its attribution to Rembrandt was never called into question. The exception is the American art historian John C. Van Dyke, who whittled Rembrandt's oeuvre down to less than fifty paintings and made short shrift of the Louvre's Philosophers: \"Small pictures over which, in the past, there has been much spilling of good printer's ink with no marked results. The pictures are not wonderful...\". With that, he attributed the paintings to Salomon Koninck, though one, today's Rembrandt, only tentatively.[36] In 1955, examinations with X-rays and infrared photography at the laboratory of the Louvre revealed notable differences in treatment and caused the attribution to Rembrandt finally to be dropped.[37]/nJacques Foucart (1982), Curator for Dutch and Fleming Painting at the Louvre, like Horst Gerson (1968)[38] and Werner Sumowski (1983),[39] attributes this work to Salomon Koninck (1609\u20131656), a Rembrandt imitator, dating it to around 1645 and titling it Philosopher with an Open Book.[40] The subject matter and details of the Koninck picture seem to have been directly inspired by a Rembrandt etching dated 1642 that represents St. Jerome in a dark chamber (Bartsch 105), which is the only other known work by Rembrandt that features a complete helical staircase.[41] The traditional iconography of the Doctors of the Church and St. Jerome provided the attributes for 17th-century representations of scholars in their study, which included books, a globe, and often a human skull.[42] The identical format might well be a product of chance (standard supply) and it was long believed that the \"pendant\" had been enlarged by 2 cm at the top, but an examination of the panel by Clarke and Foucart in 1988 revealed that it was of one piece. Any further speculation on the relationship between the two paintings must take into account manuscript notes from around 1750 written by their first French owner, the marquis de Voyer d'Argenson, who states that the two pictures were brought together \"by chance.\"[43] The provenance of the former companion piece previous to the late 1740s remains unknown: a wax seal on the back has not yet been identified.[44]/nIn the second volume of its Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings, which covers the years 1631\u20131634, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) rejected the attribution to Rembrandt of the Philosopher in Meditation. Until then, and except for the \"heretical\" John C. Van Dyke, this attribution had been unanimously accepted by experts and art historians. The RRP did not introduce any new objective or documentary evidence, but based its judgment on an assessment of Rembrandt's \"habits,\" an appraisal of the painting's style, and the difficulty of fitting it within Rembrandt's production in 1632 or the later 1630s.[45] The RRP did not make any guesses as to who the author of this painting might have been, but relegated it to \"Rembrandt's immediate circle, or even to his own workshop.\"[45] This judgment was criticized by Jean-Marie Clarke[46] who maintained the traditional attribution to Rembrandt and pointed out that the RRP might have had a special stake in rejecting this painting, as the following quote suggests:\n\"In the later part of the 18th century the painting enjoyed a great reputation in France as Le Philosophe en contemplation, and it helped to determine the image of Rembrandt's art to an unwarranted extent.\"[47]/nThis disattribution was not accepted by the Louvre and other Rembrandt scholars,[48] and the newly configured RRP has changed its stance since then. In the fifth volume of the Corpus (2011), which covers \"small history paintings,\" the painting is classified without further ado as a \"re-attribution\" by the director of the RRP, Ernst van de Wetering.[49] The painting was officially re-instated in vol. 6 of the Corpus under no. A86 with the title Interior with a window and a winding staircase and the parenthetical information: \"a study in Kamerlicht.\" [50]  There is no further mention of the issue of perspective that was highlighted by the Rembrandt Research Project in volume II when it disattributed the painting and called it just that: a study in perspective.[51] Considering the fact that it is supposed to be a study, this painting is executed in great detail (down to individual nails in the woodwork) and bears a signature and date. There is no evidence that \"studies\" or \"interiors\" with figures but without a narrative were in demand on the art market. The inconsistencies in the Rembrandt Research Project's position do not lend credence to its argument that, here, Rembrandt was working without reference to  iconography.[52]/nIn a lecture given at the Goetheanum in Dornach (1916), the ex-theosophist and founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner, described the Louvre Philosopher as the \"purest expression of light and dark... All that you see here\u2014the architecture and all the other features\u2014merely provided the occasion for the real work of Art, which lies in the distribution of light and dark.\" This, he held, was precisely the essence of Rembrandt's art. As it was, he showed only a \"lantern slide\" of the companion painting by Salomon Koninck discussed above.[53]/nWith his inversion of the title, Aldous Huxley (1954) sums up most of the \"deeper\" interpretations of the painting: \"There hangs in the Louvre a M\u00e9ditation du Philosophe, whose symbolical subject-matter is nothing more or less than the human mind, with its teeming darknesses, its moments of intellectual and visionary illuminations, its mysterious staircases winding downwards and upwards into the unknown.[54]\nThe caption to an illustration of the painting (reversed) in the psychoanalyst C. G. Jung's Man and His Symbols (1964) reads: \"The inward-looking old man provides an image of Jung's belief that each of us must explore his own unconscious.\"[55]/nJean-Marie Clarke (1980) advanced a psychological interpretation based on the circular form of the composition and the Yin-Yang-like distribution of light, reading the painting as a Mandala in the Jungian sense: an archetypal symbol of the integrated Self. The chiaroscuro treatment and the presence of many straight lines that are structured by curved lines speaks for an effort at reconciling oppositions. Further, Clarke interpreted the concentricity of the composition and wealth of circular motifs as metaphors for the underlying theme of the painting: the eye and vision. Like Julius Held,[56] Clarke believes that the drawing dated ca. 1630 at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (Benesch 64) with the caption \"HARMAN GERRITS van der Rhijn\" written in Rembrandt's hand that shows his father in a pose similar to that of Tobit here, suggests that he may have been blind at the end of his life.[57] Accordingly, the figure of the blind old man (Tobit) would stand for Rembrandt's father (d. 1630), who opposed his son's wish to become an artist and whose vision the young Rembrandt (Tobias) \"healed\" with the help of the archangel Raphael (\"God heals\", a name that also symbolizes Art).[58] More recently, Clarke published an interpretation on the internet that relates Rembrandt's composition to the design of his signature in 1632.[59]/nJean-Pierre Dautun (1983), a student of the French philosopher Raymond Abellio, offered a detailed phenomenological reading along Gnostic lines, interpreting the central motif of the painting (the basketwork tray) as \"the navel, the omphalos of the luminous hermetic secret that Rembrandt wishes to transmit: the phenomenological secret that the eye of the genius will be given to those who will conquer the genius of the eye. It is the ineffable secret of this transmission itself, the 'thou art that' of this mutus liber that is his painting, as if to permit an Occidental satori to a koan of his own devise.\"[60] The German art historian Karl Clausberg also pointed out the \"ocular nature\" of the scene and gave it a conceptual framework in his 1999 book \"Neuronale Kunstgeschichte.\"[61] The French philosophy professor R\u00e9gine Pietra (1992) published an essay in which she used the painting to illustrate the rhetorical figure of hypotyposis;[62] Rembrandt's painting, with its interplay of light and dark, renders the experience of philosophical meditation visually perceptible.[63]\nThe Dutch philosopher Otto B. Wiersma (1999) published an article on the internet that he summarizes in these terms:\n\"The painting of Rembrandt Philosophe en m\u00e9ditation (1632, Louvre Paris) can be characterized as a pictorial meditation on the miracle of vision. A better title would be M\u00e9ditation visionnaire, because the painting catches the eye in more than one sense.\"[64]\nA discussion of the Philosopher in Meditation along essentially Gurdjeffian lines can be found on the Objective Art website (2011).[65]", "589305": "Cornel Ronald West (born June 2, 1953) is an American philosopher, theologian, political activist, social critic, actor, and public intellectual.[12][13] The grandson of a Baptist minister, West's primary philosophy focuses on the roles of race, gender, and class struggle in American society. A socialist,[14][15] West draws intellectual contributions from multiple traditions, including Christianity, the black church, democratic socialism, left-wing populism, neopragmatism, and transcendentalism.[16][17][18][19] Among his most influential books are Race Matters (1993) and Democracy Matters (2004)./nWest is an outspoken voice in left-wing politics in the United States. During his career, he has held professorships and fellowships at Harvard University, Yale University, Union Theological Seminary, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Pepperdine University, and the University of Paris.[20] He is a frequent commentator on politics and social questions in many media outlets.[21]/nFrom 2010 through 2013, West co-hosted the radio program Smiley and West with Tavis Smiley.[22][23] He has been featured in several documentaries, and made appearances in Hollywood films such as The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, as well as providing commentary for both films. West has also made several spoken word and hip hop albums, and due to this work, has been named MTV's Artist of the Week.[24] West co-hosts a podcast entitled, The Tight Rope, with Tricia Rose. He is a frequent conversation partner with his friend Robert P. George, a prominent conservative intellectual, with the two often speaking together at colleges and universities on the meaning of liberal arts education, free speech, and civil dialogue.[25][26] In 2020, he was listed by Prospect magazine as the fourth-greatest thinker for the COVID-19 era.[27]/nWest is a third party candidate in the 2024 presidential election. After declaring his run with the People's Party in June 2023, he shortly thereafter announced he also was seeking the nomination of the Green Party.[6][7] In October 2023, he announced he was again switching his affiliation, and is running as an independent candidate.[28]/nWest was born on June 2, 1953, in Tulsa, Oklahoma,[29] and grew up in Sacramento, California, where he graduated from John F. Kennedy High School. His mother, Irene Rayshell (Bias), was a teacher and principal. His father, Clifton Louis West Jr., was a general contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense.[30] His grandfather, Clifton L. West Sr., was pastor of the Tulsa Metropolitan Baptist Church.[31]\nIrene B. West Elementary School in Elk Grove, California, is named after his mother.[32]/nAs a teen, West marched in civil rights demonstrations and organized protests demanding black studies courses at his high school, where he was the student body president. He later wrote that, in his youth, he admired \"the sincere black militancy of Malcolm X, the defiant rage of the Black Panther Party, and the livid black theology of James Cone\".[33]/nIn 1970, after graduation from high school, he enrolled at Harvard College and took classes taught by the philosophers Robert Nozick and Stanley Cavell. In 1973, West was graduated from Harvard magna cum laude in Near Eastern languages and civilization.[34] He credits Harvard with exposing him to a broader range of ideas and that he was influenced by his professors as well as the Black Panther Party. West says his Christianity prevented him from joining the BPP, instead choosing to work in local breakfast, prison, and church programs.[35] After completing his undergraduate work at Harvard, West enrolled at Princeton University, where he received a Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1980, completing a dissertation under the supervision of Raymond Geuss and Sheldon Wolin.[3] He became the first African American to graduate from Princeton with a PhD degree in philosophy.[36]/nAt Princeton, West was heavily influenced by the neopragmatism of Richard Rorty.[37] Rorty remained a close friend and colleague of West's for many years following West's graduation. The title of West's dissertation was Ethics, Historicism, and the Marxist Tradition,[38] which was later revised and published under the title The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought.[37]/nIn his late 20s, he returned to Harvard as a W.\u00a0E.\u00a0B. Du Bois Fellow before becoming an assistant professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. In 1984, he went to Yale Divinity School in what eventually became a joint appointment in American studies. While at Yale, he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and divestment from apartheid South Africa. One of the protests resulted in his being arrested and jailed. As punishment, the university administration canceled his leave for the spring term in 1987, leading him to commute from Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was teaching two classes, across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Paris.[17]/nHe then returned to Union Theological Seminary  for one year before going to Princeton to become a professor of religion and director of the program in African American Studies from 1988 to 1994.[17] After Princeton, he accepted an appointment as professor of African American studies at Harvard University, with a joint appointment at the Harvard Divinity School.[39] West taught one of the university's most popular courses, an introductory class on African American studies.[40] In 1998, he was appointed the first Alphonse Fletcher University Professor.[41] West used this new position to teach in not only African American studies, but also courses in divinity, religion, and philosophy.[39] West was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa in 1998 at SUNY Plattsburgh./nWest left Harvard after a widely publicized [42] 2002 dispute with the university's president, Lawrence Summers.[43] That year, West returned to Princeton, where he helped found the Center for African American studies in 2006. In 2012, West left Princeton and returned to the institution where he began his teaching career, Union Theological Seminary.[44] His departure from Princeton was quite amicable. He continued to teach occasional courses at Princeton in an emeritus capacity as the Class of 1943 University Professor in the Center for African American Studies.[45]/nWest returned to Harvard in November 2016, leaving Union Theological Seminary for a nontenured position as Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy. He was appointed jointly at the Harvard Divinity School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Department of African and African American Studies.[46][47][48]/nIn February 2021, reports circulated that West was denied consideration for tenure at Harvard and that he had threatened to leave the university again.[49] On March 8, 2021, West announced that he would leave Harvard and move to the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.[50][51][52]  He submitted a resignation letter to Harvard on June 30, 2021.[53]  West implied that the decision to deny him tenure was retaliation for his critical stance on Israel and the Palestinian cause. West wrote:/nIs Harvard a place for a free Black man like myself whose Christian faith and witness put equal value on Palestinian and Jewish babies \u2013 like all babies \u2013 and reject all occupations as immoral?/nMore than 90 organizations at Harvard, signed a petition stating that the denial of tenure to West was \"a testament to Harvard's continued expulsion of faculty who offer incisive analysis of white supremacy, racial capitalism, Zionism, and the military-industrial complex, all of which Professor West fervently critiques\".[54][non-primary source needed]/nOn July 1, 2021, West rejoined the faculty of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, holding the prestigious Dietrich Bonhoeffer Chair. Affiliated with Columbia University, since 1928, Union Theological Seminary in the city of New York has served as the Columbia University constituent faculty of theology./nThe recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees and an American Book Award,[16] West has written or contributed to more than twenty published books. West is a long-time member of the Democratic Socialists of America, for which he has served as honorary chair.[17] He is also a co-founder of the Network of Spiritual Progressives.[55] West is on the advisory board of the International Bridges to Justice.[56] In 2008, he received special recognition from the World Cultural Council.[57] West is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and its World Policy Council, a think tank whose purpose is to expand involvement of Alpha Phi Alpha in politics and social policy to encompass international concerns.[58]/nWest has been compared to W. E. B. Du Bois as a prolific African American thinker. He has been cited as \"[p]erhaps the most influential contemporary recover of Du Bois\".[59] By establishing West within Du Bois's tradition of racial thought, scholars emphasize the similarities in their intellectual positions and their aesthetic presences. They crafted their physical attire to match that of disciplined men of the black race and both Du Bois and West often wore multiple-piece suits and ties. Their modest clothing choices similarly reflected Du Bois's belief in \"the mind and the body as disciplined and contained\".[60]/nWest has been widely cited in the popular press.[61] His scholarship has been criticized as well as praised; The New Republic literary editor Leon Wieseltier called West's writing \"sectarian, humorless, pedantic, and self-endeared\".[62]/nIn 1997, West was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society,[63] and in 1999, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[20]/nWest appears as Councillor West in both The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions and also provides the voice for this character in the video game Enter the Matrix.[64] In addition, West provides philosophical commentary on all three Matrix films in The Ultimate Matrix Collection, along with the integral theorist Ken Wilber.[65]/nHe has made several appearances in documentary films, such as the 2008 film Examined Life, a documentary featuring several academics discussing philosophy in real-world contexts. West, \"driving through Manhattan,\u00a0... compares philosophy to jazz and blues, reminding us how intense and invigorating a life of the mind can be\".[66] He also appears in conversation with Bill Withers in the 2009 documentary Still Bill./nWest has made frequent appearances on the political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher.[67]/nA character based on West and events in his career appeared in the Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \"Anti-Thesis\", significant for introducing the recurring villain character Nicole Wallace.[68]/nIn May 2012, West guest-starred in the sixth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock, \"What Will Happen to the Gang Next Year?\".[69]/nWest recorded a recitation of John Mellencamp's song \"Jim Crow\" for inclusion on the singer's box set On the Rural Route 7609 in 2009.[70]/nIn 2010, he completed recording with the Cornel West Theory, a hip hop band endorsed by West.[70]/nHe also has released several hip-hop-soul-spoken word albums. In 2001, West released his first album, Sketches of My Culture.[71] Street Knowledge followed in 2004.[72] In 2007, West released his third album entitled, Never Forget: A Journey of Revelations, that included collaborations with the likes of Prince, Talib Kweli, Jill Scott, Andre 3000, KRS-One, and the late Gerald Levert.[73] West appeared on Immortal Technique's song \"Sign of the Times\", which appeared on the 2011 album The Martyr.[74] In 2012, he was featured on Brother Ali's song \"Letter to My Countrymen\", which appeared on the album Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color.[75]/nIn April 2019, Robert P. George and West participated in an \"assembly series\" discussion at Washington University in St. Louis entitled \"Liberal Arts Education: What's The Point?\"[76]/nWest is also the co-host, along with Tricia Rose, of the podcast The Tight Rope.[77]/nIn 2000, economist and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers became president of Harvard. Soon after, Summers held a private meeting with West, in which he reportedly rebuked West for missing too many classes, contributing to grade inflation, neglecting serious scholarship, and spending too much time on his financially profitable projects.[78] Summers reportedly suggested that West produce an academic book befitting his professorial position, as his recent output had consisted primarily of co-written and edited volumes. According to some reports, Summers also objected to West's production of a CD, the critically panned Sketches of My Culture, and to his political campaigning, including spending an alleged three weeks to promote Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential campaign.[79] West contended he had missed only one class during his time at Harvard \"in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard-sponsored conference on AIDS\". Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of Harvard University Professor and thus reported directly to the president, he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production.[80]/nSummers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West, except to express hope that West would remain at Harvard. Soon after, West was hospitalized for prostate cancer. West noted that Summers failed to send him get-well wishes until weeks after his surgery, whereas newly installed Princeton president Shirley Tilghman had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment.[80] In 2002, West left Harvard University to return to Princeton. West lashed out at Summers in public interviews, calling him \"the Ariel Sharon of higher education\" on the NPR program The Tavis Smiley Show.[81] In response to these remarks, five Princeton faculty members, led by professor of molecular biology Jacques Robert Fresco, said they looked with \"strong disfavor upon his characterization\" of Summers and that \"such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications\u00a0... that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate, indeed repugnant and intolerable\".[82] Harvard's undergraduate student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, suggested in October 2002 that the premise of the Law and Order: Criminal Intent episode \"Anti-Thesis\" was based on West's conflicts with Summers.[83]/nWest has called the U.S. a \"racist patriarchal\" nation where white supremacy continues to define everyday life. \"White America\", he writes, \"has been historically weak-willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of blacks.\" He goes on to say this has created many \"degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity, meaning, and self-worth.\" West attributes most of the black community's problems to \"existential angst derive[d] from the lived experience of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating U.S. society and culture.\"[84]/nIn West's view, the September 11 attacks \"gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a black person in the United States\", feeling \"unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, and hatred for who they are\".[85] \"The ugly terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on 9/11\", he said, \"plunged the whole country into the blues.\"[85]/nWest was arrested on October 13, 2014, while protesting against the shooting of Michael Brown and participating in Ferguson October,[86][87] and again on August 10, 2015, while demonstrating outside a courthouse in St. Louis on the one-year anniversary of Brown's death.[88] The 2015 documentary film #Bars4Justice includes footage of West demonstrating and being arrested in Ferguson.[89]/nWest has described himself as a \"non-Marxist socialist\" (partly because he does not view Marxism and Christianity as reconcilable)[90] and previously served as honorary chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America, which he has described as \"the first multiracial, socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join.\"[17] In the Matrix-themed documentary entitled, The Burly Man Chronicles, he described himself as a \"radical democrat, suspicious of all forms of authority\".[91]/nWest believes that \"the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's ugly totalitarian regime was desirable\",[92] but that the war in Iraq was the result of \"dishonest manipulation\" on the part of the Bush administration.[93] He asserts that Bush administration hawks \"are not simply conservative elites and right-wing ideologues\", but rather are \"evangelical nihilists \u2013 drunk with power and driven by grand delusions of American domination of the world\". He adds, \"[we now] are experiencing the sad gangsterization of America, an unbridled grasp at power, wealth, and status\". Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts, West warns, \"Free-market fundamentalism trivializes the concern for public interest. It puts fear and insecurity in the hearts of anxiety-ridden workers. It also makes money-driven, poll-obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit \u2013 often at the cost of the common good.\"[94]/nWest has been involved with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmons's Hip-Hop Summit, and he has worked with such public figures as Louis Farrakhan[29] and Al Sharpton, whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised.[95]/nIn 2000, West worked as a senior advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley. When Bradley lost in the primaries, West became a prominent and active supporter of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, speaking at several Nader rallies. Some Greens sought to draft West to run as a presidential candidate in 2004. West declined, citing his active participation in the Al Sharpton campaign. West, along with other prominent Nader 2000 supporters, signed the \"Vote to Stop Bush\" statement urging progressive voters in swing states to vote for John Kerry, despite strong disagreements with many of Kerry's policies.[96]/nIn April 2002, West and Rabbi Michael Lerner engaged in an act of civil disobedience by sitting in the street in front of the U.S. State Department \"in solidarity with suffering Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters\". West said, \"[w]e must keep in touch with the humanity of both sides\".[97][98] In May 2007, West joined a demonstration against \"injustices faced by the Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation\" and \"to bring attention to this 40-year travesty of justice\". In 2011, West called on the University of Arizona to divest from companies profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.[99]/nWest also serves as co-chair of the Network of Spiritual Progressives (formerly the Tikkun Community). He co-chaired the National Parenting Organization's Task Force on Parent Empowerment and participated in President Bill Clinton's National Conversation on Race. He has publicly endorsed In These Times magazine by calling it: \"The most creative and challenging news magazine of the American left.\" He is also a contributing editor for Sojourners magazine./nWest supports People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in its Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign, aimed at eliminating what PETA describes as the inhumane treatment of chickens by KFC. West is quoted on PETA flyers: \"Although most people don't know chickens as well as they know cats and dogs, chickens are interesting individuals with personalities and interests every bit as developed as the dogs and cats with whom many of us share our lives.\"/nIn 2008, West contributed his insights on the global issue of modernized slavery and human trafficking in the documentary Call+Response.[100] West is a member of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy./nIn 2011, West expressed his frustration with some critics of Occupy Wall Street, who said the movement lacked a clear and unified message. West replied by saying:/nIt's impossible to translate the issue of the greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands. We're talking about a democratic awakening...you're talking about raising political consciousness so it spills over all parts of the country, so people can begin to see what's going on through a set of different lens, and then you begin to highlight what the more detailed demands would be. Because in the end we're really talking about what Martin King would call a revolution: A transfer of power from oligarchs to everyday people of all colors. And that is a step by step process.[101]/nOn October 16, 2011, West was in Washington, D.C., participating in the Occupy D.C. protests on the steps of the Supreme Court over the court's decision in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case the previous year.[102] Five days later, he was arrested during an Occupy Wall Street protest in Harlem against the New York Police Department's stop and frisk policy.[103]/nIn 2014, West co-initiated the Stop Mass Incarceration Network, a project of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA. Later that year, he and RCP chairman Bob Avakian took part in a filmed discussion on \"Religion and Revolution\".[104]/nIn August 2017, West was one of a group of interfaith, multiracial clergy who took part in a counter-protest at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; West averred that Antifa had saved their lives.[105]/nWest is an outspoken supporter of Julian Assange, on one occasion saying: \"[Assange] has been simply laying bare some of the crimes and lies of the American empire\".[106]/nWest stated that he believed the Russian invasion of Ukraine was \"a criminal invasion, provoked by the expansion of NATO, which is an instrument of U.S. global power\" and described the war as a \"proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation\".[107][108]/nWest has often spoken about the lack of adequate black leadership and how it leads to doubt within black communities as to their political potential to ensure change.[109] West publicly supported 2008 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama. He spoke to more than 1,000 of Obama supporters at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, on November 29, 2007.[110]/nWest criticized Obama when he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, saying that it would be difficult for Obama to be \"a war president with a peace prize\". West further retracted his support for Obama in an April 2011 interview, stating that Obama is \"a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black muppet of corporate plutocrats. And now he has become head of the American killing machine and is proud of it\".[111][112][113] In November 2012, West said in an interview that he considered Obama a \"Rockefeller Republican in blackface\".[114]/nIn 2011, West participated in a \"Poverty Tour\" with Tavis Smiley, his co-host on the Public Radio International program Smiley & West.

Trubetskoy and his brother, Evgenii Nikolaevitch Troubetzkoy (1863\u20131920), continued Vladimir Solovyov's work on developing a modern Christian philosophy of the world.[citation needed] He was also a professor of philosophy at Moscow University and a founding member of the underground discussion circle Beseda.[1]/nTrubetskoy became an adherent of the British Positivists Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill as a teenager. Later he became disappointed with both and turned to Schopenhauer. Trubetskoy's study of Schopenhauer's philosophy led him to a conclusion that Schopenhauer's pessimism was the result of the denial of God. Trubetskoy himself described this dilemma the following way: \"Either God exists or life is not worth living\". He became an Orthodox Christian, and also an adherent of the Slavophiles: his beliefs at that time were influenced by the writings of Aleksey Khomyakov.[citation needed]/nIn 1885 Trubetskoy graduated from Moscow University; he continued to work there until his death, lecturing in philosophy./nIn 1886, Trubetskoy became acquainted with the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, who held largely the same views about religion as Trubetskoy and became his close friend.[citation needed]/nIn 1890 Trubetskoy became Professor of Philosophy at Moscow University.[citation needed] Later he played a significant role in the Russian liberal movement; he was a founding member of Beseda.[1]/nSergey Trubetskoy was one of several philosophers who complained that there in practice was no real autocracy, as all the entanglement of government agencies made it unsure where the power truly lay; in 1900 he wrote: 'There is an autocracy of policemen and land captains, of governors department heads, and ministers, but a unitary Tsarist autocracy, in the proper sense of the word, does not and cannot exist'.[2]/nIn 1904 the Trubetskoy wrote of the conflict with Japan, contending that Russia was defending the entire European civilisation from 'the yellow danger, the new hordes of Mongols armed with modern technology', being one of many Russian academics seeing the conflict as a 'crusade', a war between civilisation and barbarism;[1] it led an 'educated liberal' to see the conflict as one against the hordes of Asia.[3]/nTrubetskoy had attained the position of Professor of Philosophy at Moscow University by 1904.[1] In 1905 he was elected rector of Moscow University; but he died just a month later, of a brain haemorrhage.[citation needed]/nNikolai Trubetskoy, the linguist, was his son.[4]/nTrubetskoy's brother, Evgenii Nikolaevitch Troubetzkoy (1863\u20131920), was also a philosopher and a professor at  Moscow University, who largely shared his brother's beliefs.

His daughters and wife were killed there as well/nWorking in the same field as Solovyov, Trubetskoy sought to establish a philosophic foundation for an Orthodox Christian worldview, which would be equally rooted in faith and reason. In 1890 he defended his Master's thesis, \"Metaphysics in Ancient Greece\", in which he argued that the Holy Scripture and Christian theology largely stemmed directly from the idealistic philosophy of ancient Greece.[citation needed]/nThe religious beliefs of Trubetskoy are sometimes identified as \"Christocentrism\", wherein the Church serves as a continuation of the Incarnation of Christ to convey divine precepts to society. These views are set forth in Trubetskoy's work, The Teaching on Logos.[citation needed] Trubetskoy believed that the personality of Jesus Christ, which united the human and divine wills, is crucial for understanding of all aspects and dimensions of Christianity. He viewed Christian teaching not solely as a set of ethical norms but as a system of truth which can be perceived and understood exclusively through special revelation (see fideism). His viewpoint differed both from the official doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox Church and from the beliefs of liberal intellectuals, who reduced the Christian faith to an egalitarian ethic.[citation needed]", "5373434": "Philip Willem van Heusde (17 June 1778 in Rotterdam \u2013 2 July 1839 in Geneva) was a Dutch philosopher and educator.

He spent two extended periods in England, and is known for his influence in the 1920s on the poet Robert Graves. Mallik used as his family name derives from an honorific given by the Moghul Empire, and he preferred not to use it.[1]/nHe was the son of Srihari Kumar Mallik, an East India Railway employee, born at Jamalpur in Bihar on 27 May 1879. The family moved to Halisahar in West Bengal when he was still young. His father had a drinking problem, and died in 1888. His mother, with her mother-in-law and the other children, then moved back to Meherpur, the family home.[2] Robert Graves gave a version of Srihari's death: he was a Christian convert who gave up Hindu dietary practices, wrecking his health.[3]/nAfter attending the Meherpur high school, Basanta Kumar Mallik went to the General Assembly's Institution in 1896. In Calcutta he encountered William Spence Urquhart, from 1902 teaching at Duff College, who became a friend. After some family troubles, he gained a B.A. degree in Mental and Moral Philosophy in 1902, having gone through an arranged marriage in 1900 in Hazaribagh which came to nothing.[4][5] He took an M.A. degree in Philosophy at Presidency College, Calcutta in 1903. For the next few years he divided his time between a tutoring job in Chitpur Road, Calcutta and Hazaribagh.[6] He took on posts as warden of student hostels, befriended Kali Nath Roy and visited Varanasi in 1907.[7]/nIn 1908 a recommendation by a friend gained Mallik a position as tutor to Kaiser Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, son of Chandra Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, Prime Minister of Nepal with title Maharaja.[8] Kaiser, who later became a bibliophile, visited the United Kingdom with his father that year.[9] He was the third son, born in 1892, and his mother had died in 1905. He had been a student at the Durbar High School. In 1907 he was given a position in the Foreign Imports Department.[10] Mallik had been chosen after Kaiser's current tutor consulted the principal of the Durbar High School, and joined the court in Kathmandu in May 1909, meeting Kaiser who was camping with his father in the Gokarna reserve.[11] He shortly took on responsibility for another of the sons, and started to work under the Foreign Secretary. He was involved in preliminary discussion of what became the Nepal\u2013Britain Treaty of 1923, the long-term goal of Chandra Shumsher's diplomacy.[12]/nLife in Kathmandu near the Pashupatinath Temple suited Mallik. But Chandra Shumsher was able to arrange for his admission to Exeter College, Oxford through Lord Curzon, to read law.[13]/nMallik arrived in Oxford in 1912, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 20 November.[14] He took a law degree as an undergraduate at Exeter College, graduating B.A. in Jurisprudence in 1916.[15] The original intention that he should return to Nepal in 1915 was made impractical by World War I.[16]/nIn Michaelmas Term 1917 Mallick began a diploma course in anthropology.[17] It led to certificates in anthropology in 1918, and a diploma in 1919. He then started on doctoral study, producing a dissertation on \"The Problem of Freedom\", but leaving Oxford in 1923 before his examination.[18]/nMallik was involved in the Oxford Majlis, a student group, and had contact with the literary circle around Robert Bridges at Boar's Hill.[19][20] Friends who were Indian expatriates among the students were John Matthai, Kiron Mukherji and K. M. Panikkar.[21]/nAfter World War I Mallik had a large social circle in Oxford.[22] A smaller group of followers closely interested in Mallik's thought gathered round him: Thomas Wilfrid \"Sam\" Harries of Balliol College with Communist inclinations, Sydney Lewis of Exeter College who died shortly after leaving Oxford, the Serbian Alexander Vidakovi\u0107 who went on to be a journalist with Politika.[23][24]/nIn 1919 Mallik was elected a member of the Aristotelian Society.[25] William Yandell Elliott was in Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. He recalled a dominant role for Mallik among students who regarded him as a \"wise man\". At the Oxford Lotus Club, a student society with a focus on the Indian subcontinent, Elliott, Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan, with others, attempted to debate with him in \"Platonic dialogues\". Elliott wrote that Mallik was cast as Socrates. His compressed, over-simplified version of Mallik's position was that \"in every clash both sides are wrong\".[26]/nMallik first met Graves in 1922 at the Oxford Lotus Club, where Graves was giving a talk, a draft on \"What is Bad Poetry?\".[27] Graves's mentor W. H. R. Rivers had just died, and he had broken with his friend Robert Nichols, also engaging in a spat with Diccon Hughes, another friend. He was working on a B.Litt. dissertation but his supervisor for it at the university, Walter Raleigh, had died a few weeks before Rivers.[28]/nSubsequently, Mallik brought some of his followers, including Sam Harries, to Graves's home in Islip, to talk.[29] Alan Collingridge, counted as a disciple, left an account of discussions between Graves and Mallik there.[30] These intense encounters with Graves were also held around Oxford at Mallik's home on Farndon Road, at Garsington and elsewhere, and involved Collingridge, Wilfrid Roberts of Balliol College who became a good friend of Mallik, and Mary Neighbour.[31]/nJean Moorcroft Wilson considers that the five poetry collections published by Graves 1923\u20131925 show Mallik's influence.[32] Graves called his 1924 poetry collection Mock Beggar Hall (1924) a largely philosophical work; and in Good-Bye to All That (1929 edition) he noted that \"This philosophic interest was a result of my meeting with Basanta Mallik\". He also commented on how the encounter with Mallik allowed him to overcome some racial prejudice.[3] Graves dedicated The Marmosite's Miscellany (1925), a long pseudonymous poetical satire for the Hogarth Press published under the name John Doyle, to Mallik in India.[33]/nMallik returned to India in October 1923.[32] He made a visit to Nepal at the end of the year and saw Kaiser Shumsher in his library, but was no longer in favour at court there: Kaiser had supported his post-war period in Oxford, but he was not to expect a post from Chandra Shumsher.[16] He found lodgings in Raja Nava Kissen Street, Calcutta, through the Sen family for whom he had worked as a tutor.[34]/nAround 1924 Radhakrishnan found in Mallik and Kiron Mukherji two younger thinkers who shared his interest in European philosophy, and later in the 1920s Mallik came to be on close terms with him.[35] In June 1925 Sam Harries arrived in Calcutta to visit Mallik. He died suddenly while there, from cerebral malaria.[36]/nTaking on legal work, Mallik was able to afford a home of his own, Palashi in the district of Kanchrapara. He was also engaged once more in Nepal, as adviser, at a \ntime when Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana was faced with some serious family issues. In 1933 Mallik encountered numerous problems, with the finances of Palashi, with the death in the family of a brother involved with the Congress Party and independence politics, and an uncomfortable exit from Kathmandu via a journey on foot before he could find adequate transport to Raxaul on the Indian border. He suffered a breakdown of his physical health.[37]/nAt a low point, Mallik was contacted by Lilian Huss, a Swedish slight acquaintance from his early years in Oxford. In 1936 he voyaged from Kidderpore on the DDG Hansa line cargo steamer SS Neuenfels to Hamburg, where Lilian Huss met him. They went on to Stockholm, where he met Lilian's husband, Harald Axel Huss. He stayed with them, writing to Mary Neighbour from his old Oxford circle.[38]/nMallik returned to Oxford in February 1937, with the support of Lilian Huss in Stockholm, on what was intended to be a visit. He had few resources and no job, but began renewing old relationships, and stayed on.[39]/nRobert Graves was living on Majorca, but arrived in London in the summer of 1937, escaping the Spanish Civil War with Laura Riding.[40]  Riding vetoed further contact with Mallik.[41] Mallik sent as intermediary Ethel Reeves, sister of James Reeves. She made a verbose appeal to Graves which changed nothing.[42] Graves concluded that under the influence of philosophy, an interest that came with his friendship with Mallik, he had written bad poetry.[43] In the first edition of Good-Bye to All That, he expressed the thought that the intense discussions he had had with Mallik and Sam Harries, in particular, had almost led to metaphysics for him driving out poetry. The revision of 1957 omitted this passage and the other mentions of Mallik.[44]/nMallik did meet Radhakrishnan with Kaiser Shumser in London that year, 1937.[45] Alan Collingridge, who was on the council of Morley College, sought out Mallik on his return.[46][47] Mallik gave two public lectures there, in 1942.[48] L. A. G. Strong, a friend of Sydney Lewis from undergraduate days, renewed his acquaintance with Mallik through Winifred Lewis, Sydney's elder sister who became Mallik's biographer.[49] Winifred had heard about Mallik's return from Alexander Vidakovi\u0107, who had met Mallik by chance on The Broad.[50]/nIn rooms on Iffley Road, Mallik wrote his first book, which he had begun in Stockholm. He consulted Radhakrishnan, and drew on discussions in which he had been involved, with the Parichay circle around Sudhindranath Dutta, on Hindu\u2013Islamic relations. Through Radhakrishnan's influence, it was published in 1939 by Allen & Unwin as The Individual and the Group: An Indian Study in Conflict.[51]/nFrom 1942 Mallik lived in a household at 16 Polstead Road, in north Oxford, with supporters including Winifred Lewis, Nora Bolton and Hilda Alden;[52] M. N. Srinivas described meeting Franz Baermann Steiner there, at the \"residence of four or five middle-aged English women and an elderly Indian philosopher\".[53] That year Mallik started to give lectures in Exeter College, for undergraduates studying Greats or Modern Greats (PPE). For two academic years he covered history, and then in 1944/5 logic and theory of knowledge.[54]/nIn autumn 1958 Winifred Lewis, Mallik's long-term companion, took him for a holiday on Dartmoor. After a collapse in health on 23 September, he was admitted to the Acland Nursing Home. He was taken home to Polstead Road in November, and died there on 9 December. Winifred Lewis took his body to Bombay on the P&O steamer SS Pinjarra, arriving 22 January 1959. It went to Varanasi for cremation, and she placed his ashes in the River Ganges.[55]/nInterchange of Selves, a \"dramatic treatise on stoicism\" by Mallik, was rewritten by Robert Graves for publication in his little magazine, The Owl, and appeared in the 1923 final issue, Winter Owl, edited by Graves and William Nicholson. It was then reprinted in 1924, in Mock Beggar Hall.[32][59][60] Graves referred to it as \"An Actionless Drama for Three Actors and a Moving Background\" and gave a dedication to Lady Cecilia Roberts, wife of Charles Henry Roberts and a long-term supporter of Mallik, the mother of Wilfrid Roberts.[61][62] Kersnowski suggests that Graves may have tried to impose on Mallik's work dramatic conventions of Symbolist theatre from a generation earlier.

A good deal of Muslim and Western scholarship has been spent on just pinning down the identities of the Brethren and the century in which they were active./nThe Arabic phrase Ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be (short for, among many possible transcriptions, Ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be wa Khull\u0101n al-Waf\u0101 wa Ahl al-\u1e24amd wa abn\u0101\u02be al-Majd,[6] meaning \"Brethren of Purity, Loyal Friends, People worthy of praise and Sons of Glory\") can be translated as either the \"Brethren of Purity\" or the \"Brethren of Sincerity\"; various scholars such as Ian Netton prefer \"of Purity\" because of the group's ascetic impulses towards purity and salvation./nA suggestion made by Ign\u00e1c Goldziher, and later written about by Philip Khuri Hitti in his History of the Arabs, is that the name is taken from a story in Kalilah waDimnah, in which a group of animals, by acting as faithful friends (ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101\u02be), escape the snares of the hunter. The story concerns a Barbary dove and its companions who get entangled in the net of a hunter seeking birds. Together, they leave themselves and the ensnaring net to a nearby rat, who is gracious enough to gnaw the birds free of the net; impressed by the rat's altruistic deed, a crow becomes the rat's friend. Soon a tortoise and gazelle also join the company of animals. After some time, the gazelle is trapped by another net; with the aid of the others and the good rat, the gazelle is soon freed, but the tortoise fails to leave swiftly enough and is himself captured by the hunter. In the final turn of events, the gazelle repays the tortoise by serving as a decoy and distracting the hunter while the rat and the others free the tortoise. After this, the animals are designated as the \"Ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be\"./nThis story is mentioned as an exemplum when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one ris\u0101la (epistle), a crucial part of their system of ethics that has been summarized thus:/nIn this Brotherhood, self is forgotten; all act by the help of each, all rely upon each for succour and advice, and if a Brother sees it will be good for another that he should sacrifice his life for him, he willingly gives it.[7]/nThe Brethren regularly met on a fixed schedule. The meetings apparently took place on three evenings of each month: once near the beginning, in which speeches were given, another towards the middle, apparently concerning astronomy and astrology, and the third between the end of the month and the 25th of that month; during the third one, they recited hymns with philosophical content.[8] During their meetings and possibly also during the three feasts they held, on the dates of the sun's entry into the Zodiac signs \"Ram, Cancer, and Balance\" (which double as the Vernal Equinox, Summer Solstice, and Autumnal Equinox), beyond the usual lectures and discussions, they would engage in some manner of liturgy reminiscent of the Harranians.[9]/nHierarchy was a major theme in their Encyclopedia, and unsurprisingly, the Brethren loosely divided themselves up into four ranks by age; the age guidelines would not have been firm: for example, such an exemplar of the fourth rank as Jesus would have been too young if the age guidelines were absolute and fixed. Compare the similar division of the Encyclopedia into four sections and the Jabirite symbolism of 4. The ranks were:/nThere have been a number of theories as to the authors of the Brethren. Though some members of the Ikhw\u0101n are known, it is not easy to work out exactly who, or how many, were part of this group of writers. The members referred to themselves as \"sleepers in the cave\" (ras\u0101'il 4, p.\u00a018); a hidden intellectual presence. In one passage they give as their reason for hiding their secrets from the people to be not a fear of earthly violence but a desire to protect their God-given gifts from the world (ras\u0101'il 4, p.\u00a0166). Yet they were well aware that their esoteric teachings might provoke unrest, and the various calamities suffered by the successors of the Prophet may have seemed good reason to remain hidden./nAmong the theories of the origins of the Ikhw\u0101n is that they were Sunnis and that their batini teachings were Sufic in nature. The Ras\u0101'il contains hadith narrated by Aisha, which is something Shia scholars would not do.[11] Susanne Diwald asserts that the Ras\u0101'il is Sufi, thus implying a Sunni character.[12][13] Alessandro Bausani also presented theories of the work being Sunni-Sufi in nature.[13] The Ras\u0101'il contains reference to the Al Khulafa Al-Rashidun,[14] which is associated with Sunni Islam and also contains a passage in it that denounces the Rafidhi, a term used to describe non-Zaydi Shias, including Ismailis.[15] According to Louis Massignon, the Arab-Andalusian scholar Ibn Sab'in has asserted that the Ras\u0101'il has a Sunni-Sufi orientation.[15] According to Palestinian historian Abdul Latif Tibawi, the Ras\u0101'il contains a passage that states that if an ideal Imam dies, then the community can still be governed by consensus (ijma), which is a Sunni concept.[15] According to Tibawi, this idea rejects the Shia concept of continuous leadership based on heredity.[15]/nThe ontology of the Ikhwan is based on Neo-Platonism, linking ideas to a higher reality than sensory things. In line with the Mu'tazilite, they link human free will with God's justice. As evident from The Case of the Animals versus Man, spiritual entities frequently acknowledged by Muslim beliefs, such as angels, jinn, and spirits, function as figures representing Platonic intellects, showing further resemblance to the Mu'tazilite cosmology.[16]/nAmong the Isma'ili groups and missionaries who favored the Encyclopedia, authorship was sometimes ascribed to one or another \"Hidden Imam\"; this theory is recounted in al-Qifti's biographical compendium of philosophers and doctors, the \"Chronicle of the Learned\" (Akhb\u0101r al-Hukam\u0101 or Tabaq\u0101t-al-Hukam\u0101).[17][18][19]/nSome modern scholars have argued for an Ismaili origin to the writings. Ian Richard Netton writes that: \"The Ikhwan's concepts of exegesis of both Quran and Islamic tradition were tinged with the esoterism of the Ismailis.\"[20] According to Yves Marquet, \"It seems indisputable that the Epistles represent the state of Ismaili doctrine at the time of their compositions\".[21] Bernard Lewis was more cautious, ranking the Epistles among books which, though \"closely related to Ismailism\" may not actually have been Ismaili, despite their batini inspiration.[22] Ibn Qifti (d.646/1248), reporting in the 7th/13th century in Tarikh-i Hukama (p.\u00a082) that, \"Opinions differed about the authors of the Epistles. Some people attributed to an Alid Imam, proffering various names, whereas other put forward as author some early Mutazilite theologians.\"[citation needed]/nAmong the Syrian Ismailis, the earliest reference of the Epistles and its relation with the Ismailis is given in \"Kitab Fusul wa'l Akhbar\" by Nurudin bin Ahmad (d. 233/849). Another important work, \"al-Usul wa'l-Ahakam\" by Abul-Ma'ali Hatim bin Imran bin Zuhra (d. 498/1104), writes that, \"These da'is, and other da'is with them, collaborated in composing long Epistles, fifty-two in number, on various branches of learning.\"[23] It implies the Epistles being the product of the joint efforts of the Ismaili da'is.[citation needed]/nAmong the Yemenite traces, the earliest reference of the Epistles is found in the fragments of \"Sirat Ibn Hawshab\" by Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, who writes: \"He (Imam Wafi Ahmed) 8th Imam of Ismaili sect went through many a difficulty and fear and the destruction of his family, whose description cannot be lengthier, until he issued (ansa'a) the Epistles and was contacted by a man called Abu Gafir from among his dais. He charged him with the mission as was necessary and asked him to keep his identity concealed.\" This source not only asserts the connection of the Epistles with the Ismailis, but also indicates that the Imam himself was not the sole author (sahibor mu'allif), but only the issuer or presenter (al-munsi). It suggests that the text of the philosophical deliberations was given a final touching by the Imam, and the approved text was delivered to Abu Gafir to be forwarded possibly to the Ikhwan in Basra secretly. Since the orthodox circles and the ruling power had portrayed a wrong image of Ismailism, the names of the (six) compilers were concealed./nNotwithstanding the uncertainties in the source, the prominent members of the secret association seem to have included Abul Hasan al-Tirmizi, Abdullah bin Mubarak, Abdullah bin Hamdan, Abdullah bin Maymun, Sa'id bin Hussain. The other Yemenite source connecting the Epistles with the Ismailis was the writing of the Tayyibi da'i al-mutlaq Ibrahim ibn al-Husayn al-Hamidi (d. 557/1162), who wrote \"Kanz ul-Walad.\" After him, there followed \"al-Anwar ul-Latifa\" by Muhammad ibn Tahir (d. 584/1188), \"Tanbih al-Ghafilin\" by Hatim ibn Ibrahim al-Hamidi (d. 596/1199), \"Damigh al-Batil wa hatf ul-Munaazil\" by Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid al-Anf (d. 612/1215), \"Risalat al-Waheeda\" by al-Hussayn inn Ali al-Anf (d. 667/1268) and \"Uyun'ul-Akhbar\" by Idris Imad al-Din (d. 872/1468) etc.[citation needed]/nAl-Qifti, however, denigrates this account and instead turns to a comment he discovered, written by Ab\u016b Hayy\u0101n al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b (d. 1023)[17] in his Kit\u0101b al-Imt\u0101' wa'l-Mu'\u0101nasa (written between 983 and 985),[24] a collection of 37 s\u00e9ances at the court of Ibn Sa'd\u0101n, vizier of the Buyid ruler Samsam al-Dawla. Apparently, al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b was close to Zaid ibn Rifa'a, praising his intellect, ability and deep knowledge \u2013 indeed, he had dedicated his Kit\u0101b as-Sadiq wa 'l-Sadaqa to Zaid \u2013 but he was disappointed that Zaid was not orthodox or consistent in his beliefs, and that he was, as Samuel Miklos Stern puts it,/n...frequenting the society of the heretical authors of the Rasa'il Ikhwan as-Safa, whose names are also recorded as follows: Abu Sulaiman Muhammed b.

At-Tauhidi also reports in this connection the opinion expressed by Abu Sulaiman al-Mantiqi, his master, on the Rasa'il and an argument between a certain al-Hariri, another pupil of al-Mantiqi, and Abu Sulaiman al-Maqdisi about the respective roles of Revelation and Philosophy.[25]/nFor many years, this was the only account of the authors' identities, but al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's comments were second-hand evidence and so unsatisfactory; further, the account is incomplete, as Abu Hayyan mentions that there were others besides these 4.[26]/nThis situation lasted until al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's Kit\u0101b al-Imt\u0101' wa'l-Mu'\u0101nasa was published in 1942.[25] This publication substantially supported al-Qifti's work, although al-Qifti apparently toned down the description and prominence of al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's charges that the Brethren were Batiniyya, an esoteric Ismaili sect and thus heretics, possibly so as to not tar his friend Zaid with the same brush./nStern derives a further result from the published text of the Kit\u0101b al-Imt\u0101 wa 'l-Mu'anasa, pointing out that a story al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b ascribes to a personal meeting with Qadi Abu'l-Hasan 'Al\u012b b. H\u0101r\u016bn az-Zanj\u0101ni, the founder of the group, appears in almost identical form in one of the epistles.[27] While neat, Stern's view of things has been challenged by Tibawi, who points out some assumptions and errors Stern has made, such as the relationship between the story in al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's work and the Epistles; Tibawi points out the possibility that the story was instead taken from a third, independent and prior source.[28]/nAl-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's testimony has also been described as thus:/nThe Ikhwan al-Safa' remain an anonymous group of scholars, but when Abu Hayyan al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b was asked about them, he identified some of them: Abu Sulayman al-Busti (known as al-Muqaddasi), 'Ali b. Harun al-Zanjani, Muhammad al-Nahrajuri (or al-Mihrajani), al-'Awfi, and Zayd ibn Rifa'i.[29]/nThe last contemporary source comes from the surviving portions of the Kit\u0101b Siwan al-Hikma (c. 950) by Abu Sulaiman al-Mantiqi (al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b's teacher; 912\u2013985),[30] which was a sort of compendium of biographies; al-Mantiqi is primarily interested in the Brethren's literary techniques of using parables and stories, and so he says only this little before proceeding to give some extracts of the Encyclopedia:/nAb\u016b Sulaim\u0101n al-Maqdis\u012b: He is the author of the fifty-two Epistles inscribed The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren; all of them are full with Ethics and the science of...

Rof\u00e1'ah are the philosophers who compiled the memoirs of the Ikhw\u00e1n al-caf\u00e2, which have been recorded by Moqaddisy.[33]/nHamdani disputes the general abovegoing identifications, pointing out that accounts differ in multiple details, such as whether Zayd was an author or not, whether there was a principal author, and who was in the group or not. He lays particular stress on quotes from the Encyclopedia dating between 954 and 960 in the anonymous (Pseudo-Majriti) work Gh\u0101yat al-Hak\u012bm; al-Maqdisi and al-Zanjani are known to have been active in 983, He finds it implausible they would have written or edited \"so large an encyclopedia at least twenty-five to thirty years earlier, that is, around 343/954 to 348/960, when they would have been very young.\"[32] He explains the al-Tawhidi narrative as being motivated by contemporary politics and issues of hereticism relating to the Qarmatians, and points out that there is proof that Abu Hayyan has fabricated other messages and information.[34]/nAloys Sprenger mentions this in a footnote:/nSince I wrote the first part of this notice I found one of the authors of these memoirs mentioned in the following terms: 'Zayd b. Rofa, one of the authors of the Ikhwan al safa, was extremely ignorant in tradition, and he was a liar without shame.'\"[35]/nThe Ras\u0101\u2019il Ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be (Epistles of the Brethren of Purity) consist of fifty-two treatises in mathematics, natural sciences, psychology (psychical sciences) and theology. The first part, which is on mathematics, groups fourteen epistles that include treatises in arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, geography, and music, along with tracts in elementary logic, inclusive of: the Isagoge, the Categories, De Interpretatione, the Prior Analytics and the Posterior Analytics. The second part, which is on natural sciences, gathers seventeen epistles on matter and form, generation and corruption, metallurgy, meteorology, a study of the essence of nature, the classes of plants and animals, including a fable. The third part, which is on psychology, comprises ten epistles on the psychical and intellective sciences, dealing with the nature of the intellect and the intelligible, the symbolism of temporal cycles, the mystical essence of love, resurrection, causes and effects, definitions and descriptions. The fourth part deals with theology in eleven epistles, investigating the varieties of religious sects, the virtue of the companionship of the Brethren of Purity, the properties of genuine belief, the nature of the Divine Law, the species of politics, and the essence of magic.[36]/nThey define a perfect man in their Ras\u0101'il as \"of East Persian derivation, of Arabic faith, of Iraqi, that is Babylonian, in education, Hebrew in astuteness, a disciple of Christ in conduct, as pious as a Syrian monk, a Greek in natural sciences, an Indian in the interpretation of mysteries and, above all a Sufi or a mystic in his whole spiritual outlook\". There are debates on using this description and other materials of Rasa'il that could help with determination of the identity, affiliation (with Ismaili, Sufism, ...), and other characteristics of Ikhw\u0101n a\u1e63-\u1e62af\u0101\u02be.[37]", "2981393": "Nemesius of Emesa (Greek: \u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f18\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2; Latin: Nemesius Emesenus; fl. c. AD 390) was a Christian philosopher, and the author of a treatise \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 or De natura hominis (\"On Human Nature\"). According to the title of his book, he was the Bishop of Emesa (in present-day Syria). His book is an attempt to compile a system of anthropology from the standpoint of Christian philosophy; it was very influential in later Greek, Arabic and Christian thought./nNemesius was also a physiological theorist. He based much of his writing on previous work of Aristotle and Galen, and it has been speculated that he anticipated William Harvey's discovery of the circulation of blood.[1]\nOther views included a five-theory hierarchy of divine providence. These theories are developed from an earlier Platonic theory./nNemesius was one in a succession of advocates, from Herophilus and Erasistratus onward, of the idea that different cavities of the brain were responsible for different functions.[2] His Doctrine of Ventricle Localisation of Mental Functioning is a reconciliation of Platonic doctrines on the soul with Christian philosophy and also emphasized Greek scientific interpretation and knowledge of the human body./nLittle information is available on Nemesius' life except that he was the bishop of Emesa. Even his date is uncertain, though a rough indication is given by some internal evidence that points to a time after the Apollinarian controversy and before the strife that is connected to Eutyches and Nestorius (the second quarter of the fifth century). There is evidence that supports that he was well read in the writings of Galen and may have had some medical training. What remains very unclear in his writing is the interplay between the Christianity of his published writings and the Hellenism of his education. It is noteworthy that a bishop should be so interested in Hellenistic thought./nNemesius may be the same person as the pagan of the same name to whom Gregory of Nazianzus addressed four letters and a protreptic poem. This Nemesius, a lawyer, was the governor of Cappadocia Secunda around 386\u201387, when Gregory invited him to become a Christian.[3]/nNemesius is best known for his book De natura hominis (\"On Human Nature\" or \"On the Nature of Man\"). Nemesius' book also contains many passages concerning Galenic anatomy and physiology. Establishing that mental faculties are localized in the ventricles of one's brain was the main principles of his work./nNemesius is also well known for his theories of divine providence, a theory that has been debated over the years. It was inspired by Plato. Nemesius considers providence as somewhat of a concern with particulars and those of universals. He states that it is the work of divine providence as the reason why everyone looks different from one another. He states that without divine providence nobody would be recognizable from the other./nThis theory of Nemesius, describes that the structure of the universe is a whole, termed the \"world-soul\" (anima mundi). The world-soul consists of the heavenly gods (the stars, the planets, and the earth). It also includes the immortal, rational parts of the souls of the mortal creatures. He leaves the mortal creation parts of the souls and bodies up to the heavenly gods. The next three theories of divine providence that Nemesius suggests are arranged as a Hierarchy./nThe primary providence is that of the supreme God. It is concerned with the heavens and the rational souls. The secondary providence is recognizable by the influence of heavenly bodies on the order of the coming of perishable things and the preservation of natural things. The tertiary providence in the hierarchy concerns daemons concerning the actions of man./nIn Nemesius' fourth theory of providence he describes that there are certain things that can be attributed neither to mind nor to the nature of things. The mind is concerned with the things that we are responsible, and providence is concerned with those things that we are not responsible for./nNemesius' final theory of providence regards those who say that God is concerned for the continuity of things, but not with the particular of things./nNemesius also contributes a Doctrine of Ventricle Localisation of Mental Functions. This doctrine, as a following of earlier platonic theory, identifies that all sensory perception were received in the anterior area of the brain.  This area is now known as the Lateral-Ventricles.  This area was then later termed the sensus communis and is the region where all sensory perceptions were held in common. These were held by a force identified as the faculty of imagination./nThe middle or also known as the Third Ventricle was termed the region of the faculty of intellect. This is the area that was responsible for controlling the judging, approving, refuting, and assaying of the sensory perceptions which are gathered in the lateral ventricles. The third faculty was identified as memory, and the storehouse of all sensory perceptions after they had been judged by the faculty of intellect. \nNemesius believed that the faculties operated through the agent of an animal spirit produced after it had been carried through a network of arteries. This network was referred as the Rete Mirabile and is located at the base of the brain. Nemesius' doctrine of ventricle localisation of mental functions was greatly acknowledged but was later attacked by Brengarioda Carpi, and then by Vesalius and Varolio in 1543 and 1573./nIn the sixth century, little attention seems to have been paid to De Natura Hominis. Maximus the Confessor is the first writer to quote the work, in his Ambigua (written between 628 and 634). The ecclesiastical writer Anastasios Sinaites incorporated excerpts into his Questions and Answers. Then, in 743 John of Damascus incorporated extensive excerpts in his writing De fide orthodoxa, though without naming Nemesius as the author. This was translated into Latin by Burgundio of Pisa around 1153.[4] The Byzantine author who most used Nemesius' work was the eleventh-century writer Michael Psellos./nFor many subsequent centuries, De natura hominis was attributed to Gregory of Nyssa. This erroneous attribution was common in the Middle Ages in the Syriac, Armenian, Greek and Arabic traditions, as well as in the Latin-speaking scholarly world of the West. So, among others, Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas assumed that Gregory was the author. Gregory's high reputation contributed to the popularity of the work, which is reflected in the number of manuscripts: there are, for example, over one hundred Greek manuscripts known./nDe natura hominis was itself translated into Latin by Alphanus of Salerno around 1080. This translation was used in the twelfth century by scholars such as Adelard of Bath, William of Conches and William of St Thierry, and then by Albert the Great in the thirteenth century. A second Latin translation was made by Burgundio of Pisa around 1165. This was used by Peter Lombard, Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas./nBy these various channels, Nemesius' thought had a great impact on medieval discussions concerning the passions.", "38206995": "Georges Didi-Huberman FBA (born 13 June 1953) is a French philosopher and art historian./nGeorges Didi-Huberman was born on 13 June 1953 in Saint-\u00c9tienne.\nHe has been a scholar at the French Academy in Rome (Villa Medici) and resident in the Berenson Foundation of Villa I Tatti in Florence.\nHe teaches at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, where he has been a lecturer since 1990./nHe is the 2015 recipient of the Adorno Prize./nIn July 2017, Didi-Huberman was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.[1]", "1637909": "Samding Dorje Phagmo/nN\u0101rop\u0101 (Prakrit; Sanskrit: N\u0101rop\u0101da,[1]  Na\u1e0dap\u0101da[2] or Abhayakirti[3]) [4] or Abhayakirti was an Indian Buddhist Mahasiddha.

Newman observes: \"As a rule we must be very skeptical of the miraculously precise dates late Tibetan sources provide for events that occurred hundreds of years earlier in India.\"[13]/nN\u0101rop\u0101da's life story has mainly been represented based upon Tibetan hagiographies (rnam thar), the most detailed of which date to centuries after N\u0101rop\u0101da's lifetime. These hagiographies are filled with miracle stories and they sometimes contradict one another, making the extraction of history from them very difficult. The study of N\u0101rop\u0101da's own writings in their own right \u2013 independent of later Tibetan interpretations \u2013 remains in its infancy. If we follow the Indian tradition, N\u0101rop\u0101da wrote major works on the K\u0101lacakra tantra, something barely noted in the Tibetan hagiographies.[14]/nNaropa was born into a Shunri family of Bengal and was a contemporary of Ati\u015ba. Another account is that he was born into a   Kashmiri brahmin family.[15][16][17] His occupation was selling wood.[18] From an early age showed an independent streak, hoping to follow a career of study and meditation. Succumbing to his parents' wishes, he agreed to an arranged marriage with a young Brahmin girl. After 8 years they both agreed to dissolve their marriage and become ordained. At the age of 28 Naropa entered the famous Buddhist University at Nalanda where he studied both Sutra and Tantra. He gained the reputation of a great scholar and faultless debater, essential at that time as the tradition of debate was such that the loser automatically became a student of the winner. He eventually gained the title \"Guardian of the Northern Gate\", engaged in many debates and taught and won many students./nAccording to his Tibetan namtar, or spiritual biography, one day, while he was studying, a dakini appeared to Naropa and asked if he understood the words of the Dharma, the Buddha's teachings. He replied that he did and when she seemed happy with his response, he added that he also understood their meaning. At this point the dakini burst into tears, stating that he was a great scholar, but also a liar, as the only one who understood the teachings was her brother, Tilopa. On hearing the name \"Tilopa\", he experienced an intense feeling of devotion, and Naropa realised he needed to find the teacher to achieve full realisation. He abandoned his studies and position at the university and set out to find Tilopa. Naropa then underwent what is known as the twelve minor hardships in his quest to find his teacher, all the hardships being hidden teachings on his path to enlightenment. When he finally met Tilopa, he was given the four complete transmission lineages which he then began to practice. While studying and meditating with Tilopa, Naropa had to undergo a further twelve major hardships, trainings to overcome all the obstacles on his path, culminating in his full realisation of mah\u0101mudr\u0101. Naropa spent a total of twelve years with Tilopa. At the bank of the Bagmati river, in the precint of the Pashupatinath Temple, there is the cave where he was initiated by Tilopa and attained Siddhi./nLater in his life Naropa stayed in Phullahari, where he died aged 85. Phullahari or Pullahari was located most likely in eastern Bihar or Bengal.[19]/nOne of the few reliable historical accounts of him comes from a Tibetan translator named Ngatso Lotsawa, who made an effort to visit Naropa at the monastery of Phullahari while waiting to visit with Ati\u015ba at Vikramashila:/nBecause I went alone as an insignificant monk to see the Lord Atisha \u2014\u2014 and because he tarried for a year in Magadha \u2013 I thought I would go see the Lord Naropa, since his reputation was so great. I went east from Magadha for a month, as I had heard that the Lord was staying in the monastery known as Phullahari. Very great merit arose from being able to go see him. On the day I arrived, they said some feudal prince had come to pay homage. So I went to the spot, and a great throne had been erected. I sat right in front of it. The whole crowd started buzzing, \"The Lord is coming!\" I looked and the Lord was physically quite corpulent, with his white hair [stained with henna] bright red, and a vermilion turban on. He was being carried [on a palanquin] by four men, and was chewing betel-leaf. I grabbed his feet and thought, \"I should listen to his pronouncements!\" Stronger and stronger people, though, pushed me further and further from his feet and finally I was tossed out of the crowd. So, there I saw the Lord's face, but did not actually hear his voice.[20]/nNaropa is remembered for his trust and devotion to his teacher, which, according to his biography, enabled him to attain enlightenment in one lifetime./nHe is also remembered as part of the \"Golden Garland\", meaning he is a lineage holder of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism and was considered an accomplished scholar. A great practitioner, Naropa is best known for having collated the Six Dharmas. These practices help achieve Buddhahood more rapidly. Many subsequent Karmapas have been particularly adept at one or more of these practices, which in Vajrayana tradition are held to have been given by the Buddha and were passed on through an unbroken lineage via Tilopa to Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa and on to the present day./nNaropa is considered one of the eighty-four mahasiddhas, the 'saints' of Vajrayana.

He authored Thoughts on Political Economy (1820)[1] and The Elements of Political Economy (1823).[2][3]/nHe theorized that \"labor creates wealth,\" which may have been an improvement based on the thinking of Adam Smith of Europe.  He thought that the economy of England was actually the economy of the higher-ranking members of that society and not the economy of the entire nation. He held that wealth is not an aggregation of exchange values, as Adam Smith had conceived it, but the capacity or the opportunity to acquire the necessaries and conveniences of life by labor./nHe systematized the infant industry argument.[4]/nIn 1845, he wrote a book entitled 'The Elements of Constitutional Law' which included basic definitions of a government, a sovereign state, a confederacy and a constitution. While these concepts have evolved, much of the basic theories which he outlined still have relevance in modern political analysis.[5]/nHis writings affected political developments in the United States.[6]/nIn his Elements on Political Economy, he represents himself as a protectionist. In Book II  Chapter Nine, Of Protecting Duties, he says that protectionism is aligned with national interests and the government should put national interests ahead of individual interests. To Raymond, national interests are never in harmony with individual interests. The protective tariff represents national interests, Raymond conveys, and the advantage of protective tariffs is the leverage of a nation and the special treatment over foreigners in the nation's domestic commerce and industry of the nation./nHis policy was opposed by Adam Smith. Raymond believed national interests are monumental and trump individual interests. To Raymond, defending national interests over individual interests was like military strategy. He stated that the primordial perspective is that the army is one and the general the commander. Subordinate troops are not allowed to have the privileges of power or concerns or pursuits that directly oppose the general prosperity of the military unit./nHe then conveys that the principle that I  political economy, no private interest or right may have authority over the general interest of the country, and if a political economy does not acknowledge that principle, it will forever remain in a dismal state./nRaymond also expounded on his government philosophy. For him, the public good is above all forms of citizens, property, and individual rights. Government can seize private land and lay and collect taxes only in the name of the general good. The government has the right to take away land to use it for internal improvements or infrastructure. In addition, government has the prerogative and the absolute right to establish regulations for property or trade that benefits the general good. Raymond states that protectionism is vehemently opposed to laissez-faire./nIn Book II, Chapter VIII, \"Monopolies and Colonial Systems,\" Raymond wrote, \"There is no hardship or injustice, in excluding foreign nations from a participation in our domestic trade, but there would be a very great hardship, as well as injustice, in excluding any portion of our own citizens from a participation in it.\"/nIn Book I, Chapter XVII, Raymond considered the labor that laissez-faire advocates like not to be worthwhile to civilization. Protectionists understand what is a useful pursuit and what is a blight. Raymond stated that a destructive occupation is a detriment to civilization and that a pursuit fails to help society if it has no ability to increase the standards of the requirements and conveniences of life or to foster the joy and happiness of the society./nAlso, he said that when poets, painters and musicians cease to produce innocent enjoyments, they become uncongenial and unproductive. However, he considered the best example of an occupation that never suited society well to be the speculator and the stock-jobber (stock broker): \"The object of those employed in these occupations, is not to produce any of the necessaries and comforts of life. Different persons may have other opinions of the moral character of these occupations, but all must agree that they are useless, and unproductive to the community.\"/nHe then finished the chapter by stating the duties of man and government: each man must endeavor to foster the longevity of civilization, and no man has the warranted right to be a mindless being, by using his time repugnantly or by engaging in uncongenial pursuit./nFor him, government is an imperative and a paramount concern to stifle all occupations that are grotesque and a blight to mankind and, as much as possible, not to facilitate them.[7]", "51805727": "Eduard Alberti (11 March 1827 \u2013 28 February 1898) was a German literary historian and philosopher.

He was an advocate of legal positivism and is known for his conception of perfectionist liberalism. Raz spent most of his career as a professor of philosophy of law at Balliol College, Oxford, and was latterly a part-time professor of law at Columbia University Law School and a part-time professor at King's College London.[1]  He received the Tang Prize in Rule of Law in 2018./nJoseph Zaltsman was born on 21 March 1939 in Haifa (then in Mandatory Palestine) to Sonya and Shmuel Zaltsman.[2] He graduated in 1963 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Magister Juris, summa cum laude. Also in 1963, he changed his surname to Raz.[2] Later, with funds provided by the Hebrew University, Raz pursued a doctorate at the University of Oxford under the supervision of H. L. A. Hart. Raz had met Hart earlier at a conference in Israel, impressing him by pointing out a flaw in his reasoning that had previously eluded him; Hart encouraged him to go to Oxford for further study. Raz studied at Balliol College and completed his Doctor of Philosophy in 1967./nAfter completing his PhD, Raz returned to Israel to teach at the Hebrew University as a lecturer in the faculty of law and department of philosophy. In 1971, he was given tenure and promoted to senior lecturer. In 1972, he returned to Balliol as a fellow and tutor in law, becoming a professor of philosophy of law, Oxford University, from 1985 to 2006, and then a research professor from 2006 to 2009. In 2002, he also became a professor at Columbia Law School in New York and starting in 2011 was a research professor of law at King's College London.[1][3]/nRaz died on 2 May 2022 at Charing Cross Hospital in his sleep. The Oxford Law Faculty called him \"one of the last remaining giants of jurisprudence and philosophy\".[4][5]/nRaz's first book, The Concept of a Legal System, was based on his doctoral thesis.  A later book, The Morality of Freedom, won two prizes: the 1987 W. J. M. Mackenzie Book Prize from the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, awarded to the best book in political science each calendar year; and the 1988 Elaine and David Spitz Book Prize from the Conference for the Study of Political Thought, New York, awarded annually for the best book in liberal and/or democratic theory that had been published two years earlier. The book develops a conception of perfectionist liberalism./nIn defending his conception of perfectionist liberalism, Raz argues that political institutions are justified by virtue of their contribution to persons' well-being. He argues that a person's well-being depends on ability to pursue personal goals.[6] However, in Raz's view, well-being does not occur upon achievement of any self-set goal. Rather, in David McCabe's words, \"successful pursuit of objectively valuable goals\" produces well-being according to Raz.[7]/nRaz's argument for perfectionist liberalism follows from this view of well-being combined with two other premises. First, that human goals\u2014and, therefore, human well-being\u2014are conceived through, and depend on, what McCabe calls \"social forms\". Social forms are ways of being and acting that are developed socially and make sense only in the context of a given society. For example, one can only understand the social roles of a physician, friend, or parent by considering the rights and obligations that attach to that role in a social context.[8]/nThe second premise of the argument is that people need autonomy to occupy many social forms in liberal societies and achieve the goals that these social forms set out. Thus, a person must be autonomous to achieve the goals set by the social forms in a liberal society. Combined with Raz's view that political institutions are justified by virtue of their contribution to well-being and his argument that well-being, for humans, depends on social forms, his claim about autonomy shows that autonomy is necessary for well-being wherever social forms require autonomy. If liberal societies' social forms require autonomy, then liberal societies should support autonomy.[9]/nA pupil of H. L. A. Hart, Raz was important in continuing the development of legal positivism both before and since Hart's death. Raz was also co-editor of a second edition of Hart's The Concept of Law with a postscript including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work./nRaz argued for a distinctive understanding of legal commands as exclusionary reasons for action and for the \"service conception\" of authority, according to which those subject to an authority \"can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their existence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very same issues which the authority is there to settle\".[10] This, in turn, supports Raz's argument for legal positivism\u2014in particular \"the sources thesis\", \"the idea that an adequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral arguments\".[10]/nRaz was acknowledged by his contemporaries as being one of the most important legal philosophers of his generation. He authored and edited twelve books, namely The Concept of a Legal System (1970), Practical Reason and Norms (1975), The Authority of Law (1979), The Morality of Freedom (1986), Authority (1990), Ethics in the Public Domain (1994), Engaging Reason (1999), Value, Respect and Attachment (2001), The Practice of Value (2003), Between Authority and Interpretation (2009), From Normativity to Responsibility (2011) and The Roots of Normativity (2022). His most recent work deals less with legal theory and more with political philosophy and practical reasoning. In moral theory, Raz defended value pluralism and the idea that various values are incommensurable./nRaz's work has been cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in such cases as British Columbia v Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd and Sauv\u00e9 v Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)./nSeveral of Raz's students became legal and moral philosophers, including two current professors in jurisprudence at Oxford, Leslie Green and Timothy Endicott, and the former professor of jurisprudence John Gardner./nRaz was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1987[11] and of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1992.[12] He was awarded honorary doctorates by the Catholic University of Brussels, 1993, by King's College London, 2009, and by Hebrew University, 2014.

He was considered an original thinker by many of his contemporaries within the Lutheran tradition, and his first book, commonly known as Aurora, caused a great scandal. In contemporary English, his name may be spelled Jacob Boehme (retaining the older German spelling); in seventeenth-century England it was also spelled Behmen, approximating the contemporary English pronunciation of the German B\u00f6hme./nB\u00f6hme had a profound influence on later philosophical movements such as German idealism and German Romanticism.[3] Hegel described B\u00f6hme as \"the first German philosopher\"./nB\u00f6hme was born on 24 April 1575[4][5] at Alt Seidenberg (now Stary Zawid\u00f3w, Poland), a village near G\u00f6rlitz in Upper Lusatia, a territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia. His father, George Wissen, was Lutheran, reasonably wealthy, but a peasant nonetheless. B\u00f6hme was the fourth of five children. B\u00f6hme's first job was that of a herd boy.  He was deemed to be not strong enough for husbandry. When he was 14 years old, he was sent to Seidenberg, as an apprentice to become a shoemaker.[6] His apprenticeship for shoemaking was hard; he lived with a family who were not Christians, which exposed him to the controversies of the time. He regularly prayed and read the Bible as well as works by visionaries such as Paracelsus, Weigel and Schwenckfeld, although he received no formal education.[7] After three years as an apprentice, B\u00f6hme left to travel. Although it is unknown just how far he went, he went at least as far as G\u00f6rlitz.[6] In 1592 B\u00f6hme returned from his journeyman years. By 1599, B\u00f6hme was master of his craft with his own premises in G\u00f6rlitz. That same year he married Katharina, daughter of Hans Kuntzschmann, a butcher in G\u00f6rlitz, and together he and Katharina had four sons and two daughters.[7][8]/nB\u00f6hme's mentor was Abraham Behem who corresponded with Valentin Weigel. B\u00f6hme joined the \"Conventicle of God's Real Servants\" - a parochial study group organized by Martin Moller. B\u00f6hme had a number of mystical experiences throughout his youth, culminating in a vision in 1600 as one day he focused his attention onto the exquisite beauty of a beam of sunlight reflected in a pewter dish. He believed this vision revealed to him the spiritual structure of the world, as well as the relationship between God and man, and good and evil. At the time he chose not to speak of this experience openly, preferring instead to continue his work and raise a family.[citation needed]/nIn 1610 B\u00f6hme experienced another inner vision in which he further understood the unity of the cosmos and that he had received a special vocation from God.[citation needed]/nThe shop in G\u00f6rlitz, which was sold in 1613, had allowed B\u00f6hme to buy a house in 1610 and to finish paying for it in 1618. Having given up shoemaking in 1613, B\u00f6hme sold woollen gloves for a while, which caused him to regularly visit Prague to sell his wares.[6]/nTwelve years after the vision in 1600, B\u00f6hme began to write his first book, Morgenr\u00f6te im Aufgang (\"Dawn of the Day in the East\"). The book was given the name Aurora (sometimes translated into English as \"The Day-spring\") by a friend. B\u00f6hme originally wrote the book for himself and it was never completed.[10] A manuscript copy of the unfinished work was lent to Karl von Ender, a nobleman, who had copies made and began to circulate them. A copy fell into the hands of Gregorius Richter\u00a0[de], the chief pastor of G\u00f6rlitz, who attacked it as being heretical,[why?] speaking against it from the pulpit, and threatened B\u00f6hme with exile if he continued working on it. Richter also wrote a pamphlet denouncing B\u00f6hme and his work.[11]/nAs a result, B\u00f6hme did not write anything for several years; however, at the insistence of friends who had read Aurora, he started writing again in 1618. In 1619 B\u00f6hme wrote De Tribus Principiis or The Three Principles of the Divine Essence. It took him two years to finish his second book, which was followed by many other treatises, all of which were copied by hand and circulated only among friends.[12]} In 1620 B\u00f6hme wrote The Threefold Life of Man, Answers to Forty Questions on the Soul, The Incarnation of Jesus Christ, The Six Theosophical Points, The Six Mystical Points, the Mysterium Pansophicum and Informatorium novissimorum (Of the Last Times). In 1621 B\u00f6hme wrote De Signatura Rerum (relying in part on the doctrine of signatures). In 1623 B\u00f6hme wrote On Election to Grace, On Christ's Testaments, Mysterium Magnum, Clavis (\"Key\"). The year 1622 saw B\u00f6hme write some short works all of which were subsequently included in his first published book on New Year's Day 1624, under the title Weg zu Christo (The Way to Christ).[8]/nThe publication caused another scandal and following complaints by the clergy, B\u00f6hme was summoned to the Town Council on 26 March 1624. The report of the meeting was that:/nJacob Boehme, the shoemaker and rabid enthusiast, declares that he has written his book To Eternal Life, but did not cause the same to be printed. A nobleman, Sigismund von Schweinitz, did that. The Council gave him warning to leave the town; otherwise the Prince Elector would be apprised of the facts. He thereupon promised that he would shortly take himself off.[13]/nB\u00f6hme left for Dresden on 8 or 9 May 1624, where he stayed with the court physician for two months.  In Dresden he was accepted by the nobility and high clergy. His intellect was also recognized by the professors of Dresden, who in a hearing in May 1624, encouraged B\u00f6hme to go home to his family in G\u00f6rlitz.[7] During B\u00f6hme's absence his family had suffered due to the Thirty Years' War.[7]/nOnce home, B\u00f6hme accepted an invitation to stay with Herr von Schweinitz, who had a country-seat. While there B\u00f6hme began to write his last book, the 177 Theosophic Questions. B\u00f6hme fell terminally ill with a bowel complaint forcing him to travel home on 7 November. Gregorius Richter, B\u00f6hme's adversary from G\u00f6rlitz, had died in August 1624, while B\u00f6hme was away.  The new clergy, still wary of B\u00f6hme, forced him to answer a long list of questions when he wanted to receive the sacrament. He died on 17 November 1624.[15]/nIn this short period, B\u00f6hme produced an enormous amount of writing, including his major works De Signatura Rerum (The Signature of All Things) and Mysterium Magnum.  He also developed a following throughout Europe, where his followers were known as Behmenists./nThe son of B\u00f6hme's chief antagonist, the pastor primarius of G\u00f6rlitz  Gregorius Richter, edited a collection of extracts from his writings, which were afterwards published complete at Amsterdam with the help of Coenraad van Beuningen in the year 1682. B\u00f6hme's full works were first printed in 1730./nThe chief concern of B\u00f6hme's writing was the nature of sin, evil and redemption. Consistent with Lutheran theology, B\u00f6hme preached that humanity had fallen from a state of divine grace to a state of sin and suffering, that the forces of evil included fallen angels who had rebelled against God, and that God's goal was to restore the world to a state of grace.[citation needed]/nThere are some serious departures from accepted Lutheran theology, such as his rejection of justification by faith alone, as in this passage from The Way to Christ:/nFor he that will say, I have a Will, and would willingly do Good, but the earthly Flesh which I carry about me, keepeth me back, so that I cannot; yet I shall be saved by Grace, for the Merits of Christ. I comfort myself with his Merit and Sufferings; who will receive me of mere Grace, without any Merits of my own, and forgive me my Sins. Such a one, I say, is like a Man that knoweth what Food is good for his Health, yet will not eat of it, but eateth Poison instead thereof, from whence Sickness and Death, will certainly follow.[16]/nAnother place where B\u00f6hme may depart from accepted theology (though this was open to question due to his somewhat obscure, oracular style) was in his description of the Fall as a necessary stage in the evolution of the Universe.[17] A difficulty with his theology is the fact that he had a mystical vision, which he reinterpreted and reformulated.[17] According to F. von Ingen, to B\u00f6hme, in order to reach God, man has to go through hell first. God exists without time or space, he regenerates himself through eternity. B\u00f6hme restates the trinity as truly existing but with a novel interpretation. God, the Father is fire, who gives birth to his son, whom B\u00f6hme calls light. The Holy Spirit is the living principle, or the divine life.[18]/nIt is clear that B\u00f6hme never claimed that God sees evil as desirable, necessary or as part of divine will to bring forth good. In his Threefold Life, B\u00f6hme states: \"[I]n the order of nature, an evil thing cannot produce a good thing out of itself, but one evil thing generates another.\"  B\u00f6hme did not believe that there is any \"divine mandate or metaphysically inherent necessity for evil and its effects in the scheme of things.\"[19] Dr. John Pordage, a commentator on B\u00f6hme, wrote that B\u00f6hme \"whensoever he attributes evil to eternal nature considers it in its fallen state, as it became infected by the fall of Lucifer... .\"[19] Evil is seen as \"the disorder, rebellion, perversion of making spirit nature's servant\",[20] which is to say a perversion of initial Divine order./nB\u00f6hme's correspondences in Aurora of the seven qualities, planets and humoral-elemental associations:/nIn \"De Tribus Principiis\" or \"On the Three Principles of Divine Being\" B\u00f6hme subsumed the seven principles into the Trinity:/nIn one interpretation of B\u00f6hme's cosmology, it was necessary for humanity to return to God, and for all original unities to undergo differentiation, desire and conflict\u2014as in the rebellion of Satan, the separation of Eve from Adam and their acquisition of the knowledge of good and evil\u2014in order for creation to evolve to a new state of redeemed harmony that would be more perfect than the original state of innocence, allowing God to achieve a new self-awareness by interacting with a creation that was both part of, and distinct from, Himself. Free will becomes the most important gift God gives to humanity, allowing us to seek divine grace as a deliberate choice while still allowing us to remain individuals.[citation needed]/nB\u00f6hme believed that the Son of God became human through the Virgin Mary. Before the birth of Christ, God recognized himself as a virgin. This virgin is therefore a mirror of God's wisdom and knowledge.[18] B\u00f6hme follows Luther in that he views Mary within the context of Christ. Unlike Luther, he does not address himself to dogmatic issues very much, but to the human side of Mary. Like all other women, she was human and therefore subject to sin. Only after God elected her with his grace to become the mother of his son, did she inherit the status of sinlessness.[18] Mary did not move the Word, the Word moved Mary, so B\u00f6hme, explaining that all her grace came from Christ. Mary is \"blessed among women\" but not because of her qualifications, but because of her humility. Mary is an instrument of God; an example of what God can do: It shall not be forgotten in all eternity, that God became human in her.[21]/nB\u00f6hme, unlike Luther, did not believe that Mary was the Ever Virgin. Her virginity after the birth of Jesus is unrealistic to B\u00f6hme. The true salvation is Christ, not Mary. The importance of Mary, a human like every one of us, is that she gave birth to Jesus Christ as a human being. If Mary had not been human, according to B\u00f6hme, Christ would be a stranger and not our brother. Christ must grow in us as he did in Mary. She became blessed by accepting Christ. In a reborn Christian, as in Mary, all that is temporal disappears and only the heavenly part remains for all eternity. B\u00f6hme's peculiar theological language, involving fire, light and spirit, which permeates his theology and Marian views, does not distract much from the fact that his basic positions are Lutheran.[21]/nB\u00f6hme's writing shows the influence of Neoplatonist and alchemical[a] writers such as Paracelsus, while remaining firmly within a Christian tradition. He has in turn greatly influenced many anti-authoritarian and mystical movements, such as Radical Pietism[22][23][24][25][26][27] (including the Ephrata Cloister[28] and Society of the Woman in the Wilderness), the Religious Society of Friends, the Philadelphians, the Gichtelians, the Harmony Society, the Zoarite Separatists, Rosicrucianism, Martinism and Christian theosophy. B\u00f6hme's disciple and mentor, the Liegnitz physician Balthasar Walther, who had travelled to the Holy Land in search of magical, kabbalistic and alchemical wisdom, also introduced kabbalistic ideas into B\u00f6hme's thought.[29] B\u00f6hme was also an important source of German Romantic philosophy, influencing Schelling in particular.[30] In Richard Bucke's 1901 treatise Cosmic Consciousness, special attention was given to the profundity of B\u00f6hme's spiritual enlightenment, which seemed to reveal to B\u00f6hme an ultimate nondifference, or nonduality, between human beings and God. Jakob B\u00f6hme's writings also had some influence on the modern theosophical movement of the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge wrote about Jakob B\u00f6hme's philosophy.[31][32] B\u00f6hme was also an important influence on the ideas of Franz Hartmann, the founder in 1886 of the German branch of the Theosophical Society. Hartmann described the writings of B\u00f6hme as \u201cthe most valuable and useful treasure in spiritual literature.\u201d[33]/nI do not write in the pagan manner, but in the theosophical./n\u2014 Jacob Boehme[34]/nBehmenism, also Behemenism or Boehmenism, is the English-language designation for a 17th-century European Christian movement based on the teachings of German mystic and theosopher Jakob B\u00f6hme (1575-1624). The term was not usually applied by followers of B\u00f6hme's theosophy to themselves, but rather was used by some opponents of B\u00f6hme's thought as a polemical term. The origins of the term date back to the German literature of the 1620s, when opponents of B\u00f6hme's thought, such as the Thuringian antinomian Esajas Stiefel, the Lutheran theologian Peter Widmann and others denounced the writings of B\u00f6hme and the B\u00f6hmisten. When his writings began to appear in England in the 1640s, B\u00f6hme's surname was irretrievably corrupted to the form \"Behmen\" or \"Behemen\", whence the term \"Behmenism\" developed.[b] A follower of B\u00f6hme's theosophy is a \"Behmenist\"./nBehmenism does not describe the beliefs of any single formal religious sect, but instead designates a more general description of B\u00f6hme's interpretation of Christianity, when used as a source of devotional inspiration by a variety of groups. B\u00f6hme's views greatly influenced many anti-authoritarian and Christian mystical movements, such as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), the Philadelphians,[35] the Gichtelians, the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius), the Ephrata Cloister, the Harmony Society, Martinism, and Christian theosophy. B\u00f6hme was also an important source of German Romantic philosophy, influencing Schelling and Franz von Baader in particular.[30] In Richard Bucke's 1901 treatise Cosmic Consciousness, special attention was given to the profundity of B\u00f6hme's spiritual enlightenment, which seemed to reveal to B\u00f6hme an ultimate nondifference, or nonduality, between human beings and God. B\u00f6hme is also an important influence on the ideas of the English Romantic poet, artist and mystic William Blake. After having seen the William Law edition of the works of Jakob B\u00f6hme, published between 1764 and 1781, in which some illustrations had been included by the German early B\u00f6hme exegetist Dionysius Andreas Freher (1649\u20131728), William Blake said during a dinner party in 1825 \"Michel Angelo could not have surpassed them\".[36]/nDespite being based on a corrupted form of B\u00f6hme's surname, the term Behmenism has retained a certain utility in modern English-language historiography, where it is still occasionally employed, although often to designate specifically English followers of B\u00f6hme's theosophy.[c] Given the transnational nature of B\u00f6hme's influence, the term at least implies manifold international connections between Behmenists.[37] In any case, the term is preferred to clumsier variants such as \"B\u00f6hmeianism\" or \"B\u00f6hmism\", although these may also be encountered./nIn addition to the scientific revolution, the 17th century was a time of mystical revolution in Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism. The Protestant revolution developed from B\u00f6hme and some medieval mystics. B\u00f6hme became important in intellectual circles in Protestant Europe, following from the publication of his books in England, Holland and Germany in the 1640s and 1650s.[38] B\u00f6hme was especially important for the Millenarians and was taken seriously by the Cambridge Platonists and Dutch Collegiants. Henry More was critical of B\u00f6hme and claimed he was not a real prophet, and had no exceptional insight into metaphysical questions. Overall, although his writings did not influence political or religious debates in England, his influence can be seen in more esoteric forms such as on alchemical experimentation, metaphysical speculation and spiritual contemplation, as well as utopian literature and the development of neologisms.[d] More, for example, dismissed Opera Posthuma by Spinoza as a return to Behmenism.[40]/nWhile B\u00f6hme was famous in Holland, England, France, Denmark and America during the 17th century, he became less influential during the 18th century. A revival occurred late in that century with interest from German Romantics, who considered B\u00f6hme a forerunner to the movement. Poets such as John Milton, Ludwig Tieck, Novalis, William Blake[41] and W. B. Yeats[42] found inspiration in B\u00f6hme's writings. Coleridge, in his Biographia Literaria, speaks of B\u00f6hme with admiration. B\u00f6hme was highly thought of by the German philosophers Baader, Schelling and Schopenhauer. Hegel went as far as to say that B\u00f6hme was \"the first German philosopher\".[43] Danish Bishop Hans Lassen Martensen published a book about B\u00f6hme.[44]/nSeveral authors have found Boehme's description of the three original Principles and the seven Spirits to be similar to the Law of Three and the Law of Seven described in the works of Boris Mouravieff and George Gurdjieff.[45][46]/nIn 2022, Jacob Boehme was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar along with Johann Arndt with a feast day on 11 May.[47]/nCormac McCarthy's 1985 novel Blood Meridian includes three epigraphs, the second of which comes from Jacob Boehme: \"It is not to be thought that the life of darkness is sunk in misery and lost as if in sorrowing. There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of the darkness.\"[48]/nThe Life and Legacy of Jacob Boehme.

He was a connoisseur of esoteric doctrines and a scholar of Eastern and Western mysticism./nZolla was born in Turin to a cosmopolitan family. His father was the painter Venanzio Zolla (1880\u20131961), born in England of Lombard father and an Alsatian mother.  His mother was Blanche Smith (1885\u20131951) a British musician, originally of Kent. Zolla spent his childhood between Paris, London, and Turin, speaking English, French, and Italian, while studying German and Spanish./nAt age 22, he became ill with tuberculosis. During this illness he wrote a novel, Minuetto all'inferno [Minuet in Hell], published in 1956, which won the Strega Prize for a debut work. In 1957, he moved to Rome, where he worked in the drafting of Tempo presente [This Time]. In 1959, he published the essay Eclissi dell'intellettuale, an unconventional work in which, starting from a critique of mass society based on the analysis of Adorno and Horkheimer, also took a stand against political and cultural lobbies and progressive conformism./nIn 1958, after ten years of engagement, he married the poet Maria Luisa Spaziani, but the marriage cracked almost immediately. From 1959, he was tied to the writer Cristina Campo (born Victoria Guerrini), with whom he lived until her death in 1977. In 1980, he married Grazia Marchian\u00f2, an orientalist and student of aesthetics./nIn 1960, through the intervention of Mario Praz, he obtained a post in Language and Anglo-American Literature at the University of Rome. His lectures were attended by, among others, the young Roberto Calasso. From 1967, he taught as a Professor at University of Catania, then to Genoa (where he also taught Germanic Philology) and, from 1974, back to Rome./nFrom 1966 to 1968, he was secretary general of the Istituto Accademico di Roma and, from 1970 to 1973, was director of Istituto Ticinese di Alti Studi in Lugano./nIn 1968, after a trip to the Southwestern United States, he wrote a history of the image of the Indian in American literature, I letterati e lo sciamano [The Scholar and The Shaman]. In later years he devoted himself to travel in India, Indonesia, China, Korea, and especially in Iran, which gave ample information in the book Aure./nIn January 1969, he founded the magazine Conoscenza Religiosa [Religious Knowledge] (published by Nuova Italia), which he directed until 1983. It featured writings by intellectuals such as AJ Heschel, Jean Servier, Henry Corbin, Cristina Campo, Quirino Principe, Guido Ceronetti, Peter Citati, Sergio Quinzio, Margarete Riemschneider, Jorge Luis Borges, Hossein Nasr, Leo Schaya, Eugenio Montale, Giuseppe Dale, and Rosario Assunto. There were also published essays by Marcel Griaule./nIn 1970, he wrote a controversial introduction to the first edition of The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien. In 1974, he presented the first global translation (by Peter Modesto) of the monumental work The Pillar and Ground of the Truth by the philosopher and mystic Russian Pavel Alexandrovich Florensky./nAs a preface author and critic, Zolla wrote about Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu, the Upanishads, The Imitation of Christ, Richard Rolle, Ioan Petru Culianu, Mircea Eliade, Thomas Mann, Marquis de Sade, Kafka, James Joyce, Emily Dickinson, Herman Melville (and oversaw a translation part of the poem Clarel), Nathaniel Hawthorne, Margery Kempe, F.

In later life Adams held satsang with a small group of devotees in California, US.[1] He mainly advocated the path of j\u00f1\u0101na yoga[note 1] with an emphasis on the practice of self-enquiry.[2] Adams' teachings were not well known in his lifetime, but have since been widely circulated amongst those investigating the philosophy of Advaita and the Western devotees of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.[3][note 2] A book of his teachings, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams, was published in 1999./nRobert Adams was born on January 21, 1928, in Manhattan[4] and grew up in New York City, USA.[5] Adams claimed that from as far back as he could remember, he had had visions of a white haired, bearded man seated at the foot of his bed, who was about two feet tall, and who used to talk to him in a language which he did not understand.[6] He told his parents but they thought he was playing games. He would later find out that this man was a vision of his future guru Sri Ramana Maharshi. At the age of seven, Adams's father died and the visitations suddenly stopped.[4]/nAdams said that he then developed a siddhi whereby whenever he wanted something, from a candy bar to a violin, all he needed to do was say the name of the object three times and the desired object would appear from somewhere, or be given to him by someone.[7] If there was a test at school, Adams would simply say 'God, God, God' and the answers would immediately come to him; no prior study was necessary.[4]/nAdams claimed to have had a profound spiritual awakening at the age of fourteen. It was the end of term finals maths test[1] and Adams had not studied for it at all. As was his custom he said 'God' three times, but with a phenomenal and unintended outcome:[7]/nInstead of the answers coming, the room filled with light, a thousand times more brilliant than the sun. It was like an atomic bomb, but it was not a burning light. It was a beautiful, bright, shining, warm glow. Just thinking of it now makes me stop and wonder. The whole room, everybody, everything was immersed in light. All the children seemed to be myriads particles of light. I found myself melting into radiant being, into consciousness. I merged into consciousness. It was not an out of body experience. This was completely different. I realised that I was not my body. What appeared to be my body was not real. I went beyond the light into pure radiant consciousness. I became omnipresent. My individuality had merged into pure absolute bliss. I expanded. I became the universe. The feeling is indescribable. It was total bliss, total joy. The next thing I remembered was the teacher shaking me. All the students had gone. I was the only one left in the class. I returned to human consciousness. That feeling has never left me.[4]/nNot long after this experience, Adams went to the school library to do a book report. While passing through the philosophy section he came across a book on yoga masters. Having no idea what yoga was, he opened the book and for the first time saw a photo of the man he had experienced visions of as a young child, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi.[4]/nAt the age of 16, Adams' first spiritual mentor was Joel S. Goldsmith, a Christian mystic from New York,[8] whom he used to visit in Manhattan, in order to listen to his sermons. Goldsmith helped Adams to better understand his enlightenment and advised him to go and see Paramahansa Yogananda. Adams did so and visited Yogananda at the Self-Realization Fellowship in Encinitas, California, where he intended to be initiated as a monk.[8] However, after speaking to him, Yogananda felt that Adams had his own path and should go to India.[6] He told him that his satguru was Sri Ramana Maharshi and that he should go to him as soon as possible because Ramana Maharshi's body was old and in ill-health. Sri Ramana Maharshi lived at Sri Ramanasramam at the foot of Arunachala in Tamil Nadu, South India.[8]/nWith $14,000 of inheritance money from a recently deceased aunt, Adams set off for India and his guru Sri Ramana Maharshi in 1946:[1]/nWhen I was eighteen years old, I arrived at Tiruvannamalai. In those days they didn\u2019t have jet planes. It was a propeller plane. I purchased flowers and a bag of fruit to bring to Ramana. I took the rickshaw to the ashram. It was about 8:30 a.m. I entered the hall and there was Ramana on his couch reading his mail. It was after breakfast. I brought the fruit and the flowers over and laid them at his feet. There was a guardrail in front of him to prevent fanatics from attacking him with love. And then I sat down in front of him. He looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back. I have been to many teachers, many saints, many sages. I was with Nisargadatta, Anandamayi Ma, Papa Ramdas, Neem Karoli Baba and many others, but never did I meet anyone who exuded such compassion, such love, such bliss as Ramana Maharshi.[web 1]/nAdams stayed at Sri Ramanasramam for the final three years of Sri Ramana Maharshi's life.[9][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Over the course of this time he had many conversations with Sri Ramana Maharshi, and through abiding in his presence was able to confirm and further understand his own experience of awakening to the non-dual Self.[8] In the first of these conversations, Ramana Maharshi told Adams they had been together in a previous life.[10] After Sri Ramana Maharshi left the body in 1950 Adams spent a further seventeen years travelling around India[note 3] and stayed with well known gurus such as Nisargadatta Maharaj,[note 4] Anandamayi Ma, Neem Karoli Baba and Swami Ramdas to name but a few. He also spent time with less well-known teachers such as Swami Brahmadanda \"the Staff of God\" in the holy city of Varanasi.[12]/nIn the late 1960s, Adams returned to the United States and lived in Hawaii and Los Angeles before finally moving to Sedona, Arizona[13] in the mid 1990s.[note 5] He was married to Nicole Adams and fathered two daughters. In the 1980s Adams developed Parkinson's disease,[15] which forced him to settle in one location and receive the appropriate care.[12] A small group of devotees soon grew up around him and in the early 1990s he gave weekly satsangs in the San Fernando Valley, along with other surrounding areas of Los Angeles.[1] These satsangs were both recorded and transcribed.[16] After several years of deteriorating health, Adams died on March 2, 1997[1] in Sedona, Arizona, where he was surrounded by family members and devotees. He died at the age of 69 from cancer of the liver.[17]/nNone of Robert Adams claims of visiting India or Ramana Ashram have ever been verified by anyone except himself. His claims of living in Arthur Osborne's house have been questioned by Katya Osborne and Michael James and found to be likely made up.[18] Also Ramana Ashram's The Mountain Path has concluded Robert Adams was never there:[19]/nThere is the curious case of a Robert Adams, an American guru who asserted that he was at Sri Ramanasramam between 1947-8 and 1952 (the dates vary in his conversations) and that he moved closely with Bhagavan. Until such time as there appears objective, verifiable evidence to substantiate this claim, we cannot but come to the conclusion that his account is unreliable./nHis claim to remember crib age experiences is regarded as fantasy. The earliest age of memory recall is 2 years old even for major events like hospitalization and a sibling birth.[20]/nIn 1992, Ramana Maharshi's nephew V. Ganesan had a chance encounter at an airport in Los Angeles, where a student of Robert Adams approached him to ask if he would like to attend Satsang. V. Ganesan eventually met Robert Adams on multiple occasions and acclaimed him to be a fully realized Jnani.[21][22][23] H.W.L. Poonja, a direct disciple of Ramana Maharshi who was a vehement critic of most contemporary teachers, liked Adams' teachings enough to read them out during several of his own Satsangs. Rupert Spira, the Advaita teacher, author and potter visited Robert Adams two days before Adams' death in 1997, where he learned about his then to be teacher Francis Lucille, who had previously met Adams. Many of Adams' students went on to become teachers, including Ed Muzika, Luis De Santiago, Stuart Schwartz, Pamela Wilson and John Taylor./nThe teacher is really yourself. You have created a teacher to wake you up. The teacher would not be here if you were not dreaming about the teacher. You have created a teacher out of your mind in order to awaken, to see that there is no teacher, no world - nothing. You've done this all by yourself./nAdams did not consider himself to be a teacher, a philosopher or a preacher.[9] What he imparted he said was simply the confession of a jnani.[25] He said he confessed his and everyone else's own reality, and encouraged students not to listen to him with their heads but with their hearts. Adams' way of communicating to his devotees was often funny,[26] and with interludes of silence or music between questions and answers. He stated that there was no such thing as a new teaching. This knowledge could be found in the Upanishads, the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures.[note 6]/nAdams did not write any books himself nor publish his teachings as he did not wish to gain a large following. He instead preferred to teach a small number of dedicated seekers.[12] However, in 1992, a book of his dialogues was transcribed, compiled and distributed by and for the sole use of his devotees.[web 2][note 7] In 1999, a later edition of this book, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams, was posthumously published by Acropolis Books Inc.[note 8] As conveyed by the title of these dialogues, Adams considered silence to be the highest of spiritual teachings:[29]/nThe highest teaching in the world is silence. There is nothing higher than this. A devotee who sits with a Sage purifies his mind just by being with the Sage. The mind automatically becomes purified. No words exchanged, no words said. Silence is the ultimate reality. Everything exists in this world through silence. True silence really means going deep within yourself to that place where nothing is happening, where you transcend time and space. You go into a brand new dimension of nothingness. That's where all the power is. That's your real home. That's where you really belong, in deep Silence where there is no good and bad, no one trying to achieve anything. Just being, pure being.[12]/nAlthough Adams was never initiated into a religious order or spiritual practice, nor became a renunciate, his teachings were described by Dennis Waite as being firmly based in the Vedic philosophy and Hindu tradition of Advaita Vedanta.[3] Advaita (non-dual in sanskrit) refers to the ultimate and supreme reality, Brahman,[note 9] which according to Ramana Maharshi, as interpreted by some of his devotees, is the substratum of the manifest universe,[30] and if describable at all, could be defined as pure consciousness. Another term for Brahman is \u0100tman.[30] The word \u0100tman is used when referring to Brahman as the inmost spirit of man. \u0100tman and Brahman are not different realities, but identical in nature.[30] Adams used a metaphor to explain this:/nA clay pot has space inside of it and outside of it. The space inside is not any different from the space outside. When the clay pot breaks, the space merges the inside with the outside. It's only space. So it is with us. Your body is like a clay pot, and it appears you have to go within to find the truth. The outward appears to be within you. The outward is also without you. There's boundless space. When the body is transcended, it's like a broken clay pot. The Self within you becomes the Self outside of you ... as it's always been. The Self merges with the Self. Some people call the inner Self the \u0100tman. And yet it is called Brahman. When there is no body in the way, the Atman and the Brahman become one... they become free and liberated.[31]/nThose in search of liberation from the manifest world will gain it only when the mind becomes quiescent. The world is in fact nothing other than the creation of the mind, and only by the removal of all thoughts, including the 'I' thought, will the true reality of Brahman shine forth.[32] Adams taught self-enquiry, as previously taught by Sri Ramana Maharshi, in order to achieve this./nIn his weekly satsangs Adams advocated the practice of self-enquiry (\u0101tma-vich\u0101ra)[16] as the principal means of transcending the ego and realising oneself as sat-chit-ananda (being-consciousness-bliss). After acknowledging to oneself that one exists, and that whether awake, dreaming or in deep sleep one always exists, one then responds to every thought that arises with the question \"Who am I?\":[33]/nWhat you are really doing is, you\u2019re finding the source of the 'I'. You're looking for the source of 'I', the personal 'I'. 'Who am I?' You're always talking about the personal 'I'. 'Who is this I? Where did it come from? Who gave it birth?' Never answer those questions. Pose those questions, but never answer them ... do nothing, absolutely nothing. You're watching the thoughts come. As soon as the thoughts come, in a gentle way you enquire, 'To whom do these thoughts come? They come to me. I think them. Who is this I? Where did it come from? How did it arise? From where did it arise? Who is the I? Who am I?' You remain still. The thoughts come again. You do the same thing again and again and again.[34]/nAdams rarely gave a sadhana to his devotees, however, he did often have visions,[12][note 10] and in one such vision he gave a teaching as the Buddha. He visualised himself sitting under a tree in a beautiful open field with a lake and a forest nearby. He was wearing the orange garb of a Buddhist renunciate. All of a sudden hundreds of bodhisattvas and mahasattvas came out of the forest and sat down in a semi-circle around Adams as the Buddha. Together they proceeded to meditate for several hours. Afterwards, one of the bodhisattvas stood up and asked the Buddha what he taught. The Buddha answered, \"I teach Self-realization of Noble Wisdom.\" Again they sat in silence for three hours before another bodhisattva stood up and asked how one could tell whether they were close to self-realization. In reply, Adams as the Buddha, gave the bodhisattvas and mahasattvas four principles, which he named The Four Principles of Self-Realization of Noble Wisdom:[35][web 3]/nAlthough Robert Adams' stories of staying at Ramana Ashram and having personal talks with Ramana have been regarded by some as entertaining, Kitty Osborne (longtime Ashram resident) and others have noted that the stories appear to come from someone who had almost no idea about the actual situation at Ramana Ashram or Ramana\u2019s habits.[39]/nFor example Robert Adams recalls staying at the ashram for over eight months attending all of Ramana\u2019s meetings yet was never seen, noted, or remembered by anyone who was actually there, when in actuality Westerners were always noted, written about and photographed by the Ashram, as a visit from a Westerner was highly unusual and always well documented.[40][19]/nRobert claimed to have personal English conversations with Ramana without a translator apparently not knowing that Ramana generally never spoke English without a translator. Robert told one such story at length during his August 2, 1992, satsang about a chat at the Osborne house in which he says the two talked about various things such as self-enquiry, the maturity and sincerity of seekers, and a number of other topics. [41][42] Kitty Osborne noted the unlikelihood:/n\"They supposedly had long chats there. Who was their interpreter? That whole story is a fabrication. Bhagavan understood English pretty well, but he barely spoke it at all. As I have explained earlier, Bhagavan never went into any house, including ours. My goodness if he had, the whole street, town, country, would have known about it. It would have become a landmark day for our family and remembered for ever more. It would have been written about by the diligent scribes who religiously recorded every word Bhagavan uttered and everyone who came into his presence![42]/nRobert Adams claimed to have private personal visits with Ramana inside the Osborne house when in actuality Ramana never went inside a grihasta (householder\u2019s) home after 1896 and did not leave the ashram front gates after 1929 except on two well noted occasions, neither of which involved going to the Osborne house.{{sfn|The Collected Works of Robert Adams- Satsangs from August 1990- June 1993|pp=2777 }[42]/nIn his August 9th 1992 satsang, Robert told a story of sadhus rolling boulders down the hill from the caves above Skandashram attempting to murder Ramana, apparently unaware that there are no caves above Skandashram despite previously claiming to have lived there for years. Something that would have been noticed in minutes by anyone who was actually there.[43]/nWhen he [Ramana] was living in askandha ashram which is up on the hill in Arunachala. In those days there were many people or sadhus living in the other caves above him. [...] Now the sadhus lived above him about fifty feet above him in the cave became jealous. They decided to kill him. So they rolled boulders\ndown on him./nMany of Robert\u2019s fictional stories involved money that did not take into account for the monetary inflation that happened in India between the 1940s and 1990s such as his story of Henry Wells:/nI recall a Westerner, I'm trying to think of his name, Henry Wells, from Scotland. He apparently had read a lot of books about Ramana, and this was his first visit. He came into the hall, and I was watching this. Ran over to Ramana and prostrated himself on his stomach, and started going crazy. His feet were shaking, and he was chanting. The devotees wanted to pick him up, and Ramana said, \"Let him stay.\" When he came out of it he told Ramana, \"At last I have found you. You are my father, my mother, my son, my daughter, my friend.\" And Ramana just smiled at him. And I said to myself, I was only eighteen years old, I said to myself, \"Someone who is this enthusiastic, let's see what happens, if it lasts.\"/nThe days went by and he kept prostrating himself every day for about a month./nThen he finally stopped and he sat down like everybody else. And after about two months he started looking around the room at everybody, and he started complaining, that this wasn't right, that wasn't right. After about four months of being there he donated forty thousand dollars to the ashram, and I'm just watching all these things going on.[44]/nApparently Robert failed to realize the unlikelihood of a Scotsman donating dollars and the fact that $40k in 1950 could have likely bought the entire town of Tiruvannamalai and most certainly would have at least been noted by someone at the ashram itself.[45]/nRobert claimed to have donated a jeep to the Ashram when no jeep or car was ever possessed by the ashram until 2018.[46][47]/nAccording to Ed Muzika in his Yoga Journal article of Jan/Feb 1998,/n\u201cDuring the fall of 1946 Robert traveled to India, arriving by train in the town of Tiruvannamalai, a few miles from Arunachala mountain, the site of Ramana Maharshi\u2019s ashram. Early the next day, while walking to ward the ashram, he spotted Ramana coming down the path toward him. An electrifying energy coursed through his body. He felt completely opened. As Ramana got closer, Robert stripped off all his clothes and dropped at his guru\u2019s feet. Ramana reached down, grabbed Robert by his shoulders, looked into his eyes and said, \u201cI have been waiting for you. Get up! Get up!\u201d [48]/n[49]/nOf course Ramana never treated anyone as special or claimed to have been waiting for them to finally arrive./nMr. Adams claimed Ramana used to cover himself with mud and tell visitors that Ramana doesn't live here anymore in order to get rid of them, when in fact Ramana never lied about anything, always was scrupulously clean, and always warmly welcomed all comers to the ashram, Pundits or not.[50]/n[Ramana...] would rub himself with mud and become filthy and sit there in the mud. And when they'd come by they would say,\"Where does the sage live?\" and he would say, \"he's gone, he doesn't live here anymore,\" and then they would inquire up the hill and they would say, \"you just passed him sitting in the mud.\" (laughter) And they would become disillusioned and go away.[51]/nWhile events in many of Robert's stories were claimed to have happened to him, they could actually be found in various Hindu texts. Others were highly imaginative descriptions meant to contain some type of parable or spiritual truth which he apparently made up on the spot and told entertainingly as \"first-person\" accounts.", "53476951": "George Dewey Yancy (born June 3, 1961)[1] is an American philosopher who is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Philosophy at Emory University.

Laozi is a Chinese honorific, typically translated as \"the Old Master\". Modern scholarship generally regards his biographical details as invented, and his opus a collaboration. Traditional accounts say he was born as Li Er in the state of Chu in the 6th century\u00a0BC during China's Spring and Autumn period, served as the royal archivist for the Zhou court at Wangcheng (in modern Luoyang), met and impressed Confucius on one occasion, and composed the Tao Te Ching in a single session before retiring into the western wilderness./nA central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is generally considered the founder of Taoism. He was claimed and revered as the ancestor of the 7th\u201310th century Tang dynasty and is similarly honored in modern China as the progenitor of the popular surname Li. In some sects of Taoism and Chinese folk religion, it is held that he then became an immortal hermit,[2] or that the Tao Te Ching was the avatar \u2013 embodied as a book \u2013 of the god Laojun,[3] one of the Three Pure Ones of the celestial bureaucracy.[citation needed] The Tao Te Ching had a profound influence on Chinese religious movements and on subsequent Chinese philosophers, who annotated, commended, and criticized his work extensively. In the 20th century, textual criticism by modern historians led to theories questioning Laozi's timing or even existence, positing that the received text of the Tao Te Ching was not composed until the 4th century\u00a0BC Warring States period, and was the product of multiple authors./n/nLaozi /\u02c8la\u028adz\u0259/ is the modern pinyin romanization of \u8001\u5b50. It is not a name but an honorific title, meaning \"old\" or \"venerable master\". The structure of the name exactly matches that of other ancient Chinese philosophers such as Kongzi, Mengzi, Zhuangzi, &c.[4]/nTraditional accounts give Laozi the personal name Li Er (\u674e\u8033, L\u01d0 \u011ar), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *C.r\u0259\u0294\u00a0C.n\u0259\u0294.[1] Li is a common Chinese surname meaning \"plum\" or plum tree; there is a legend tying Laozi's birth to a plum tree.[5] Laozi has long been identified with the persona Lao Dan (\u8001\u8043, L\u01ceo D\u0101n).[6][7][8] Dan similarly means \"Long-Ear\" or \"the Long-Eared One\". The character \u8033 is the Chinese word for \"ear\".[9]/nLaozi is recorded bearing the courtesy name Boyang (\u4f2f\u967d, B\u00f3y\u00e1ng), whose Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *p\u02e4rak\u00a0la\u014b.[1] The character \u4f2f was the title of the eldest son born to the primary wife, or an uncle of the father's family who was older than one's father, also used as a noble title indicating an aristocratic lineage head with rulership over a small to medium domain, and as a general mark of respect. The character \u967d is yang, the solar and masculine life force in Taoist belief. Lao Dan seems to have been used more generally, however, including by Sima Qian in his Records of the Grand Historian,[10] in the Zhuangzi,[10] and by some modern scholars.[11]/nBy the mid-twentieth century, consensus had emerged among Western scholars that the historicity of a person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the Tao Te Ching is \"a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands\",[12][13] with an author being invented afterwards.[14] The book's conspicuous absence of a central Master figure place it in marked contrast with nearly all other early Chinese philosophical works.[15][16]/nAs of 2023[update], the oldest text containing quotes from the Tao Te Ching dates to the late 4th century BC, written on bamboo slips excavated as part of the Guodian Chu Slips. However, these are mixed in with quotes from other works, indicating that the Tao Te Ching had not yet emerged as a distinct work.[17] The oldest manuscripts of the Tao Te Ching in a complete form by itself were discovered at a tomb in Mawangdui, and date to the early 2nd century BCE.[18] Analysis of early commentary on passages that appear in the received Tao Te Ching supports an accretionary evolution for the text rather than a singular authorship event.[19]/nThe earliest biographical reference to Laozi is found in the 1st\u2011century\u00a0BC Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. Multiple accounts of Laozi's biography are presented, with Sima Qian expressing various levels of doubt in his sources.[20]/nIn one account, Sima Qian reports that Laozi was said to be a contemporary of Confucius during the 6th or 5th\u00a0century\u00a0BC. His personal name was Er or Dan. was born in the village of Quren (\u66f2\u4ec1\u91cc, Q\u016br\u00e9n l\u01d0) in the southern state of Chu,[21] within present-day Luyi in Henan.[22] He was said to be the son of the Censor-in-Chief of the Zhou dynasty and Lady Yishou (\u76ca\u58fd\u6c0f), and was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou. This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time, and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west./nIn another, Laozi was a different contemporary of Confucius called Lao Laizi (\u8001\u83b1\u5b50), and wrote a book in 15 parts. The story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats an enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong, from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made./nIn a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th century\u00a0BC reign of the Duke Xian of Qin[23][24] who grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the Tao Te Ching, although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again.[25] In some later interpretations, the \"Old Master\" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha. Others say he was the Buddha himself.[26][27]/nThe stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the Zhuangzi.[26][28] His birthday is popularly held to be the 15th day of the second month of the Chinese calendar.[29] In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son who became a celebrated soldier of Wei during the Warring States period./nThe Tao Te Ching is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. It is often called the Laozi, and has always been associated with that name. The identity of the person or people who wrote or compiled the text has been the source of considerable speculation and debate throughout history.[30][31] As with many works of ancient Chinese philosophy, ideas are often explained by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. The Tao Te Ching stands as an exemplar of this literary form.[32] Unlike most works of its genre, the book conspicuously lacks a central \"master\" character and seldom references historical people or events, giving it an air of timelessness.[33]/nThe Tao Te Ching describes the Tao as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act \"unnaturally\", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The Tao Te Ching intends to lead students to a \"return\" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao.[34] Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.[35]/nWu wei (\u7121\u70ba), literally \"non-action\" or \"not acting\", is a central concept of the Tao Te Ching. The concept of wu wei is multifaceted, and reflected in the words' multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean \"not doing anything\", \"not forcing\", \"not acting\" in the theatrical sense, \"creating nothingness\", \"acting spontaneously\", and \"flowing with the moment\".[36]/nThis concept is used to explain ziran (\u81ea\u7136), or harmony with the Tao. It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source. Tao Te Ching used the term broadly with simplicity and humility as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between wu wei and esoteric practices, such as zuowang (\u5750\u5fd8; \"sitting in oblivion\": emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the Zhuangzi.[35]/nAlan Chan provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to \"nature\", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of wu wei, free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in \"ignorance\", or \"simple-minded\". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as \"valley spirit\" (\u8c37\u795e, gushen) and \"soul\" (\u9b44, po), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.[35]/nConfucianism\nPersons/nTopics/nNeo Confucianism/nNew Confucianism/nDaoism\nPersons/nTopics/nLegalism/nMohism/nMilitary and Strategy/nHan Buddhism/nTibetan Buddhism/nMaoism/nGeneral topics/nVedic philosophy/nMimamsa/nVedanta/nSamkhya/nYoga/nNyaya/nNavya-Ny\u0101ya/nVaisheshika/nN\u0101stika (heterodox)/nTamil/nOther/nGeneral topics/nJainism/nBuddhism/nTraditions/nTopics/nJapanese Buddhism/nJapanese Confucianism/nKokugaku/nModern Thought/nStatism/nKyoto School/nKorean Buddhism/nKorean Confucianism\nPersons/nTopics/nDonghak/nModern Thought\nPersons/nTopics/nPotential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and Zhuangzi, to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, the other founder of Taoism, had a great deal of influence on Chinese literati and culture.[37] Political theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various antiauthoritarian movements have embraced Laozi's teachings on the power of the weak.[38]/nThe story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the Han dynasty. As Taoism took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the Tao from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the Way of the Celestial Masters, the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the Tao. He is said to have undergone numerous \"transformations\" and taken on guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the \"Old Master\" did not disappear after writing the Tao Te Ching but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the Tao.[39]/nTaoist myths state that Laozi was a virgin birth, conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree.  Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life.[40] Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived 990 years and spent his life traveling to reveal the Tao.[39]/nDue to his traditional name Li Er, Laozi has been venerated as the ancestor of all subsequent Lis, and many clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi,[41] including the emperors of the Tang dynasty.[42][41][43] This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (\u96b4\u897f\u674e\u6c0f). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi's impact on Chinese culture.[44] Under the Tang, Laozi received a series of temple names of increasing grandeur. In the year 666, Emperor Gaozong named Laozi the \"Supremely Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\" (\u592a\u4e0a\u7384\u5143\u7687\u5e1d, T\u00e0ish\u00e0ng Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec).[45] In 743, Emperor Xuanzong declared him the \"Sage Ancestor\" (\u8056\u7956, Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4) of the dynasty with the posthumous title of \"Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\" (\u7384\u5143\u7687\u5e1d, Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec). Emperor Xuanzong also elevated Laozi's parents to the ranks of \"Innately Supreme Emperor\" (\u5148\u5929\u592a\u4e0a\u7687, Xi\u0101nti\u0101n T\u00e0ish\u00e0ng Hu\u00e1ng) and \"Innate Empress\" (\u5148\u5929\u592a\u540e, Xi\u0101nti\u0101n T\u00e0ih\u00f2u). In 749, Laozi was further honored as the \"Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Emperor of the Great Way\" (\u8056\u7956\u5927\u9053\u7384\u5143\u7687\u5e1d, Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4 D\u00e0d\u00e0o Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec) and then, in 754, as the \"Great Sage Ancestor and Mysterious and Primordial Heavenly Emperor and Great Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the High and Supreme Great Way\" (\u5927\u8056\u7956\u9ad8\u4e0a\u5927\u9053\u91d1\u95d5\u7384\u5143\u5929\u7687\u5927\u5e1d, D\u00e0 Sh\u00e8ngz\u01d4 G\u0101o Sh\u01ceng D\u00e0d\u00e0o J\u012bnqu\u0113 Xu\u00e1n Yu\u00e1n Ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng D\u00e0d\u00ec)./nA seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang (\u4e09\u6d1e\u73e0\u56ca; \"Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns\"), presents Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and a character named Yinxi as the ideal Taoist student. Yinxi follows a formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.[46]/nIn the Siddhar tradition of Tamil Nadu, the greatly revered Siddhar Bhogar, one of the 18 esteemed Siddhars of yore, is believed to be Laozi and is of Chinese origin. His caste, from obscure references is noted to be \"Cinatecakkuyavar\" or Chinese potter. In his principal book of poetry, the Bhogar 7000, he tells of his travels to China to spread his ideas on spirituality, specifically on the topic of sublimating the sexual energies and using said energies to become self-realised, with a spiritually-minded partner.[47][48] His Jeeva Samadhi can be found in the southwestern corridor of the Dhandayuthapani Temple, Palani, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu.[49]/nMany contemporary philosophers have seen Laozi as a proponent of limited government.[50] The right-libertarian economist Murray Rothbard suggested that Laozi was the first libertarian,[51] likening Laozi's ideas on government to Friedrich Hayek's theory of spontaneous order.[52] James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, \"argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.\"[53] Similarly, the Cato Institute's David Boaz includes passages from the Tao Te Ching' in his 1997 book The Libertarian Reader and noted in an article for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica that Laozi advocated for rulers to \"do nothing\" because \"without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.\"[54][55] Philosopher Roderick Long argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier Confucian writers.[56]/nThe anarcho-syndicalist writer and activist Rudolf Rocker praised Laozi's \"gentle wisdom\" and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community in his 1937 book Nationalism and Culture.[57] In his 1910 article for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Peter Kropotkin also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially anarchist concepts.[58] More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and Ursula K. Le Guin have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular.[59] In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi \"does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.\"[60]", "654943": "Samuel (de) Sorbi\u00e8re (French: [s\u0254\u0281bj\u025b\u0281]; 1615\u20131670) was a French physician and man of letters, a philosopher and translator, who is best known for his promotion of the works of Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi, in whose view of physics he placed his support, though unable to refute Ren\u00e9 Descartes, but who developed a reputation in his own day for a truculent and disputatious nature.[1]  Sorbi\u00e8re is regarded often by his position on ethics and disclosure about medical mistakes.  In 1672 Sorbi\u00e8re considered the idea of being honest and upfront about a mistake having been made in medicine but thought that it might seriously jeopardise medical practice and concluded that it \"would not catch on\".[2]/nAfter relocating to the Netherlands, he published a French translation of Thomas More's Utopia in 1643. He arranged for the publication of Hobbes's De Cive in Amsterdam in 1647, published a French translation in 1649, published a French translation of Hobbes' De Corpore Politico, or the Elements of Law in 1652, and helped secure a publisher for Hobbes's own Latin translation of Leviathan in 1668. His collected Lettres et discours de M. de Sorbi\u00e8re, sur diverses mati\u00e8res curieuses, published in Paris, 1660, are imbued with the spirit of compromise, reconciling science and theology and separating science from metaphysics. His life of Gassendi was prefixed to the collected edition of Gassendi's writings, 1658. Besides Gassendi and Hobbes, he corresponded with Marin Mersenne, Fran\u00e7ois de La Mothe Le Vayer and other prominent thinkers of the day.[3]/nIn 1663\u20131664, Sorbi\u00e8re visited England, where in 1663 he was inducted into the Royal Society.

Billaine, Paris),[4] in which he offered his comments on how bad the food was, how bad the inns were and imputed to the Royal Society the intention of developing a library. This provoked Thomas Sprat (then spokesman for and historian of the Society) to publish Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier's Voyage into England (London, 1665) as a reply to Sorbi\u00e8re's perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy, Sorbi\u00e8re was held under arrest for four months in France, and Charles II of England prohibited any further responses./nSorbi\u00e8re's conversion from Calvinism to Catholicism, which opened a career to him, has been interpreted in a political light.[5]", "5144162": "Sir Larry Alan Siedentop CBE (born 24 May 1936)[1] is an American-born British political philosopher with a special interest in 19th-century French liberalism.

His grandfather Adriaan Helvetius introduced the use of ipecacuanha;[4] his father Jean Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius was first physician to Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career, apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen,[5] but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three, at the queen's request, he was appointed as a farmer-general, a tax-collecting post worth 100,000 crowns a year. Thus provided for, he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost, with the help of his wealth and liberality, his literary and artistic tastes - he attended, for example, the progressive Club de l'Entresol. As he grew older, he began to seek more lasting distinctions, stimulated by the success of Pierre Louis Maupertuis as a mathematician, of Voltaire as a poet, and of Montesquieu as a philosopher.[6] His wife, Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helv\u00e9tius, maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the Enlightenment for over five decades./nIn 1758 Helv\u00e9tius published his philosophical magnum opus, a work called De l'esprit (On Mind), which claimed that all human faculties are attributes of mere physical sensation, and that the only real motive is self-interest, therefore there is no good and evil, only competitive pleasures.

De l'esprit became almost a scapegoat for this.[5]/nThis great publicity resulted in the book being translated into almost all the languages of Europe. Voltaire said that it lacked originality. Rousseau declared that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles. Grimm thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from Diderot. Madame du Deffand felt that Helv\u00e9tius had raised such a storm by saying openly what everyone thought in secret. Madame de Graffigny claimed that all the good things in the book had been picked up in her own salon.[6]/nHelv\u00e9tius' philosophy belongs to the Egoist school:/nThis view of man was largely Hobbesian\u00a0\u2013 man is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment, and the ends of government are to ensure the maximization of pleasure./n\"All men,\" Helv\u00e9tius maintained, \"have an equal disposition for understanding.\"[10] As one of the French Enlightenment's many Lockean disciples, he regarded the human mind as a blank slate, but free not only from innate ideas but also from innate natural dispositions and propensities. Physiological constitution was at most a peripheral factor in men's characters or capabilities. Any apparent inequalities were independent of natural organization, and had their cause in the unequal desire for instruction. This desire springs from passions, of which all men commonly well organized are susceptible to the same degree. We thus owe everything to education. Social engineering is therefore an enterprise unconstrained by the natural abilities of men./nThis natural equality applied to all men in all nations, and thus the differences in national characteristics were not the result of innate differences between the people therein, but rather a byproduct of the system of education and government. \"No nation,\" wrote Helv\u00e9tius, \"has reason to regard itself superior to others by virtue of its innate endowment.\"[11]/nThis radically egalitarian aspect of Helv\u00e9tius' philosophy caused Diderot to remark that if it were true, De l'esprit might just as well have been written by Helv\u00e9tius' dogkeeper.[citation needed]/nSince all men have the same natural potential, Helv\u00e9tius argued, they all have the same ability to learn.  Thus, education is the method by which to reform society, and there are few limits to the drastic social improvements that could be brought about by the appropriate distribution of education.  Although people seem to possess certain qualities in greater abundance than their neighbours, the explanation for this comes 'from above' \u2013 it is caused by education, law and government. \"If we commonly meet in London, with knowing men, who are with much more difficulty found in France,\" this is because it is a country where \"every citizen has a share in the management of affairs in general.\"[12] \"The art of forming men,\" he concludes, \"is in all countries [...] strictly connected to the form of the government\", and thus education via governmental intervention is the method of reform.[13]/nThe crux of his thought was that public ethics has a utilitarian basis, and he insisted strongly on the importance of culture and education in national development.[14] His thinking can be described as unsystematic.[by whom?]/nThe original ideas in his system are those of the natural equality of intelligences and the omnipotence of education, neither of which gained general acceptance, though both were prominent in the system of John Stuart Mill.  Cesare Beccaria states that he was largely inspired by Helv\u00e9tius in his attempt to modify penal laws.  Helv\u00e9tius also exerted some influence on the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham./nThe materialistic aspects of Helv\u00e9tius, along with Baron d'Holbach, had an influence on Karl Marx, the theorist of historical materialism and communism, who studied the ideas of Helv\u00e9tius in Paris and later called the materialism of Helv\u00e9tius and d'Holbach \"the social basis of communism\".[15]/nGerman philosopher Johann Georg Hamann vigorously opposed Helv\u00e9tius's rationalistic doctrines.[16]/nBritish philosopher Isaiah Berlin listed Helv\u00e9tius, along with Hegel, Fichte, Rousseau, Saint-Simon and Maistre as one of the six \"enemies of freedom\" who constituted the ideological basis for modern authoritarianism, in his book Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty.[17]/nHis poetic ambitions resulted in the poem called Le Bonheur (published posthumously, with an account of Helv\u00e9tius's life and works, by Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert, 1773), in which he develops the idea that true happiness is only to be found in making the interest of one person that of all.[6]/nA work called De l'homme, de ses facult\u00e9s intellectuelles et de son \u00e9ducation, found among his manuscripts, was published after his death.

He is well remembered for his treatise On Crimes and Punishments (1764), which condemned torture and the death penalty, and was a founding work in the field of penology and the Classical School of criminology. Beccaria is considered the father of modern criminal law and the father of criminal justice.[3][4][5]/nAccording to John Bessler, Beccaria's works had a profound influence on the Founding Fathers of the United States.[6]/nBeccaria was born in Milan on 15 March 1738 to the Marchese Gian Beccaria Bonesana, an aristocrat of moderate standing from the Austrian Habsburg Empire.[7] Beccaria received his early education in the Jesuit college at Parma. Subsequently, he graduated in law from the University of Pavia in 1758. At first he showed a great aptitude for mathematics, but studying Montesquieu (1689\u20131755) redirected his attention towards economics. In 1762 his first publication, a tract on the disorder of the currency in the Milanese states, included a proposal for its remedy.[8]/nIn his mid-twenties, Beccaria became close friends with Pietro and Alessandro Verri, two brothers who with a number of other young men from the Milan aristocracy, formed a literary society named \"L'Accademia dei pugni\" (the Academy of Fists), a playful name which made fun of the stuffy academies that proliferated in Italy and also hinted that relaxed conversations which took place in there sometimes ended in affrays. Much of its discussion focused on reforming the criminal justice system. Through this group Beccaria became acquainted with French and British political philosophers, such as Diderot, Helv\u00e9tius, Montesquieu, and Hume. He was particularly influenced by Helv\u00e9tius.[9]/nCesare Beccaria was best known for his book on crimes and punishments. In 1764, with the encouragement of Pietro Verri, Beccaria published a brief but celebrated treatise On Crimes and Punishments. Some background information was provided by Pietro, who was writing a text on the history of torture, and Alessandro Verri, a Milan prison official who had firsthand experience of the prison's appalling conditions. In this essay, Beccaria reflected the convictions of his friends in the Il Caff\u00e8 (Coffee House) group, who sought reform through Enlightenment discourse./nBeccaria's treatise marked the high point of the Milan Enlightenment. In it, Beccaria put forth some of the first modern arguments against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. It is a less theoretical work than the writings of Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf and other comparable thinkers, and as much a work of advocacy as of theory./nThe brief work relentlessly protests against torture to obtain confessions, secret accusations, the arbitrary discretionary power of judges, the inconsistency and inequality of sentencing, using personal connections to get a lighter sentence, and the use of capital punishment for serious and even minor offences./nAlmost immediately, the work was translated into French and English and went through several editions. Editions of Beccaria's text follow two distinct arrangements of the material: that by Beccaria himself, and that by French translator Andr\u00e9 Morellet (1765) who imposed a more systematic order. Morellet felt the Italian text required clarification, and therefore omitted parts, made some additions, and above all restructured the essay by moving, merging or splitting chapters. Because Beccaria indicated in a letter to Morellet that he fully agreed with him, scholars assumed that these adaptations also had Beccaria's consent in substance. The differences are so great, however, that Morellet\u2019s version became quite another book than the book that Beccaria wrote.[10]/nBeccaria opens his work describing the great need for reform in the criminal justice system, and he observes how few studies there are on the subject of such reform. Throughout his work, Beccaria develops his position by appealing to two key philosophical theories: social contract and utility. Concerning the social contract, Beccaria argues that punishment is justified only to defend the social contract and to ensure that everyone will be motivated to abide by it. Concerning utility (perhaps influenced by Helvetius), Beccaria argues that the method of punishment selected should be that which serves the greatest public good./nContemporary political philosophers distinguish between two principal theories of justifying punishment. First, the retributive approach maintains that punishment should be equal to the harm done, either literally an eye for an eye, or more figuratively which allows for alternative forms of compensation. The retributive approach tends to be retaliatory and vengeance-oriented. The second approach is utilitarian which maintains that punishment should increase the total amount of happiness in the world. This often involves punishment as a means of reforming the criminal, incapacitating him from repeating his crime, and deterring others. Beccaria clearly takes a utilitarian stance. For Beccaria, the purpose of punishment is to create a better society, not revenge. Punishment serves to deter others from committing crimes, and to prevent the criminal from repeating his crime./nBeccaria argues that punishment should be close in time to the criminal action to maximize the punishment's deterrence value. He defends his view about the temporal proximity of punishment by appealing to the associative theory of understanding in which our notions of causes and the subsequently perceived effects are a product of our perceived emotions that form from our observations of a causes and effect occurring in close correspondence (for more on this topic, see David Hume's work on the problem of induction, as well as the works of David Hartley). Thus, by avoiding punishments that are remote in time from the criminal action, we are able to strengthen the association between the criminal behavior and the resulting punishment which, in turn, discourages the criminal activity./nFor Beccaria when a punishment quickly follows a crime, then the two ideas of \"crime\" and \"punishment\" will be more closely associated in a person's mind. Also, the link between a crime and a punishment is stronger if the punishment is somehow related to the crime. Given the fact that the swiftness of punishment has the greatest impact on deterring others, Beccaria argues that there is no justification for severe punishments. In time we will naturally grow accustomed to increases in severity of punishment, and, thus, the initial increase in severity will lose its effect. There are limits both to how much torment we can endure, and also how much we can inflict./nBeccaria touches on an array of criminal justice practices, recommending reform. For example, he argues that dueling can be eliminated if laws protected a person from insults to his honor. Laws against suicide are ineffective, and thus should be eliminated, leaving punishment of suicide to God. Bounty hunting should not be permitted since it incites people to be immoral and shows a weakness in the government. He argues that laws should be clear in defining crimes so that judges do not interpret the law, but only decide whether a law has been broken./nPunishments should be in degree to the severity of the crime. Treason is the worst crime since it harms the social contract. This is followed by violence against a person or his property, and, finally, by public disruption. Crimes against property should be punished by fines. The best ways to prevent crimes are to enact clear and simple laws, reward virtue, and improve education./nThree tenets served as the basis of Beccaria's theories on criminal justice: free will, rational manner, and manipulability. According to Beccaria\u2014and most classical theorists\u2014free will enables people to make choices. Beccaria believed that people have a rational manner and apply it toward making choices that will help them achieve their own personal gratification./nIn Beccaria's interpretation, law exists to preserve the social contract and benefit society as a whole. But, because people act out of self-interest and their interest sometimes conflicts with societal laws, they commit crimes. The principle of manipulability refers to the predictable ways in which people act out of rational self-interest and might therefore be dissuaded from committing crimes if the punishment outweighs the benefits of the crime, rendering the crime an illogical choice./nThe principles to which Beccaria appealed were Reason, an understanding of the state as a form of contract, and, above all, the principle of utility, or of the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Beccaria had elaborated this original principle in conjunction with Pietro Verri, and greatly influenced Jeremy Bentham to develop it into the full-scale doctrine of Utilitarianism./nHe openly condemned the death penalty on two grounds:/nBeccaria developed in his treatise a number of innovative and influential principles:/nHe also argued against gun control laws,[11] and was among the first to advocate the beneficial influence of education in lessening crime.[12] Referring to gun control laws as laws based on \"false ideas of utility\", Beccaria wrote, \"The laws of this nature are those which forbid to wear arms, disarming those only who are not disposed to commit the crime which the laws mean to prevent.\" He further wrote, \"[These laws] certainly makes the situation of the assaulted worse, and of the assailants better, and rather encourages than prevents murder, as it requires less courage to attack unarmed than armed persons\". Thomas Jefferson noted this passage in his \"Legal Commonplace Book\".[13]/nAs Beccaria's ideas were critical of the legal system in place at the time, and were therefore likely to stir controversy, he chose to publish the essay anonymously, for fear of government backlash. Among his contemporary critics, was Antonio Silla, writing from Naples./nIn the event, the treatise was extremely well received. Catherine the Great publicly endorsed it, while thousands of miles away in the United States, founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and John Adams quoted it. Once it was clear that the government approved of his essay, Beccaria republished it, this time crediting himself as the author./nWith much hesitation, Beccaria accepted an invitation to Paris to meet the great thinkers of the day. He travelled with the Verri brothers and was given a warm reception by the philosophes. However, the chronically-shy Beccaria made a poor impression and left after three weeks, returning to Milan and to his young wife Teresa and never venturing abroad again. The break with the Verri brothers proved lasting; they were never able to understand why Beccaria had left his position at the peak of success./nBeccaria nevertheless continued to command official recognition, and he was appointed to several nominal political positions in Italy. Separated from the invaluable input of his friends, he failed to produce another text of equal importance. Outside Italy, an unfounded myth grew that Beccaria's literary silence resulted from Austrian restrictions on free expression in Italy. In fact, prone to periodic bouts of depression and misanthropy, he had grown silent on his own./nLegal scholars of the time hailed Beccaria's treatise, and several European emperors were willing to follow it. Many reforms in the penal codes of the principal European nations can be traced to the treatise, but few contemporaries were convinced by Beccaria's argument against the death penalty. Even when the Grand Duchy of Tuscany abolished the death penalty, the first nation in the world to do so, it followed Beccaria's argument about the lack of utility of capital punishment, not about the state's lacking the right to execute citizens. In the anglophone world, Beccaria's ideas fed into the writings on punishment of Sir William Blackstone (selectively), and more wholeheartedly those of William Eden and Jeremy Bentham.[14]/nIn November 1768, he was appointed to the chair of law and economy founded expressly for him at the Palatine College of Milan. His lectures on political economy, which are based on strict utilitarian principles, are in marked accordance with the theories of the English school of economists. They are published in the collection of Italian writers on political economy (Scrittori Classici Italiani di Economia politica, vols. xi. and xii.).[8] Beccaria never succeeded in producing another work to match Dei Delitti e Delle Pene, but he made various incomplete attempts in the course of his life. A short treatise on literary style was all he saw to press./nIn 1771, Beccaria was made a member of the supreme economic council, and in 1791 he was appointed to the board for the reform of the judicial code, where he made a valuable contribution. During this period he spearheaded a number of important reforms, such as the standardisation of weights and measurements.[15] He died in Milan.[8]/nA pioneer in criminology, his influence during his lifetime extended to shaping the rights listed in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. On Crimes and Punishments served as a useful guide to the founding fathers./nBeccaria's theories, as expressed in On Crimes and Punishments, have continued to play a great role in recent times. Some of the current policies impacted by his theories are truth in sentencing, swift punishment and the abolition of the death penalty in dozens of countries. While many of his theories are popular, some are still a source of heated controversy, even more than two centuries after the famed criminologist's death./nBeccaria's grandson was Alessandro Manzoni, the noted Italian novelist and poet who wrote, among other things, The Betrothed, one of the first Italian historical novels, and \"Il cinque maggio\", a poem on Napoleon's death.", "23527015": "\u00c9tienne Vincent Borne (January 22, 1907 \u2013 June 14, 1993) was born in Manduel (Gard).

He was Professor Emeritus of philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the New School for Social Research in New York. Yovel had also been a political columnist in Israel, cultural and political critic and a frequent presence in the media. Yovel was a laureate of the Israel Prize in philosophy and officier of the French order of the Palme acad\u00e9mique. His books were translated into English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Hebrew, Korean and Japanese. Yovel was married to Shoshana Yovel, novelist and community organizer, and they had a son, Jonathan Yovel, poet and law professor, and a daughter, Ronny, classical musician, TV host and family therapist.[2]/nBorn in Haifa, Palestine, then under a British mandate, Yirmiyahu Yovel graduated in 1953 from the Hebrew Reali School in Haifa. Following his mandatory military service he studied philosophy and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, completing his B.A. in 1961 and M.A. in 1964. He supported his studies as radio news editor and presenter. However, he declined a permanent career in broadcasting and went to the Sorbonne and Princeton University to complete his philosophical studies. In 1968 he earned his PhD from the Hebrew University. His adviser was Nathan Rothenstreich./nYovel came to the university driven by existential philosophical concerns and suspicious of rationalism. Upholding individual subjectivity, young Yovel was estranged from the collectivist ideals and political ideologies of the time (including the socialist-Zionist ethos), because of their demand to monopolize and politicize all intellectual concerns. Religion, too, was not the answer, but rather an escape. Yovel has shared from the start Nietzsche's radical drive to existential lucidity, which can be emotionally taxing but also liberating./nIt was, in particular, Kant's program of critical reason (though not its actual execution), and the concept of finite rationality that provided Yovel with the terms for a constructive critique of rationalism, one that recognizes rationality as indispensable for human life and culture, even while taking its finitude more radically than Kant's, by admitting its fallibility, open-endedness, and non-absolute nature./nYovel holds that the history of philosophy is embedded in most philosophical discourse, and that often it contains issues and insights that can be fruitfully contemporized by a method of immanent reconstruction. His own philosophical position can be described as \"a philosophy of immanence,\" which, following Spinoza, views the immanent world as all there is and as the sole possible source of social and political normativity. The latter theme was extensively probed in his two-volume Spinoza and Other Heretics (Princeton, 1989), which traces the idea of immanence back to Spinoza and follows its adventures in later thinkers of modernity from Kant and Hegel to Nietzsche and beyond./nYovel was to return as visiting professor both to Princeton University (1970\u201371) and the Sorbonne (1978\u201380), among other foreign appointments. His years on both sides of the Atlantic helped shape Yovel's attitude towards Anglo-American analytic philosophy. He shares its demand for clarity and precision \u2013 this was recognized as a hallmark of his writing \u2013 but criticized its often scholastic tendencies and a-historical approach./nFollowing his academic and public activity Yirmiyahu Yovel became a prominent voice in Israeli intellectual life. His numerous columns in major papers, mostly Ha'aretz and Yediot Aharonot, probed public attitudes and government policies. He was an early advocate of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, and strongly opposed the settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza as politically wrong and motivated by false Messianism./nYovel's involvement in journalism started in his student days. In 1960\u201364 he worked for radio Israel and co-founded its weekly news magazine. In 1967 he participated in the project of creating an independent Israeli broadcasting authority, serving two terms on its council. Later he edited the first political documentaries of Israel TV, and during 1975\u20131978 he edited and hosted 30 major TV programs on social and political issues (drugs, gay liberation, divorce, adoption, violence in sports, Arab land rights; the right to die, etc.). His viewers also remembered him as a military reporter in the Sinai frontline in both the 1967 and 1973 war. In 1973 he was among the few journalists who insisted on reporting the truth about Israel's military setbacks in the early stage of the war./nAfter Labor's historic defeat in 1977, he joined \"Circle 77,\" a group of intellectuals that tried to reform the Labor party, but found himself unfit for party politics. Henceforth he focused on the written press, publishing scores of political columns until the 1990s./nMost of Yovel's career took place at the Hebrew University, where he served in various academic posts and held the Shulman Chair of Philosophy. During that time, he also visited and lectured in numerous universities and institutes worldwide including Columbia, Hamburg, Milan, Oxford, Paris IV (\"Paris-Sorbonne\"), and others. In 1994 he accepted an appointment to teach annually one-term at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research which became his \"second academic home.\" He was then nominated to the inaugural Hans Jonas Chair in Philosophy, from which he retired in 2010.[3]/nIn 1986, Yovel founded the Jerusalem Spinoza Institute with a dual intention \u2013 to foster Spinoza scholarship, and to promote public education around ideas associated with Spinoza (such as democracy, secularism, and tolerance) both as all- European thinker and as an emblematic figure of Jewish modernity)./nIn 2000 Yovel won the Israel Prize for his achievements in philosophy. His thank-you address on behalf of his fellow laureates was entitled \"A Report on the State of Reason.\" Reason is alive and breathing, Yovel reported, but is besieged by inner and outer enemies. Reason's \"inner enemy\" is its over-ambitious tendency to exceed its limits and control, and three \"external enemies\": mysticism, global commercial culture, and post-modern radical critique. Yovel argued that these challenges can be tackled by a sober attitude, committed to reason all while accepting its fallibility, finitude, and lack of absolute character. This is rationality \"on a human scale,\" rather than a secular replica of religion.[4]/nYirmiyahu Yovel's published numerous scholarly articles and several books, among them Kant and  the Problem of History (Princeton 1980,86) Spinoza and Other Heretics (Princeton 1989), Dark Riddle: Hegel,  Nietzsche and the Jews (Polity 1996) and The Other Within: The Marranos (Princeton 2013). He translated into Hebrew two major philosophical classics (Spinoza's Ethics and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason) with systematic introductions, and  edited several collective books, including a 5-volume encyclopedia of Jewish modern secular culture. Yovel's credits as journalist include dozens of press columns and 30 major TV programs./nYovel's first book, based on his PhD dissertation, was Kant and the Renewal of Metaphysics (1974, in Hebrew.) While Kant had been often held to have destroyed metaphysics, Yovel's book argues that Kant's actual program was to renew it, by replacing the old dogmatic metaphysics with a new critical one. Metaphysical questions are deeply significant even when they exceed the range of legitimate answers. To either repress the questions or to pretend answering them is equally irrational. Reason in Kant has a metaphysical interest and a critical interest that are equally indispensable, yet contradict each other in the absence of a critique. The critical turn resolves this antinomy in two stages. First, it establishes a system of synthetic a-priori categories and principles that functions as a valid metaphysics of the immanent (empirical) domain; and, secondly, in the Dialectic, it re-orients the metaphysical drive from its search of empty, illusory objects back into the empirical world, and makes us realize our fundamental finitude, as well as the endlessly open horizons within this world which we can explore.[5]/nBy metaphysics Kant understood a system of supersensible elements that (1) determines the entities in the sensible world, and (2) concerns the meaning of their being. The Kantian synthetic a-priori categories and principles fulfill the first role, but do so critically, since they are not supersensible objects existing in themselves but are only ingredients in the synthesis of empirical objects. As such they also determine what it means for empirical objects to be (namely, to be a synthesis of sense perceptions linked by the categories.) The a priori system is thus not only an epistemology, but equally an ontology of finite, natural beings./nThe book also highlights the dynamic, self-driving nature of Kantian reason (which Yovel sometimes calls \"erotic\" in the Platonic sense). Human rationality is not a mere calculus in Kant but a goal-oriented activity, which projects its own inherent ends and strives to realize them. Finally, the book describes Kant's method as the self-explication of reason, which depends upon its own history, including a series of collapses, and culminates in a critical revolution.[citation needed]/nYovel's major work on Kant was to become his Kant and the Philosophy of History (Princeton 1980, 1986; French 1989).[6] Kant's historical thought had for a long time been ignored, or dismissed as marginal and inconsistent. Yovel's work was instrumental in reversing this outlook. The book goes beyond Kant's customary moral teaching, which revolves on the formal and personal characteristics of morality, to uncover a second, material tier in Kant's practical philosophy, in which the moral will becomes a world-shaping will: the will is not satisfied with its personal morality alone, but works to reshape the entire social-historical world as \"a moral totality\". The will does not only strive to make itself good, but to reshape its world in its own image\u2014to see its moral goals embodied in the actual world's ways and institutions. This makes possible a critical philosophy of history, and of particular areas within it\u2014politics, law, social ethics, moral education, and a religion of reason.[7]/nThe lever leading to the second stage is Kant's concept of \"The Highest Good\" and the imperative to promote it. A close analysis of this concept leads Yovel to interpret it as the Kantian regulative idea of history, an ideal that combines maximal morality (personal and institutional, ethical and political) with universal well-being and prosperity. Kant even calls the historical task \"the ultimate end of creation itself\"[8]), thus suggesting that moral history, in which humans change themselves and reform the world, is the only possible justification of there being a world and a human race, which otherwise would be utterly contingent and meaningless.[9]/nIn method, the book is not a narrative commentary but a systematic reconstruction. While relying on careful textual analyses, it organizes the material in relation to the inner logic and latent implications of Kant's positions, which allow Yovel to draw new conclusions that shed light on unknown aspects in his philosophy./nThe book had strong echoes which reversed the traditional outlook. Today there is even talk of Kant's \"historical turn\", a concept unheard of in the past).\nA noted German philosopher, director of the Institut f\u00fcr Sozialforschung (Institute for Social Research, the institutional home of the Frankfurt School and critical theory) recently described the book's impact:/n\"When I first read Yirmiyahu Yovel's marvelous book on Kant and the Philosophy of History almost twenty years ago, I learned how one should approach the task of interpreting classical texts: Starting from the identification of a central problem in a philosopher`s writings, one must try rearrange the elements of the proposed solution until a new idea emerges that goes beyond the original author's explicit intentions. Because I was extremely impressed by this method the way it was applied to Kant's systematic thought, I not only became a regular and eager reader of Yirmiyahu Yovel's publications, but I also tried to emulate this mode of thinking in my own work\" (\u2014Axel Honneth, 2010)./nYovel's best-known book is Spinoza and other Heretics, (Princeton 1989), a diptych in two volumes that offers a new interpretation of the existential origins of Spinoza's intellectual revolution (Vol. I) and its developments in later thinkers of modernity (Vol. II). Spinoza appealed to Yovel primarily by his radical principle of immanence, which Yovel sees as paradigmatic of much of modern thought, and by his striking personal case. No modern thinker before Nietzsche has gone as far as Spinoza in shedding all historical religion and all horizons of transcendence. In wondering what had enabled Spinoza to tear himself so drastically from the Western theistic tradition, Yovel did not turn directly to  the rational arguments that drove Spinoza, but  looked first for the historico-existential situation that cleared the mental space for those arguments to emerge and take hold in the mind.[10]/nThe answer, Yovel suggested, is  linked to the  dualities and confused religious identity of the peculiar Jewish group from which Spinoza came, the so-called Marranos, who before arriving in Holland had lived for generations in Spain and Portugal as forced converts from Judaism, absorbing Christian symbols, mental patterns and ways of thinking. Former Jews  who tried to remain Jewish in secret had only scant knowledge of Judaism, and what they knew  they  conceptualized  in Christian terms;  while others, having mixed the two religions, ended up  neither Jews nor Christians, and looked to the affairs of this life and this world as a substitute to religious salvation in either Jesus or Moses. However, describing the events of Marranos responding to the miracle in the Convent of S\u00e3o Domingos in Lisbon on April 19, 1506 with statements such as \"How can a piece of wood do miracles?\", or \"Put some water to it and it'll go out\", Yovel states that these words \"expressed the same rough Jewish common sense resisting the Catholic sense of mysterium and insisting on calling super-rational phenomena by their earthly names.\"[11] The Marrano experience, Yovel suggests, made it possible for several ex-Marranos to adopt the immanent and \"secular\" standpoint  which Spinoza radicalized and gave it a powerful systematization.[12]/nVolume One (The Marrano of Reason)[13] uses historical and literary materials to elicit a set of typical and recurring Marrano patterns (for example: life on two levels, overt and concealed; the use of equivocation and dual language; the search for an alternative way to salvation, replacing Jesus and Moses with philosophical reason, etc.) which in Spinoza are transposed from the context of religion to that of reason. From the other direction, key philosophical issues in Spinoza (language, politics and the multitude, the third kind of knowledge) are also, at the same time, shown to be responding to Marrano-like elements that further illuminate and contextualize  them. Yovel insists that this contextualization is not reductive: Spinoza's ideas have an independent rational import that cannot be reduced to the historical circumstances that allowed them to arise.[14]/nA heretic to all religions, Spinoza was banned by the rabbis but refused to convert to Christianity. By calling him \"the first modern Jew\", Yovel highlights his relevance to the Modern Jewish situation. His case - even more than his thought - anticipated most of the rival and contradicting solutions that were offered in later centuries to non-orthodox Jewish existence. Yet Spinoza himself neither advocated nor personally realized any of those options. He thus became, involuntarily, a founding father of almost all the forms of modern life in which he himself did not participate.[15]/nVolume Two (The Adventures of Immanence)[16] uncovers the presence of  Spinoza's revolution in some major turns of modern thought. Yovel distinguishes between naturalism and the broader concept of a \"philosophy of immanence\". The latter maintains that (a) immanent reality is all there is, the overall horizon of being; (b) it is also (through humans) the only valid source of moral and  political norms; and (c) interiorizing this recognition is a precondition to whatever liberation or redemption humans can hope for. Yovel takes the reader into the latent and overt conversation with Spinoza in the work of  Kant, Hegel, the left-Hegelians (Heine, Feuerbach, Hess), Marx, Nietzsche and Freud - all of whom shared a core philosophy of immanence but worked it out in rival ways, which also diverge from  Spinoza's. This approach makes vividly present  Spinoza's influence on modernity, including Jewish modernity. In the Epilogue, speaking for himself, Yovel argues for a critical philosophy of immanence to modify Spinoza's \"dogmatic\" one.[17]/nThe book was widely discussed and translated into French, German, Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese.[18]/nThis book[19] treats the so-called \"Jewish question\"' as primarily a question for Europe with itself. Hegel was a philosopher of reason and Nietzsche its outright opponent; Hegel was a (heterodox) Christian and Nietzsche a self-proclaimed 'Antichrist'; Hegel sought to bring rational modernity to its climax and Nietzsche wanted to replace it with a \"Dionysian\"culture based upon the \"will to power\". Yet each in terms of his project had to grapple with the issue of Judaism and the Jews. The result was ambivalence of two different kinds.[20]/nThe young Hegel manifested a harsh anti-Jewish attitude which his mature philosophy mitigated. Reversing his early claim that the Jews had contributed nothing worthwhile to humanity, the older Hegel went as far as to attribute to Judaism one of the most consequential turning points in human history: the recognition that absolute being is Spirit, not a thing or a natural entity, and that Spirit is higher than nature. Yet Judaism falsified its own revolution in the very act of performing it, because it shaped itself as \"a religion of sublimity\", by which Hegel means a religion of self-alienation and slavish submission to an infinitely remote Master, before whom the individual stands in dread as a complete nullity. In this dialectical fashion, the mature Hegel tacitly condemned the Jews in the very act of praising them. Furthermore, unlike Nietzsche, Hegel denied post-Christian Jews any historical significance and value. It followed from Hegel's logic of history that the Jews had lost their raison d'\u00eatre already in antiquity and become the empty shell of their former self. Yet while he was puzzled and disturbed by their long survival as a theoretical paradox (a \"dark riddle\"), this did not prevent Hegel from supporting political emancipation and social acceptance for the contemporary Jews, an unpopular position in Germany at the time. Hegel looked down on German xenophobic nationalism, and as a philosopher of freedom he chose, without enthusiasm, to admit the Jews into the modern world as a necessary recognition of their humanity.[21]/nNietzsche not only overcame the anti-Jewish prejudice of his early years but, unlike Hegel, did so with passion. Following his break with Wagner and Schopenhauer the mature Nietzsche came into his own as an ardent anti-anti-Semite. To him, the modern anti-Semite was a creature of ressentiment, and as such was the genealogical cousin of the ancient Jewish priest, whom Nietzsche despised with the same ardor, and for the same psycho-philosophical reasons. Nietzsche refused to attribute to Judaism a single unchanging essence. His attitude, as reconstructed in this book, varies according to three phases in Jewish history. (1)The Old Testament Hebrews were the object of Nietzsche's admiration on account of their grand figures, great deeds, and authentic self-affirmation. (2) Nietzsche loathed and reviled the \u2018priestly' Judaism of the Second Temple (and Testament), primarily because it had engendered Christianity and the \"slave morality\" that corrupted Europe alongside Socratic rationalism. (3) He admired the Jews of the Diaspora because of their historical depth and the existential power they accumulated in centuries of resistance and perseverance. This power Nietzsche now wanted to pour into the new Europe he envisioned. He therefore expects urged the Jews to become secularized, to mix with other Europeans, to excel in all European affairs and eventually set new standards and values to them. The Jew's existential vigor and anti-Christian disposition would then pour into Europe, promoting a Dionysian revolution of values. Unlike Hegel, then, Nietzsche treats the Jews as an ethnic, historical human group and not primarily a religion.[22]/nThis book, published in Hebrew in 1996 and translated into English, French, Japanese, and Romanian, also shows that universal reason does not necessarily exclude a strong anti-Jewish bias, and a philosophy of power must not necessarily be anti-Semitic./nFollowing his interest in Spinoza, Yovel was intrigued by the broader phenomenon of the Marranos and studied it for its own sake. The result was another opus: The Other Within: The Marranos: Split Identity and Emerging Modernity (Princeton 2009).[23]\nYovel describes the Marranos as \"the other within\"\u2014people who both did and did not belong. Rejected by most Jews as renegades and by most veteran Christians as Jews with impure blood, Marranos had no definite, integral identity, Yovel argues. The \"Judaizers\"-Marranos who wished to remain secretly Jewish - were not actually Jews, and those Marranos who wished to assimilate were not truly integrated as Hispano-Catholics. Rather, mixing Jewish and Christian symbols and life patterns, Marranos were typically distinguished by a split identity. They also discovered the subjective mind, engaged in social and religious dissent, and demonstrated early signs of secularity and this-worldliness. In these ways, Yovel says, the Marranos anticipated many central features of Western modernity, and also of the modern Jewish experience./nHistorians who see their work as constructive of the national identity tend to appropriate the Marranos (or, Conversos) exclusively to their own nation and culture. Yovel's book argues it is impossible to attribute any integral and univocal identity to the Marranos, neither Jewish nor Hispano-Catholic, since  it was, precisely, the disintegration of the  compact characteristic of medieval society which is the most distinctive and interesting feature of these people, and one of the main contributions they made to early-modern Europe./nOne of this book's philosophical conclusions is that the split identity which the Inquisition persecuted and modern nationalism condemns as illicit, is a genuine and inevitable shape of human existence, which deserves recognition as a basic human freedom.", "228980": "Martin Buber (Hebrew: \u05de\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8; German: Martin Buber, pronounced [\u02c8ma\u0281ti\u02d0n\u0329 \u02c8bu\u02d0b\u0250] \u24d8; Yiddish: \u05de\u05d0\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05df \u05d1\u05d5\u05d1\u05e2\u05e8; February 8, 1878 \u2013 June 13, 1965) was an Austrian Jewish and Israeli philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I\u2013Thou relationship and the I\u2013It relationship.[2] Born in Vienna, Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in philosophy. He produced writings about Zionism and worked with various bodies within the Zionist movement extensively over a nearly 50 year period spanning his time in Europe and the Near East. In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, Ich und Du (later translated into English as I and Thou),[3] and in 1925, he began translating the Hebrew Bible into the German language reflecting the patterns of the Hebrew language./nHe was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature ten times, and the Nobel Peace Prize seven times.[4]/nMartin (Hebrew name: \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b3\u05bc\u05db\u05b7\u05d9, Mordechai) Buber was born in Vienna to an Orthodox Jewish family. Buber was a direct descendant of the 16th-century rabbi Meir Katzenellenbogen, known as the Maharam (\u05de\u05d4\u05e8\"\u05dd), the Hebrew acronym for \u201cMordechai, HaRav (the Rabbi), Meir\u201d, of Padua. Karl Marx is another notable relative.[5] After the divorce of his parents when he was three years old, he was raised by his grandfather in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine).[5] His grandfather, Solomon Buber, was a scholar of Midrash and Rabbinic Literature. At home, Buber spoke Yiddish and German. In 1892, Buber returned to his father's house in Lemberg./nDespite Buber's putative connection to the Davidic line as a descendant of Katzenellenbogen, a personal religious crisis led him to break with Jewish religious customs. He began reading Immanuel Kant, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche.[6] The latter two, in particular, inspired him to pursue studies in philosophy. In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna (philosophy, art history, German studies, philology)./nIn 1898, he joined the Zionist movement, participating in congresses and organizational work. In 1899, while studying in Z\u00fcrich, Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a \"brilliant Catholic writer from a Bavarian peasant family\"[7] who in 1901 left the Catholic Church and in 1907 converted to Judaism.[8]/nBuber, initially, supported and celebrated the Great War as a 'world historical mission' for Germany along with Jewish intellectuals to civilize the Near East.[9] Some researchers believe that while in Vienna during and after World War I, he was influenced by the writings of Jacob L. Moreno, particularly the use of the term \u2018encounter\u2019.[10][11]/nIn 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main, but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews from public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, receiving a professorship at Hebrew University and lecturing in anthropology and introductory sociology. After the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, Buber became the best known Israeli philosopher./nBuber and Paula had two children: a son, Rafael Buber, and a daughter, Eva Strauss-Steinitz. They helped raise their granddaughters Barbara Goldschmidt (1921\u20132013) and Judith Buber Agassi (1924\u20132018), born by their son Rafael's marriage to Margarete Buber-Neumann.\nBuber's wife Paula Winkler died in 1958 in Venice, and he died at his home in the Talbiya neighborhood of Jerusalem on June 13, 1965./nBuber was a vegetarian.[12]/nBuber's evocative, sometimes poetic, writing style marked the major themes in his work: the retelling of Hasidic and Chinese tales, Biblical commentary, and metaphysical dialogue. A cultural Zionist, Buber was active in the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and Israel.[13] He was also a staunch supporter of a binational solution in Palestine, and, after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of social psychology, social philosophy, and religious existentialism.[14]/nBuber's attitude toward Zionism was tied to his desire to promote a vision of \"Hebrew humanism\".[15] According to Laurence J. Silberstein, the terminology of \"Hebrew humanism\" was coined to \"distinguish [Buber's] form of nationalism from that of the official Zionist movement\" and to point to how \"Israel's problem was but a distinct form of the universal human problem. Accordingly, the task of Israel as a distinct nation was inexorably linked to the task of humanity in general\".[16]/nApproaching Zionism from his own personal viewpoint, a young Buber disagreed with Theodor Herzl about their respective positions on Zionism. Herzl did not envision Zionism as a movement with religious objectives. In contrast, Buber believed the potential of Zionism was for social and spiritual enrichment. For example, Buber argued that following the formation of the Israeli state, there would need to be reforms to Judaism: \"We need someone who would do for Judaism what Pope John XXIII has done for the Catholic Church\".[17] Herzl and Buber would continue, in mutual respect and disagreement, to work towards their respective goals for the rest of their lives. In 1902, Buber became the editor of the weekly Die Welt, the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became involved with the Jewish Hasidic movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the Hasidim were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work, and devoted himself to study and writing, as in that same year, he published his thesis, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems, on Jakob B\u00f6hme and Nikolaus Cusanus.[18]/nIn a 1910 essay entitled \"He and We,\" Buber established himself and Herzl as diametrically opposed in their perspectives on Zionism. Buber described Herzl by saying, \"The impulse of the elementally active person (Elementaraktiver) to act is so strong that it prevents him from acquiring knowledge for the sake of knowledge,\" and, according to Buber, when a person like Herzl is aware of his Jewishness, \"In him awakens the will to help the Jews to whom he belongs, to lead the where they can experience freedom and security. Now he does what his will tells He does not see anything else.\"[19] In that same essay, Buber would draw a parallel between Herzl and Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, arguing that both seek to reinstate the Jewish people, the difference coming in their approaches; Herzl affecting change indirectly via history whereas Baal Shem Tov sought to achieve improvement directly through religion.[19]/nBuber produced multiple writings on Zionism and nationalism during this time period, expanding upon broader ideas related to Zionism. In light of the outbreak of WWI, Buber engaged in debates with fellow German theologian Herrman Cohen in 1915 on the nature of nationalism and zionism.[20] Whereas Cohen, whose argument was based in messianic principles, believed that a Jewish minority was essential to a broader German national identity, Buber argued that, \"Judaism may well be taken up in messianic humanity, to be melted into it; we do not, however, consider that the Jewish people must disappear among contemporary humanity so that a messianic humanity might arise.\"[21]/nBuber continued to explore and develop his views on Zionism in these years. One such notable piece of writing is a letter to a professor entitled \"Concepts and Reality\" in 1916. In this letter, Buber addresses the issues of nationalism, Messianism, and Hebrew within the Zionist movement of the period.[22]  Buber argued that nationalism is not a natural phenomenon, and that Zionism is a movement centered around religiosity, not nationalism.[23] However, according to Buber, the messianic movement within zionism is obscured by those in liberal Jewish and anti-Zionist circles, who argue that Messianism necessitates a diaspora.[24] On the importance of the Hebrew language, Buber believed, \"Hebrew is not first and foremost a vernacular but the single language that can fully absorb and express the sublime values of Judaism.\"[25]/nIn the early 1920s, Martin Buber started advocating a binational Jewish-Arab state, stating that the Jewish people should proclaim \"its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people, and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development.\"[26] Buber rejected the idea of Zionism as just another national movement, and wanted instead to see the creation of an exemplary society; a society which would not be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs. It was necessary for the Zionist movement to reach a consensus with the Arabs even at the cost of the Jews remaining a minority in the country. In 1925, he was involved in the creation of the organization Brit Shalom (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life, he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation./nIn a 1929 essay entitled \"The National Home and National Policy in Palestine,\" Buber explores Jewish right to the land of Israel before engaging with the question of Jewish-Arab relations.[27] According to Buber, the Zionist right to establish a country in Israel originates from their ancient, ancestral connection to the land, the fact that Jews have worked to cultivate the land in recent years, and the future prospect that a Jewish state offers as a both a cultural center for Judaism, but also as a model for creating a new social organization, referencing the emergence of kibbutzim.[28] Buber goes on to discuss, broadly, the necessity for injustice in order to survive, and focuses it to the Zionist perspective by writing, \"It is indeed true that there can be no life without injustice. The fact that there is no living creature that can live and thrive without destroying another existing organism has a symbolic significance as regards our human life. But the human aspect of life begins the moment we say to ourselves: We will not do more injustice to others than we are forced to do to exist.\"[29] Buber then uses this perspective to argue in favor of Binationalism as means to establish a combination of potential coexistence and national independence.[30]/nLiving and writing in Jerusalem, Buber increased his political involvement, and continued to develop his ideas on Zionism. In 1942, he co\u2011founded the Ihud party, which advocated a bi-nationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers such as Chaim Weizmann, Max Brod, Hugo Bergman, and Felix Weltsch, who were close friends of his from old European times in Prague, Berlin, and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s./nBuber evaluated the competing strains of cultural and political zionism from a somewhat teleological perspective in a 1948 piece \"Zionism and Zionism\".[31] He summarizes these two competing perspectives as, on the one hand, \"returning and restoring the true Israel, whose spirit and life would once again no longer exist beside each other,\" and, on the other hand, as a process of \"normalization,\" and that to be \"normal,\" a \"nation needs a land, a language, and independence. Thus, one must only go and acquire those commodities, and the rest will take care of itself.\"[32] According Buber, as Jews and Israel succeed at being a \"normal nation,\" the drive for a spiritual and cultural rebirth is lost, and the war being waged over political structure threatens to become a war for survival.[32] After the establishment of Israel in 1948, Buber advocated Israel's participation in a federation of \"Near East\" states wider than just Palestine.[33] Buber outlines this concept in \"Zionism and Zionism\". For Buber, Israel has the potential to  serve as an example for the \"Near East\" as, in his Binationalist perspective, two independent nations, could each maintain their own cultural identity, \"but both united in the enterprise of developing their common homeland and in the federal management of shared matters. On the strength of that covenant we wish to return once more to the union of Near Eastern nations, to build an economy integrated in that of the Near East, to carry out policies in the framework of the life of the Near East, and, God willing, to send the \"living idea\" forth to the world from the Near East once again.\"[34] During this same time period Buber remained critical of many policies and leaders of the new Israeli government. He was particularly vocal about the treatment of Arab refugees, and was unafraid to criticize top leadership like David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister.[35]/nFrom 1905 he worked for the publishing house R\u00fctten & Loening as a lecturer; there he initiated and supervised the completion of the social psychological monograph series Die Gesellschaft\u00a0[de]./nFrom 1906 until 1914, Buber published editions of Hasidic, mystical, and mythic texts from Jewish and world sources. In 1916, he moved from Berlin to Heppenheim./nDuring World War I, he helped establish the Jewish National Committee[36] to improve the condition of Eastern European Jews. During that period he became the editor of Der Jude (German for \"The Jew\"), a Jewish monthly (until 1924). In 1921, Buber began his close relationship with Franz Rosenzweig. In 1922, he and Rosenzweig co-operated in Rosenzweig's House of Jewish Learning, known in Germany as Lehrhaus.[37]/nIn 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, Ich und Du (later translated into English as I and Thou). Though he edited the work later in his life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the Hebrew Bible into German (Die Schrift). He himself called this translation Verdeutschung (\"Germanification\"), since it does not always use literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original. Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly Die Kreatur (\"The Creature\").[38]/nIn 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main. He resigned in protest from his professorship immediately after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. On October 4, 1933, the Nazi authorities forbade him to lecture. In 1935, he was expelled from the Reichsschrifttumskammer (the National Socialist authors' association). He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body, as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education.[39] The Nazi administration increasingly obstructed this body./nFinally, in 1938, Buber left Germany, and settled in Jerusalem, then capital of Mandate Palestine. He received a professorship at Hebrew University, there lecturing in anthropology and introductory sociology. The lectures he gave during the first semester were published in the book The problem of man (Das Problem des Menschen);[40][41] in these lectures he discusses how the question \"What is Man?\" became the central one in philosophical anthropology.[42] He participated in the discussion of the Jews' problems in Palestine and of the Arab question \u2013 working out of his Biblical, philosophic, and Hasidic work./nHe became a member of the group Ihud, which aimed at a bi-national state for Arabs and Jews in Palestine. Such a binational confederation was viewed by Buber as a more proper fulfillment of Zionism than a solely Jewish state. In 1949, he published his work Paths in Utopia,[43] in which he detailed his communitarian socialist views and his theory of the \"dialogical community\" founded upon interpersonal \"dialogical relationships\"./nAfter World War II, Buber began lecture tours in Europe and the United States. In 1952, he argued with Jung over the existence of God.[44]/nBuber is famous for his thesis of dialogical existence, as he described in the book I and Thou.[3] However, his work dealt with a range of issues including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, ethics, education, and Biblical hermeneutics.[45]/nBuber rejected the label of \"philosopher\" or \"theologian\", claiming he was not interested in ideas, only personal experience, and could not discuss God, but only relationships to God.[46]/nPolitically, Buber's social philosophy on points of prefiguration aligns with that of anarchism, though Buber explicitly disavowed the affiliation in his lifetime and justified the existence of a state under limited conditions.[47][48]/nIn I and Thou,[3] Buber introduced his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kierkegaard's Single One, Buber worked upon the premise of existence as encounter.[49] He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of Ich-Du and Ich-Es to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew).[50] Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being\u2014particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in I and Thou, a person is at all times engaged with the world in one of these modes./nThe generic motif Buber employs to describe the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (Ich-Du) and monologue (Ich-Es).[51] The concept of communication, particularly language-oriented communication, is used both in describing dialogue/monologue through metaphors and expressing the interpersonal nature of human existence./nIch\u2011Du (\"I\u2011Thou\" or \"I\u2011You\") is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another. Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I\u2013Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts).[51] Buber stressed that an Ich\u2011Du relationship lacks any composition (e. g., structure) and communicates no content (e. g., information). Despite the fact that Ich\u2011Du cannot be proven to happen as an event (e. g., it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that it is real and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate Ich\u2011Du relationships in daily life\u2014two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the Ich\u2011Du relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange./nOne key Ich\u2011Du relationship Buber identified was that which can exist between a human being and God. Buber argued that this is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an Ich\u2011Du relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God./nTo create this I\u2013Thou relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It\u2011ness, and so would prevent an I\u2011You relation, limiting it to I\u2011It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I\u2013Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I\u2013Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I\u2011It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community./nThe Ich-Es (\"I\u2011It\") relationship is nearly the opposite of Ich\u2011Du.[51] Whereas in Ich\u2011Du the two beings encounter one another, in an Ich\u2011Es relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the \"I\" confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant's theory of phenomenon, in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent's mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the Ich\u2011Es relationship is in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue./nIn the Ich-Es relationship, an individual treats other things, people, etc., as objects to be used and experienced. Essentially, this form of objectivity relates to the world in terms of the self \u2013 how an object can serve the individual's interest./nBuber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between Ich\u2011Du and Ich\u2011Es, and that in fact Ich\u2011Du experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of modernity (e. g., isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of Ich\u2011Es relations - even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence./nBuber was a scholar, interpreter, and translator of Hasidic lore. He viewed Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, frequently citing examples from the Hasidic tradition that emphasized community, interpersonal life, and meaning in common activities (e. g., a worker's relation to his tools). The Hasidic ideal, according to Buber, emphasized a life lived in the unconditional presence of God, where there was no distinct separation between daily habits and religious experience. This was a major influence on Buber's philosophy of anthropology, which considered the basis of human existence as dialogical./nIn 1906, Buber published Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman, a collection of the tales of the Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a renowned Hasidic rebbe, as interpreted and retold in a Neo-Hasidic fashion by Buber. Two years later, Buber published Die Legende des Baalschem (stories of the Baal Shem Tov), the founder of Hasidism.[37]/nChinesische Geister- und Liebesgeschichten included the first German translation ever made of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio.

Friedrich Nietzsche referred to him as \"a most fastidious and refined intelligence\" [1] and \"the most profound, discerning, and perhaps also the filthiest man of his century.\"[2]/nBorn in Chieti, he was carefully educated by his uncle, Monsignor Celestino Galiani,[3] in Naples and Rome with a view to entering the church. Galiani showed early promise as an economist, and even more as a wit. By the age of twenty-two, after he took orders,[4] he had produced two works by which his name became widely known far beyond the bounds of Naples. The first, Della Moneta, a disquisition on coinage in which he shows himself a strong supporter of mercantilism, deals with many aspects of the question of exchange, but always with a special reference to the state of confusion then presented by the monetary system of the Neapolitan government.[5]/nThe other, Raccolta in Morte del Boia, established his fame as a humorist, and was highly popular in Italian literary circles at the end of the 18th century. In this volume Galiani parodied, in a series of discourses on the death of the public hangman, the styles of Neapolitan writers of the day.[6] Galiani's political knowledge and social qualities brought him to the attention of King Charles of Naples and Sicily (afterwards Charles III of Spain) and his liberal minister Bernardo Tanucci, and in 1759 Galiani was appointed secretary to the Neapolitan embassy in Paris. He held this post for ten years, when he returned to Naples and was made a councillor of the tribunal of commerce, and in 1777 administrator of the royal domains.[5]/nGaliani's published works focus on the area of humanities as well as social sciences. He left a large number of letters which are not only of biographical interest but are also important for the light they cast on the social, economic, and political characteristics of eighteenth-century Europe. His economic reputation was mainly due to his book written in French and published 1769 in Paris, namely, his Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds, \"Dialogues on the commerce in wheat\". This work, by its light and pleasing style, and its vivacious wit, delighted Voltaire, who described it as a cross between Plato and Moli\u00e8re. The author, says Giuseppe Pecchio,[7] treated his arid subject as Fontenelle did the vortices of Descartes, or Algarotti the Newtonian system of the world. The question at issue was that of the freedom of the corn trade, then much agitated, and, in particular, the policy of the royal edict of 1764, which permitted the exportation of grain so long as the price had not reached a certain level. The general principle he maintains is that the best system in regard to this trade is to have no system \u2014 countries in different circumstances requiring, according to him, different modes of treatment. Similarly to Voltaire and even Pietro Verri, he held that one country cannot gain without another losing, and in his earlier treatise defended the action of governments in debasing the currency. Until his death in Naples, Galiani kept up a correspondence with his old Parisian friends, notably Louise d'\u00c9pinay;[8] this was published in 1818.[5]/nSee L'abate Galiani, by Alberto Marghieri (1878), and his correspondence with Tanucci in Giampietro Vieusseux's L'Archivio storico (Florence, 1878)./nIn 1751, while still a student, Galiani wrote a book entitled Della moneta which intervened in the Neapolitan debate on economic reform. In this book, he discussed financial politics and gave opinions on how to develop the Neapolitan economy. At the same time, he proposed a theory of value based on utility and scarcity; this depth of thinking on economic value would not be seen again until discussions of marginal utility developed in the 1870s. In addition, Galiani's tract exhibited conventional Mercantilist ideas and some of his recommendations were adopted by the Neapolitan government./nChapter 1 of Book I introduces the history of money as well as the rise and fall of states in antiquity and modern times. By using historical examples, Galiani illustrated his idea that commerce was neglected by political rulers throughout the whole history of humankind. States could become rich and grew through the conquest; however, they could not enhance their power, territory and wealth without commerce./nIn the core chapter of the book, Galiani explained that the value of money at any point in time derived from principles that were part of human nature itself; money was definitely not a human invention by which people deliberately changed the societies they lived in. Money generated naturally from the gradual modification of people's loves into social ideas of value that inspired commercial interaction. Money exists without relying on promises, trust, or another moral capacity of self-restraint and money is not created by an agreement. If this situation was changed, commerce could not be the centre of modern societies./nIn Della moneta, Galiani constantly described the effects of human actions in terms of providential rewards and punishments. He used the term \"providence\" to reconcile the historical dynamic of commercial progress with a set of fixed moral rules that lay at the core of successful human interaction. Galiani presented any moralistic dismissals of natural price formation and self-interested profit-seeking as reproaches to the way God intended human societies to function. Providential mechanisms were also involved in the history of money, the rise and fall of states in both antiquity and modernity and regulated the development of cultural characteristics of the dominant societies in the course of time. Throughout history man constantly reshaped the fictional moral beliefs, thereby creating the mental preconditions for commercial society./nDuring the period of being a diplomat in Paris, Galiani wrote Dialogues sur le commerce des bleds, which emphasized the importance for the regulation of commerce \u2014 an argument that opposed the physiocrats, who advocated complete freedom. This book was published in 1770 and Galiani indicated in this book that there are increasing returns to manufacturing, and diminishing returns to agriculture and the wealth of a nation depends on manufacturing and trade. Although approving of the edict of 1764 liberalizing the grain trade, Galiani rejected much of the physiocratic analysis, notably its \"land theory of value\". His 1770 piece also provided a quite modern analysis of the balance of payments./nIn the Dialogues, Galiani described that wheat can be seen in two different aspects. The distinctions between two different aspects are important: as a product of the earth, wheat can be considered both commerce and economic legislation. As a product of first necessity, wheat is a symbol of social order and belongs to administration. As Galiani put it in an illuminating way, \u2018As soon as supplying [wheat] is the concern of administration, it is no longer an object of commerce\u2019. Correspondingly, \u2018It is certain that what is sensible and useful from one standpoint, becomes absurd and harmful from another\u2019./nGaliani believed that there are many shocks to the economy, which can cause disequilibrium and it takes long time for the restoration of equilibrium. He thanked that something instead of the natural law needed to face the challenge and shocks. Administration dealt with the \u2018sudden movements\u2019 of the economy, such as shortages in the wheat supply. In other words, the legislator could not but consider the down-to-earth constraints of subsistence. In this respect, the physiocratic enlightened despot consistently and independently ruling economic matters according to natural laws was not enough to maintain social order./nGaliani not only had theoretical brilliance with his idea of \"natural\" laws in economics, but also was a practical man, skeptical about the reach of abstract theory, particularly when action was necessary and urgent. He was repelled by the wide-eyed policies called for by the physiocrats, which he believed were, unrealistic, impractical and, in times of crisis, downright dangerous./nGaliani disagreed with the physiocratic argument which said that in order to provide a sufficient supply of grain, it suffices to establish a completely free trade. In fact, the foreign trade agreed with the physiocrats that internal free trade can benefit the economy. However, Galiani used the case of exportation to challenge the physiocrats. At one point in the Dialogues, he even stated: \u2018Here I am not talking about the internal liberty of trade\u2026 Let us talk foreign trade\u2019 (Galiani 1770, 224-5). Whereas the physiocrats advocated total liberty both domestically and internationally, Galiani believed internal liberty was the first priority. Even though he was not totally opposed to grain exportation, Galiani often condemned the physiocratic liberty to export grain. Precisely, he argued that the foreign trade can threaten domestic liberty, for the frontier provinces of the kingdom may find foreign markets more attractive than domestic ones. Therefore, as long as there is no certainty as to the existence of a permanent surplus, Galiani claimed, the nation must concentrate its efforts on the internal circulation of grain./nFor him, the physiocrats were a dangerous group of impractical men with wrong ideas. In 1768, as France collapsed in a near-famine, the physiocrats still called for \"non-action\", muttering on their ordre naturel and the glorious wisdom of Quesnay, which galvanized of making their own remarkable contributions in opposition.", "32931446": "Olav Gjelsvik (born 30 June 1956) is a Norwegian philosopher.[1]/nBorn and raised in R\u00f8ros, he graduated with a DPhil from Oxford University (Balliol College) in 1986, and has since been employed by the University of Oslo; from 1991 as an associate professor, and from 1994 as a full professor.

Famous for his wit and his criticism of Christianity (especially of the Roman Catholic Church) and of slavery, Voltaire was an advocate of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and separation of church and state./nVoltaire was a versatile and prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary form, including plays, poems, novels, essays, histories, but also scientific expositions. He wrote more than 20,000 letters and 2,000 books and pamphlets.[10] Voltaire was one of the first authors to become renowned and commercially successful internationally. He was an outspoken advocate of civil liberties and was at constant risk from the strict censorship laws of the Catholic French monarchy. His polemics witheringly satirized intolerance and religious dogma, as well as the French institutions of his day. His best-known work and magnum opus, Candide, is a novella which comments on, criticizes and ridicules many events, thinkers and philosophies of his time, most notably Gottfried Leibniz and his belief that our world is the \"best of all possible worlds\".[11][12]/nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet was born in Paris, the youngest of the five children of Fran\u00e7ois Arouet (1649\u20131722), a lawyer who was a minor treasury official, and his wife, Marie Marguerite Daumard (c.\u20091660\u20131701), whose family was on the lowest rank of the French nobility.[13] Some speculation surrounds Voltaire's date of birth, because he claimed he was born on 20 February 1694 as the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Gu\u00e9rin de Rochebrune or Roquebrune.[14] Two of his older brothers\u2014Armand-Fran\u00e7ois and Robert\u2014died in infancy, and his surviving brother Armand and sister Marguerite-Catherine were nine and seven years older, respectively.[15] Nicknamed \"Zozo\" by his family, Voltaire was baptized on 22 November 1694, with Fran\u00e7ois de Castagn\u00e8re, abb\u00e9 de Ch\u00e2teauneuf\u00a0[fr], and Marie Daumard, the wife of his mother's cousin, standing as godparents.[16] He was educated by the Jesuits at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand (1704\u20131711), where he was taught Latin, theology, and rhetoric;[17] later in life he became fluent in Italian, Spanish, and English.[18]/nBy the time he left school, Voltaire had decided he wanted to be a writer, against the wishes of his father, who wanted him to become a lawyer.[19] Voltaire, pretending to work in Paris as an assistant to a notary, spent much of his time writing poetry. When his father found out, he sent Voltaire to study law, this time in Caen, Normandy. But the young man continued to write, producing essays and historical studies. Voltaire's wit made him popular among some of the aristocratic families with whom he mixed. In 1713, his father obtained a job for him as a secretary to the new French ambassador in the Netherlands, the marquis de Ch\u00e2teauneuf\u00a0[fr], the brother of Voltaire's godfather.[20] At The Hague, Voltaire fell in love with a French Protestant refugee named Catherine Olympe Dunoyer (known as 'Pimpette').[20] Their affair, considered scandalous, was discovered by de Ch\u00e2teauneuf and Voltaire was forced to return to France by the end of the year.[21]/nMost of Voltaire's early life revolved around Paris. From early on, Voltaire had trouble with the authorities for critiques of the government. As a result, he was twice sentenced to prison and once to temporary exile to England. One satirical verse, in which Voltaire accused the R\u00e9gent of incest with his daughter, resulted in an eleven-month imprisonment in the Bastille.[23] The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise had agreed in January 1717 to stage his debut play, \u0152dipe, and it opened in mid-November 1718, seven months after his release.[24] Its immediate critical and financial success established his reputation.[25] Both the R\u00e9gent and King George I of Great Britain presented Voltaire with medals as a mark of their appreciation.[26]/nVoltaire mainly argued for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. He campaigned to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority, and supported a constitutional monarchy that protects people's rights.[27][28]/nArouet adopted the name Voltaire in 1718, following his incarceration at the Bastille. Its origin is unclear. It is an anagram of AROVET LI, the Latinized spelling of his surname, Arouet, and the initial letters of le jeune (\"the young\").[29] According to a family tradition among the descendants of his sister, he was known as le petit volontaire (\"determined little thing\") as a child, and he resurrected a variant of the name in his adult life.[30] The name also reverses the syllables of Airvault, his family's home town in the Poitou region.[31]/nRichard Holmes[32] supports the anagrammatic derivation of the name, but adds that a writer such as Voltaire would have intended it to also convey connotations of speed and daring. These come from associations with words such as voltige (acrobatics on a trapeze or horse), volte-face (a spinning about to face one's enemies), and volatile (originally, any winged creature). \"Arouet\" was not a noble name fit for his growing reputation, especially given that name's resonance with \u00e0 rouer (\"to be beaten up\") and rou\u00e9 (a d\u00e9bauch\u00e9)./nIn a letter to Jean-Baptiste Rousseau in March 1719, Voltaire concludes by asking that, if Rousseau wishes to send him a return letter, he do so by addressing it to Monsieur de Voltaire. A postscript explains: \"J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 si malheureux sous le nom d'Arouet que j'en ai pris un autre surtout pour n'\u00eatre plus confondu avec le po\u00e8te Roi\", (\"I was so unhappy under the name of Arouet that I have taken another, primarily so as to cease to be confused with the poet Roi.\")[33] This probably refers to Adenes le Roi, and the 'oi' diphthong was then pronounced like modern 'ouai', so the similarity to 'Arouet' is clear, and thus, it could well have been part of his rationale. Voltaire is known also to have used at least 178 separate pen names during his lifetime.[34]/nVoltaire's next play, Art\u00e9mire, set in ancient Macedonia, opened on 15 February 1720. It was a flop and only fragments of the text survive.[35] He instead turned to an epic poem about Henry IV of France that he had begun in early 1717.[36] Denied a licence to publish, in August 1722 Voltaire headed north to find a publisher outside France. On the journey, he was accompanied by his mistress, Marie-Marguerite de Rupelmonde, a young widow.[37]/nAt Brussels, Voltaire and Rousseau met up for a few days, before Voltaire and his mistress continued northwards. A publisher was eventually secured in The Hague.[38] In the Netherlands, Voltaire was struck and impressed by the openness and tolerance of Dutch society.[39] On his return to France, he secured a second publisher in Rouen, who agreed to publish La Henriade clandestinely.[40] After Voltaire's recovery from a month-long smallpox infection in November 1723, the first copies were smuggled into Paris and distributed.[41] While the poem was an instant success, Voltaire's new play, Mariamne, was a failure when it first opened in March 1724.[42] Heavily reworked, it opened at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in April 1725 to a much-improved reception.[42] It was among the entertainments provided at the wedding of Louis XV and Marie Leszczy\u0144ska in September 1725.[42]/nIn early 1726, the aristocratic chevalier de Rohan-Chabot taunted Voltaire about his change of name, and Voltaire retorted that his name would win the esteem of the world, while Rohan would sully his own.[43] The furious Rohan arranged for his thugs to beat up Voltaire a few days later.[44] Seeking redress, Voltaire challenged Rohan to a duel, but the powerful Rohan family arranged for Voltaire to be arrested and imprisoned without trial in the Bastille on 17 April 1726.[45][46] Fearing indefinite imprisonment, Voltaire asked to be exiled to England as an alternative punishment, which the French authorities accepted.[47] On 2 May, he was escorted from the Bastille to Calais and embarked for Britain.[48]/nIn England, Voltaire lived largely in Wandsworth, with acquaintances including Everard Fawkener.[49] From December 1727 to June 1728 he lodged at Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, now commemorated by a plaque, to be nearer to his British publisher.[50] Voltaire circulated throughout English high society, meeting Alexander Pope, John Gay, Jonathan Swift, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and many other members of the nobility and royalty.[51] Voltaire's exile in Great Britain greatly influenced his thinking. He was intrigued by Britain's constitutional monarchy in contrast to French absolutism, and by the country's greater freedom of speech and religion.[52] He was influenced by the writers of the time, and developed an interest in English literature, especially Shakespeare, who was still little known in continental Europe.[53] Despite pointing out Shakespeare's deviations from neoclassical standards, Voltaire saw him as an example for French drama, which, though more polished, lacked on-stage action. Later, however, as Shakespeare's influence began growing in France, Voltaire tried to set a contrary example with his own plays, decrying what he considered Shakespeare's barbarities. Voltaire may have been present at the funeral of Isaac Newton,[a] and met Newton's niece Catherine Conduitt.[50] In 1727, Voltaire published two essays in English, Upon the Civil Wars of France, Extracted from Curious Manuscripts and Upon Epic Poetry of the European Nations, from Homer Down to Milton.[50] He also published a letter about the Quakers after attending one of their services.[54]/nAfter two and a half years in exile, Voltaire returned to France, and after a few months in Dieppe, the authorities permitted him to return to Paris.[55] At a dinner, French mathematician Charles Marie de La Condamine proposed buying up the lottery that was organized by the French government to pay off its debts, and Voltaire joined the consortium, earning perhaps a million livres.[56] He invested the money cleverly and on this basis managed to convince the Court of Finances of his responsible conduct, allowing him to take control of a trust fund inherited from his father. He was now indisputably rich.[57][58]/nFurther success followed in 1732 with his play Za\u00efre, which when published in 1733 carried a dedication to Fawkener praising English liberty and commerce.[59] He published his admiring essays on British government, literature, religion, and science in Letters Concerning the English Nation (London, 1733).[60] In 1734, they were published in Rouen as Lettres philosophiques, causing a huge scandal.[61][b] Published without approval of the royal censor, the essays lauded British constitutional monarchy as more developed and more respectful of human rights than its French counterpart, particularly regarding religious tolerance. The book was publicly burnt and banned, and Voltaire was again forced to flee Paris.[27]/nIn 1733, Voltaire met \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet (Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet), a mathematician and married mother of three, who was 12 years his junior and with whom he was to have an affair for 16 years.[63] To avoid arrest after the publication of Lettres, Voltaire took refuge at her husband's ch\u00e2teau at Cirey on the borders of Champagne and Lorraine.[64] Voltaire paid for the building's renovation,[65] and \u00c9milie's husband sometimes stayed at the ch\u00e2teau with his wife and her lover.[66] The intellectual paramours collected around 21,000 books, an enormous number for the time.[67] Together, they studied these books and performed scientific experiments at Cirey, including an attempt to determine the nature of fire.[68]/nHaving learned from his previous brushes with the authorities, Voltaire began his habit of avoiding open confrontation with the authorities and denying any awkward responsibility.[69] He continued to write plays, such as M\u00e9rope (or La M\u00e9rope fran\u00e7aise) and began his long researches into science and history. Again, a main source of inspiration for Voltaire were the years of his British exile, during which he had been strongly influenced by Newton's works. Voltaire strongly believed in Newton's theories; he performed experiments in optics at Cirey,[70] and was one of the promulgators of the famous story of Newton's inspiration from the falling apple, which he had learned from Newton's niece in London and first mentioned in his Letters.[50]/nIn the fall of 1735, Voltaire was visited by Francesco Algarotti, who was preparing a book about Newton in Italian.[71] Partly inspired by the visit, the Marquise translated Newton's Latin Principia into French, which remained the definitive French version into the 21st century.[27] Both she and Voltaire were also curious about the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz, a contemporary and rival of Newton. While Voltaire remained a firm Newtonian, the Marquise adopted certain aspects of Leibniz's critiques.[27][72] Voltaire's own book Elements of the Philosophy of Newton made the great scientist accessible to a far greater public, and the Marquise wrote a celebratory review in the Journal des savants.[27][73] Voltaire's work was instrumental in bringing about general acceptance of Newton's optical and gravitational theories in France, in contrast to the theories of Descartes.[27][74]/nVoltaire and the Marquise also studied history, particularly the great contributors to civilization. Voltaire's second essay in English had been \"Essay upon the Civil Wars in France\". It was followed by La Henriade, an epic poem on the French King Henri IV, glorifying his attempt to end the Catholic-Protestant massacres with the Edict of Nantes, which established religious toleration. There followed a historical novel on King Charles XII of Sweden. These, along with his Letters on the English, mark the beginning of Voltaire's open criticism of intolerance and established religions.[citation needed] Voltaire and the Marquise also explored philosophy, particularly metaphysical questions concerning the existence of God and the soul. Voltaire and the Marquise analyzed the Bible and concluded that much of its content was dubious.[75] Voltaire's critical views on religion led to his belief in separation of church and state and religious freedom, ideas that he had formed after his stay in England./nIn August 1736, Frederick the Great, then Crown Prince of Prussia and a great admirer of Voltaire, initiated a correspondence with him.[76] That December, Voltaire moved to Holland for two months and became acquainted with the scientists Herman Boerhaave and Willem 's Gravesande.[77] From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in Limburg.[78] In July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick's Anti-Machiavel.[79] In September Voltaire and Frederick (now King) met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleves and in November Voltaire was Frederick's guest in Berlin for two weeks,[80] followed by a meeting in September 1742 at Aix-la-Chapelle.[81] Voltaire was sent to Frederick's court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick's military intentions in the War of the Austrian Succession.[82]/nThough deeply committed to the Marquise, Voltaire by 1744 found life at her ch\u00e2teau confining. On a visit to Paris that year, he found a new love\u2014his niece. At first, his attraction to Marie Louise Mignot was clearly sexual, as evidenced by his letters to her (only discovered in 1957).[83][84] Much later, they lived together, perhaps platonically, and remained together until Voltaire's death. Meanwhile, the Marquise also took a lover, the Marquis de Saint-Lambert.[85]/nAfter the death of the Marquise in childbirth in September 1749, Voltaire briefly returned to Paris and in mid-1750 moved to Prussia at the invitation of Frederick the Great.[86] The Prussian king (with the permission of Louis XV) made him a chamberlain in his household, appointed him to the Order of Merit, and gave him a salary of 20,000 French livres a year.[87] He had rooms at Sanssouci and Charlottenburg Palace.[88] Life went well for Voltaire at first,[89] and in 1751 he completed Microm\u00e9gas, a piece of science fiction involving ambassadors from another planet witnessing the follies of humankind.[90] However, his relationship with Frederick began to deteriorate after he was accused of theft and forgery by a Jewish financier, Abraham Hirschel, who had invested in Saxon government bonds on behalf of Voltaire at a time when Frederick was involved in sensitive diplomatic negotiations with Saxony.[91]/nHe encountered other difficulties: an argument with Maupertuis, the president of the Berlin Academy of Science and a former rival for \u00c9milie's affections, provoked Voltaire's Diatribe du docteur Akakia (\"Diatribe of Doctor Akakia\"), which satirized some of Maupertuis's theories and his persecutions of a mutual acquaintance, Johann Samuel K\u00f6nig. This greatly angered Frederick, who ordered all copies of the document burned.[92] On 1 January 1752, Voltaire offered to resign as chamberlain and return his insignia of the Order of Merit; at first, Frederick refused until eventually permitting Voltaire to leave in March.[93] On a slow journey back to France, Voltaire stayed at Leipzig and Gotha for a month each, and Kassel for two weeks, arriving at Frankfurt on 31 May. The following morning, he was detained at an inn by Frederick's agents, who held him in the city for over three weeks while Voltaire and Frederick argued by letter over the return of a satirical book of poetry Frederick had lent to Voltaire. Marie Louise joined him on 9 June. She and her uncle only left Frankfurt in July after she had defended herself from the unwanted advances of one of Frederick's agents, and Voltaire's luggage had been ransacked and valuable items taken.[94]/nVoltaire's attempts to vilify Frederick for his agents' actions at Frankfurt were largely unsuccessful, including his M\u00e9moires pour Servir \u00e0 la Vie de M. de Voltaire, published posthumously, in which he also explicitly made mention of Frederick's homosexuality, when he described how the king regularly invited pages, young cadets or lieutenants from his regiment to have coffee with him and then withdrew with the favourite for a quickie.[95][96] However, the correspondence between them continued, and though they never met in person again, after the Seven Years' War they largely reconciled.[97]/nVoltaire's slow progress toward Paris continued through Mainz, Mannheim, Strasbourg, and Colmar,[98] but in January 1754 Louis XV banned him from Paris,[99] and he turned for Geneva, near which he bought a large estate (Les D\u00e9lices) in early 1755.[100] Though he was received openly at first, the law in Geneva, which banned theatrical performances, and the publication of The Maid of Orleans against his will soured his relationship with Calvinist Genevans.[101] In late 1758, he bought an even larger estate at Ferney, on the French side of the Franco-Swiss border.[102] The town would adopt his name, calling itself Ferney-Voltaire, and this became its official name in 1878.[103]/nEarly in 1759, Voltaire completed and published Candide, ou l'Optimisme (Candide, or Optimism). This satire on Leibniz's philosophy of optimistic determinism remains Voltaire's best-known work. He would stay in Ferney for most of the remaining 20 years of his life, frequently entertaining distinguished guests, such as James Boswell, Adam Smith, Giacomo Casanova, and Edward Gibbon.[c] In 1764, he published one of his best-known philosophical works, the Dictionnaire philosophique, a series of articles mainly on Christian history and dogmas, a few of which were originally written in Berlin.[46]/nFrom 1762, as an unmatched intellectual celebrity, he began to champion unjustly persecuted individuals, most famously the Huguenot merchant Jean Calas.[46] Calas had been tortured to death in 1763, supposedly because he had murdered his eldest son for wanting to convert to Catholicism. His possessions were confiscated, and his two daughters were taken from his widow and forced into Catholic convents. Voltaire, seeing this as a clear case of religious persecution, managed to overturn the conviction in 1765.[104]/nVoltaire was initiated into Freemasonry a little over a month before his death. On 4 April 1778, he attended la Loge des Neuf S\u0153urs in Paris, and became an Entered Apprentice Freemason. According to some sources, \"Benjamin Franklin\u00a0... urged Voltaire to become a freemason; and Voltaire agreed, perhaps only to please Franklin.\"[105][106][107] However, Franklin was merely a visitor at the time Voltaire was initiated, the two only met a month before Voltaire's death, and their interactions with each other were brief.[108]/nIn February 1778, Voltaire returned to Paris for the first time in over 25 years, partly to see the opening of his latest tragedy, Irene.[109] The five-day journey was too much for the 83-year-old, and he believed he was about to die on 28 February, writing \"I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition.\" However, he recovered, and in March he saw a performance of Irene, where he was treated by the audience as a returning hero.[46]/nHe soon became ill again and died on 30 May 1778. The accounts of his deathbed have been numerous and varying, and it has not been possible to establish the details of what precisely occurred. His enemies related that he repented and accepted the last rites from a Catholic priest, or that he died in agony of body and soul, while his adherents told of his defiance to his last breath.[110] According to one story of his last words, when the priest urged him to renounce Satan, he replied, \"This is no time to make new enemies.\"[111] However, this appears to have originated from a joke in a Massachusetts newspaper in 1856, and was only attributed to Voltaire in the 1970s.[112]/nBecause of his well-known criticism of the Church, which he had refused to retract before his death, Voltaire was denied a Christian burial in Paris,[113] but friends and relations managed to bury his body secretly at the Abbey of Scelli\u00e8res\u00a0[fr] in Champagne, where Marie Louise's brother was abb\u00e9.[114] His heart and brain were embalmed separately.[115]/nOn 11 July 1791, the National Assembly of France, regarding Voltaire as a forerunner of the French Revolution, had his remains brought back to Paris and enshrined in the Panth\u00e9on.[116][d] An estimated million people attended the procession, which stretched throughout Paris. There was an elaborate ceremony, including music composed for the event by Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try.[119]/nVoltaire had an enormous influence on the development of historiography through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:/nVoltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.[120]/nVoltaire's best-known histories are History of Charles XII (1731), The Age of Louis XIV (1751), and his Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. The Essay on Customs traced the progress of world civilization in a universal context, rejecting both nationalism and the traditional Christian frame of reference. Influenced by Bossuet's Discourse on Universal History (1682), he was the first scholar to attempt seriously a history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. He treated Europe as a whole rather than a collection of nations. He was the first to emphasize the debt of medieval culture to Middle Eastern civilization, but otherwise was weak on the Middle Ages. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and expanding literacy would lead to progress./nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die: \"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\" Voltaire's histories imposed the values of the Enlightenment on the past, but at the same time he helped free historiography from antiquarianism, Eurocentrism, religious intolerance and a concentration on great men, diplomacy, and warfare.[121][122] Yale professor Peter Gay says Voltaire wrote \"very good history\", citing his \"scrupulous concern for truths\", \"careful sifting of evidence\", \"intelligent selection of what is important\", \"keen sense of drama\", and \"grasp of the fact that a whole civilization is a unit of study\".[123]/nFrom an early age, Voltaire displayed a talent for writing verse, and his first published work was poetry. He wrote two book-long epic poems, including the first ever written in French, the Henriade, and later, The Maid of Orleans, besides many other smaller pieces.[citation needed]/nThe Henriade was written in imitation of Virgil, using the alexandrine couplet reformed and rendered monotonous for modern readers but it was a huge success in the 18th and early 19th century, with sixty-five editions and translations into several languages. The epic poem transformed French King Henry IV into a national hero for his attempts at instituting tolerance with his Edict of Nantes. La Pucelle, on the other hand, is a burlesque on the legend of Joan of Arc./nMany of Voltaire's prose works and romances, usually composed as pamphlets, were written as polemics. Candide attacks the passivity inspired by Leibniz's philosophy of optimism through the character Pangloss's frequent refrain that circumstances are the \"best of all possible worlds\". L'Homme aux quarante ecus (The Man of Forty Pieces of Silver) addresses social and political ways of the time; Zadig and others, the received forms of moral and metaphysical orthodoxy; and some were written to deride the Bible. In these works, Voltaire's ironic style, free of exaggeration, is apparent, particularly the restraint and simplicity of the verbal treatment.[124] Candide in particular is the best example of his style. Voltaire also has\u2014in common with Jonathan Swift\u2014the distinction of paving the way for science fiction's philosophical irony, particularly in his Microm\u00e9gas and the vignette \"Plato's Dream\" (1756)./nIn general, his criticism and miscellaneous writing show a similar style to Voltaire's other works. Almost all of his more substantive works, whether in verse or prose, are preceded by prefaces of one sort or another, which are models of his caustic yet conversational tone. In a vast variety of nondescript pamphlets and writings, he displays his skills at journalism. In pure literary criticism his principal work is the Commentaire sur Corneille, although he wrote many more similar works\u2014sometimes (as in his Life and Notices of Moli\u00e8re) independently and sometimes as part of his Si\u00e8cles.[125]/nVoltaire's works, especially his private letters, frequently urge the reader: \"\u00e9crasez l'inf\u00e2me\", or \"crush the infamous\".[126] The phrase refers to contemporaneous abuses of power by royal and religious authorities, and the superstition and intolerance fomented by the clergy.[127] He had seen and felt these effects in his own exiles, the burnings of his books and those of many others, and in the atrocious persecution of Jean Calas and Fran\u00e7ois-Jean de la Barre.[128] He stated in one of his most famous quotes that \"Superstition sets the whole world in flames; philosophy quenches them.\"[129]/nThe most oft-cited Voltaire quotation is apocryphal. He is incorrectly credited with writing, \"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.\" These were not his words, but rather those of Evelyn Beatrice Hall, written under the pseudonym S. G. Tallentyre in her 1906 biographical book The Friends of Voltaire. Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire's attitude towards Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius and his controversial book De l'esprit, but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire's attitude towards Helv\u00e9tius; it had been said Hall's summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, \"I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.\"[130] Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.[e]/nVoltaire's first major philosophical work in his battle against \"l'inf\u00e2me\" was the Trait\u00e9 sur la tol\u00e9rance (Treatise on Tolerance), exposing the Calas affair, along with the tolerance exercised by other faiths and in other eras (for example, by the Jews, the Romans, the Greeks and the Chinese). Then, in his Dictionnaire philosophique, containing such articles as \"Abraham\", \"Genesis\", \"Church Council\", he wrote about what he perceived as the human origins of dogmas and beliefs, as well as inhuman behavior of religious and political institutions in shedding blood over the quarrels of competing sects. Amongst other targets, Voltaire criticized France's colonial policy in North America, dismissing the vast territory of New France as \"a few acres of snow\" (\"quelques arpents de neige\")./nVoltaire also engaged in an enormous amount of private correspondence during his life, totalling over 20,000 letters. Theodore Besterman's collected edition of these letters, completed only in 1964, fills 102 volumes.[131] One historian called the letters \"a feast not only of wit and eloquence but of warm friendship, humane feeling, and incisive thought.\"[132]/nIn Voltaire's correspondence with Catherine the Great he derided democracy. He wrote, \"Almost nothing great has ever been done in the world except by the genius and firmness of a single man combating the prejudices of the multitude.\"[133]/nLike other key Enlightenment thinkers, Voltaire was a deist.[134] He challenged orthodoxy by asking: \"What is faith? Is it to believe that which is evident? No. It is perfectly evident to my mind that there exists a necessary, eternal, supreme, and intelligent being. This is no matter of faith, but of reason.\"[135][136]/nIn a 1763 essay, Voltaire supported the toleration of other religions and ethnicities: \"It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?\"[137]/nIn one of his many denunciations of priests of every religious sect, Voltaire describes them as those who \"rise from an incestuous bed, manufacture a hundred versions of God, then eat and drink God, then piss and shit God.\"[138]/nHistorians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as \"propagandistic\".[139] His Dictionnaire philosophique is responsible for the myth that the early Church had fifty gospels before settling on the standard canonical four as well as propagating the myth that the canon of the New Testament was decided at the First Council of Nicaea. Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church Fathers.[140] Furthermore, despite the death of Hypatia being the result of finding herself in the crossfires of a mob (likely Christian) during a political feud in 4th-century Alexandria, Voltaire promoted the theory that she was stripped naked and murdered by the minions of the bishop Cyril of Alexandria, concluding by stating that \"when one finds a beautiful woman completely naked, it is not for the purpose of massacring her.\" Voltaire meant for this argument to bolster one of his anti-Catholic tracts.[141] In a letter to Frederick the Great, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity:/nLa n\u00f4tre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infect\u00e9 le monde.[142]\"Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out.\"[143][144]/nIn La bible enfin expliqu\u00e9e, he expressed the following attitude to lay reading of the Bible:/nIt is characteristic of fanatics who read the holy scriptures to tell themselves: God killed, so I must kill; Abraham lied, Jacob deceived, Rachel stole: so I must steal, deceive, lie. But, wretch, you are neither Rachel, nor Jacob, nor Abraham, nor God; you are just a mad fool, and the popes who forbade the reading of the Bible were extremely wise.[145]/nVoltaire's opinion of the Bible was mixed. Although influenced by Socinian works such as the Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum, Voltaire's skeptical attitude to the Bible separated him from Unitarian theologians like Fausto Sozzini or even Biblical-political writers like John Locke.[146] His statements on religion also brought down on him the fury of the Jesuits and in particular Claude-Adrien Nonnotte.[147][148][149][150] This did not hinder his religious practice, though it did win for him a bad reputation in certain religious circles. The deeply Christian Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote to his father the year of Voltaire's death, saying, \"The arch-scoundrel Voltaire has finally kicked the bucket ...\"[151] Voltaire was later deemed to influence Edward Gibbon in claiming that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire in his book The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:/nAs Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire\u2014arts, science, literature, decay\u2014barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph\u2014and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion\u2014the abominable Manicheism of Candide, and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school\u2014viz., \"that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil.\"[152]/nHowever, Voltaire also acknowledged the self-sacrifice of Christians. He wrote: \"Perhaps there is nothing greater on earth than the sacrifice of youth and beauty, often of high birth, made by the gentle sex in order to work in hospitals for the relief of human misery, the sight of which is so revolting to our delicacy. Peoples separated from the Roman religion have imitated but imperfectly so generous a charity.\"[153] Yet, according to Daniel-Rops, Voltaire's \"hatred of religion increased with the passage of years. The attack, launched at first against clericalism and theocracy, ended in a furious assault upon Holy Scripture, the dogmas of the Church, and even upon the person of Jesus Christ Himself, who [he] depicted now as a degenerate.\"[154] Voltaire's reasoning may be summed up in his well-known saying, \"Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.\"/nAccording to Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin, the most significant Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire;[155] 30 of the 118 articles in his Dictionnaire philosophique dealt with Jews or Judaism, describing them in consistently negative ways.[156][157] For example, in Voltaire's A Philosophical Dictionary, he wrote of Jews: \"In short, we find in them only an ignorant and barbarous people, who have long united the most sordid avarice with the most detestable superstition and the most invincible hatred for every people by whom they are tolerated and enriched.\"[158] Telushkin states that Voltaire did not limit his attack to aspects of Judaism that Christianity used as a foundation, repeatedly making it clear that he despised Jews.[155]/nOn the other hand, Peter Gay, a contemporary authority on the Enlightenment,[155] also points to Voltaire's remarks (for instance, that the Jews were more tolerant than the Christians) in the Trait\u00e9 sur la tol\u00e9rance and surmises that \"Voltaire struck at the Jews to strike at Christianity\". Whatever anti-semitism Voltaire may have felt, Gay suggests, derived from negative personal experience.[159]/nArthur Hertzberg, a Conservative Rabbi, claims that Gay's second suggestion is also untenable, as Voltaire himself denied its validity when he remarked that he had \"forgotten about much larger bankruptcies through Christians\".[clarification needed][160] However, Bertram Schwarzbach's far more detailed studies of Voltaire's dealings with Jewish people throughout his life concluded that he was anti-biblical, not anti-semitic. His remarks on the Jews and their \"superstitions\" were essentially no different from his remarks on Christians.[161]/nVoltaire said of the Jews that they \"have surpassed all nations in impertinent fables, in bad conduct and in barbarism. You deserve to be punished, for this is your destiny.\"[162][163][164] He further said, \"They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and the Germans are born with blond hair. I would not be in the least bit surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race.\"[165][166][167]/nSome authors link Voltaire's anti-Judaism to his polygenism. According to Joxe Azurmendi this anti-Judaism has a relative importance in Voltaire's philosophy of history. However, Voltaire's anti-Judaism influenced later authors like Ernest Renan.[168]/nVoltaire did have a Jewish friend, Daniel de Fonseca, whom he esteemed highly, and proclaimed him as \"the only philosopher, perhaps, among the Jews of his time\".[169]/nVoltaire had also condemned the persecution of Jews on several occasions including in his work Henriade, and never advocated violence or attacks against them.[158][170] According to the historian Will Durant, Voltaire had praised the simplicity, sobriety, regularity, and industry of Jews, however subsequently, Voltaire became strongly anti-Semitic after some regrettable personal financial transactions and quarrels with Jewish financiers. In his Essai sur les moeurs Voltaire had denounced the ancient Hebrews using strong language; a Catholic priest had protested against this censure. The anti-Semitic passages in Voltaire's Dictionnaire philosophique were criticized by Isaac De Pinto in 1762. Subsequently, Voltaire agreed with the criticism of the anti-Semitic passages and stated that De Pinto's letter convinced that there are \"highly intelligent and cultivated people\" among the Jews and that he had been \"wrong to attribute to a whole nation the vices of some individuals\";[171] he also promised to revise the objectionable passages for forthcoming editions of the Dictionnaire philosophique, but failed to do so.[171]/nVoltaire's views about Islam were generally negative, and he found its holy book, the Quran, to be ignorant of the laws of physics.[172] In a 1740 letter to Frederick the Great, Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that \"is assuredly nothing any man can excuse\" and suggests that his following stemmed from superstition; Voltaire continued, \"But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven, where he received in part this unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder; that, to pay homage to this book, he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death: this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse, at least if he was not born a Turk, or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him.\"[173]/nIn 1748, after having read Henri de Boulainvilliers and George Sale,[174] he wrote again about Mohammed and Islam in \"De l'Alcoran et de Mahomet\" (\"On the Quran and on Mohammed\"). In this essay, Voltaire maintained that Mohammed was a \"sublime charlatan\".[f] Drawing on complementary information in Herbelot's \"Oriental Library\", Voltaire, according to Ren\u00e9 Pomeau, adjudged the Quran, with its \"contradictions, ... absurdities, ... anachronisms\", to be \"rhapsody, without connection, without order, and without art\".[175][176][177][178] Thus he \"henceforward conceded\"[178] that \"if his book was bad for our times and for us, it was very good for his contemporaries, and his religion even more so. It must be admitted that he removed almost all of Asia from idolatry\" and that \"it was difficult for such a simple and wise religion, taught by a man who was constantly victorious, could hardly fail to subjugate a portion of the earth.\" He considered that \"its civil laws are good; its dogma is admirable which it has in common with ours\" but that \"his means are shocking; deception and murder\".[179]/nIn his Essay on the Manners and Spirit of Nations (published 1756), Voltaire deals with the history of Europe before Charlemagne to the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, and that of the colonies and the East. As a historian, he devoted several chapters to Islam,[180][181][182] Voltaire highlighted the Arabian, Turkish courts, and conducts.[178][183][184] Here he called Mohammed a \"poet\", and stated that he was not an illiterate.[185] As a \"legislator\", he \"changed the face of part of Europe [and] one half of Asia.\"[186][187][188] In chapter VI, Voltaire finds similarities between Arabs and ancient Hebrews, that they both kept running to battle in the name of God, and sharing a passion for the spoils of war.[189] Voltaire continues that, \"It is to be believed that Mohammed, like all enthusiasts, violently struck by his ideas, first presented them in good faith, strengthened them with fantasy, fooled himself in fooling others, and supported through necessary deceptions a doctrine which he considered good.\"[190][191] He thus compares \"the genius of the Arab people\" with \"the genius of the ancient Romans\".[192]/nAccording to Malise Ruthven, as Voltaire learned more about Islam his opinion of the faith became more positive.[193] As a result, his play Mahomet inspired Goethe, who was attracted to Islam, to write a drama on this theme, though he completed only the poem \"Mahomets-Gesang\" (\"Mahomet's Singing\").[194]/nThe tragedy Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet (French: Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophete) was written in 1736 by Voltaire. The play is a study of religious fanaticism and self-serving manipulation. The character Muhammad orders the murder of his critics.[195] Voltaire described the play as \"written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect.\"[196]/nVoltaire described Muhammad as an \"impostor\", a \"false prophet\", a \"fanatic\" and a \"hypocrite\".[197][198] Defending the play, Voltaire said that he \"tried to show in it into what horrible excesses fanaticism, led by an impostor, can plunge weak minds\".[199] When Voltaire wrote in 1742 to C\u00e9sar de Missy, he described Mohammed as deceitful.[200][201]/nIn his play, Mohammed was \"whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.\"[202][203] After later having judged that he had made Mohammed in his play \"somewhat nastier than he really was\",[204] Voltaire claims that Muhammad stole the idea of an angel weighing both men and women from Zoroastrians, who are often referred to as \"Magi\". Voltaire continues about Islam, saying:/nNothing is more terrible than a people who, having nothing to lose, fight in the united spirit of rapine and of religion.[205]/nIn a 1745 letter recommending the play to Pope Benedict XIV, Voltaire described Muhammad as \"the founder of a false and barbarous sect\" and \"a false prophet\". Voltaire wrote: \"Your holiness will pardon the liberty taken by one of the lowest of the faithful, though a zealous admirer of virtue, of submitting to the head of the true religion this performance, written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect. To whom could I with more propriety inscribe a satire on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet, than to the vicar and representative of a God of truth and mercy?\"[206][207] His view was modified slightly for Essai sur les Moeurs et l'Esprit des Nations, although it remained negative.[138][208][209][210] In 1751, Voltaire performed his play Mohamet once again, with great success.[211]/nCommenting on the sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, Voltaire observed:/nThe Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East.[212]/nHe regarded Hindus as \"a peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves.\"[213] Voltaire was himself a supporter of animal rights and was a vegetarian.[214] He used the antiquity of Hinduism to land what he saw as a devastating blow to the Bible's claims and acknowledged that the Hindus' treatment of animals showed a shaming alternative to the immorality of European imperialists.[215]/nWorks attributed to Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit missionaries stationed in China.[g] Matteo Ricci was among the earliest to report on the teachings of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687.[216]/nTranslations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period,[217] particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who hoped to improve European morals and institutions by the serene doctrines of the East.[216][218] Voltaire shared these hopes,[219][220] seeing Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma.[221] He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.[221]/nConfucius has no interest in falsehood; he did not pretend to be prophet; he claimed no inspiration; he taught no new religion; he used no delusions; flattered not the emperor under whom he lived.../nWith the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional Ancien R\u00e9gime of Europe.[222] Voltaire wrote favourably of the idea, claiming that the Chinese had \"perfected moral science\" and advocating an economic and political system after the Chinese model.[222]/nVoltaire rejected the biblical Adam and Eve story and was a polygenist who speculated that each race had entirely separate origins.[223][224] According to William Cohen, like most other polygenists, Voltaire believed that because of their different origins, Black Africans did not entirely share the natural humanity of white Europeans.[225] According to David Allen Harvey, Voltaire often invoked racial differences as a means to attack religious orthodoxy, and the Biblical account of creation.[226] Other historians, instead, have suggested that Voltaire's support for polygenism was more heavily encouraged by his investments in the French Compagnie des Indes and other colonial enterprises that engaged in the slave trade.[227][228][229]/nHis most famous remark on slavery is found in Candide, where the hero is horrified to learn \"at what price we eat sugar in Europe\" after coming across a slave in French Guiana who has been mutilated for escaping, who opines that, if all human beings have common origins as the Bible taught, it makes them cousins, concluding that \"no one could treat their relatives more horribly\". Elsewhere, he wrote caustically about \"whites and Christians [who] proceed to purchase negroes cheaply, in order to sell them dear in America\". Voltaire has been accused of supporting the slave trade as per a letter attributed to him,[230][231][232] although it has been suggested that this letter is a forgery \"since no satisfying source attests to the letter's existence.\"[233]/nIn his Philosophical Dictionary, Voltaire endorses Montesquieu's criticism of the slave trade: \"Montesquieu was almost always in error with the learned, because he was not learned, but he was almost always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery.\"[234]/nZeev Sternhell argues that despite his shortcomings, Voltaire was a forerunner of liberal pluralism in his approach to history and non-European cultures.[235] Voltaire wrote, \"We have slandered the Chinese because their metaphysics is not the same as ours\u00a0... This great misunderstanding about Chinese rituals has come about because we have judged their usages by ours, for we carry the prejudices of our contentious spirit to the end of the world.\"[235] In speaking of Persia, he condemned Europe's \"ignorant audacity\" and \"ignorant credulity\". When writing about India, he declares, \"It is time for us to give up the shameful habit of slandering all sects and insulting all nations!\"[235] In Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations, he defended the integrity of the Native Americans and wrote favorably of the Inca Empire.[236]/nAccording to Victor Hugo: \"To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century.\"[237] Goethe regarded Voltaire as the greatest literary figure of modern times, and possibly of all time.[238] According to Diderot, Voltaire's influence would extend far into the future.[239][h] Napoleon commented that till he was sixteen he \"would have fought for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire, today it is the opposite\u00a0... The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic\"[240] (though he later criticized Voltaire's work Mahomet during his captivity on Saint Helena).[241] Frederick the Great commented on his good fortune for having lived in the age of Voltaire, and corresponded with him throughout his reign until Voltaire's death.[242] On May 12, 1760, Frederick wrote: \"For my part I shall go to Hades and tell Virgil that a Frenchman has surpassed him in his own art. I shall say as much to Sophocles and Euripides; I shall speak to Thucydides of your histories, to Quintus Curtius of your Charles XII; and perhaps I shall be stoned by these jealous dead because a single man has united all their different merits in himself.\"[243] In England, Voltaire's views influenced Godwin, Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Bentham, Byron and Shelley.[238] Macaulay made note of the fear that Voltaire's very name incited in tyrants and fanatics.[244][i]/nIn Russia, Catherine the Great had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762.[242][245] In October 1763, she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death. The content of these letters has been described as being akin to a student writing to a teacher.[246] Upon Voltaire's death, the Empress purchased his library, which was then transported and placed in The Hermitage.[247] Alexander Herzen remarked that \"The writings of the egoist Voltaire did more for liberation than those of the loving Rousseau did for brotherhood.\"[248] In his famous letter to N. V. Gogol, Vissarion Belinsky wrote that Voltaire \"stamped out the fires of fanaticism and ignorance in Europe by ridicule.\"[249]/nIn his native Paris, Voltaire was remembered as the defender of Jean Calas and Pierre Sirven.[238] Although Voltaire's campaign had failed to secure the annulment of la Barre's execution for blasphemy against Christianity, the criminal code that sanctioned the execution was revised during Voltaire's lifetime.[250] In 1764, Voltaire successfully intervened and secured the release of Claude Chamont, arrested for attending Protestant services. When Comte de Lally was executed for treason in 1766, Voltaire wrote a 300-page document in his defense. Subsequently, in 1778, the judgment against de Lally was expunged just before Voltaire's death. The Genevan Protestant minister Pomaret once said to Voltaire, \"You seem to attack Christianity, and yet you do the work of a Christian.\"[251] Frederick the Great noted the significance of a philosopher capable of influencing judges to change their unjust decisions, commenting that this alone is sufficient to ensure the prominence of Voltaire as a humanitarian.[251]/nUnder the French Third Republic, anarchists and socialists often invoked Voltaire's writings in their struggles against militarism, nationalism, and the Catholic Church.[252] The section condemning the futility and imbecility of war in the Dictionnaire philosophique was a frequent favorite, as were his arguments that nations can only grow at the expense of others.[253] Following the liberation of France from the Vichy regime in 1944, Voltaire's 250th birthday was celebrated in both France and the Soviet Union, honoring him as \"one of the most feared opponents\" of the Nazi collaborators and someone \"whose name symbolizes freedom of thought, and hatred of prejudice, superstition, and injustice.\"[254]/nJorge Luis Borges stated that \"not to admire Voltaire is one of the many forms of stupidity\" and included his short fiction such as Microm\u00e9gas in \"The Library of Babel\" and \"A Personal Library.\"[255] Gustave Flaubert believed that France had erred gravely by not following the path forged by Voltaire instead of Rousseau.[256] Most architects of modern America were adherents of Voltaire's views.[238] According to Will Durant:/nItaly had a Renaissance, and Germany had a Reformation, but France had Voltaire; he was for his country both Renaissance and Reformation, and half the Revolution.[237] He was first and best in his time in his conception and writing of history, in the grace of his poetry, in the charm and wit of his prose, in the range of his thought and his influence. His spirit moved like a flame over the continent and the century, and stirs a million souls in every generation.[257]/nVoltaire's junior contemporary Jean-Jacques Rousseau commented on how Voltaire's book Letters on the English played a great role in his intellectual development.[258] Having written some literary works and also some music, in December 1745 Rousseau wrote a letter introducing himself to Voltaire, who was by then the most prominent literary figure in France, to which Voltaire replied with a polite response. Subsequently, when Rousseau sent Voltaire a copy of his book Discourse on Inequality, Voltaire replied, noting his disagreement with the views expressed in the book:/nNo one has ever employed so much intellect to persuade men to be beasts. In reading your work one is seized with a desire to walk on all fours [marcher \u00e0 quatre pattes]. However, as it is more than sixty years since I lost that habit, I feel, unfortunately, that it is impossible for me to resume it.[259]/nSubsequently, commenting on Rousseau's romantic novel Julie, or the New Heloise, Voltaire stated:/nNo more about Jean-Jacques' romance if you please. I have read it, to my sorrow, and it would be to his if I had time to say what I think of this silly book.[260]/nVoltaire quipped that the first half of Julie had been written in a brothel and the second half in a lunatic asylum.[261] In his Lettres sur La Nouvelle Heloise, written under a pseudonym, Voltaire criticized Rousseau's grammatical mistakes:/nParis recognized Voltaire's hand and judged the patriarch to be bitten by jealousy.[260]/nIn reviewing Rousseau's book Emile, Voltaire dismissed it as \"a hodgepodge of a silly wet nurse in four volumes, with forty pages against Christianity, among the boldest ever known.\" He expressed admiration for the section titled Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar, calling it \"fifty good pages\u00a0... it is regrettable that they should have been written by\u00a0... such a knave.\"[262] He went on to predict that Emile would be forgotten within a month.[261]/nIn 1764, Rousseau published Lettres de la montagne on religion and politics. In the fifth letter he wondered why Voltaire had not been able to imbue the Genevan councilors, who frequently met him, \"with that spirit of tolerance which he preaches without cease, and of which he sometimes has need\". The letter continued with an imaginary speech in the voice of Voltaire, acknowledging authorship of the heretical book Sermon of the Fifty, which the real Voltaire had repeatedly denied.[263]/nIn 1772, when a priest sent Rousseau a pamphlet denouncing Voltaire, Rousseau responded by defending his rival:/nHe has said and done so many good things that we should draw the curtain over his irregularities.[263]/nIn 1778, when Voltaire was given unprecedented honors at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais,[264] an acquaintance of Rousseau ridiculed the event. This was met by a sharp retort from Rousseau:/nHow dare you mock the honors rendered to Voltaire in the temple of which he is the god, and by the priests who for fifty years have been living off his masterpieces?[265]/nOn 2 July 1778, Rousseau died one month after Voltaire.[266] In October 1794, Rousseau's remains were moved to the Panth\u00e9on near the remains of Voltaire.[267][j]/nLouis XVI, while incarcerated in the Temple, lamented that Rousseau and Voltaire had \"destroyed France\".[268][k]/nVoltaire perceived the French bourgeoisie to be too small and ineffective, the aristocracy to be parasitic and corrupt, the commoners as ignorant and superstitious, and the Church as a static and oppressive force useful only on occasion as a counterbalance to the rapacity of kings, although all too often, even more rapacious itself. Voltaire distrusted democracy, which he saw as propagating the idiocy of the masses.[270] Voltaire long thought only an enlightened monarch could bring about change, given the social structures of the time and the extremely high rates of illiteracy, and that it was in the king's rational interest to improve the education and welfare of his subjects. But his disappointments and disillusions with Frederick the Great changed his philosophy somewhat, and soon gave birth to one of his most enduring works, his novella Candide, ou l'Optimisme (Candide, or Optimism, 1759), which ends with a new conclusion of quietism: \"It is up to us to cultivate our garden.\" His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later. Candide was also burned, and Voltaire jokingly claimed the actual author was a certain 'Demad' in a letter, where he reaffirmed the main polemical stances of the text.[271]/nHe is remembered and honored in France as a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for civil rights (such as the right to a fair trial and freedom of religion) and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. The Ancien R\u00e9gime involved an unfair balance of power and taxes between the three Estates: clergy and nobles on one side, the commoners and middle class, who were burdened with most of the taxes, on the other. He particularly had admiration for the ethics and government as exemplified by the Chinese philosopher Confucius.[272]/nVoltaire is also known for many memorable aphorisms, such as \"Si Dieu n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inventer\" (\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\"), contained in a verse epistle from 1768, addressed to the anonymous author of a controversial work on The Three Impostors. But far from being the cynical remark it is often taken for, it was meant as a retort to atheistic opponents such as d'Holbach, Grimm, and others.[273]/nHe has had his detractors among his later colleagues. The Scottish Victorian writer Thomas Carlyle argued that \"Voltaire read history, not with the eye of devout seer or even critic, but through a pair of mere anti-catholic spectacles.\"[274]/nThe town of Ferney, where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life, was officially named Ferney-Voltaire in honor of its most famous resident, in 1878.[275] His ch\u00e2teau is a museum. Voltaire's library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg. In the Zurich of 1916, the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde Dada movement named their theater the Cabaret Voltaire. A late-20th-century industrial music group later adopted the same name. Astronomers have bestowed his name on the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire.[276]/nVoltaire was also known to have been an advocate for coffee, drinking it at every turn: fifty times a day, according to Frederick the Great; three times a day, said Wagniere.[277] It has been suggested that high amounts of caffeine stimulated his creativity.[278] His great-grand-niece was the mother of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Catholic philosopher and Jesuit priest.[279][280] His book Candide was listed as one of The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written, by Martin Seymour-Smith./nIn the 1950s, the bibliographer and translator Theodore Besterman started to collect, transcribe and publish all of Voltaire's writings.[281] He founded the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva where he began publishing collected volumes of Voltaire's correspondence.[281] On his death in 1976, he left his collection to the University of Oxford, where the Voltaire Foundation became established as a department.[282][283] The Foundation has continued to publish the Complete Works of Voltaire, a complete chronological series expected to reach completion in 2018 with around 200 volumes, fifty years after the series began.[283][284] It also publishes the series Oxford University Studies in the Enlightenment, begun by Bestermann as Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, which has reached more than 500 volumes.[283]/nVoltaire wrote between fifty and sixty plays (tragedies), including a few unfinished ones.[285] Among them are:/nYet...he never for a moment supposed that in this \"splendid outburst\" all France would accept enthusiastically the philosophy of this queer Jean-Jacques Rousseau who, from Geneva and Paris, was thrilling the world with sentimental romances and revolutionary pamphlets. The complex soul of France seemed to have divided itself into these two men, so different and yet so French. Nietzsche speaks of \"la gaya scienza, the light feet, wit, fire, grace, strong logic, arrogant intellectuality, the dance of the stars\"\u2014surely he was thinking of Voltaire. Now beside Voltaire put Rousseau: all heat and fantasy, a man with noble and jejune visions, the idol of la bourgeois gentile-femme, announcing like Pascal that the heart has its reason which the head can never understand.[269]/nIn French/nPrimary sources", "13991543": "Menedemus (Greek: \u039c\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2; fl. 3rd century BC) was a Cynic philosopher, and a pupil of the Epicurean Colotes of Lampsacus.[1] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius states that he used to go about garbed as a Fury, proclaiming himself a sort of spy from Hades:/nHe assumed the garb of a Fury, and went about saying that he had come from Hades to take notice of all who did wrong, in order that he might descend there again and make his report to the deities who live in that country. And this was his dress: a tunic of a dark colour reaching to his feet, and a purple girdle round his waist, an Arcadian hat on his head with the twelve signs of the zodiac embroidered on it, tragic buskins, a preposterously long beard, and an ashen staff in his hand.[1]/nHowever, Wilhelm Cr\u00f6nert argued[2] that this story is actually derived from one of the satires (the Necromancy) of Menippus,[3] and that parallels to this story can be found in the dialogues of Lucian, which are based on those of Menippus./nThe claim that Menedemus was originally a pupil of Colotes of Lampsacus, on the other hand, may be true. Two papyri from Herculaneum show that Menedemus disputed with Colotes on Epicurean opinions concerning poetry.[4]", "196218": "Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert (French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 f\u0281\u0251\u0303swa d\u0259 s\u025b\u0303 l\u0251\u0303b\u025b\u0281]; 26 December 1716 \u2013 9 February 1803) was a French poet, philosopher and military officer./nSaint-Lambert was born at Nancy and raised on his parents' estate at Affracourt, a village in Lorraine near Harou\u00e9, a seat of the Beauvau family, with whom he had close ties. He studied at the university at Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, but then spent several years at home recovering from an unidentified illness.[1] He often complained of poor health, but participated in military campaigns,[2] led a strenuous social life, and lived to be 86 years old.[citation needed]/nSaint-Lambert began writing poetry in his adolescence and belonged to Fran\u00e7oise de Graffigny's social circle in Lun\u00e9ville. By October 1733 he had already begun work on The Seasons, his major poetical work, which did not appear in print until 1769 (see 1769 in poetry).[3] All his life, he read his works in salons and to his friends, but did not rush to publish them.[citation needed]/nIn 1739, Saint-Lambert joined the Heudicourt regiment in the Lorraine Guards, in which his boyhood friend, Charles-Just, prince de Beauvau-Craon, was already a colonel, despite being only 19 years old. For much of the 1740s the two men fought side by side in the Italian campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession.[citation needed]/nSaint-Lambert spent the winter quarter in Lun\u00e9ville in 1745\u201346, and according to Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine Devaux, he became at that time the lover of the Marquise de Boufflers.[4] She was a sister of the prince de Beauvau, and the mistress of Stanislaus Leszczynski, who had been established in 1737 as duke of Lorraine.[citation needed]/nOver the winter of 1747\u201348, Voltaire and his entourage took up residence in Lun\u00e9ville. Saint-Lambert soon began a liaison with the great writer's mistress, \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet.[5] She was in her forties, and had had many lovers, but succumbed to a mad passion for Saint-Lambert and became pregnant with his child. The baby, a girl named Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Du Ch\u00e2telet, was born on 4 September 1749 in what at first seemed an easy delivery; but \u00c9milie contracted a fever and died on 10 September. The infant died in Lun\u00e9ville on 6 May 1751.[6]/n\u00c9milie was a brilliant and learned woman, known all over Europe for her translation of Newton. Her love affair and pregnancy created scandal and inspired satirical mirth; her death was a shock to everyone. Voltaire was shattered, and according to his friend Devaux, so was Saint-Lambert, who nonetheless moved to Paris around 1750 and to all appearances soon recovered from his grief.[7]/nIt was at this time that he gave himself the title Marquis de Saint-Lambert, to which he had no right; it was once claimed that he was not even of noble birth, but the evidence refuting that charge was published long ago.[8]/nIn 1752 he began the second of his two famous love affairs, with Sophie d'Houdetot. This relationship became noteworthy because in 1757, while Saint-Lambert was away on military duty in the Seven Years' War, Jean-Jacques Rousseau suddenly conceived a mad passion for Sophie, which he wrote about in his Confessions. In Rousseau's mind, she became identified with a character in the great novel he was then writing, Julie, ou la Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse. In the end, Sophie turned Rousseau away, saying that she loved Saint-Lambert.[9] She and Saint-Lambert remained together as a couple until his death in 1803, spending their last years in a cordial m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with her husband.[10]/nSaint-Lambert resigned from the army in 1758 and devoted the rest of his life to literature. He wrote several articles for Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die, published an essay on \"Luxury\" in 1764, brought out an edition of The Seasons with a selection of his other poetry and some short stories in 1769, and completed a multi-volume philosophical work in 1797\u201398, called Principe des m\u0153urs chez toutes les nations ou Cat\u00e9chisme universel (Principle of morals among all nations, or universal catechism).[11] He wrote the section on \"Siam\", and most likely also other parts of the first edition of Guillaume Thomas Fran\u00e7ois Raynals L'Histoire philosophique et politique des \u00e9tablissements et du commerce des Europ\u00e9ens dans les deux Indes.[12] He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1770.[citation needed]/nHe and Sophie outlived most of their contemporaries, however, and around 1800 members of a new generation wrote about them as relics of a legendary past. Count Louis-Mathieu Mol\u00e9 described the fabled lover as \"a little old man dressed in a hideous cotton dressing gown with a pattern of blue stripes and red bouquets, a wispy cotton bonnet on his head, using a cane walking stick with a gold knob as tall as he was to support his wobbly steps.\"[13] Chateaubriand used the couple as symbols of a discredited era, when he wrote that they \"both represented the opinions and the freedoms of a by-gone age, carefully stuffed and preserved: it was the eighteenth century expired and married in its manner. It was sufficient to remain steadfast in one's life for illegitimacies to become legitimacies.\"[14]", "39419519": "Saviour Montebello (1762\u20131809) was a Maltese Doctor of Theology, a professor of philosophy at the University of Malta, and a  Parish priest of Bormla.[1] After Napoleon took over the Maltese islands in 1798, Montebello took an active part in the resistance of the Maltese against the French around his home-town at \u017bejtun. Afterwards, when the French Napoleonic forces had been ousted, and the British set up a provisional government in Malta, he was the first to be appointed to the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta. He held the office for almost four years, mainly teaching logic and metaphysics. He relinquished the Chair because he was appointed parish priest of Bormla, the last to hold the office under this title because subsequently the parish was promoted to a Collegiate led by Archpriests. He held the office of parish priest for only five years due to his premature death at the age of 46.[2]/nSaviour Montebello,[3] son of Joseph (1730[4]\u20131768[5]) and Catherine n\u00e9e Caruana (1731[6]\u2013?[7]), was born at \u017bejtun, Malta, on 9 June 1762.[8] His parents had married at \u017bejtun parish church of St. Catherine of Alexandria on 26 September 1752.[9] and Saviour was their fourth child out of six.[10] He was baptised on the same day of his birth at \u017bejtun's parish church by the deputy parish priest, Joseph Saliba, and given the names Saviour, Francis Xavier and Anthony. His godparents were Joseph Buttigieg, son of Luke, and Rose, wife of Francis Bugeja, both from the \u017bejtun parish.[11]/nAt the age of 19, in 1781, Montebello entered the bishop's seminary at Floriana to study for the priesthood.[12] As was required at the time, his family donated him with a patrimony which could pay for his seminary expenses. This consisted of four properties: two partitions of grasslands around Tas-Sil\u0121 (limits of \u017bejtun), and two edifices at \u017bejtun's village centre. The patrimony was temporarily entrusted to the administration of Michael Pulis,[13] the husband of Montebello's older sister, Mary.[14]/nMontebello was ordained a priest in 1787, six years after entering the seminary,[15] most probably by the then Bishop of Malta, Carmelo Scicluna (bishop between 1875 and 1888).[16] Thereafter, Montebello seems to have been stably assigned to pastoral work within and around the parish of \u017bejtun. Such work does not appear to have hindered him from studying for his Doctorate in Theology. This seems to have been done in Malta (and not abroad). In this case his studies would probably have been pursued, as was normally done, at the Collegium Melitense in Valletta. By 1797, that is ten years after his ordination, he had already acquired his S.T.D.[17]/nMontebello was well connected through his family. His cousin, Giuseppe Montebello (1713[18]\u20131833[19]), from Tarxien, was the son of Montebello's uncle, Peter,[20] and a well-heeled merchant.[21] He was Capo di Casal Tarxien (Head of Tarxien),[22] elected by the gentry there[23] to represent them in all administrative matters.[24] During the French presence in Malta (1798), he was chosen to be part of the committee administering one of the twelve municipalities created by Napoleon, that which included Tarxien, \u017bejtun, \u017babbar and G\u0127axaq.[25] Only three months later, however, Montebello was very much involved in the organised resistance of the Maltese against the French between 1798 and 1800. As head of the local provisional government at Tarxien,[26] he was appointed capo battaglione (battalion leader) with operational responsibilities around that locality.[27] Together with others, he contributed financially to the two-year war effort,[28] and also donated (on 24 December 1798) a considerable part of his wealth to procure wheat and other supplies from Sicily to ease the food shortage that ensued from the revolt.[29] When the British provisionally took over the government of the Maltese islands instead of the French Republican Commission, Giuseppe was elected by the gentry at Tarxien (18 February 1799) to be head of their locality, and thus part of the National Congress created by the representative of the British provisional government, Alexander Ball.[30] Later, Giuseppe was appointed Logotenente di Governo (Government Lieutenant) of Tarxien.[31] Afterwards, when the British officially became lords of the land, and partitioned the Maltese islands into six districts, Giuseppe was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the district comprising Tarxien, Paola, \u017bejtun, \u017babbar, Gudja and Luqa (28 June 1815).[32] Giuseppe's house at Tarxien, built by government funds as recompense for his share in the revolt,[33] still stands unto this day, and is a tourist attraction.[34]/nAnother influential close relative, Giuseppe Pulis Montebello (1783\u20131855), was Montebello's nephew.[35] He was from \u017bejtun and resided in Valletta together with his Italian wife Carlotta Bertelli.[36] Giuseppe lived for many years in Livorno, Italy, where he married.[37] They had at least five children.[38] He and his wife settled in Malta for just a decade or so, and returned to Livorno a few months before Giuseppe's death in 1855.[39] He was a well-off and self-sufficient merchant.[40] He too was elected to the National Assembly (1849\u201354).[41] He was very popular with voters, obtaining the largest number of popular votes.[42] Three publications of his are known. In 1824 he published Chtieb il Kari Yau Dahla\u2019al ilsien Malti (A Book of Maltese Reading or An Introduction to the Maltese Language);[43] in 1826 Trattat Fuq l\u2019Obblighi Tal-Bniedem (A Treatise on the Duties of Man);[44] and in 1847 Rendiconto pratico del Campo Esperimentale dell\u2019Est (A practical Statement on the Experimental Camp in the East).[45] The first two are credited to be the first books written entirely in the Maltese language.[46]/nTogether with many others, including his uncle Giuseppe, between 1798 and 1800 Montebello was part of the resistance of the Maltese against the French.[47] He was stationed at \u017bejtun (at Tal-Borg),[48] and gave his share within a team of resistance fighters. The team's job was to intercept any manoeuvring by or to the French troops blockaded in Valletta through the road leading to Cottonera from the east, and to organise and manage supplies around that area. Despite some skirmishes\u2015which had even left some casualties on both sides[49]\u2015Montebello's involvement does not seem to have been military, as some suggested,[50] but rather of a logistical nature. In fact, together with two others (Luigi Agius, a doctor of canon and civil law, and Vincenzo Borg, later a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George) Montebello served as consultore legale (legal adviser) under the command of Giuseppe Abela.[51] The team's General Headquarters was situated at San Giuseppe (Hamrun), under the general command of Francesco Saverio Caruana.[52] Caruana was a Monsignor[53] who had studied philosophy under Michael Xerri.[54] He was professor of philosophy and mathematics at the bishop\u2019s seminary at Mdina,[55] and later appointed Bishop of Malta (1831\u201347).[56]/nFollowing the French capitulation on 5 September 1800,[57] Montebello was appointed professor of the chair of philosophy at the University of Malta. The chair had been suspended by Napoleon on 18 June 1798,[58] but then reinstated by the British by Alexander Ball. On 5 November 1800,[59] Montebello was chosen to be professor of logic and metaphysics,[60] with an honorarium of 200 scudi per annum.[61] He was chosen for this office by the newly appointed rector, Saverio Caruana,[62] Montebello\u2019s former \u2018priest-in-arms\u2019. This was done with the approval of Malta\u2019s provisional government (which included Montebello's cousin, Giuseppe).[63]/nOn the day of his appointment, 5 November,[64] together with the other newly appointed professors, Montebello called on the rector at his residence in Valletta to thank him for their appointments. Caruana received them most kindly and, as was formerly the practice during the time of the Knights Hospitallers,[65] they all proceeded to the palace of the bishop, Vincenzo Labini,[66] in Valletta who then administered to them the oath of office. On the following day, 6 November,[67] professors, students and members of the better educated classes assembled in the main hall of the University of Malta in Valletta, where the Augustinian Vincenzo Thei (the professor of moral theology), delivered a solemn oration for the success of the new studies. The British governor, Alexander Ball, was also present for the occasion. Lectures started a week later, on 13 November, after the solemn intonation of the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus in the university  church, also at Valletta. Then each professor went to his lecture room and gave a public lecture./nMontebello's academic remit at the university was of two hours every week.[68] A welcome development occurred on 13 March 1802, when the British governor, Alexander Ball, re-established the practice of conferring degrees, thus giving more weight to the academic institution. In the following month the first ceremony of the conferrement of degrees under British rule was held.[69] This must have brought on, a few months later, on 5 May 1802, the increase in salary of the university professors, including Montebello's, from two to three hundred scudi per annum by the British Civil Commissioner, Charles Cameron.[70] Following these developments, no other events of note seem to have occurred at the university up till 1813,[71] well after Montebello's time there./nMontebello relinquished the chair of philosophy in 1804 when he was appointed by Bishop Vincenzo Labini[72] as parish priest of Civitatis Cospiqu\u00e6 (Bormla).[73] On 3 October of that year, he was succeeded at the university by the professor of humanistic literature and secretary of the university, Peter Mallia, a doctor of canon and civil law.[74]/nMontebello became vicar (or Parochus pr\u00e6lectus)[75] of Bormla on 23 June 1804,[76] and immediately took up residence there[77] together with his sister Vincenza. He took official possession of the parish (as Parochus et Rector)[78] on the following 26 July.[79] He was the sixteenth parish priest of Bormla[80] since the parish\u2019s inception on 15 September 1586.[81] However, as it happened, he was also its last parish priest, since in 1822, during the tenure of Montebello's successor as parish priest, Giuseppe Bezzina, the parish became a Collegiate by decree of Pope Pius VII.[82]/nApart from the usual pastoral duties as parish priest, at Bormla, Montebello founded, in May 1805, the Confraternity of St. Agatha[83] and a few months later, on 15 September 1805, the Confraternity of St. Michael.[84]/nMontebello remained parish priest for five years.[85] Unfortunately, he died suddenly and prematurely at his residence in Bormla[86] on 18 April 1809,[87] seven weeks before his 47th birthday,.[88] Though the last baptism he administered was just two days before his death, on the 16th,[89] he was apparently too ill to officiate at a marriage celebrated less than a week before, on the 11th.[90] Oddly enough, his funeral was not held at Bormla, as would have been normal practice, but at the parish church of his birthplace, \u017bejtun, with the participation of the clergy serving at Bormla.[91] Stranger still, for some reason yet unknown he was not buried at \u017bejtun but was transported again, this time to Valletta, and buried in the crypt of the Collegiate church of St. Paul's Shipwreck,[92] in the part reserved for priests.[93] In gratitude towards the clergy of Bormla, a few days after the funeral, on the 23rd, his sister, Vincenza Montebello, donated 50 scudi to the Bormla collagate per i poveri di Cospicua (for the poor of Bormla).[94] Several masses were sung by the Bormla clergy for his repose on the anniversary of his death in the succeeding five years (until 1814).[95] More masses were sung for his repose by the clergy at \u017bejtun almost fifty years later, in 1855, and in succeeding years, by bequest of Giuseppe Pulis Montebello.[96]/nThere is as yet no indication that Montebello ever published any works, philosophical or otherwise. In all probability he did not./nHis class notes on logic and metaphysics, subjects which he taught for four years at the University of Malta, do not seem to have survived, not even in indirect form (by his students). At least, nothing is yet known about their whereabouts. Having said this, however, it might not be irrelevant to point out that the hundreds of manuscripts held at the archive of the Collegiate of Bormla\u2015one likely place where Montebello's writings might be held\u2015are still not catalogued. This, as yet, makes it impossible to know for sure whether anything of his philosophical notes survived.

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "228998": "Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 \u2013 15 December 2011) was a British author, journalist and educator.[27][28] Author of 18 books on faith, culture, politics, and literature, he was born and educated in Britain, graduating in the 1970s from Oxford with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. In the early 1980s, he emigrated to the United States and wrote for The Nation and Vanity Fair. Known as \"one of the 'four horsemen'\" of New Atheism, he gained prominence as a columnist and speaker. His epistemological razor, which states that \"what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\", is still of mark in philosophy and law.[29][30]/nHitchens's political views evolved greatly throughout his life.[31] Originally describing himself as a democratic socialist,[32] he was a member of various socialist organisations in his early life, including the Trotskyist International Socialists.[33] He was critical of aspects of American foreign policy, including its involvement in Vietnam, Chile and East Timor. However, he also supported the United States in the Kosovo War. Hitchens has emphasized the centrality of the American Revolution and Constitution to his political philosophy.[34] Hitchens held complex views on abortion; being ethically opposed to it in most instances, and believing that a foetus was entitled to personhood, while holding ambiguous, changing views on its legality.[35] He allegedly supported gun rights and supported same-sex marriage, while opposing the war on drugs.[36][37] Beginning in the 1990s, and particularly after 9/11, his politics were widely viewed as drifting to the right, but Hitchens objected to being called conservative.[38][31][39] During the 2000s, he argued for the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, endorsed the re-election campaign of George W. Bush in 2004, and viewed Islamism as the principal threat to the Western world.[40][41]/nHitchens described himself as an anti-theist and saw all religions as false, harmful and authoritarian.[42] He argued for free expression, scientific discovery, and the separation of church and state, arguing that they were superior to religion as an ethical code of conduct for human civilisation.  Hitchens notably wrote critical biographies of Catholic nun Mother Teresa in The Missionary Position, President Bill Clinton in No One Left To Lie To, and American diplomat Henry Kissinger in The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Hitchens died from complications related to oesophageal cancer in December 2011, at the age of 62.[43]/nHitchens was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, the elder of two boys; his brother, Peter, became a socially conservative journalist.[44] Their parents, Eric Ernest Hitchens (1909\u20131987) and Yvonne Jean Hitchens (n\u00e9e Hickman; 1921\u20131973), met in Scotland when serving in the Royal Navy during World War II.[45] His mother had been a Wren, a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service.[46] She was of Jewish origin (Christopher and his brother were 1/32 ethnically Jewish), something Hitchens discovered when he was 38; he came to identify as a Jew.[47][48][49]/nHitchens often referred to Eric simply as 'the commander'. Eric was deployed on HMS\u00a0Jamaica, which took part in the sinking of the German battleship Scharnhorst in the Battle of the North Cape on 26 December 1943. He paid tribute to his father's contribution to the war: \"Sending a Nazi convoy raider to the bottom is a better day's work than any I have ever done.\" Eric's naval career required the family to move from base to base throughout Britain and its colonies, including to Malta, where Peter Hitchens was born in Sliema in 1951.[50] Eric later worked as a bookkeeper for boatbuilders, speedboat-manufacturers, and a prep school.[45][51]/nHitchens attended two independent schools\u2014Mount House School, Tavistock, Devon, from the age of eight, and the Leys School in Cambridge.[52] Hitchens was admitted to Balliol College, Oxford in 1967 where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics and was tutored by Steven Lukes and Anthony Kenny. He graduated in 1970 with a third-class degree.[44][53] In his adolescence, he was \"bowled over\" by Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley, Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, R. H. Tawney's critique on Religion and the Rise of Capitalism, and the works of George Orwell.[46] In 1968, he took part in the TV quiz show University Challenge.[54][55]/nIn the 1960s Hitchens joined the political left, drawn by disagreement over the Vietnam War, nuclear weapons, racism and oligarchy, including that of \"the unaccountable corporation\".[56] He expressed affinity with the politically charged countercultural and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He avoided the recreational drug use of the time, saying \"in my cohort we were slightly anti-hedonistic\u00a0... it made it very much easier for police provocation to occur, because the planting of drugs was something that happened to almost everyone one knew.\"[57] Hitchens was inspired to become a journalist after reading a piece by James Cameron.[52]/nHitchens was bisexual during his younger days, and joked that as he aged, his appearance \"declined to the point where only women would go to bed with [him].\"[58] He said he had sexual relations with two male students at Oxford who would later become Tory ministers during the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, although he would not reveal their names publicly.[58]/nHitchens joined the Labour Party in 1965, but along with the majority of the Labour students' organisation was expelled in 1967, because of what Hitchens called \"Prime Minister Harold Wilson's contemptible support for the war in Vietnam.\"[59] Under the influence of Peter Sedgwick, who translated the writings of Russian revolutionary and Soviet dissident Victor Serge, Hitchens forged an ideological interest in Trotskyism and anti-Stalinist socialism.[46] Shortly after, he joined \"a small but growing post-Trotskyist Luxemburgist sect\" the International Socialists. [60][61] Hitchens recruited James Fenton to the International Socialists.[62]/nEarly in his career Hitchens began working as a correspondent for the magazine International Socialism,[63] published by the International Socialists, the forerunners of today's British Socialist Workers Party. This group was broadly Trotskyist, but differed from more orthodox Trotskyist groups in its refusal to defend communist states as \"workers' states\". Their slogan was \"Neither Washington nor Moscow but International Socialism\"./nIn 1971 after spending a year travelling the United States on a scholarship, Hitchens went to work at the Times Higher Education Supplement where he served as a social science correspondent.[64] Hitchens was fired after six months in the job.[64] Next he was a researcher for ITV's Weekend World.[65]/nIn 1973 Hitchens went to work for the New Statesman, where his colleagues included the authors Martin Amis, whom he had briefly met at Oxford, as well as Julian Barnes and James Fenton, with whom he had shared a house in Oxford.[65] Amis described him at the time as, \"handsome, festive [and] gauntly left-wing\".[66] Around that time, the Friday lunches began, which were attended by writers including Clive James, Ian McEwan, Kingsley Amis, Terence Kilmartin, Robert Conquest, Al Alvarez, Peter Porter, Russell Davies and Mark Boxer. At the New Statesman Hitchens acquired a reputation as a left-winger while working as a war correspondent from areas of conflict such as Northern Ireland, Libya, and Iraq.[65]/nIn November 1973, while in Greece, Hitchens reported on the constitutional crisis of the military junta. It became his first leading article for the New Statesman.[52] In December 1977 Hitchens interviewed Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, a conversation he later described as \"horrifying\".[67] In 1977, unhappy at the New Statesman, Hitchens defected to the Daily Express where he became a foreign correspondent. He returned to the New Statesman in 1978 where he became assistant editor and then foreign editor.[65]/nHitchens went to the United States in 1981 as part of an editor exchange programme between the New Statesman and The Nation.[68] After joining The Nation, he penned vociferous critiques of Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and American foreign policy in South and Central America.[47][69][70][71][72][73]/nHitchens became a contributing editor of Vanity Fair in 1992,[74] writing ten columns a year. He left The Nation in 2002 after profoundly disagreeing with other contributors over the Iraq War.[75]/nThere is speculation that Hitchens was the inspiration for Tom Wolfe's character Peter Fallow in the 1987 novel The Bonfire of the Vanities,[70] but others\u2014including Hitchens\u2014believe it to be Spy Magazine's \"Ironman Nightlife Decathlete\", Anthony Haden-Guest.[76] In 1987, Hitchens's father died from cancer of the oesophagus, the same disease that would later claim his own life.[77] In April 2007, Hitchens became a US citizen; he later stated that he saw himself as Anglo-American.[78]/nHe became a media fellow at the Hoover Institution in September 2008.[79] At Slate, he usually wrote under the news-and-politics column Fighting Words.[80]/nHitchens spent part of his early career in journalism as a foreign correspondent in Cyprus.[81] Through his work there he met his first wife Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, with whom he had two children, Alexander and Sophia. His son, Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens, born in 1984, has worked as a policy researcher in London. Hitchens continued writing essay-style correspondence pieces from a variety of locales, including Chad, Uganda[82] and the Darfur region of Sudan.[83] In 1991, he received a Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction.[84]/nHitchens met Carol Blue in Los Angeles in 1989 and they married in 1991. Hitchens called it love at first sight.[85] In 1999, Hitchens and Blue, both harsh critics of President Clinton, submitted an affidavit to the trial managers of the Republican Party in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Therein they swore that their then-friend Sidney Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker. This allegation contradicted Blumenthal's own sworn deposition in the trial,[86] and it resulted in a hostile exchange of opinion in the public sphere between Hitchens and Blumenthal. Following the publication of Blumenthal's The Clinton Wars, Hitchens wrote several pieces in which he accused Blumenthal of manipulating the facts.[86][87] The incident ended their friendship and sparked a personal crisis for Hitchens, who was stridently criticised by friends for what they saw as a cynical and ultimately politically futile act.[47]/nBefore Hitchens's political shift, the American author and polemicist Gore Vidal was apt to speak of Hitchens as his \"dauphin\" or \"heir\".[88][89] In 2010 Hitchens attacked Vidal in a Vanity Fair piece headlined \"Vidal Loco\", calling him a \"crackpot\" for his adoption of 9/11 conspiracy theories.[90][91] On the back of Hitchens's memoir Hitch-22, among the praise from notable figures, Vidal's endorsement of Hitchens as his successor is crossed out in red and annotated \"NO, C.H.\" Hitchens's strong advocacy of the war in Iraq gained him a wider readership, and in September 2005 he was named as fifth on the list of the \"Top 100 Public Intellectuals\" by Foreign Policy and Prospect magazines.[92] An online poll ranked the 100 intellectuals, but the magazines noted that the rankings of Hitchens (5), Noam Chomsky (1), and Abdolkarim Soroush (15) were partly due to their respective supporters' publicising of the vote. Hitchens later responded to his ranking with a few articles about his status as such.[93][94]/nHitchens did not leave his position writing for The Nation until after the 11 September attacks, stating that he felt the magazine had arrived at a position \"that John Ashcroft is a greater menace than Osama bin Laden\".[95] The 11 September attacks \"exhilarated\" him, bringing into focus \"a battle between everything I love and everything I hate\" and strengthening his embrace of an interventionist foreign policy that challenged \"fascism with an Islamic face\".[73] His numerous editorials in support of the Iraq War caused some to label him a neoconservative, although Hitchens insisted he was not \"a conservative of any kind\", and his friend Ian McEwan described him as representing the anti-totalitarian left.[96] Hitchens recalls in his memoir having been \"invited by Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy to write an essay on political reconsiderations for his magazine La Regle du Jeu. I gave it the partly ironic title: 'Can One Be a Neoconservative?' Impatient with this, some copy editor put it on the cover as 'How I Became a Neoconservative.' Perhaps this was an instance of the Cartesian principle as opposed to the English empiricist one: It was decided that I evidently was what I apparently only thought.\" Indeed, in a 2010 BBC interview, he stated that he \"still [thought] like a Marxist\" and considered himself \"a leftist\".[97]/nIn 2007, Hitchens published one of his most controversial articles titled \"Why Women Aren't Funny\" in Vanity Fair. While providing no empirical evidence, he argued that there is less societal pressure for women to practice humour and that \"women who do it play by men's rules\".[98] Over the following year, Vanity Fair published several letters that it received, objecting to the tone or premise of the article, as well as a rebuttal by Alessandra Stanley.[99] Amid further criticism, Hitchens reiterated his position in a video and written response.[100][101]/nIn 2007 Hitchens's work for Vanity Fair won the National Magazine Award in the category \"Columns and Commentary\".[102]\nHe was a finalist in the same category in 2008 for some of his columns in Slate but lost out to Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone.[103] Hitch-22 was short-listed for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award for Autobiography. He won the National Magazine Award for Columns about Cancer in 2011.[104][105] Hitchens also served on the advisory board of Secular Coalition for America and offered advice to the Coalition on the acceptance and inclusion of nontheism in American life.[106] In December 2011, prior to his death, Asteroid 57901 Hitchens was named after him.[107]/nHitchens wrote a monthly essay in The Atlantic[108] and occasionally contributed to other literary journals. One of his books, Unacknowledged Legislation: Writers in the Public Sphere, collected these works. In Why Orwell Matters, he defends Orwell's writings against modern critics as relevant today and progressive for his time. In the 2008 book Christopher Hitchens and His Critics: Terror, Iraq, and the Left, many literary critiques are included of essays and other books of writers, such as David Horowitz and Edward Said./nDuring a three-hour In Depth interview on Book TV, he named authors who influenced his views, including Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, P. G. Wodehouse and Conor Cruise O'Brien.[109][110][111] When asked what the difference between an autobiography and a memoir was, he replied \"Look, everyone has a book inside of them ... which is exactly where I think it should, in most cases, remain\".[112]/nHitchens was a visiting professor in the following institutions:/nChristopher's sibling was the journalist and author Peter Hitchens, who is two years younger. Christopher said in 2005 the main difference between the two is belief in the existence of God.[116] Peter became a member of the International Socialists (forerunners of the modern Socialist Workers' Party) from 1968 to 1975 (beginning at age 17) after Christopher introduced him to them.[117]/nThe brothers fell out after Peter wrote a 2001 article in The Spectator which allegedly characterised Christopher as a Stalinist.[116][118] After the birth of Peter's third child, the brothers were reconciled.[119] Peter's review of God Is Not Great led to a public argument between the brothers but no renewed estrangement.[120]/nIn 2007 the brothers appeared as panellists on BBC TV's Question Time, where they clashed on a number of issues.[121] In 2008, in the US, they debated the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the existence of God.[122] In 2010 at the Pew Forum, the pair debated the nature of God in civilisation.[123] At the memorial service held for Christopher in New York, Peter read a passage from St Paul's Epistle to the Philippians[124] which Christopher himself had read at their father's funeral.[citation needed]/nMy own opinion is enough for me, and I claim the right to have it defended against any consensus, any majority, anywhere, anyplace, anytime. And anyone who disagrees with this can pick a number, get in line, and kiss my arse./n\u2014Christopher Hitchens[125]/nIn 2009 Hitchens was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the \"25 most influential liberals in the U.S. media\".[126] The article also noted that he would \"likely be aghast to find himself on this list\", as it reduces his self-styled radicalism to mere liberalism. Hitchens's political perspectives also appear in his wide-ranging writings, which include many dialogues.[127] He said of Ayn Rand's Objectivism, \"I have always found it quaint, and rather touching, that there is a movement in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.\"[128]/nHitchens disagreed with the premise of a Jewish homeland[129] and had said of himself, \"I am an Anti-Zionist. I'm one of those people of Jewish descent who believes that Zionism would be a mistake even if there were no Palestinians.\"[130]/nHaving long described himself as a socialist and a Marxist, Hitchens began his break from the established political left after what he called the \"tepid reaction\" of the Western left to the controversy over The Satanic Verses[citation needed], followed by what he saw as the left's embrace of Bill Clinton and the anti-war movement's opposition to NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s[citation needed]. He later became a so-called liberal hawk and supported the War on Terror, but he had some reservations, such as his characterisation of waterboarding as torture after voluntarily undergoing the procedure.[131][132] In January 2006, he joined four other individuals and four organisations, including the ACLU and Greenpeace, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, challenging Bush's NSA warrantless surveillance; the lawsuit was filed by the ACLU.[133][134]/nHitchens was an avid critic of President Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 of Serbia and other Serbian politicians of the 1990s. He called Milo\u0161evi\u0107 a \"fascist\" and a \"Nazi\" after the Bosnian genocide and ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo and expressed a positive reaction to his death. Hitchens often accused the Serbian government of committing numerous war crimes during the Yugoslav Wars. He denounced people like Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman, who criticized the NATO intervention there. Hitchens also criticized Croatian president Franjo Tu\u0111man and the policies of the Croatian government, which he saw as reviving \"Ustashe formations\".[135][136][137]/nHitchens held complex views on abortion; being ethically opposed to it in most instances, and believing that a fetus was entitled to personhood, while holding ambiguous and changing views on its legality.[138] In a 1988 interview with Crisis Magazine, Hitchens wrote: \"It might interest your readers to know that Margaret Thatcher voted to keep capital punishment, to keep homosexuality criminal, to make divorce harder to get, and for the abortion bill. I gather that she's since changed her position on the latter. My own vote would have been, as so often, exactly the reverse of hers.\"[35] However, Hitchens argued that the issue was cynically used by self-described pro-life politicians, and doubted that they sincerely desired to legally prohibit abortion.[138]/nIn the same 1988 interview with Crisis Magazine he stated:[35]/nOnce you allow that the occupant of the womb is even potentially a life, it cuts athwart any glib invocation of \"the woman's right to choose\"/nand that:[35]/nI would like to see something much broader, much more visionary. We need a new compact between society and the woman. It's a progressive compact because it is aimed at the future generation.  It would restrict abortion in most circumstances. Now I know most women don't like having to justify their circumstances to someone. 'How dare you presume to subject me to this?' some will say./nBut sorry, lady, this is an extremely grave social issue. It's everybody's business./nHitchens allegedly supported gun rights[36][139] and supported same-sex marriage.[140][141]/nHitchens was a supporter of the European Union. In an appearance on C-SPAN in 1993, Hitchens said, \"As of 1992, there is now a Euro passport that makes you free to travel within the boundaries of\u00a0... member countries, and I've always liked the idea of European unity, and so I held out for a Euro passport. So I travel as a European.\"[142] Speaking at the launch of his brother Peter Hitchens's book, The Abolition of Britain, at Conway Hall in London, Hitchens denounced the so-called Eurosceptic movement, describing it as \"the British version of fascism\". He went on to say, \"Scepticism is a title of honour. These people are not sceptical. They're fanatical. They're dogmatic\".[143]/nHitchens wrote book-length biographical essays on Thomas Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson: Author of America), Thomas Paine (Thomas Paine's \"Rights of Man\": A Biography) and George Orwell (Why Orwell Matters)./nHe also became known for excoriating criticisms of public contemporary figures, including Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger, the subjects of three full-length texts: The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice, No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton, and The Trial of Henry Kissinger respectively. In 2007, while promoting his book God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, Hitchens described the Christian evangelist Billy Graham as \"a self-conscious fraud\" and \"a disgustingly evil man\"[citation needed]. Hitchens claimed that the evangelist, who had recently been hospitalised for intestinal bleeding, made a living by \"going around spouting lies to young people. What a horrible career. I gather it's soon to be over. I certainly hope so.\"[citation needed]/nIn response to the comments, writers Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy published an article in Time in which, among other things, they challenged Hitchens's suggestion that Graham went into ministry to make money. They argued that during his career Graham \"turn[ed] down million-dollar television and Hollywood offers.\" They also pointed out that having established the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in 1950, Graham drew a straight salary, comparable to that of a senior minister, irrespective of the money raised by his meetings.[144]/nIn 1999, Hitchens wrote a profile of Donald Trump for The Sunday Herald. Trump had expressed interest in running in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election as a candidate for the Reform Party. Of Trump, Hitchens said, \"Because the man with many monikers in many ways embodies his country and because this election cycle is now so absurd, and so much up for grabs, it is unwise to exclude anything\u00a0... The best guess has to be that here's a man who hates to be alone, who needs approval and reinforcement, who talks a better game than he plays, who is crude, hyperactive, emotional and optimistic.\"[145] Hitchens had previously written that Trump demonstrated how \"nobody is more covetous and greedy than those who have far too much.\"[146]/nHitchens was an antitheist, and said that a person \"could be an atheist and wish that belief in God were correct\", but that \"an antitheist, a term I'm trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there's no evidence for such an assertion.\"[147] He often spoke against the Abrahamic religions. When asked by readers of The Independent (London) what he considered to be the \"axis of evil\", Hitchens replied \"Christianity, Judaism, Islam \u2013 the three leading monotheisms.\"[148] In debates Hitchens often posed what has become known as \"Hitchens's Challenge\": to name at least one moral action that a person without a faith (e.g., an atheist or antitheist) could not possibly perform, and conversely, to name one immoral action that only a person with a faith could perform or has performed in the past.[149][150]/nIn his best-seller God Is Not Great, Hitchens expanded his criticism to include all religions, including those rarely criticised by Western secularists, such as Hinduism, Buddhism and neo-paganism. Hitchens said that organised religion is \"the main source of hatred in the world\", calling it \"violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: [it] ought to have a great deal on its conscience\".[151] In the same work Hitchens says that humanity therefore needs a renewed Enlightenment.[152] The book received mixed responses, ranging from praise in The New York Times for his \"logical flourishes and conundrums\"[153] to accusations of \"intellectual and moral shabbiness\" in the Financial Times.[154] God Is Not Great was nominated for a National Book Award on 10 October 2007.[155]/nGod Is Not Great affirmed Hitchens's position in the \"New Atheism\" movement. Hitchens was made an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist International and the National Secular Society shortly after its release and he was later named to the Honorary Board of distinguished achievers of the Freedom From Religion Foundation.[156][157] He also joined the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America, a group of atheists and humanists.[106] Hitchens said he would accept an invitation from any religious leader who wished to debate with him. On 30 September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion lasting two hours. The event was videotaped and entitled \"The Four Horsemen\".[158] In it, Hitchens stated at one point that he saw the Maccabean Revolt as the most unfortunate event in human history due to the reversion from Hellenistic thought and philosophy to messianism and fundamentalism that its success constituted.[159][160]/nThat year Hitchens began a series of written debates on the question \"Is Christianity Good for the World?\" with Christian theologian and pastor Douglas Wilson, published in Christianity Today magazine.[161] This exchange eventually became a book with the same title published in 2008. During their promotional tour of the book, they were accompanied by the producer Darren Doane's film crew. Thence Doane produced the film Collision: Is Christianity GOOD for the World?, which was released on 27 October 2009.[162][163] On 4 April 2009, Hitchens debated William Lane Craig on the existence of God at Biola University.[164] On 19 October 2009, Intelligence Squared explored the question \"Is the Catholic Church a force for good in the world?\".[165] John Onaiyekan and Ann Widdecombe argued that it was, while Hitchens joined Stephen Fry in arguing that it was not. The latter side won the debate according to an audience poll.[166] On 5 October 2010, Hitchens debated with Tariq Ramadan, as to whether Islam was a religion of peace, at 92 NY.[167] On 26 November 2010, Hitchens appeared in Toronto, Ontario, at the Munk Debates, where he debated religion with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a convert to Roman Catholicism. Blair argued religion is a force for good, while Hitchens argued against that.[168]/nThroughout these debates, Hitchens became known for his persuasive and enthusiastic rhetoric in public speaking. \"Wit and eloquence\", \"verbal barbs and linguistic dexterity\" and \"self-reference, literary engagement and hyperbole\" are all elements of his speeches.[169][170][171] The term \"hitch-slap\" has been used as an informal term among his supporters for a carefully crafted remark designed to humiliate his opponents.[171][172] Hitchens's line \"one asks wistfully if there is no provision in the procedures of military justice for them to be taken out and shot,\" condemning the perpetrators of the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse, was cited by The Humanist as an example.[173] A tribute in Politico stated that this was a trait Hitchens shared with fellow atheist and intellectual Gore Vidal.[174]/nHitchens was raised nominally Christian and attended Christian boarding schools, but from an early age he declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side and that his Jewish ancestors were immigrants from Eastern Europe (including Poland).[52][175] Hitchens was married twice, first to Eleni Meleagrou, a Greek Cypriot, in 1981; the couple had a son, Alexander, and a daughter, Sophia.[176]/nIn 1991 Hitchens married his second wife, Carol Blue, an American screenwriter,[47] in a ceremony held at the apartment of Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation. They had a daughter together, Antonia.[47]/nHitchens considered reading, writing and public speaking not as a job or career but as \"what I am, who I am, [and] what I love.\"[177]/nIn November 1973 Hitchens's mother died by suicide in Athens in a pact with her lover, a defrocked clergyman named Timothy Bryan.[46] The pair overdosed on sleeping pills in adjoining hotel rooms and Bryan slashed his wrists in the bathtub. Hitchens flew alone to Athens to recover his mother's body, initially under the impression that she had been murdered./nIn 2007, after living in the US for 25 years, he became an American citizen (while retaining his UK citizenship).[178]/nOn 8 June 2010, Hitchens was on tour in New York promoting his memoirs Hitch-22 when he was taken into emergency care suffering from a severe pericardial effusion. Soon after, he announced he was postponing his tour to undergo treatment for oesophageal cancer.[179]/nIn a Vanity Fair piece titled \"Topic of Cancer\",[77] he stated that he was undergoing treatment for cancer.

He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare, and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent that we give them meaning.\"[190][191] Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, \"We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time.\"[192] Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012.[193][194][195][196]/nBritish Conservative and friend of Hitchens Douglas Murray paid tribute to Hitchens in an article in The Spectator, recalling personal experiences with him.[197]/nThree weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the New Statesman wrote, \"He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur.

He described the universe as a manifestation of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature, resulting in creation. His spiritual and social philosophies embraced diversity as the law of nature; a result of Singular Consciousness expressing itself in numerous forms. Sarkar advocated for the welfare of humans and the planet through his socio-economic philosophy of PROUT, which is rooted in the idea of Neohumanism, a worldview based on inter-connectedness of all beings./nSarkar was born during the full moon of the Indian month of Vaeshakh (Buddha Purnima), on 21 May 1921 (at 6:07 in the morning) to Lakshmi Narayan Sarkar, a homoeopathic doctor and Abharani Devi in the small town of Jamalpur,  Bihar.[8] His family hailed from Bamunpara (Brahmanpara), Burdwan District in West Bengal.[4]/nIn 1939 Sarkar left Jamalpur for Kolkata to attend Vidyasagar College of the University of Calcutta. Sarkar had to quit his studies to support his family after the death of his father, and from 1944 until the early 1950s, Sarkar worked as an accountant at the Indian railways headquarters in Jamalpur, Bihar. He taught the techniques of Yoga and Tantra meditation to a select number of his colleagues and gradually more people were drawn to the spiritual practices he taught.[4]/nIn 1955, Sarkar founded Ananda Marga (the Path of Bliss), a socio-spiritual movement with a two-part mission that Sarkar stated as \"self-realization and service to all\" with a spiritual practice that synthesized Vedic and Tantric philosophies. Sarkar's ideas are collected in the series of books called \"Subh\u00e1\u015bita Samgraha\", which form part of the philosophical scriptures of Ananda Marga ideology.[4]/nDuring the latter part of his life his main residence was in Lake Gardens in Kolkata, West Bengal. He also spent much time, especially early on, in the all-round development community he founded based on his PROUT theory at Anandanagar. Ananda Marga opened regional offices in various countries, including the US in 1969, and by 1973 had established approximately 100 local centres teaching yogic and social philosophies, with several thousand members, some living communally in the ashrams.[9][10]/nIn 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges.[4]/nIn 1979, Sarkar took two world tours to meet disciples in various countries around the world, including Switzerland, Germany, France, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Jamaica and Venezuela. He was barred from entering the US by the State Department, so instead he met his American disciples in Jamaica in 1979.[11] Just before he died on 21 October 1990 from a heart attack, he founded Ananda Marga Gurukula on 7 September 1990, an educational network to preserve and develop his legacy through research, teaching and service./n\"Critical of profit-motivated capitalism, hedonistic materialism, and religious dogma, Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar developed a Spiritual or Neo-Humanism bringing in spiritual, economic, social scientific, ecological, and moral themes to create a long term view of human progress; progress is the evolution of consciousness and movement directed toward the well-being of everyone. Basing his philosophy on love and respect for all things and the central human ideals of freedom, equality, and justice, Sarkar proposed that the physical, mental, and spiritual realms of humanity all need to be addressed in a vision of the future. A new social order \u2013 a \"moral society\" \u2013 is needed for the future, emphasizing cooperation over competition, collective welfare over profit, and transcendent ideals over self-interest. And finally, as a common theme that runs through many works, the idea of the New (or Second) Enlightenment, reflecting an ethical, psychological, and social transformation in humanity, has been proposed as a hopeful and preferable futurist vision for the world.\"/n\u2014Thomas Lombardo on Sarkar's philosophy.[12]/nSarkar's teachings on spiritual philosophy are a synthesis of Vedic and Tantric philosophies. He considered himself to be \"an incorrigible optimist\" in his thinking.[citation needed]/nSarkar described the universe as a result of macropsychic conation \u2013 the entire universe exists within the cosmic mind, which itself is the first expression of consciousness coming under the bondage of its own nature. He described the cosmological flow as being from limitless consciousness to limited consciousness and back to limitless consciousness, attained by meditation.[4]/nAccording to Sarkar's philosophy the individual mind is composed of five layers called Kosas:/nSarkar's \"biopsychology\" reimagined the traditional tantric belief in chakras (\"wheels\") as being due to interactions of subtle energies through nerve plexuses. He believed this connected the endocrine glands of the neuroendocrine system with a psychic part of the body. The philosophy of Ananda Marga considers the human body as composed of the same five fundamental factors as the rest of the universe as explained in Brahmachakra. Every factor is said to be distributed throughout the body, but governed by a chakra, substations of the mind which control their own assigned areas. The biopsychology of Ananda Marga expands the concept of the seven basic chakras and in general, mainly considers:[13]/n\"Microvita\" is plural for \"Microvitum\" and literally means \"possessing or with micro-life\". He believed that microvita are smaller and subtler than physical atoms and subatomic particles, and in the psychic realm contribute to \"pure consciousness\".[14] Sarkar claimed that they would be recognised by conventional science. Sarkar gave the intuitional theory of Microvita in 1986.[15]/nA central point in Sarkar's philosophy is the concept of Sadhana. He described Sadhana as a practice for \"the transformation of fearful love into fearless love\". For Sarkar, Sandhana was concretized by the practice of meditation. He recommended to his disciples the daily practice of individual meditation and the weekly practice of collective meditation. These weekly meetings of his disciples, called Dharma Chakras, are preceded by the collective singing of a few Prabhat Samgiita (or \"Songs of the New Dawn\", composed by P. R. Sarkar himself) followed by Baba Nam Kevalam kiirtan, then the mantra called Samgacchadvam. The mantra Nityam Shuddham marks the end of the collective meditation, then the spiritual gathering will end with the Guru Puja mantra.[4]/nThe concept of Varna describes four main socio-psychological types, whereby human psychological and physical endowment and social motivations are expressed: the Vipra (intellectual), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (acquisitor) and Shudra (labourer). Varna, in Sarkar's perspective, however is more than just a psychological trait but rather an archetype, approximately to Michel Foucault's notion of epistemes, which are broader frameworks of knowledge defining what is true and real.[16] Sarkar clarified that Varna is not the same as Hindu idea of \"caste\". He was an ardent advocate of building a casteless society, in which everyone gets equal opportunities to fulfil their highest human potential based on their physical, psychological and spiritual strengths. To materialize this, Sarkar propounded Prout./nSarkar's \"Law of Social Cycle\" applies these traits in a theory of historical evolution, where ages rise and fall in terms of ruling elites representing one of the above-mentioned traits. This \"law\" possibly connects to the earlier cyclical historical ideas of Sri Aurobindo, with a focus on the psychology of human development, as well as Ibn Khaldun, among other macrohistorians ideas about cycles. However, along with a cyclical dimension\u00a0\u2014 the rise and fall of ages\u00a0\u2014 Sarkar's theory exhibits a correspondent linear dimension, in that economic and technological \"progress\" are considered critical in terms of meeting the changing material conditions of life. Ultimately, for Sarkar, true progress has to prioritise development in the spiritual dimension.[citation needed]/nSpirituality for Sarkar is defined as the individual realising the \"true self\". In addition to yogic meditational practices and purity of thought and deed, Sarkar attached great importance to selfless social service as a means of liberation. Sarkar considered it necessary for the social arrangements to support the inner development of human beings and rejected both capitalism and communism as appropriate social structures for humanity to move forward to the golden age of a balanced way of life sustaining all-round progress. A serious problem with capitalism was according to Sarkar the concentration of wealth in a few hands and stoppages in the rolling of money which he considered root causes of recessions, even depressions. A spiritual way of life, however, would in no way be divorced from creating structures that help meet the basic, though ever changing, needs\u00a0\u2014 food, housing, clothing, health and education.[citation needed]/nSarkar developed both \u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga and the Progressive Utilization Theory as practical means to encourage harmony and co-operation to help society escape this proposed cycle. Sarkar argues that once the social cycle is understood and sadvipras evolved, then the periods of exploitation can be largely reduced, if not eliminated. With leadership that is representative of all aspects of the varnas \u2014 that is, the leader engaged in service, who is courageous, who uses the intellect for the benefits of others, and who has innovative/entrepreneurial skills\u00a0\u2014 the cycle can become an upward spiral.[17]\nSarkar's concept of karma samnyasa refers to the principle that a yogi becomes a person with all-round development and a balanced mind, that he called a sadvipra; and that this is accomplished by someone who remains fixed on the \"supreme\" consciousness through transformative personal practices and engaging in the politics of social liberation as a form of service work.[18]/nBy 1959, Sarkar had developed the socio-economic Progressive Utilization Theory (Prout).[19] In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book Ananda Sutram, published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00farti.[20] In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation \"Proutist Block of India\" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.[21] The PBI was soon superseded by \"Proutist Universal\" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).[when?]/nA Prout economy is cooperative and decentralised. Its focus is collective welfare rather than to profit, without neglecting individuals and their merits. \"Progressive utilization\" refers to the optimising the use of natural, industrial and human resources on a sustainable basis for the entire ecosystem. The theory claims to overcome the limitations of both capitalism and communism. It is inline with Sarkar's social theory of the Law of Social Cycle. The theory aims to encompass the whole of individual and collective existence for all beings, including physical, educational, social, political, mental, cultural and spiritual.[22][23]/nIn 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of human society with the introduction of his new theory of Neohumanism.[24]  If humanism tends to contemplate only humans in a human-centric view, Neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to universalism. Sarkar said \"When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.\"[24] Neohumanism is said to prefer existential value over utility value for all living beings./nSarkar's Neohumanism places great emphasis on rationality and encourages what he calls a \"protospiritual mentality,\" a process of continually recognising each object with which we come in contact, externally or internally, as a manifestation of the Supreme Consciousness (Brahma). According to Sarkar, rationality helps to give rise to devotion, which he consider to be the \"highest and most valuable treasure of humanity\".[24] In Sarkar's view, Neohumanism leads to the liberation of human intellect from the constraints of imposed dogma and the principle of selfish pleasure|dogma]] and psychic complexes helping to bridge the gap between the inner and outer worlds.[23][25]/nIn his series of discourses Talks on Prout, given in Ranchi in July 1961,[26] Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"[27]/nThe philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:/nIf the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \"the culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations [...] it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)[28]/nAlthough Sarkar spent only seventeen years of his life working full-time for his organisations (1966\u20131971 & 1978\u20131990), he left behind a vast legacy, including over 250 books written on a wide variety of topics. Many of this books are compilations or collections of speeches given by him during spiritual or social meetings. He is primarily known as the spiritual teacher behind Ananda Marga, but Sarkar wrote over 1500 pages on his socio-politico-economic Progressive Utilization Theory (PROUT), with several thousand more pages dedicated to linguistics and the study of languages; Sarkar's writings on linguistics included, among other works, Shabda Cayanika (\"A Collection of Words\"), an unfinished, twenty-six volume dictated encyclopaedia on the Bengali language.[29][self-published source?] Beyond this, he wrote books on sociology, agriculture, history, literature, education, medicine, cosmology, and philosophy, also notably founding the philosophy of Neohumanism in 1982[23][4] and the Theory of Microvita in 1986.[15] In his Theory of Microvita, Sarkar \"believed that the atoms and the subatomic particles throughout the boundless universe are imbued with life.\"[30]/nIn 1982 Sarkar started composing songs. In eight years, until the date of his death, He completed the composition of 5018 songs in multiple languages.[31] His collection of songs is called Prabhat Samgiita (\"Songs of the New Dawn\").[32]", "19889802": "Ellis Sandoz Jr. (February 10, 1931 \u2013 September 19, 2023) was an American academic and political scientist.

In 1266, he was attached to the Faculty of Arts in the University of Paris at the time when a riot erupted between the French and Picard \"nations\" of students\u2014a series of loosely organized fraternities. The papal legate threatened Siger with execution as the ringleader of the Picard attack on the French, but no further action was taken./nIn the ten years following the riot, he wrote the six works which are ascribed to him and were published under his name by Pierre Mandonnet in 1899. The titles of these treatises are:/nIn 1271, he was once more involved in a party struggle. The minority among the \"nations\" chose him as rector in opposition to the elected candidate, Aubri de Rheims. For three years the strife continued, and was probably based on the opposition between the Averroists, Siger and Pierre Dubois, and the more orthodox schoolmen. The matter was settled by the Papal Legate, Simon de Brion, afterwards Pope Martin IV. Siger retired from Paris to Li\u00e8ge./nSiger was accused of teaching \"double truth\"\u2014that is, saying one thing could be true through reason, and that the opposite could be true through faith. Because Siger was a scholastic, he probably did not teach double truths but tried to find reconciliations between faith and reason./nIn 1277, a general condemnation of Aristotelianism included a special clause directed against Boetius of Dacia and Siger of Brabant. Again Siger and Bernier de Nivelles were summoned to appear on a charge of heresy, especially in connection with the Impossibilia, where the existence of God is discussed. It appears, however, that Siger and Boetius fled to Italy and, according to John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, then perished miserably./nThe manner of Siger's death, which occurred at Orvieto, is not known. A Brabantine chronicle says that he was stabbed by a seemingly-insane secretary (a clerico suo quasi dementi). The secretary is said to have used a pen as the murder weapon and his critics claimed since he had done so much damage with his pen, he deserved what was coming. Dante, in the Paradiso (x.134\u20136), says that he found \"death slow in coming,\" and some have concluded that this indicates death by suicide. A 13th-century sonnet by one Durante (xcii.9\u201314) says that he was executed at Orvieto: \"a ghiado il fe' morire a gran dolore, Nella corte di Roma ad Orbivieto.\" The date of this may have been 1283\u20131284 when Pope Martin IV was in residence at Orvieto. His fellow radicals were lying low in the face of the Condemnations of 1277 and there was no investigation into his murder./nIn politics he held that good laws were better than good rulers, and criticised papal infallibility in temporal affairs. The importance of Siger in philosophy lies in his acceptance of Averroism in its entirety, which drew upon him the opposition of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas./nIn December 1270, Averroism was condemned by ecclesiastical authority, and during his whole life Siger was exposed to persecution both from the Church and from purely philosophic opponents./nIn Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy, Siger of Brabant is found in the Fourth Sphere of Paradise for being a positive example of Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.", "7208598": "Robert Redeker is a French writer and philosophy teacher.

In particular, secularization finds its centre in a process of \"temporalization of history\" thanks to which the categories of time (that translate Christian eschatology into a generic opening to the future: progress, revolution, liberation, etc.) gain an increasing centrality in the political representations of Modernity./nBased on these reflections, also exposed in After the Leviathan, 1995 (third edition in 2013) and The Passion of the Present, 2008, a clear thematization of the philosophical problem of time has grown up. In opposition to Henri Bergson's and Martin Heidegger's views, which delineate with different shades a pure form of temporality, more original than its representations and spatializations, Marramao declares that the link time-space is inseparable and, also connecting to contemporary Physics, he asserts that the structure of Time possesses an aporetic and impure profile, compared to which the dimension of space is the formal reference necessary to think its paradoxes (Minima temporalia, 1990, new edition in 2005; Kairos: Towards an Ontology of Due Time, 1992, new edition in 2005).", "30277296": "Alexander Broadie FRSE, Scottish philosopher, emeritus professor of logic and rhetoric at Glasgow University.

But at the end of this article, Talbott also ventured into more controversial territory, suggesting ways in which even the tragic suffering of innocent children might contribute, in the end, to the future blessedness of all people (including the children who suffer). In accordance with his affirmation of universal reconciliation, he thus expressed the hopeful belief that \"every innocent child who suffers will one day look upon that suffering as a privilege because of the joy it has made possible: the joy of knowing that one has been used by God in the redemption of others, the joy of that final union or reunion in which love's triumph is complete and all separation from others is finally overcome.

But Beversluis,\" Talbott insists, \"does not so much as identify the proposition that he claims logically commits me to the moral obligation he alleges; much less does he make the required deduction.\"[7]/nTalbott acknowledges, however, that his optimistic view could be regarded as a case of wishful thinking.

He retired in 2009, but was awarded the position of emeritus professor, and continued to teach courses and advise students until his death at 83 years of age./nHe was the first Swedish logician to work on model theory with his dissertation Some problems in Model Theory (for which the University of Uppsala awarded him a doctorate in 1960). His early work was in formal logic, and he established a reputation for brilliance early in his career with a series of proofs, including an independent proof of equivalent characterizations of omega-categorical theories. A 1959 paper of his in Theoria establishes what is still referred to as the 'Svenonius theorem' on decidability. One of his proponents in Sweden was Per Lindstr\u00f6m.[1]/nLars Svenonius' early work  was in the field of logic known as model theory, in which properties of the interpretations (\"models\") of theories are studied. This field was the object of intense study and saw great progress in the 1950s, largely due to the work of Alfred Tarski and his students at the University of California, Berkeley. At the same time it became much more mathematical, both in techniques and in the concepts used. Svenonius' work was of the modern mathematical\nvariety./nSvenonius' reputation as a mathematical model theorist was established with the publication of three papers in Theoria in 1959 and 1960:/nIn particular, paper (2) contains what is now called \"Svenonius' Theorem\", an important result on definability of predicates in first order theories. Even the statement of this result requires mathematical model-theoretic concepts. It states that if the interpretation of a predicate in any model of a first-order theory is invariant under permutations (\"automorphisms\") of the model fixing the other predicates, then the interpretation of that predicate is definable in every model by a formula involving only the other predicates; furthermore only finitely many such defining formulas are required. Beth's earlier definability theorem is a consequence of Svenonius' Theorem./nThe other two papers include a characterization of theories having only one countable model, obtained also by the Polish logician Czes\u0142aw Ryll-Nardzewski, and results on prime models, obtained also by Robert Vaught at Berkeley. All of these results are classics of modern model theory./nPresumably as a result of these papers he was named a visiting associate professor at The University of California, Berkeley, for 1962\u20131963, and gave an Invited Address at the International Symposium on the Theory of Models held there in 1963. His address was published in the Conference Proceedings (The Theory of Models, North-Holland Publishing Co., 1965) as \"On the denumerable models of theories with extra predicates\", pp 376\u2013389. In this paper he characterizes the countable (\"denumerable\") structures  which can be made into models of a theory by adding interpretations of the extra predicates used in defining the theory. His characterization involves (infinite) expressions beginning with an infinite sequence of alternating quantifiers. Such expressions are now interpreted using infinite\ntwo-person games. The importance of this work was only realized after it was rediscovered and extended by Robert Vaught in his work on descriptive set theory and infinitary logics.

Izetbegovi\u0107 led the Bosniak forces initially alongside the Croat forces, until a separate war erupted between them. Relations between the two sides were resolved in the Washington Agreement, which he signed with Croatian president Franjo Tu\u0111man./nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina continued, with widespread ethnic cleansing and other war crimes committed by mostly Serb forces against the Bosniak and Croat populations, eventually culminating in the massacre of male Bosniaks in Srebrenica by Serb forces, which would later be determined to be genocide. Izetbegovi\u0107 was also a signatory for the Dayton Agreement, which ended the war in a stalemate following NATO bombings, and recognized Republika Srpska as an autonomous entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. He continued to serve in this role until 1996, when he became a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, serving until 2000./nIzetbegovi\u0107 was the founder and first president of the Party of Democratic Action. He was also the author of several books, most notably Islam Between East and West and the Islamic Declaration./nIzetbegovi\u0107 was born on 8 August 1925 in the town of Bosanski \u0160amac.[1] While serving as a soldier in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, Izetbegovi\u0107's paternal grandfather Alija married a Turkish woman named S\u0131d\u0131ka Han\u0131m.[2] The couple eventually moved to Bosanski \u0160amac and had five children. Izetbegovi\u0107's grandfather later became the town's mayor.[3]/nIzetbegovi\u0107's father, an accountant, had fought for the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Italian Front during World War I and sustained serious injuries which left him in a semi-paralyzed state for at least a decade. He declared bankruptcy in 1927. The following year, the family moved to Sarajevo, where Izetbegovi\u0107 received a secular education.[4]/nIn 1941, Izetbegovi\u0107 helped to found a Bosnian Islamist organization named \"Young Muslims\" (Mladi Muslimani), which was modeled after the Muslim Brotherhood.[5] When the \"Young Muslims\" became torn between supporting the largely Muslim Waffen-SS Handschar Division or the communist Yugoslav Partisans, according to the New York Times, he joined the SS Handschar, despite a lack of evidence.[6][7] Izetbegovi\u0107's family denied the claim and claimed that he had joined the communist Yugoslav Partisans.[7] Izetbegovi\u0107 was detained by the Serb royalist Chetniks in mid-1944, but released by Chetnik voivode Dragutin Keserovi\u0107.[8] He was arrested by the Yugoslav communists following the war and sentenced to three years in prison in 1946 on charges of collaborating with the Nazi forces.[9] Before incarceration, he had earned a law degree at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Law.[10] He remained engaged in politics after serving the sentence.[11]/nIn 1970, Izetbegovi\u0107 published a manifesto entitled the Islamic Declaration, expressing his views on relationships between Islam, state and society. The manifesto was banned by the government.[12] In it, he tried to reconcile Western-style progress with Islamic tradition.[13] The work issued a call for \"Islamic renewal\" without mentioning Yugoslavia specifically. However, he and his supporters were accused by the Communist authorities of reviving the \"Young Muslims\" organisation and of a conspiracy to set up an \"Islamically pure\" Bosnia and Herzegovina.[14]/nThe declaration designated Pakistan as a model country to be emulated by Muslim revolutionaries worldwide.[15] One of the passages that was in particular picked out by his opponents during the trial was, \"There can be no peace or coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic social and political institutions...the state should be an expression of religion and should support its moral concepts.\"[16] The declaration remains a source of controversy. Serbs, who were opposed to Izetbegovi\u0107, often quoted the declaration as indicative of an intent to create an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Bosnia.[12]/nHe himself later insisted many times that the statements about the creation of an Islamic state were hypothetical and were not to be the applied to the situation in Bosnia. Regardless, Bosnia's non-Muslim population were unsettled by several of his statements in his writings.[17] Passages from the declaration were frequently quoted by Izetbegovi\u0107's opponents during the 1990s, who considered it to be an open statement of Islamic fundamentalism.[18] This opinion is also shared by some Western authors.[19] Izetbegovi\u0107 vigorously denied these accusations.[12]/nIzetbegovi\u0107 was first arrested in 1946 aged twenty-one. He was sentenced to jail in various cases in a total for 8 years for his membership in an organization fighting for human rights and religious rights.[20]/nIn April 1983, Izetbegovi\u0107 and twelve other Bosniak activists (including Melika Salihbegovi\u0107, Edhem Bi\u010dak\u010di\u0107, Omer Behmen, Mustafa Spahi\u0107 and Hasan \u010cengi\u0107) were tried before a Sarajevo court for a variety of charges called \"offences as principally hostile activity inspired by Bosnian nationalism, association for purposes of hostile activity and hostile propaganda\". Izetbegovi\u0107 was further accused of organizing a visit to a Muslim congress in Iran. All of those tried were convicted and Izetbegovi\u0107 was sentenced to fourteen years in prison.[citation needed]/nThe verdict was strongly criticised by Western human rights organisations, including Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch, which claimed the case was based on \"communist propaganda\", and the accused were not charged with either using or advocating violence. The following May, the Bosnian Supreme Court conceded the point with an announcement that \"some of the actions of the accused did not have the characteristics of criminal acts\" and reduced Izetbegovi\u0107's sentence to twelve years. In 1988, as communist rule faltered, he was pardoned and released after almost five years in prison. His health had suffered serious damage.[11]/nThe introduction of a multi-party system in Yugoslavia at the end of the 1980s prompted Izetbegovi\u0107 and other Bosniak activists to establish a political party, the Party of Democratic Action (Stranka Demokratske Akcije, SDA) in 1990. It had a largely Muslim character; similarly, the other principal ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs and Croats, also established ethnically based parties (SDS and HDZ BiH). The SDA won the largest share of the vote, 33% of the seats, with the next runners-up being nationalist ethnic parties representing Serbs and Croats. Fikret Abdi\u0107 won the popular vote for Presidency member among the Bosniak candidates, with 44% of the vote, Izetbegovi\u0107 with 37%. According to the Bosnian constitution, the first two candidates of each of the three constitutient nations would be elected to a seven-member multi-ethnic rotating presidency (with two Croats, two Serbs, two Bosniaks and one Yugoslav); a Croat took the post of prime minister and a Serb the presidency of the Assembly. Abdi\u0107 agreed to stand down as the Bosniak candidate for the Presidency and Izetbegovi\u0107 became Chairman of the Presidency./nBosnia and Herzegovina's power-sharing arrangements broke down very quickly as ethnic tensions grew after the outbreak of fighting between Serbs and Croats in neighboring Croatia. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 was due to hold the presidency for only one year according to the constitution, this arrangement was initially suspended due to \"extraordinary circumstances\" and was eventually abandoned altogether during the war as the Serb and Croat nationalistic parties SDS and HDZ BiH abandoned the government. When fighting broke out in Slovenia and Croatia in the summer of 1991, it was immediately apparent that Bosnia and Herzegovina would soon become embroiled in the conflict. Izetbegovi\u0107 initially proposed a loose confederation to preserve a unitary Bosnian state and strongly urged a peaceful solution. He did not subscribe to the peace at all costs view and commented in February 1991 that I would sacrifice peace for a sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina\u00a0... but for that peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina I would not sacrifice sovereignty. He abandoned the Zulfikarpa\u0161i\u0107\u2013Karad\u017ei\u0107 agreement which would see Bosnia as a sovereign state in a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro, with 60% of Sand\u017eak ceded to Bosnia.[21] By the start of 1992, it had become apparent that the rival nationalist demands were fundamentally incompatible: the Bosniaks and Croats sought an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina while the Serbs wanted it to remain in a rump Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia. Izetbegovi\u0107 publicly complained that he was being forced to ally with one side or the other, vividly characterising the dilemma by comparing it to having to choose between leukemia and a brain tumour.[22]/nIn January 1992, Portuguese diplomat Jos\u00e9 Cutileiro drafted a plan, later known as the Lisbon Agreement, that would turn Bosnia into a triethnic cantonal state. Initially, all three sides signed up to the agreement; Izetbegovi\u0107 for the Bosniaks, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 for the Serbs and Mate Boban for the Croats. Some two weeks later, however, Izetbegovi\u0107 withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any type of partition of Bosnia, supposedly encouraged by Warren Zimmermann, the United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia at the time.[23][24]/nIn February 1992, Izetbegovi\u0107 called an independence referendum on the European condition[25] for recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state, despite warnings from the Serb members of the presidency that it was unconstitutional[26] and that any move towards independence would result in the Serb-inhabited areas seceding to remain with the rump Yugoslavia. The referendum achieved a 99.4% vote in favor on a 63% turnout,[27] largely boycotted by the Serbs.[28] Namely, according to the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the change of the state-legal status was not possible without the national consensus of all three nations. This mechanism was incorporated into the constitution due to the genocide committed against Serbs in World War II, which disturbed the ethnic balance. Another possibility was for two-thirds of the citizens to vote in a referendum to leave the Yugoslav federation. The Serbs did not agree with the secession from Yugoslavia. Furthermore, less than two-thirds of the population went to the referendum. Nevertheless, the EU and the US accepted the referendum./nThe Bosnian parliament, already vacated by the Bosnian Serbs, formally declared independence from Yugoslavia on 29 February and Izetbegovi\u0107 announced the country's independence on 3 March. It did not take effect until 7 April 1992, when the European Union and United States recognized the new country. Sporadic fighting between Serbs and government forces occurred across Bosnia in the run-up to international recognition. Izetbegovi\u0107 appears to have gambled that the international community would send a peacekeeping force upon recognising Bosnia in order to prevent a war, but this did not happen. Instead, war immediately broke out across the country as Serb and Yugoslav army forces took control of large areas against the poorly equipped government security forces. Initially, Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces systematically ransacked or burnt down Bosniak houses and apartments, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, including also being raped repeatedly by Serb soldiers or policemen.[29]/nIzetbegovi\u0107 consistently promoted the idea of a multi-ethnic Bosnia under central control, which seemed a hopeless strategy under the circumstances. The Bosnian Croats, disillusioned with the Sarajevo government and supported militarily and financially by the Croatian government, increasingly turned to establishing their own ethnically based state of Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia in Herzegovina and Central Bosnia. The Croats pulled out of the Sarajevo government and fighting broke out in 1993. In some areas local armistices were signed between the Serbs and Croats. Croat forces launched their first attacks on Bosniaks in central Bosnia in June 1992, but these failed.[citation needed] The Graz agreement caused deep division among Bosnian Croats and strengthened separatist Herzeg-Bosnia, and led to the La\u0161va Valley ethnic cleansing campaign against Bosniak civilians from May 1992 to March 1993.[30][31]/nAdding to the general confusion, Izetbegovi\u0107's former colleague Fikret Abdi\u0107 established an Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia in parts of Cazin and Velika Kladu\u0161a municipalities in opposition to the Sarajevo government and in cooperation with Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Franjo Tu\u0111man. Abdi\u0107's faction was eventually routed by the Bosnian army. By this time, Izetbegovi\u0107's government controlled only about 25% of the country and represented principally the Bosniak community.[citation needed]/nFor three and a half years, Izetbegovi\u0107 lived precariously in a besieged Sarajevo surrounded by Serb forces. He denounced the failure of Western countries to reverse Serbian aggression and turned instead to the Muslim world, with which he had already established relations during his days as a dissident. The Bosnian government received money and arms. Osama bin Laden was given a Bosnian passport during Izetbegovi\u0107's presidency and went on to visit Bosnia and Kosovo several times.[32][33][34] Bin Laden stated to a German reporter that he planned to bring Muslim volunteers to Bosnia.[35] Following massacres on Bosnian Muslims by Serb and, to a lesser extent, Croat forces, foreign Muslim volunteers joined the Bosnian army in the so-called Bosnian mujahideen, numbering between 300 and 1,500.[36] They quickly attracted heavy criticism amplified by Serb and Croat propaganda, who considered their presence to be evidence of \"violent Islamic fundamentalism\" at the heart of Europe. However, the foreign volunteers became unpopular even with many of the Bosniak population, because the Bosnian army had thousands of troops and no need for more soldiers, but for arms. Many Bosnian army officers and intellectuals were suspicious regarding foreign volunteers' arrival in the central part of the country, because they came from Split and Zagreb in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed Herzeg-Bosnia unlike Bosnian army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. According to general Stjepan \u0160iber, the highest-ranking ethnic Croat in the Bosnian army, the key roles in the foreign volunteers' arrival were played by Franjo Tu\u0111man and Croatian counter-intelligence underground with the aim to justify the involvement of Croatia in the Bosnian War and mass crimes committed by Croat forces. Although Izetbegovi\u0107 regarded them as symbolically valuable as a sign of the Muslim world's support for Bosnia, they appear to have made little military difference and became a major political liability.[37][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nIn 1993, Izetbegovi\u0107 agreed to a peace plan that would divide Bosnia along ethnic lines but continued to insist on a unitary Bosnia government from Sarajevo and on the allocation to the Bosniaks of a large percentage of Bosnia's territory. The war between the Bosniaks and Croats was eventually ended by a truce brokered with the aid of the Americans in March 1994, following which the two sides collaborated more closely against the Serbs. NATO then became increasingly involved in the conflict with occasional \"pinprick\" bombings conducted against the Bosnian Serbs, generally following violations of ceasefires and the no-fly zone over Bosnia. The Bosnian Croat forces benefited indirectly from US military training given to the Croatian Army. In addition, the Croatians provided considerable quantities of weaponry to the Bosnian Croats and much smaller amounts to the Bosnian army, despite a UN weapons embargo. Most of the Bosnian army's supply of weapons was airlifted from the Muslim world, specifically Iran \u2013 an issue which became the subject of some controversy and a US congressional investigation in 1996. In September 1993, the Second Bosniak Congress officially re-introduced the historical ethnic name Bosniaks.[citation needed] The Yugoslav \"Muslims by nationality\" policy was considered by Bosniaks to be neglecting and opposing their Bosnian identity because the term tried to describe Bosniaks as a religious group, not an ethnic one.[38]/nThe Washington Agreement in March 1994 ended the Croat-Bosniak War and divided the combined ARBiH and HVO territory into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina./nIn August 1995, following the Srebrenica massacre and the 2nd Markale massacre, NATO launched an intensive bombing campaign which destroyed the Bosnian Serb command and control system. This allowed the Croatian and Bosniak forces to overrun many Serb-held areas of the country, producing a roughly 50/50 split of the territory between the two sides. The offensive came to a halt not far from the de facto Serb capital of Banja Luka./nWhen the Croat and Bosniak forces stopped their advance they had captured the power plants supplying Banja Luka's electricity and used that control to pressure the Serb leadership into accepting a ceasefire. The parties agreed to meet at Dayton, Ohio to negotiate a peace treaty under the supervision of the United States. Serb and Croat interests were represented by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and Tu\u0111man, respectively. Izetbegovi\u0107 represented the internationally recognized Bosnian government.[39][full citation needed]/nAfter the Bosnian War was formally ended by the Dayton peace accord in November 1995, Izetbegovi\u0107 became a Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. His party's power declined after the international community installed a High Representative to oversee affairs of state, with more power than the Presidency or parliaments of either the Bosniak-Croat or Serb entities. He stepped down in October 2000 at the age of 74, citing poor health. However, Izetbegovi\u0107 remained popular with the Bosniak public, who nicknamed him Dedo (which in Bosnian means grandfather). His endorsement helped his party to bounce back in the 2002 general election. Some observers have described his rule as authoritarian with nationalist positions.[40][41][42][43]/nIzetbegovi\u0107 died on 19 October 2003 of heart disease complicated by injuries suffered from a fall at home. An ICTY investigation of Izetbegovi\u0107 was in progress, but ended with his death.[44][45][46] His funeral, held three days after his death, on 22 October, drew many Bosnian officials, dignitaries from 44 foreign countries, 105 members of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and between 100,000 and 150,000 people, with his family receiving over 4,000 telegrams.[47] Over 400 journalists attended the funeral as it was broadcast live on TV with 37 cameras.[47]/nFollowing Izetbegovi\u0107's death there was an initiative to rename a part of the main street of Sarajevo from Ulica Mar\u0161ala Tita (Marshal Tito Street) and the Sarajevo International Airport in his honor. Following objections from politicians from Republika Srpska, the international community, and UN envoy Paddy Ashdown, both initiatives failed.[48]/nHe had a son, Bakir, who also entered politics, as well as two granddaughters (Jasmina and Mirzela Izetbegovi\u0107).[6]/nOn 11 August 2006, Izetbegovi\u0107's grave at the Kova\u010di cemetery in Sarajevo was badly damaged by a bomb. The identity of the bomber or bombers has never been determined.[49]/nAvailable in English/nAvailable in Bosnia", "3047135": "David Lee Hull (15 June 1935 \u2013 11 August 2010)[1] was an American philosopher who was most notable for founding the field philosophy of biology.[2] Additionally, Hull is recognized within evolutionary culture studies as contributing heavily in early discussions of the conceptualization of memetics.[3][4] In addition to his academic prominence, he was well known as a gay man who fought for the rights of other gay and lesbian philosophers.[5] Hull was partnered with Richard \"Dick\" Wellman, a Chicago school teacher, until Wellman's passing during the drafting of Science as Process.[6]/nHull initially got a bachelor's degree in Biology at Illinois Wesleyan University.[6] He then became one of the first graduates of the History and Philosophy of Science department at Indiana University (IU). After earning his PhD from IU, he taught at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee for 20 years before moving to Northwestern, where he taught for another 20 years.  Hull was a former president of the Philosophy of Science Association, the ISHPSSB, and the Society for Systematic Biology.  He was particularly well known for his argument that species are not sets or collections but rather spatially and temporally extended individuals (also called the individuality thesis or \"species-as-individuals\" thesis)./nHe is considered to have founded and systematically developed the area of philosophy of biology as it is understood in contemporary philosophy. Hull proposed an elaborate discussion of science as an evolutionary process in his 1988 book, which also offered a historical account of the \"taxonomy wars\" of the 1960s and 1970s between three competing schools of taxonomy: phenetics, evolutionary systematics, and cladistics. In Hull's view, science evolves like organisms and populations do, with a demic population structure, subject to selection for ideas based on \"conceptual inclusive credit.\" Either novelty or citation of work gives credit, and the professional careers of scientists share in credit by using successful research. This is a \"hidden hand\" account of scientific progress./nAdditionally, Hull regularly contributed to a variety of studies of evolutionary culture. He contributed to philosophical and empirical accounts of the evolution of science and evolutionary epistemology. While most of his work is in metaphysics and epistemology of evolution and biology, some of his work is closely related to what has since been called Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, or Science of Science. He forwarded citation analysis to develop an account of the evolutionary survival of scientific ideas[7] which has a direct relationship to what has been called Knowledge Memes or Science Memes.[8]/nHe also contributed to evolutionary culture theory more broadly by contributing to initial discussions surrounding the generalization of Richard Dawkins' evolutionary vehicles in memetics research. In relation to Richard Dawkins' theory of replicators, Hull introduced the notion of interactors.[9][10]/nHe was Dressler Professor in the Humanities Emeritus at Northwestern University.[11]", "163552": "Joseph Butler (18 May 1692 \u2013 16 June 1752) was an English Anglican bishop, theologian, apologist, and philosopher, born in Wantage in the English county of Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). He is known for critiques of Deism, Thomas Hobbes's egoism, and John Locke's theory of personal identity.[4] The many philosophers and religious thinkers Butler influenced included David Hume, Thomas Reid, Adam Smith,[5] Henry Sidgwick,[6] John Henry Newman,[7] and C. D. Broad,[8] and is widely seen as \"one of the pre-eminent English moralists.\"[9] He played a major, if underestimated role in developing 18th-century economic discourse, influencing the Dean of Gloucester and political economist Josiah Tucker.[10]/nButler was born on 18 May 1692.[12] The son of a Presbyterian linen draper, Butler was destined for the ministry of that church, and with the future archbishop Thomas Secker, entered Samuel Jones's dissenting academy at Gloucester (later Tewkesbury) for the purpose. There he began a secret correspondence with the Anglican theologian and philosopher Samuel Clarke. In 1714, he decided to join the Church of England and entered Oriel College, Oxford, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1718 and named a Doctor of Civil Law on 8 December 1733.[1]/nButler was ordained a deacon on 26 October 1718 by William Talbot, Bishop of Salisbury, in his Bishop's Palace, Salisbury, his palace chapel[13] and a priest on 21 December 1718 by Talbot at St James's Church, Piccadilly.[1] After holding various other high positions, he became rector of the rich living of Stanhope, County Durham./nIn 1736 Butler became the head chaplain of George II's wife Caroline, on the advice of Lancelot Blackburne. He was nominated Bishop of Bristol on 19 October 1738 and consecrated a bishop on 3 December 1738 at Lambeth Palace chapel. Remaining Bishop of Bristol, Butler was installed Dean of St Paul's on 24 May 1740, keeping the office until his translation to Durham.[1] He is said apocryphally to have declined an offer to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1747, but he served as Clerk of the Closet to the king in 1746\u20131752. He was translated to Durham by the confirmation of his election in October 1750; he was then enthroned by proxy on 9 November 1750.[1] He is buried in Bristol Cathedral./nButler died in 1752 at Rosewell House, Kingsmead Square in Bath, Somerset.[14] His admirers have praised him as an excellent person and a diligent and conscientious churchman. Though indifferent to literature, he had some taste in the fine arts, especially architecture./nJoseph is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 16 June.[15] He had his own collection of manuscripts (e. g. Lectionary 189)./nDuring his lifetime and for many years after, Butler was best known for his Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed (1736), which according to historian Will Durant \"remained for a century the chief buttress of Christian argument against unbelief.\"[16] English deists such as John Toland and Matthew Tindal had argued that nature provides clear evidence of an intelligent designer and artificer, but they rejected orthodox Christianity due to the incredibility of miracles and the cruelties and contradictions recorded in the Bible./nButler's Analogy was one of many book-length replies to the deists, and long believed to be the most effective. Butler argued that nature itself was full of mysteries and cruelties and so shared the same alleged defects as the Bible. Arguing on empiricist grounds that all knowledge of nature and human conduct is merely probable, Butler appealed to a series of patterns (\"analogies\") observable in nature and human affairs, which in his view make the chief teachings of Christianity likely./nButler argued that \"because nature is a mess of riddles, we cannot expect revelation to be any clearer\"[17] Today, Butler's Analogy is \"now largely of historical interest,\"[18] with the only part widely read being the section which deals with his criticism of John Locke's theory of personal identity.[3]/nA Butler scholar, Stephen Darwall, wrote: \"Probably no figure had a greater impact on nineteenth-century British moral philosophy than Butler.\"[19] Butler's chief target in the Sermons was Thomas Hobbes and the egoistic view of human nature he had defended in Leviathan (1651). Hobbes was a materialist who believed that science reveals a world in which all events are causally determined and in which all human choices flow unavoidably from whatever desire is most powerful in a person at a given time. Hobbes saw human beings as being violent, self-seeking, and power-hungry. Such a view left no place for genuine altruism, benevolence or concept of morality as traditionally conceived.[20]/nIn the Sermons, Butler argues that human motivation is less selfish and more complex than Hobbes claimed. He maintains that the human mind is an organized hierarchy of a number of different impulses and principles, many of which are not fundamentally selfish. The ground floor, so to speak, holds a wide variety of specific emotions, appetites and affections, such as hunger, anger, fear and sympathy. They, in properly organized minds, are controlled by two superior principles: self-love (a desire to maximize one's own long-term happiness) and benevolence (a desire to promote general happiness). The more general impulses are in turn subject to the highest practical authority in the human mind: moral conscience. Conscience, Butler claims, is an inborn sense of right and wrong, an inner light and monitor, received from God.[21] Conscience tells one to promote the general happiness and personal happiness. Experience informs that the two aims largely coincide in the present life. For many reasons, Butler argues, unethical and self-centred people who care nothing for the public good are not usually very happy./nThere are, however, rare cases where the wicked seem for a time to prosper. A perfect harmony of virtue and self-interest, Butler claimed, is guaranteed only by a just God, who in the afterlife rewards and punishes people as they deserve.[22]/nIn Appendix 1 of the Analogy, Butler offers a famous criticism of John Locke's influential theory of \"personal identity\", an explanation of what makes someone the \"same person\" from one time to the next, despite all the physical and psychological changes experienced over that period. Locke claimed that personal identity is not from having the same body or the same soul but from having the same consciousness and memory. According to Locke, memory is the \"glue\" that ties the various stages of our life together and constitutes sameness of person. This section of the Analogy is the only widely read part of it today.[3]/nMore precisely, Locke claims, Person A is the same person as Person B only in a case where A and B share at least some of the same memories. Butler said that the way \"real\" memories can be distinguished from false ones is that people who had the experiences that are truly remembered. Thus, Butler claimed, memory presupposes personal identity and so cannot constitute it.[23]/nButler is honoured on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 16 June.[24]", "622304": "Ernesto Laclau (Spanish: [la\u02c8klaw]; 6 October 1935 \u2013 13 April 2014) was an Argentine political theorist and philosopher.

He is well known for his collaborations with his long-term partner, Chantal Mouffe./nHe studied history at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, graduating with a licenciatura in 1964, and received a PhD from the University of Essex in 1977./nFrom 1986 he served as Professor of Political Theory at the University of Essex, where he founded and directed for many years the graduate programme in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, as well as the Centre for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and the Social Sciences. Under his directorship, the Ideology and Discourse Analysis programme has provided a research framework for the development of a distinct type of discourse analysis that draws on post-structuralist theory (especially the work of Saussure, and Derrida), post analytic thought (Wittgenstein, and Richard Rorty) and psychoanalysis (primarily the work of Lacan) to provide innovative analysis of concrete political phenomena, such as identities, discourses and hegemonies. This theoretical and analytical orientation is known today as the 'Essex School of discourse analysis'.[1]/nOver his career Laclau lectured extensively in many universities in North America, South America, Western Europe, Australia, and South Africa. He also held positions at SUNY Buffalo and Northwestern University, both in the US./nLaclau died of a heart attack in Seville in 2014.[2][3]/nLaclau studied history at the University of Buenos Aires[4] and was a member of the PSIN (Socialist Party of the National Left) until 1969, when the British historian Eric Hobsbawm supported his entrance to Oxford.[5] He had close links with Jorge Abelardo Ramos, the founder of the PSIN, although he stated in 2005 that the latter had evolved in a direction he did not appreciate.[5] In the same interview, he claimed that he came from a Yrigoyenista family, and that the Peronist politician Arturo Jauretche, a strong opponent of Justo's dictatorship during the Infamous Decade of the 1930s, was a close friend of his father.[5]/nIn his later years, he had close ties with the Argentine Socialist Confederation (Spanish: Confederaci\u00f3n Socialista Argentina),[6] and in Argentina he is associated with Peronism.[7]/nLaclau's early work was influenced by Althusserian Marxism and focused on issues debated within Neo-Marxist circles in the 1970s, such as the role of the state, the dynamics of capitalism, the importance of building popular movements, and the possibility of revolution. Laclau's most significant book is Hegemony and Socialist Strategy, which he co-authored with Chantal Mouffe in 1985. The position outlined in this book is usually described as post-Marxist because it rejects (a) Marxist economic determinism and (b) the view that class struggle is the most important antagonism in society. In their 2001 introduction to the second edition Laclau and Mouffe commented on this label, stating that whilst 'post-Marxist' they were also 'post-Marxist':[8] their work, though a departure from traditional Western Marxism, retained similar concerns and ideas. A key innovation in Hegemony and Socialist Strategy was Laclau and Mouffe's argument that left-wing movements need to build alliances with a wide variety of different groups if they are to be successful and establish a left-wing 'hegemony'. In the final chapter of the book, the project of \"radical and plural democracy\" was advocated: a democracy in which subjects accept the importance of the values of liberty and equality, but fight over what the terms mean./nIn Hegemony and Socialist Strategy Laclau and Mouffe also offered a constructivist account of 'discourse'. By drawing on the work of the later Wittgenstein, they argued that social entities only become meaningful through both linguistic and non-linguistic discursive articulation.[9] As such, the meaning of something is never pre-given but is, instead, constructed through social practices. In a later summary of his view, Laclau claims there is support for this broad sense of discourse in Saussure. \"By discourse... I do not mean something that is essentially restricted to the areas of speech and writing, but any complex of elements in which relations play the constitutive role. This means that elements do not pre-exist the relational complex but are constituted through it. Thus 'relation' and 'objectivity' are synonymous. Saussure asserted that there are no positive terms in language, only differences \u2014 something is what it is only through its differential relations to something else.\"[10]/nLaclau subsequently used this account of discourse to re-consider the nature of identity, arguing that all political identities are discursive - even if they are experienced by individuals as 'natural' (even to the point where one's identity is not recognised as an identity). For example, though an individual may think that they are just 'born male' this is, for Laclau[citation needed] not the case: 'maleness' is a socially constructed category that has no innate meaning./nIn his more recent works Laclau returned to a topic that was prevalent in his earliest writings: populism. In On Populist Reason, Laclau considered the nature of populism in political discourse, the creation of a popular hegemonic bloc such as \"the people\", and the importance of affect in politics. Building on his earlier work, Laclau argued that the basis of populism lies in the creation of \"empty signifiers\": words and ideas that express a universal idea of justice, and symbolically structure the political environment. Against those who see populism as a threat to democracy, Laclau argued that it is an essential component of it.[11]/nLaclau is known for his long standing dialogue with Lacanian \"arch-Marxist\" Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. This dates back to at least 1989, when Laclau wrote the introduction to \u017di\u017eek's first book in English (The Sublime Object of Ideology). \u017di\u017eek is widely recognized as responsible for Laclau's increased acceptance of Lacanian ideas and his essay \"Beyond Discourse Analysis\",[12] which was published in Laclau's New Reflections on the Revolutions of Our Time (1990), provided a psychoanalytic critique of Laclau's work. In 2000, Laclau, \u017di\u017eek and Judith Butler published the trialogue Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, in which each responded to the others' works in a three-essay cycle. Although \u017di\u017eek and Laclau noted their similarities and mutual respect, significant political and theoretical differences emerged between all three interlocutors. Following several acrimonious publications in the early 2000s, Laclau wrote in On Populist Reason (2005) that \u017di\u017eek had an impractical and confused approach to politics, describing him as \"waiting for the Martians\".[13] Their disagreement escalated in the pages of Critical Inquiry in 2006, when in a spate of essays the two argued in an increasingly hostile manner about political action, Marxism and class struggle, Hegel, populism, and the Lacanian Real.[14][15] More recently in a 2014 interview with David Howarth, Laclau stated that his relationship with \u017di\u017eek had deteriorated due to the latter adopting a \"frantic ultra-Leftist stance, wrapped in a Leninism of kindergarten\".[16]", "42106597": "Eduardo Barrio is an Argentine logician./nSince 2005 he is professor of logic at University of Buenos Aires and researcher at CONICET.

Known for his contributions to philosophical aesthetics and the emerging field of somaesthetics, currently he is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at Florida Atlantic University./nRichard Shusterman was born on December 3, 1949, to a Jewish family living in Philadelphia, USA.[1] At the age 16 he left his home and went to Israel, where he continued his education, studying English and philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[2] There he received a B.A. degree in English and Philosophy, and later an M.A. degree in philosophy (both degrees awarded magna cum laude).[3]/nAfter teaching at different Israeli academic institutions, and receiving tenure at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with an episode as a visiting fellow at St. John's College, Oxford University during academic year 1984/85,[4] Shusterman did his doctoral studies in philosophy at St. John\u2019s College, Oxford University. His doctoral supervisor was J.O. Urmson, and his examiners were Stuart Hampshire and Patrick Gardiner. Shusterman became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Temple University, Philadelphia, USA in 1986.[3] He was granted tenure in 1988 and promoted to full professor in 1991. He then served as chair of the philosophy department between the years of 1998\u20132004.[5]/nIn 2004 Richard Shusterman left Temple University to become the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities at Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, where he also holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Philosophy and English.[6]/nDuring his years at the University of Jerusalem, Shusterman focused on analytic philosophy. The interest carried over with his doctoral dissertation at Oxford University; The Object of Literary Criticism which he wrote at St. John's College under the supervision of J. O. Urmson and defended in 1979.[7] It was published under the original title in 1984./n1988 saw the publication of Shusterman's second book, T. S. Eliot and the Philosophy of Criticism,[8][9] and with it came a turn in his philosophical focus as well. Influenced by the work that produced the book and personal experiences, Shusterman's attention moved from analytic philosophy to pragmatism.[10][11] He also began work to develop his own theory of pragmatist aesthetics; based on John Dewey's aesthetics but augmented by the argumentative methods and tools of analytic philosophy.[8]/nHis third book published, Pragmatist Aesthetics in 1992,[12] brought a big breakthrough in Shusterman's academic career. The book's original approach to the problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages (French, German, Finnish, Portuguese, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Slovakian, Hungarian, Romanian, Italian, and Russian) and several editions were published.[13] Shusterman's position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997,[14] Performing Live in 2000,[15] and Surface and Depth in 2002;[16] in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.[17]/nIn Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman introduces his concept of somaesthetics,[10] which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics is the focus of Shusterman's two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics[18] and Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics.[19] The first of these books, translated into seven languages, (French, Polish, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, and Italian) helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices./nIn 2007, as a part of his project of developing somaesthetics, Shusterman established the Center for Body, Mind, and Culture at FAU.[20]  He is a member of many editorial boards and has been allocated important grants and fellowships for his research; from the National Endowment of the Humanities, the Fulbright Commission,[17] and the Humboldt Foundation./nOne of the important factors influencing Shusterman's philosophy has been his international career. For instance, his work in France with Pierre Bourdieu, the Sorbonne, and the College International de Philosophie has allowed his pragmatism to engage and deploy the contemporary French philosophical tradition. His Fulbright Professorship in Berlin enabled his pragmatism to intersect more closely with contemporary German philosophy. Similarly, his years as a visiting research professor in Hiroshima, Japan and in Beijing and Shandong in China facilitated his study of Asian philosophy and Zen practice./nShusterman philosophy stretches beyond the confines of professional academic life. In 1995, he was a delegate member of the UNESCO project Philosophy and Democracy in the World, and for several years he directed the UNESCO project MUSIC: Music, Urbanism, Social Integration and Culture.[21][22] In 2012 he prepared a project commissioned by UNESCO that aims to use the internet to stimulate international youth to immerse in dialogue about peace and violence, through the medium of art. Recalling the classical Greek concept of education, the project is named PAIDEIA, an acronym that stands for Peace through Art and Internet Dialog for Education and Intercultural Association.  On a more local level, during the years 1998\u20132004, he organized and hosted a public discussion forum, titled \"Dialogues on the Square\", at Philadelphia's main Barnes & Noble bookstore, at Rittenhouse Square.[23] In 2002, he received his professional certification as a Feldenkrais practitioner,[24] and he has worked since as a professor, researcher, lecturer, director of the Center for Body, Mind, and Culture, somatic educator, and therapist./nContemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the neo-analytical.[25] The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger.[26] The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.[27]/nAssuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of \"reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism\"[28]) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance./nBesides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology (Pierre Bourdieu)[29] and philosophy (Michel Foucault, Michel de Montaigne, Friedrich Nietzsche,)[30] Western body therapy (Moshe Feldenkrais, F. Matthias Alexander)[31] as well as East-Asian thought (Confucius).[32]/nThis diversity of interests and inspirations finds its reflection in the scope of Shusterman's philosophical work which embraces not only aesthetics, but also metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, political theory as well as metaphilosophy; in which he advocates the idea of philosophy as the art of living./nExperience serves as a basic category in Shusterman's pragmatism, both in terms of methodology (the pragmatist should always work from experience) [33] as well as ontology or epistemology (experience \"is a transactional nexus of interacting energies connecting the embodied self and its environing world\"[34]) but contrary to John Dewey, Shusterman does not engage in constructing a general metaphysical conception. He has, however, made significant comments on Dewey's insights [35] and defends Dewey's idea of immediate, nondiscursive experience against the criticism put forward by Richard Rorty.[36]/nWhile Rorty shares Dewey's commitment to debunk epistemological foundationalism, he (Rorty) believes that the notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey's theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims./nTo this, Shusterman replies that:\n(a) The anti-foundationalist thrust of the notion of language is not as clear as Rorty sees it (in fact language has been frequently used as a foundationalist category)\n(b) Dewey never really intended his theory of experience to be a kind of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including \"the immediate dimension of somatic experience\" and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life. (The inspiration of body theorist-therapist F. M. Alexander is important here). Although he argues that Dewey's theory was ultimately spoiled by a kind of foundationalism (not the one Rorty accuses Dewey of but rather one asserting that the specific quality of immediate experience is the glue that makes coherent thought possible),\nShusterman believes that the philosophical value of experience can and should be reaffirmed in an anti-foundationalist form./nIn Shusterman's and, also, Dewey's opinion, the eastern meditation practices repair perception for understanding our dependence on the society's moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars's critique of the myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation has been one of the reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics./nShusterman also addresses the philosophical problems of defining art; by presenting both, meta-theoretical insights as well as definitions of his own./nOn the meta-theoretical level he criticizes essentialist, classificatory definitions of art (preferred by the traditional analytic philosophy), which he calls \"wrapper definitions\" since they aim \"at the perfect coverage\" of the logical extension of the notion of art.[37] Shusterman finds these definitions problematic, given art's contested value and nature as well as its unpredictable development in the future. He further argues that there is a goal for art definitions, which is more important than the conceptual coverage that is directional/transformational in \"illuminating the special point and value of art or...improving art's appreciation\".[38]/nHe says that these ideas may converge, but since they may as well not, it is unacceptable to exclude any definitions only on the basis that they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by George Dickie and Arthur Danto.[39]/nShusterman advocates a definition of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey's definition with significant changes. While he accepts the majority of the elements central to the Dewey's conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey's insistence on the unity and coherence of aesthetic experience which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation)./nHe says that Dewey was wrong to treat his definition of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension of the concept of art it \"underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art\" (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen \"the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world\".[40]/nShusterman also advocates a definition of art as dramatization, which supplements the definition he has inherited from Dewey not only by illuminating art's nature from a slightly different angle, but also by serving a different, yet equally important purpose \u2013 the reconciliation of two prominent and, at the same time, conflicted aesthetic accounts of art: historicism and naturalism. Since the notion of dramatization involves, and harmonizes two important moments: of putting something into a formalized frame (e.g. \"the frame of a theatrical performance\"[41]) and of intense experiential content that is framed, it presents itself as a potential synthesizing formula for historicism and naturalism which, Shusterman argues, can be reduced to emphasizing the formal institutional frame of art (historicism) or experiential intensity that characterizes art as such (naturalism)./nBoth of Shusterman's definitions have become the subject of many commentaries and criticisms.[a]/nOf the many debates that galvanize contemporary humanities, one of the most important one is devoted to the problem of interpretation. Shusterman has participated in it by co-editing a fundamental anthology \"The Interpretive Turn\", as well as making his opinions known.\nShusterman's account of interpretation is constructed in opposition to both analytic aesthetics and deconstruction, which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share \"a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular ... [\"separate and autonomous\"] meaning-object\", yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as \"systematic play of differences\", claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a \"misreading\", while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as \"metaphysically fixed in the artwork\" and identifying it with the intention of the artist or \"semantic features of the work itself\".[42]/nTo avoid both these extremes Shusterman proposes a conception of textual meaning inspired by Wittgenstein (and his notion of language games) in which meaning is thought of as a correlate of understanding, the latter term being conceived as \"an ability to handle or respond to [something] in certain accepted ways\"[43] which, although shared and legitimized by the community, can be quite different and constitute many diverse \"interpretation games\"./nInterpretation, thus, is not an act (be it successful or inherently condemned to failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of \"making sense'\" of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the \"rules\" (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since there are many different incommensurable games existing at the same time and since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman's logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).[44]/nAnother of Shusterman's contributions to the theory of interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls 'hermeneutic universalism', and attributes to Hans-Georg Gadamer, Alexander Nehamas and Stanley Fish, among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists' position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that \"to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently ... must always be to interpret\" and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger's theory of hermeneutic circle, Shusterman proposes:/nthe immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then have to figure out what is meant).[45]/nAmong Shusterman's achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist (Harold Bloom's, Jonathan Culler's), analytic (Joseph Margolis') and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty's, Stanley Fish's, Walter Benn Michaels and Steven Knapp's) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism./nAccording to Shusterman, one of the most pressing sociocultural problems of today is the aesthetic legitimization of popular art. He feels that though popular art may now seem to be socially justified, its artistic value is still questioned which leads to the following problems:/nA sincere advocate of popular aesthetics, Shusterman is careful to distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as 'melorism' which \"recognizes popular art's flaws and abuses but also its merits [while also holding] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends\".[48]\nPutting his meliorism into practice, Shusterman seeks to win aesthetic legitimation for popular art in two ways:/nSomaesthetics is a term coined by Shusterman to denote a new philosophical discipline he has invented as a remedy for the following problems:/nThe above-mentioned conditions have determined the nature of somaesthetics as a grounded-in-philosophical-aesthetics yet interdisciplinary project of theory and practice which can be defined as:/n\"the critical, meliorative study of the experience and the use of one's body as a locus sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aisthesis) and creative self-fashioning ..., devoted [also] to the knowledge, discourses and disciplines that structure such somatic care or can improve it.\".[58]/nTo clarify the terminological issues, one needs to mention that Shusterman has intentionally put the term 'soma' (instead of the more familiar 'body') in the name of his disciplinary proposal to emphasize one important feature of his conception of corporeality. For Shusterman, who is a true disciple of Dewey in this regard, bodily and mental (as well as cultural and biological) dimensions of  human beings are essentially inseparable, and to signify this unity (this \"sentient perceiving \"body-mind\"\") he prefers to use the term 'soma' which, unlike 'body', does not automatically connote passive flesh contrasted to dynamic soul or mind./nAlthough Shusterman's project may at first glance seem utterly innovatory and even iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, can be traced to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.\nSomaesthetics divides into three fundamental branches:/nShusterman himself works in all three somaesthetic subdisciplines:/nSomaesthetics, which by now forms the center of Shusterman's philosophical inquiries, has already influenced many scholars working in fields as diverse as philosophy, art education, dance theory, health and fitness studies.[67]/nSomaesthetics has proved itself useful for several art forms. In a modern, Aristotelian understanding of music, there is an aesthetic separation between the cognitive abilities of the artist (poiesis) and the reception of the audience. The latter\u2019s experience is of the action (praxis) of the art work. Taking cues from poets like Val\u00e9ry and T. S. Eliot, who affirm a two-stage temporal process to aesthetic experience, Shusterman has used the idea of the \u201cperceptive attending\u201d of the soma to integrate this process.[68]/nShusterman has argued that somaesthetics can aid architecture\u2019s critical function. The body (soma), as it\u2019s understood in somaesthetics, shares several features with architecture and as such, somatic reflection can be an insightful resource.[69]/nIn photography, somatic skill plays a role in setting up a shot and posing. The camera itself is relevant because in the simplicity and instantaneousness of capturing a posing subject with a button press, the individual posing is locked in a tense relationship with the camera, as it \u201cthematizes this self-presentation, making it explicit by focusing on framing a particular moment of such self-presentation and fixing it in a permanent image that objectifies and defines the self in terms of that experiential moment, an image that can be indefinitely reproduced and circulated as a representation of what the self really is.\u201d[70]/nWith dance, Shusterman identifies an educational aspect, saying \u201cIt is an education in disciplined, skilled movement, expressive gesture, and elegant bearing whose experience in performance can afford the dancer the joys and healing harmony of somaesthetic pleasure and whose mastery also has beneficial uses in real life off stage.\u201d[71] Shusterman has also drawn on non-western art like N\u014d theatre and the theories of Zeami Motokiyo. Zeanmi\u2019s theories of dance encourages wide and deep somatic awareness through deliberate training.[72]", "50855670": "Peter Coffey (9 April 1876 \u2013 7 January 1943) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and neo-scholastic philosopher./nCoffey was educated at the Meath Diocesan Seminary in Navan, and St Patrick's College, Maynooth (Maynooth College).

She was a disciple of Raymond Aron and a lifelong admirer of Levi-Strauss\u2019 s structural anthropology, Fran\u00e7oise Blime was one of the few French students to have been accepted in the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship at Brandeis University, where she was trained along some of the leading thinkers behind the US social revolution of the late 1960s such as Angela Davis. Back in France, she worked relentlessly to elaborate and apply new paradigms in the French state educational systems, initially by the insertion of institutional psychopedagogy in the training courses of school teachers and later as a prominent researcher and administrator of the National Centre for Pedagogical Documentation (Centre National de la Documentation P\u00e9dagogique, CNDP), the office within the French Ministry of Education that publishes teaching training materials. Fran\u00e7oise Blime was also member of a number of prestigious think-tanks in the field of education, such as the Teaching League (La Ligue de l\u2019Enseignement) and was awarded the Palmes Acad\u00e9miques.[1]/nFran\u00e7oise Blime was born Fran\u00e7oise Dutertre on July 11, 1939 in Paris, France. Second daughter of Maurice Dutertre (1902 \u2013 1998) a Navy officer, and Yvonnes Delarue-Dutertre (1906-1992), a saleswoman, a swimming instructor and an artist from the Parisian branch of the Delarue family from Honfleur, Normandie./nEarly on recognized as talented in school, Fran\u00e7oise Blime grew up in Toulon, where her father was stationed as an officer in the newly formed anti-submarine naval air force units fighting the 1940 war against French Mediterranean incursions of the Italian fleet. The family then moved to Lyon for the time of the German occupation, where her father, forcibly decommissioned and a stunt anti-British naval officer is suspected to have worked as a potential collaborator with the Vichy police. Troubles at home and the repeated bombing of Lyon suburbs made it that Francoise was interned in a catholic institutions with her brother and sister, an experience that made her a staunch anti-clerical person all of her life. Her parents separated during the war and she moved to Paris with her mother, her brother and her sister. As her mother was trying to make ends meet in post-war Paris, Fran\u00e7oise was sent to live with her godfather's family in Le Vesinet, a posh Western suburb of Paris. Despite her modest upbringing, her constant success in school allowed her to get into the prestigious nearby Lyc\u00e9e de Saint Germain-en-Laye where she excelled in all subjects and in particular in all literature-related studies. After her Baccalaur\u00e9at, she was admitted at the Sorbonne Universit\u00e9 on full scholarship where she studied philosophy.[2]/nFrench philosopher Raymond Aron quickly noticed the excellence of Fran\u00e7oise an after a few years into the program at the Sorbonne supported her application to the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship that sent her to Brandeis University where she studied History of Ideas, under the guidance of the controversial German-born philosopher Herbert Marcuse. It was in Marcuse teaching seminars that she met with the American youth that were to form the militant basis of the American social revolution of the late 1960s. Among them, Angela Davis, not yet leader of the US Communist Party, whom she continued to see after she returned at the Sorbonne. It was also at Brandeis that under the teachings of Abraham Maslow, she discovered psychoanalysis. She spent the rest of her life trying to reconcile the teachings of both Marcuse and Maslow in institutional education systems. She graduated with a Masters of Arts from Brandeis University and then with a Doctorate (?) from the Sorbonne University in Paris.[3] During her finishing time at the Sorbonne, she worked for the American pharmaceutical company Vicks,[4]/nIt was natural from her upbringing and from her training that Fran\u00e7oise Blime was heading for a career in public education. After all, the only steady element of her early life was school excellence and her later training pointed at revolutionary ambitions to reform a French educational system that had been slow in evolution since the late 19th century. She started by teaching philosophy at the Lycee of Noyon, nearby Paris, while joining Fernand Oury\u2019s movement of P\u00e9dagogie Institutionnelle and being involved in various research movements to reform education at this time when France itself was changing following the 1968 upheavals. In the early 1970s, she became a founding member of the Mouvement pour la Psycho-P\u00e9dagogie Institutionelle (movement for institutional psycho-pedagogy) along with Francoise Dolto, the famous French psychoanalyst. She then accepted a teaching position at the Ecole Normale des Instituteurs (the French national school for schoolteachers) where she was able to influence generations of teachers with new innovative learning methods. She kept her position at the Ecole Normale from 1972 to 1988. In 1988 she was appointed at the Centre National de Documentation P\u00e9dagogique (CNDP: The French Ministry of Education's agency for teaching supports) as advisor to the President, a position she held until her retirement in 2002. In 2002, she was appointed at the Ligue de l\u2019Enseignement, a think-tank that advises the French Ministry of Education of various matters linked to progress in education, where she researched the impact of new digital tools to support teachings in the classrooms.[5]/nShe was diagnosed with ALS in 2015, shortly after her grandson lost his battle against cancer.

Although Kirk did not invent this idea, he introduced the term zombie in his 1974 papers \"Sentience and Behaviour\"[2] and \"Zombies v.

In 1943 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. Vernadsky's portrait is depicted on the Ukrainian \u20b41,000 hryvnia banknote./nVernadsky was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, on 12 March\u00a0[O.S. 28 February]\u00a01863 in the family of the native Kyiv residents Russian Imperial economist Ivan Vernadsky and music instructor Anna Konstantinovich, who came from an old Russia noble family.[9][10] According to family legend, his father's ancestors were Zaporozhian Cossacks.[11] Ivan Vernadsky had been a professor of political economy in Kyiv at the St. Vladimir University before moving to Saint Petersburg; then he was an Active State Councillor and worked in the Governing Senate in St. Petersburg. Vladimir's mother was a Russian noblewoman of Ukrainian Cossack descent.[12] In 1868 his family relocated to Kharkiv, and in 1873 he entered the Kharkiv provincial gymnasium.\nVernadsky graduated from Saint Petersburg State University in 1885. As the position of mineralogist in Saint Petersburg State University was vacant, and Vasily Dokuchaev, a soil scientist, and Alexey Pavlov, a geologist, had been teaching Mineralogy for a while, Vernadsky chose to enter Mineralogy. He wrote to his wife Nataliia on 20 June 1888 from Switzerland:/nTo collect facts for their own sake, as many now gather facts, without a program, without a question to answer or a purpose, is not interesting. However, there is a task which someday the human mind will solve, and which is extremely interesting. Minerals are remains of those chemical reactions which took place at various times on earth; these reactions take place according to laws which are not always known to us, but which, we are allowed to think, are closely tied to general changes which the earth has undergone as a planet. The task is to connect the various phases of changes undergone by the earth with the general laws of celestial mechanics.[13]/nIn 1888\u20131890, he traveled through Europe, studying the museums of Paris and London, and worked in Munich and Paris.[14]/nWhile trying to find a topic for his doctorate, he first went to Naples to study under crystallographer Arcangelo Scacchi, who was senile by that time. Scacchi's condition led Vernadsky to go to Germany to study under Paul Groth, curator of minerals in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Vernadsky learned to use Groth's modern equipment, which included a machine to study the optical, thermal, elastic, magnetic and electrical properties of crystals. He also gained access to the physics lab of Leonhard Sohncke (Direktor, Physikalisches Institut der Universit\u00e4t Jena, 1883\u20131886; Professor der Physik an der Technischen Hochschule M\u00fcnchen 1886\u20131897), who was studying crystallisation during that period./nIn his childhood, his father had a huge influence on his development, he very carefully and consistently engaged in the upbringing and education of his son. It was he who instilled in Volodymyr interest and love for the Ukrainian people, their history and culture. The future scientist recalled that before moving from Kharkiv to St. Petersburg, he and his father were abroad and in Milan, they read about a circular in Pyotr Lavrov's newspaper \"Forward\" that forbade printing in Ukrainian in Russia. In his memoirs, he wrote:/nThis made a huge impression on my father, and the conversations related to this had a strong effect on me at the time. My father told the history of Ukraine in a completely different way than it was taught in the gymnasium. He often mentioned that Petersburg was built on the bones of Ukrainians (Cossacks from Ivan Mazepa's regiments built Petersburg). After returning to St. Petersburg, I tried to familiarize myself with Ukrainian literature. In his father's library, he found scattered issues of Osnovy and other Ukrainian publications. Obtained Ukrainian books from second-hand booksellers, and received some from abroad. He asked his father in detail about Shevchenko, Kulish, Maksymovich, Kvitka-Osnovianenko, whom he knew personally, as well as about the Cyril-Methodiev brotherhood, about Kostomarov, etc./n[15][16]/nIn St. Petersburg, a 15-year-old boy noted in his diary on 29 March 1878:/nUkrainians are terribly oppressed. Even in Austria, Drahomanov was not allowed to publish a newspaper in Ukrainian. In Russia, it is completely forbidden to print books in my native language. During the holidays, I will take care of her with all respect. In Kyiv, when a portrait of Shevchenko is seen in a house, it is taken away./n[17][18][19][20][16][21]/nVernadsky participated in the First General Congress of the zemstvos, held in Petersburg on the eve of the 1905 Russian Revolution to discuss how best to pressure the government to the needs of the Russian society; became a member of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (KD); and served in parliament, resigning to protest the Tsar's proroguing of the Duma. He served as professor and later as vice rector of Moscow University, from which he also resigned in 1911 in protest over the government's reactionary policies./nFollowing the advent of the First World War, his proposal for the establishment of the Commission for the Study of the Natural Productive Forces (KEPS) was adopted by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in February 1915. He published War and the Progress of Science where he stressed the importance of science as regards to its contribution to the war effort:[22]/nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, he served on several commissions of agriculture and education of the provisional government, including as assistant minister of education.[24]/nVladimir Vernadsky had dual \"Russian \u2013 Ukrainian\" identity [5] and considered the Ukrainian culture as part of Russia imperial culture[25] and even declined to become a Ukrainian citizen in 1918.[25]/nVernadsky first popularized the concept of the noosphere and deepened the idea of the biosphere to the meaning largely recognized by today's scientific community. The word 'biosphere' was invented by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess, whom Vernadsky met in 1911./nIn Vernadsky's theory of the Earth's development, the noosphere is the third stage in the earth's development, after the geosphere (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human cognition will fundamentally transform the biosphere. In this theory, the principles of both life and cognition are essential features of the Earth's evolution, and must have been implicit in the earth all along. This systemic and geological analysis of living systems complements Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection,[citation needed] which looks at each individual species, rather than at its relationship to a subsuming principle./nVernadsky's visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West. However, he was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planets as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was an important pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.[26]/nVernadsky was a member of the Russian and Soviet Academies of Sciences since 1912 and was a founder and first president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kyiv, Ukraine (1918). He was a founder of the National Library of Ukrainian State and worked closely with the Tavrida University in Crimea. During the Russian Civil War, he hosted gatherings of the young intellectuals who later founded the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Eurasianism movement.[27]/nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s Vernadsky played an early advisory role in the Soviet atomic bomb project, as one of the most forceful voices arguing for the exploitation of nuclear power, the surveying of Soviet uranium sources, and having nuclear fission research conducted at his Radium Institute. He died, however, before a full project was pursued./nOn religious views, Vernadsky was an atheist.[28] He was interested in Hinduism and Rig Veda.[29][30]/nVernadsky's son George Vernadsky (1887\u20131973) emigrated to the United States where he published numerous books on medieval and modern Russian history./nThe National Library of Ukraine, the Tavrida National University in Crimea and many streets and avenues in Ukraine and Russia are named in honor of Vladimir Vernadsky./nUNESCO sponsored an international scientific conference, \"Globalistics-2013\", at Moscow State University on 23\u201325 October 2013, in honor of Vernadsky's 150th birthday./nOn 25 October 2019 the National Bank of Ukraine put in circulation a \u20b41,000 hryvnia banknote with Vernadsky's portrait.[31]", "1834764": "Don Ihde (/d\u0251\u02d0n a\u026adi/; born 1934) is an American philosopher of science and technology.[1] In 1979 he wrote what is often identified as the first North American work on philosophy of technology,[2] Technics and Praxis./nBefore his retirement, Ihde was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Ihde lectures and gives seminars internationally and some of his books and articles have appeared in a dozen languages./nDon Ihde uses the theoretical tools of phenomenology to analyse technology, and specifically the relations between humans and technological artefacts.[4] Rather than thinking about technology as an abstract category, postphenomenological analysis looks at actual artefacts and the way they interact with users.[4] Technologies, according to this view, mediate our relationship to the world, influencing the way we see it, understand it, act on it.[4] Other important authors in the field of postphenomenology are Peter-Paul Verbeek and Robert Rosenberger./nIhde's work Bodies in Technology[5] spells out the original exploration of the ways cyberspace affects the human experience. The book explores embodiment in cyberspace with references to human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) research. The main question of the book is the meaning of bodies in technology./nIhde rejects Cartesian dualism. Even to have an out of body experience is to have an implicit 'here-body' from which we experience an 'object-body' over there. He has further explored these arguments in his book Bodies in Technology.[5]/nBeginning with a \"phenomenology of multistability\" in the way various \"technological media\" are perceived, Ihde examines the \"roles of human embodiment, perception, and spatial transformations within communication and information media.\"[6]/nIhde argues that movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a technological context and relate to the human sense of embodiment. He stresses an important fact that we have to experience the embodiment where we live, rather than to \"plugin\" to a technofantasies world.[7]/nThe study of technoscience examines recent work in the fields of the philosophies of science and technology, and science studies; it also emphasizes the roles of our material cultures and expertise. According to Ihde, science and technology are in a symbiotic relationship, where scientific research relies fully on the development of scientific instruments, the technological development./nIn a paper \"Was Heidegger prescient concerning Technoscience?\", Ihde re-examines Martin Heidegger's philosophy of science with a reappraisal of what was innovative, and what remained archaic. Heidegger then is read against the background of the \"new\" approaches to science in science studies, and against the background of the scientific revolutions which have occurred since the mid-20th century.[8]/nIhde has introduced the concept of  material hermeneutics, which characterises much practice within the domains of technoscience. He rejects the vestigial Diltheyan division between the humanistic and natural sciences and argues that certain types of critical interpretation, broadly hermeneutic, characterize both sets of disciplines. He examines what he calls a style of interpretation based in material practices relating to imaging technologies which have given rise to the visual hermeneutics in technoscience studies.[9]/nWith references to science studies, sociology of science and feminist critique of science, Ihde has presented the idea of expanding hermeneutics, which emphasises praxis, instruments and laboratories over theoretical work. He claims that in science, the instruments and technologies used operate in a hermeneutic way.[10]/nIhde has argued on numerous occasions that \"if the philosopher is to play a more important role it must not be only in or limited to the Hemingway role. Rather, it should take place in the equivalent of the officers' strategy meeting, before the battle takes shape. I will call this the 'R&D role'\".[11] Philosophers should engage themselves on interdisciplinary research teams and actively participate in research and development work.[11] He has claimed that only by having philosophers in the R&D labs they can have truly new and emerging technologies that are philosophically engaged.[12] Philosophers, precisely postphenomenologists, could help the scientific community to think about the future, rather than only about present-day phenomena or the past.[13]", "2916113": "Emmanuel Mounier (/mu\u02d0n\u02c8je\u026a/; French: [munje]; 1 April 1905 \u2013 22 March 1950) was a French philosopher, theologian, teacher and essayist./nMounier was the guiding spirit in the French personalist movement, and founder and director of Esprit, the magazine which was the organ of the movement.

In Athens, he studied under Proclus, and learned the doctrine of Aristotle from Marinus.[3] According to Damascius, \"Isidore was awestruck at the sight of Proclus, venerable and marvelous to see; he thought he was seeing in him the very face of true philosophy.\"[4] Proclus for his part used to \"marvel at Isidore's appearance, as it was possessed by the divine and full of the philosophical life within.\"[5] Damascius further tells us that \"Isidore, besides simplicity, loved truthfulness especially, and undertook to be straight-talking beyond what was necessary, and had no pretence in himself whatsoever.\"[6] The claim made in the Suda that Isidore was the husband of Hypatia,[7] must be in error since Isidore was born long after Hypatia died.[8] It is elsewhere related that Isidore had a wife called Domna, who died five days after the birth of their son whom they named Proclus.[9]/nIsidore returned to Alexandria accompanied by Sallustius.[10] In Alexandria he taught philosophy. He was in Athens when Proclus died (in 485), and later when Marinus took over as head (scholarch) of the Neoplatonist school.[3] Marinus persuaded him to be his successor as head of the school, but he left Athens not long after Marinus died,[11] resigning his position to Hegias.[2]/nIsidore is known principally as the teacher of Damascius, whose testimony in his Life of Isidore presents Isidore in a very favourable light as a man and a thinker.[2] Damascius' Life, which is dedicated to Theodora, a disciple of both Isidore and Damascius, is preserved in summary form by Photius in his Bibliotheca,[12] and in fragments in the Suda./nIt is generally admitted that he was rather an enthusiast than a thinker; reasoning with him was subsidiary to inspiration, and he preferred the theories of Pythagoras and Plato to the unimaginative logic and the practical ethics of the Stoics and Aristotelians.

He had a son named Lysiadas. Phaedrus was succeeded by Patro./nCicero wrote to Atticus requesting Phaedrus' essay On gods (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd).[6]  Cicero used this work to aid his composition of the first book of the De Natura Deorum.

He was described as the Crates from Mallus to distinguish him from other philosophers by the same name. His chief work was a critical and exegetical commentary on Homer. He is also famous for constructing the earliest known globe of the Earth./nHe was born in Mallus in Cilicia, and was brought up at Tarsus, and then moved to Pergamon, and there lived under the patronage of Eumenes II, and Attalus II. He was the founder of the Pergamon school of grammar, and seems to have been at one time the head of the library of Pergamon. Among his followers were Hermias (\u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 mentioned in sch. Hom. Il. 16.207a), Zenodotus of Mallus and Herodicus of Babylon./nHe visited Rome as ambassador of either Eumenes, in 168 BC, or Attalus in 159 BC.  Having broken his leg after falling into an open sewer, he was compelled to stay in Rome for some time and delivered lectures which gave the first impulse to the study of grammar and criticism among the Romans.[1][2]/nCrates made a strong distinction between criticism and grammar, the latter of which he regarded as subordinate to the former. A critic, according to Crates, should investigate everything which could throw light upon literature; the grammarian was only to apply the rules of language to clear up the meaning of particular passages, and to settle the text, prosody, accentuation, etc. From this part of his system, Crates derived the surname of Kritikos./nLike Aristarchus of Samothrace, Crates gave the greatest attention to the works of Homer, from his labours upon which he was also surnamed Homerikos. He wrote a commentary on the Iliad and Odyssey in nine books. Some fragments of this commentary are preserved by the scholiasts and other ancient writers.[3] His principles were opposed to those of Aristarchus, who was the leader of the Alexandrian school. Crates was the chief representative of the allegorical theory of exegesis, and maintained that Homer intended to express scientific or philosophical truths in the form of poetry.[2]/nBesides his work on Homer, Crates wrote commentaries on the Theogony of Hesiod, on Euripides, on Aristophanes, and probably on other ancient authors; a work on the Attic dialect; and works on geography, natural history, and agriculture, of which only a few fragments exist.[4]/nAccording to Strabo, Crates devised a globe representing the Earth, which is thus the earliest known globe representing the Earth:/nWe have now traced on a spherical surface the area in which we say the inhabited world is situated; and the man who would most closely approximate the truth by constructed figures must necessarily take for the earth a globe like that of Crates, and lay off on it the quadrilateral, and within the quadrilateral put down the map of the inhabited world. But since the need of a large globe, so that the section in question (being a small fraction of the globe) may be large enough to receive distinctly the appropriate parts of the inhabited world and to present the proper appearance to observers, it is better for him to construct a globe of adequate size, if he can do so; and let it be no less than ten feet in diameter.[6]/nFollowing the theory of five climatic zones, Crates considered that the torrid zone is occupied by the Ocean and that, by analogy, one can imagine people living beyond the torrid zone:/nFor Crates, following the mere form of mathematical demonstration, says that the torrid zone is \"occupied\" by Oceanus and that on both sides of this zone are the temperate zones, the one being on our side, while the other is on the other side of it. Now, just as these Ethiopians on our side of Oceanus, who face the south throughout the whole length of the inhabited land, are called the most remote of the one group of peoples, since they dwell on the shores of Oceanus, so too, Crates thinks, we must conceive that on the other side of Oceanus also there are certain Ethiopians, the most remote of the other group of peoples in the temperate zone, since they dwell on the shores of this same Oceanus; and that they are in two groups and are \"sundered in twain\" by Oceanus.[7]/nThe classic drawing of the sphere displays the known world, or Oecumene (Europe, North Africa, and Asia), with three other continents, labeled the Perioeci, the Antipodes, and the Antioeci. Crates' Perioeci and Antipodes arguably do exist, corresponding roughly to North America and South America respectively, but the continent of the Antioeci, Terra Australis, does not, except in fragments (Australasia and southern Africa). And the earth does in fact have a ring of water around it, but at 60 degrees South latitude, not at the Equator./nCrates Bay in Antarctica is named after Crates of Mallusan.", "556846": "Ernst Alfred Cassirer (/k\u0251\u02d0\u02c8s\u026a\u0259r\u0259r, k\u0259\u02c8-/ kah-SEER-\u0259r, k\u0259-,[1] German: [\u02c8\u025b\u0281nst ka\u02c8si\u02d0\u0281\u0250];[2][3] July 28, 1874 \u2013 April 13, 1945) was a German philosopher. Trained within the Neo-Kantian Marburg School, he initially followed his mentor Hermann Cohen in attempting to supply an idealistic philosophy of science./nAfter Cohen's death in 1918, Cassirer developed a theory of symbolism and used it to expand phenomenology of knowledge into a more general philosophy of culture. Cassirer was one of the leading 20th-century advocates of philosophical idealism. His most famous work is the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923\u20131929)./nThough his work received a mixed reception shortly after his death, more recent scholarship has remarked upon Cassirer's role as a strident defender of the moral idealism of the Enlightenment era and the cause of liberal democracy at a time when the rise of fascism had made such advocacy unfashionable. Within the international Jewish community, Cassirer's work has additionally been seen as part of a long tradition of thought on ethical philosophy.[4]/nBorn in Breslau in Silesia (modern-day southwest Poland), into a Jewish family, Cassirer studied literature and philosophy at the University of Marburg (where he completed his doctoral work in 1899 with a dissertation on Ren\u00e9 Descartes's analysis of mathematical and natural scientific knowledge entitled Descartes' Kritik der mathematischen und naturwissenschaftlichen Erkenntnis [Descartes' Critique of Mathematical and Scientific Knowledge]) and at the University of Berlin (where he completed his habilitation in 1906 with the dissertation Das Erkenntnisproblem in der Philosophie und Wissenschaft der neueren Zeit: Erster Band [The Problem of Knowledge in Philosophy and Science in the Modern Age: Volume I]).[5]/nPolitically, Cassirer supported the liberal German Democratic Party (DDP).[6] After working for many years as a Privatdozent at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, Cassirer was elected in 1919 to the philosophy chair at the newly founded University of Hamburg, where he lectured until 1933, supervising amongst others the doctoral theses of Joachim Ritter and Leo Strauss. \nOn 30 January 1933, the Nazi Regime came to power. Cassirer left Germany on 12 March 1933 - one week after the first Reichstagswahl under that Regime - because he was Jewish.[7]/nAfter leaving Germany he taught for a couple of years at the University of Oxford, before becoming a professor at Gothenburg University. When Cassirer considered Sweden too unsafe, he applied for a post at Harvard University, but was rejected because thirty years earlier he had rejected a job offer from them.[citation needed] In 1941 he became a visiting professor at Yale University, then moved to Columbia University in New York City, where he lectured from 1943 until his death in 1945./nCassirer died of a heart attack in April 1945 in New York City. The young rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, who was a student of Cassirer's at Columbia University, conducted the funeral service.[8] His grave is located in Westwood, New Jersey, on the Cedar Park Beth-El Cemeteries in the graves of the Congregation Habonim. His son, Heinz Cassirer, was also a Kantian scholar./nOther members of his prominent family included the neurologist Richard Cassirer, the publisher and gallery owner Bruno Cassirer and the art dealer and editor Paul Cassirer./nDonald Phillip Verene, who published some of Cassirer's papers kept at Yale University, gave this overview of his ideas:/n\"Cassirer as a thinker became an embodiment of Kantian principles, but also of much more, of an overall movement of spirit stretching from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, and on to Herder\u2019s conception of history, Goethe\u2019s poetry, Wilhelm von Humboldt\u2019s study of the Kavi language, Schelling\u2019s Philosophie Der Mythologie, Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit, and Vischer\u2019s conception of the aesthetic symbol, among many others. Cassirer\u2019s own position is born through a mastery of the whole development of this world of the humanistic understanding, which included the rise of the scientific world view \u2014 a mastery evident both in his historical works and in his systematic philosophy.\"[9]/nCassirer's first major published writings were a history of modern thought from the Renaissance to Kant. In accordance with his Marburg neo-Kantianism he concentrated upon epistemology. His reading of the scientific revolution, in books such as The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy (1927), as a \"Platonic\" application of mathematics to nature, influenced historians such as E. A. Burtt, E. J. Dijksterhuis, and Alexandre Koyr\u00e9./nIn Substance and Function (1910), he writes about late nineteenth-century developments in physics including relativity theory and the foundations of mathematics. In Einstein's Theory of Relativity (1921) he defended the claim that modern physics supports a neo-Kantian conception of knowledge. He also wrote a book about Quantum mechanics called Determinism and Indeterminism in Modern Physics (1936)./nAt Hamburg Cassirer discovered the Library of the Cultural Sciences founded by Aby Warburg. Warburg was an art historian who was particularly interested in ritual and myth as sources of surviving forms of emotional expression. In Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923\u201329) Cassirer argues that man (as he put it in his more popular 1944 book Essay on Man) is a \"symbolic animal\". Whereas animals perceive their world by instincts and direct sensory perception, humans create a universe of symbolic meanings. Cassirer is particularly interested in natural language and myth. He argues that science and mathematics developed from natural language, and religion and art from myth./nIn 1929 Cassirer took part in a historically significant encounter with Martin Heidegger in Davos during the Second Davos Hochschulkurs (the Cassirer\u2013Heidegger debate). Cassirer argues that while Kant's Critique of Pure Reason emphasizes human temporality and finitude, he also sought to situate human cognition within a broader conception of humanity. Cassirer challenges Heidegger's relativism by invoking the universal validity of truths discovered by the exact and moral sciences./nCassirer believed that reason's self-realization leads to human liberation. Mazlish (2000)[citation needed], however, notes that Cassirer in his The Philosophy of the Enlightenment (1932) focuses exclusively on ideas, ignoring the political and social context in which they were produced./nIn The Logic of the Cultural Sciences (1942) Cassirer argues that objective and universal validity can be achieved not only in the sciences, but also in practical, cultural, moral, and aesthetic phenomena. Although inter-subjective objective validity in the natural sciences derives from universal laws of nature, Cassirer asserts that an analogous type of inter-subjective objective validity takes place in the cultural sciences./nCassirer's last work, The Myth of the State (1946), was published posthumously; at one level it is an attempt to understand the intellectual origins of Nazi Germany. Cassirer sees Nazi Germany as a society in which the dangerous power of myth is not checked or subdued by superior forces. The book discusses the opposition of logos and mythos in Greek thought, Plato's Republic, the medieval theory of the state, Machiavelli, Thomas Carlyle's writings on hero worship, the racial theories of Arthur de Gobineau, and Hegel. Cassirer claimed that in 20th-century politics there was a return, with the passive acquiescence of Martin Heidegger, to the irrationality of myth, and in particular to a belief that there is such a thing as destiny. Of this passive acquiescence, Cassirer says that in departing from Husserl's belief in an objective, logical basis for philosophy, Heidegger attenuated the ability of philosophy to oppose the resurgence of myth in German politics of the 1930s.", "32833330": "Stefano (or Stephen) Pace (1695\u20131735) was a minor Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in physics.[1]/nUnfortunately, very little is known about the private life of Pace. It seems that, in his youth, he might have been a student at the Studium Generale of the Dominicans at Valletta, Malta. It seems he was a diocesan priest. Whatever the case, it is certain that he was a member of the clerical branch of the Franciscan Order in Malta. No portrait of Pace has been discovered so far./nOnly one work of Stephen Pace is known. It is a work in three volumes, of which only one \u2013 the third \u2013 is still extant./nThis third volume is titled La Fisica (Physics).

But this, of course, cannot be ascertained./nIn any case, it is interesting that this book (and presumably the other volumes as well) was published in Venice, at the publishing house of Lorenzo Basegio. This alone might attest to Pace\u2019s foreign experience as well as his standing amongst foreigners./nThe extant volume on physics is in Italian and was published in 1729. The other volumes of the set must have been similar, and published around that year too. La Fisica contains 522 pages./nThe volume is divided into seven Treatises, and each one is sub-divided into Chapters. The title of the book might give the impression that Pace deals with physics in the sense commonly understood, as general or particular physics. However, in fact the work is specifically about the physical qualities and characteristics of animals, specifically from the point of view of Aristotle./nPace takes pains to refuse the interpretations given by various other Aristotelian commentators or by philosophers in general. As promised, he includes in his refutation some Cartesians, Atomists, and also other Physicalists./nHis detailed analysis in the treatises, all dealing with animals, focuses on the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul; movement, reproduction and nutrition, and the nature and faculties of the sensitive soul and the rational souls. At the end of his work, Pace includes an illustration on the physical structure of the eye, and the brain./nIt can only be imagined what the two former volumes of Pace\u2019s trilogy dealt with. However, if the third extant volume is anything to go by with, they must have been enormously interesting from a philosophical point of view. Not only as regards content but surely also as regards intensity, extensiveness and depth. Especially if they dealt with metaphysics and logic./nHaving said this, it is certain that much research is needed in order that the full value of Pace is recognised. It is a pity, for instance, that the first two volumes of his trilogy have not yet been located. These would surely contribute to a fuller understanding of his philosophy and his worth./nFurthermore, the dearth of information concerning Pace\u2019s personal life is truly unfortunate. He was not part of the great monastic movements, and yet he seems to have been a considerable success, both locally and abroad. This alone must be a sign of his esteem and value.

As a boy, he was obsessed with science fiction; he was particularly struck by the ideas in Robert A. Heinlein's Orphans of the Sky. Churchland liked building things in his father's woodworking and metal shop in their basement, and expected to become an aerodynamical engineer.[5]/nAt the University of British Columbia, Churchland began with classes in math and physics, intending to pursue engineering.

His work has been described as being influenced by the work of W. V. O. Quine, Thomas Kuhn, Russell Hanson, Wilfrid Sellars, and Paul Feyerabend.[14]/nAlong with his wife, Churchland is a major proponent of eliminative materialism,[15] the belief that/neveryday, common-sense, 'folk' psychology, which seeks to explain human behavior in terms of the beliefs and desires of agents, is actually a deeply flawed theory that must be eliminated in favor of a mature cognitive neuroscience.[6]/nwhere by folk psychology is meant everyday mental concepts such as beliefs, feelings, and desires, which are viewed as theoretical constructs without coherent definition, and thus destined to be obviated by a scientific understanding of human nature. From the perspective of Zawidzki, Churchland's concept of eliminativism is suggested as early as his book Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind (1979), with its most explicit formulation appearing in a Journal of Philosophy essay, \"Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes\" (1981).[6]/nChurchland believes that beliefs are not ontologically real; that is, that a future, fully matured neuroscience is likely to have no need for \"beliefs\" (see propositional attitudes), in the same manner that modern science discarded such notions as legends or witchcraft. According to Churchland, such concepts will not merely be reduced to more finely grained explanation and retained as useful proximate levels of description, but will be strictly eliminated as wholly lacking in correspondence to precise objective phenomena, such as activation patterns across neural networks. He points out that the history of science has seen many posits that were considered as real entities: such as phlogiston; caloric; the luminiferous ether; and vital forces that were thus eliminated.[citation needed]/nMoreover, in The Engine of Reason, The Seat of the Soul Churchland suggests that consciousness might be explained in terms of a recurrent neural network with its hub in the intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus, and feedback connections to all parts of the cortex. He acknowledges that this proposal will likely be found in error with regard to the neurological details, but states his belief that it is on the right track in its use of recurrent neural networks to account for consciousness. This has been described as a reductionist rather than eliminativist account of consciousness.[citation needed]/nChurchland is the husband of philosopher Patricia Churchland, and it has been noted that, \"Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person.\"[16]/nThe Churchlands are the parents of two children, Mark Churchland and Anne Churchland, both of whom are neuroscientists.[17]/nProfessor Churchland has authored several books in philosophy, which have been translated into many languages.[3] His works are as follows:/nHis book Matter and Consciousness has been frequently and extensively reprinted.[18] Both Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind and A Neurocomputational Perspective have been reprinted.[19]/nProfessor Churchland has written a number of published articles, some of which have been translated into other languages, including several that have had a substantial impact in philosophy.

A Novel of Upbringing and Adventures of Major Zvyagin (1991) became bestsellers, along with \"The Legends of Nevsky Prospect\" (1993). His book Everything about Life is a book about how the world works, why a no one ever has what they need, and why happiness is not achievable but should be sought (his later book Cassandra updates this philosophy).

According to this theory the primordial energy released in the Big Bang is attached to material structures of ever increasing complexity, which in their turn decompose and release energy. These cycles continue at ever increasing speed. The human existence is entangled in this process and also increases the speed of revolution. Humankind thus is at the cutting edge of the evolution of the universe. The end of history is to arrive when post-humanity will assist the release of all energy in the matter, thereby causing a new cycle by the next BIg Bang event.

His primary areas of research are the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and cognitive science./nIn his book, Existential Cognition: Minds in the World, McClamrock argued for the extreme importance of the external environment (both social and physical) in the determination of almost all varieties of human and animal behavior. His position is that the methodological individualism inherent in many contemporary forms of computational theories of the mind are completely inadequate and that we must look to the interactions between organism and world in order to find \"external mechanisms that mediate behavior\" as well as the usual internal mechanisms. Borrowing from Herbert A. Simon and also influenced by the ideas of existential phenomenologists such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, McClamrock suggests that man's condition of being-in-the-world makes it impossible for him to understand himself by abstracting away from it and examining it as if it were a detached experimental object of which he himself is not an integral part./nHowever, unlike the continental philosophers, McClamrock relies upon results from modern information sciences, biology and cognitive science to support his conclusions about the bounded and embedded nature of consciousness and the mind as a whole. One of his examples, taken from David Marr, discusses the exploitation of local environmental regularities in the control mechanisms of the common fly./nThe local surface mediates the signal from brain to wings, illustrating the point that the human nervous system may be said, in a certain sense, to extend to parts of its external environment./nIn another example, McClamrock cites the case of a man driving from one destination to another. On the way, he encounters various external signals and stimuli (street names, direction signs, people who provide information when asked, landmarks, etc..) and all of these help him, in many cases are indispensable to, his successfully finding his way from point A to point B. The path he ends up traveling to get to point B from point A is, in any case, partially determined by his environment. In the case of ants, this is even clearer. When we look at the tracks that ants make as a result of their movements, they seemed to be highly ordered and preplanned. But, in fact, an ant will usually encounter unforeseen and unforeseeable obstacles as it makes its way along from one point to another. At each obstacle, it will be constrained to make a choice that it otherwise wouldn't. The path that it ultimately travels will therefore be heavily determined by its exterior environment, as well its behavior./nMcClamrock's article \"Emergence Unscathed: Kim on Non-Reducible Types\"  took on Jaegwon Kim's famous \"causal powers\" argument against multiple realizability.[1] Kim argued that multiple realizability conflicts with fundamental constraints on the definition of kinds and with general rules of scientific taxonomy. Kim's argument is based on two essential premises:/nFrom this it follows that:/nThe second premise is/nFrom all of this, it follows, according to Kim, that \"if mental kinds are multiply realizable, then they are disqualified as proper scientific kinds...because they are realized by diverse physical causal kinds.\"[2]/nMcClamrock flatly rejected Kim's claim that \"instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind\". It is a consequence of token materialism that a complete specification of the causal powers of a mental kind at a certain time will be a complete specification of the causal powers of the physical state which implements it. But Kim's assertion only follows if we assume that the only specification of causal kinds can be in terms of causal powers of tokens. McClamrock suggested understanding higher-level causal powers as simply more general and abstract characterizations of the lower-level causal powers implemented in the physical structure of a system. There are many varieties of causal taxonomy classifying things according to various kinds of causal powers they possess. For example, a taxonomy of orbiting bodies may specify the causal powers of objects in terms of mass, position and velocity \u2013 abstracting from the body's chemical composition, geology or microbiotic agglomerations. Such an abstract and incomplete characterization of the causal powers of a system makes it possible to group together physically type-distinct instances of the higher-level kind (in this case, planets, stars and other orbiting bodies)./nMoreover, taxonomies in computer science are typically characterized by such abstractions. What is of interest at the level of information processing are such things as registers and microprogramming operations, not the causal powers of the material structure of semiconductors.", "2948966": "Edmundo O'Gorman (24 November 1906 in Mexico City \u2013 28 September 1995 in Mexico City) was a Mexican writer, historian and philosopher.

Pereira worked hard to dispel medieval concepts of medicine and proposed the application of empirical methods; as for his philosophy, it is of the standard direction and his reasonings are a clear precedent of Ren\u00e9 Descartes.[1] He was the first to propose the famous \"Cogito ergo sum\", in 1554, commonly attributed to Descartes. He was famous for his practice of medicine, although he had many diverse occupations, such as owning businesses, engineering, and philosophy./nNot much is known of his life, because there was no one who took care of his manuscripts. What is known is the result of the investigation of unrelated documents to which researchers have given shape, many of them having to do with business or lawsuits./nBorn in 1500 in Medina del Campo, he was the second of five brothers; his father, Antonia Pereira, owned a small shop of \" xerguer\u00eda,\" i.e., fabrics and low quality cloths. His mother, Margarita de Medina, died in 1515 and her sons went to the care of her aunt Ana de Avila. It is thought that Pereira descended from a family of converted Jews originally from Portugal, though this is not certain because the source of this was a neighbor that testified against him in a lawsuit./nHowever, we cannot rule out this conversion because we know that, until his marriage, Pereira lived with his parents on Serrano street, which is located in the old Jewish quarter of town./nPereira studied natural philosophy at the University of Salamanca with professor Juan Mart\u00ednez Sil\u00edceo (who later became the archbishop of Toledo between 1545 and 1557). There, apparently, he was actively involved in the disputes between the realists and the nominalists, preferring the latter and rejecting the authority of the old masters in favor of knowledge provided by experience and reason. Here, he also studied medicine, concluding his studies 1520./nHe then returned to Medina where he established himself as a doctor. He married Isabel Rodriguez and lived on R\u00faa Nueva (now Padilla Street) where he worked as a doctor and managed the business that he inherited from his family. He possessed a considerable amount of capital and invested in a wide range of business including responsibility for making the actual income and managing the collection of several parishes, trading and warehousing wines, and renting rooms to other merchants who went to the \"Great Exhibitions of the Kingdom\" that took place in Medina./nHis fame as a physician exceeded the boundaries of Medina, and he practiced in Burgos, Segovia, \u00c1vila and other important cities of Castille. He even came to the court of Phillip II where he was summed to attend upon Prince Charles, heir to the unfortunate throne, who had suffered a serious accident. Thanks to Pereira, the Prince lived until 1568. He was also interested in the construction of hydraulic devices and, with his companion Francisco Lobato, designed a watermill dam that could function without water, which was patented in 1563./nIn folio 26 of the Manuscripts of Francisco Lobato, the Medinan engineer decided to design a special mill, at the initiative of King Maxmilian II of Austria, who at the time was in Vallodolid (ca. 1550), a refugee from the wars against the Protestants. The future king of Bohemia took a fancy to go up the Douro River, so he commanded a galley be built and ordered the removal of any building that disrupted his navigation, i.e., fisheries and mills. This greatly harmed the locals who came to Lobato and Pereira to design a mill that could grind with the force of water without being directly on the river bank. Lobato goes on to explain that a model they tested on the Zapardiel River \"milled and shook with reasonable force\u2026, but it sucked in so much water that, by midday, there wasn't a single drop.\" Although the model was refined with a dam that returned the water to the river, the king paid no attention, and the project fell into oblivion. Lobato complained bitterly that, despite the promises of funding by the Habsburgs, \"we have already spent 150 ducats\u2026and he never paid me anything\u2014someday I'll have to ask for it.\"/nPereira's unique thought arose from his synthesis of philosophy and medicine. He rejected the authority of the old masters and medievals in favor of reason, logic and experience. Moreover, he often used paradoxes and syllogisms to expose the errors of those he questioned. Thus, it can be argued that his philosophy was more negative than positive, but this is understandable considering the context of ideological suppression in the face of religious authority, as well the veiled accusations about Pereira's Jewish origins. The famous essayist Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo wrote of this famous thinker:/nIn experimental psychology, G\u00f3mez Pereira is, without a doubt, more advanced than his time, more than the seventeenth century, more than Bacon, more than Descartes. None noted the phenomenon of his intelligence./nNovae veraeque Medicinae is a medical treatise that focuses on the study of fevers [its causes and types] as well as other specific diseases like leprosy and smallpox. In this work, which he dedicated to Prince Don Carlos, Pereira challenges the tradition of Aristotle and Galen, as well as the medieval tradition of \"magister dixit\". His is an entirely empirical and rational method, based in his experience as a physician. The healing methods are simple, and the doctor, because of his method and experience, is the final criterion of truth (as opposed to truths of religion or faith). \"In no case of religious things will I give the opinion and sentence of some philosopher if it is not based on reason.\"/nG\u00f3mez Pereira felt that the heat generated by a fever is the body's defense mechanism to remove the damage that affects it and, thus, nature restores the natural balance of any body, a surprisingly modern conception of fever as a reaction against disease. As for his studies of diseases such as leprosy or smallpox, Pereira's conclusions were later commended by the physician and historian Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Morej\u00f3n./nAntoniana Margarita was reprinted many times but only very recently translated into Spanish (2000, from the original Latin).[2] The work is dedicated to his teacher Juan Mart\u00ednez Siliceo and is a tribute to his parents, Antonio and Margarita, even though the subtitle of clearly indicates its scientific and philosophical contents: \"a work so useful and necessary for medical, physical, and theologians (\"Opus nempe phisicis, ac medicis teologis, non minus utile quam necessarium\")./nA difficult text to read because there are no chapters or paragraphs, the document uses the language of the \"christianos nuevos\" (New Christians) to explore new ideas from empiricism and materialism, possibly an effort to hide potentially controversial and blasphemous methods of reasoning (16th Century Castile, the Council of Trent had already begun). Thus, the Pereira did not venture to develop the logical conclusions to their fullest extent./nIt is a philosophical treatise that addresses three key issues: the \"automatism of beasts\"; the theory of human knowledge; the immortality of the soul./nPereira's paradigm is typical of the Christian humanism of the Renaissance, denying that animals are equal to humans, while acknowledging some resemblance. Both have a body with five senses, but in the case of animals, the senses do not lead to knowledge, but cause automatic reactions. Indeed, many animals are capable of acting on internal impulses (soma), upon external stimuli (specie and phantasma), and have some non-conscious ability to learn (memoria). Nevertheless, Pereira denies animals the capacity for real knowledge: \"bruta sensu carent.\"/nThe idea had many supporters, because, as indicated by the author himself, if animals feel just like humans, there would be nothing to differentiate, and if humans and animals are equal, animals can also learn about the Universal, which would be \"absurd and impious.\" But he also had detractors, some of them very close. The physician Francisco de Sosa, who published in 1556 his work \"Endec\u00e1lago against Antoniana Margarita, in which is treated many and very sensitive reasons and authorities of the proofs of the feeling and movement of brutes.\"/nIn this sense, Pereira's ideas are radically opposed to medieval scholasticism. He argues that knowledge enters through the sensory organs, as in animals, but only the human soul, its spirit, is capable of converting the information provided by the senses into real thought. This is one of the qualities of the soul, the ability to extract from physical sensations the substance of things (universals) through this process of abstraction. But G\u00f3mez Pereira believes that sensation and intellect go together in such a way that in human beings there is something that identifies the faculty of feeling with the quality of thought, in the same way, e.g., that thought and language are linked: \"if you feel, you understand.\"/nThus, knowledge would be an essential faculty of the soul, and, moreover, the human being has a soul conscious of itself, that exists thanks to the thoughts it develops. In this work (Antoniana Margarita), there is the phrase \"I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist\" (\"Nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum\").[3][4]/nHistory has not recognized his contribution even though Descartes had already been accused of plagiarism in his time, for example by Pierre Daniel Huet.[5]/nAlthough Pereira recognizes that animals have souls, it dies with them. The human soul, however, is self-sufficient and thus immortal. He provides three proofs that he claims had not been discovered. First, because of its consciousness, the human soul is capable of knowing independent of the body, and thus is capable of existing despite the body's death. Secondly, the human soul does not change even though the body ages or becomes diseased, that is, its essence is not affected by extrinsic factors. Thirdly, it is the desire of all humans to attain happiness, which, alongside the wish to know the future and the consequences of our actions, are the reasons that prompt us to do good, because evil deeds lead to punishment and misfortune./nAfter Ren\u00e9 Descartes published his Discourse on Method in 1637, the originality of the thoughts was questioned and even said to be an overt plagiarism of G\u00f3mez Pereira, as the Spanish philosopher had been studied by many prestigious intellectuals during the 16th and 17th Centuries./nThe first to suggest the similarities between the two was Pierre Daniel Huet, originally a follower then an opponent of Cartesian philosophy. Descartes himself was forced to defend himself against these accusations, as is evidenced by a letter he wrote in 1641 to his friend Father Marin Mersenne:/nI have not seen Antoniana Margarita, nor do I have a great need to see it any more than the Theses of Louvain or the book of Hansenius, but I would like to know where to find a copy if you think it necessary./nMany scholars of the 17th and 18th Centuries sided with Descartes and despised the work of Pereira, among them Pierre Bayle (although he did recognize the similarity between the two) and the Enclyopedists Diderot and d'Alembert who said:/nDescartes is the first philosopher who dared to consider animals as mere machines: therefore, G\u00f3mez Pereira, who said this some time before him . . . stumbled upon this hypothesis by chance./nHowever, many others have defended the contrary thesis. Even accepting that Descartes may not have read the work of Pereira, they argue that he was influenced indirectly, especially through the work of another Spanish physician and philosopher, Francisco Valles, who read it in French. Among those who accuse Descartes of being a counterfeit are Isaac Cardoso and Voltaire./nThe basis for this criticism is the striking similarities between the two thinkers on some key points:", "60915562": "Ignaz Cornova (25 July 1740 \u2013 25 July 1822) was a Jesuit priest who had spent his life and career in Bohemia.   His family provenance was Italian, but his social and professional network revolved around the ethnically German community centred on Prague.   He can be variously described as a historian, a teacher, an author and an early representative of the European Catholic Enlightenment movement. He was also a prominent Freemason.[1][2]/nIgnaz Cornova was born and died in Prague.[1]   His father was a businessman originally from Como.[3]    He attended the Jesuit Gymnasium (Secondary school) within the old city-walls of Prague.   Between 1756 and 1759 (sources differ) he himself became a member of the Jesuit order.[1][3][4]   He went on to undertake a further period of training in Br\u00fcnn (as Brno would have been known at that time).   He spent a year as a student in Bresnitz during 1759/60 and then between 1760 and 1764 studied at Olomouc/Olm\u00fctz[1] where the focus of his studies was on philosophy and theology.   Cornova was ordained in 1770 after which he pursued a teaching career, focusing initially on grammar and quickly broadening his scope to include poetry, Classical Greek and humanities subjects more broadly.[1][4]/nFrom his own subsequently published correspondence it appears that Cornova was working as a school teacher well before the conclusion of his university studies.   He started teaching at the Jesuit Gymnasium (Secondary school) in Br\u00fcnn in 1762.[5]  During 1770/71 his teaching career was interrupted by the demands of his priestly duties.   Then between 1771 and 1773 he was employed in Chomutov/Komotau (roughly equidistant between Leipzig and Prague) as a \"Pr\u00e4ses\" (loosely, \"professor\" or \"senior teacher\") at both the Jesuit seminary and the city gymnasium (secondary school) in Chomutov/Komotau (roughly equidistant between Leipzig and Prague).[1]   Pupils whom he taught during this period included the railway pioneer Franti\u0161ek Josef Gerstner.[6]   He then, early in 1773, became a professor of poetry and Classical Greek at the Jesuit college in Klatovy/Klattau, a town with a strong Jesuit presence, located to the south-west of Prague.[1][7]/nThe outlawing of the Jesuits which became effective in the Habsburg territories during 1773 deeply impacted  Cornova's career, but he was able to return to Prague and obtain a post teaching humanities at the \"Altst\u00e4dter Gymnasium\" (secondary school) in the city for ten years till 1784.[1]   It was during this period that he received his doctorate on philosophy.[5]   Then, between 1784 and 1794, he held a professorship in history at the university.[1]   During this time, in 1790, he accepted an appointment as dean of the philosophy faculty.[8]   In 1791 he was made a member of the Royal Bohemian Society (\"Regia Societas Scientiarum Bohemica\").   After 1795 he supported himself as a private educator, while composing lyric poems in the style of Klopstock./nCornova's principal contribution to historical scholarship is the new edition of Pavel Str\u00e1nsk\u00fd's Respublica Bojema (1634) and the translation of it into German, adding numerous supplementary notes.[9]   His further publications included a monograph about Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic.   His surviving works on philosophy include handwritten lecture notes about the methodologies of history teaching at Prague University./nAlthough Ignaz Cornova was influenced by Voltaire, but an earlier and more profound influence came from Herder, who impacted his approach to the role of the Slavic nations.[10]   The historical developments of the \"Enlightenment\" he viewed as a series of stages in the unfolding of historical events which could be attributed to the natural laws governing human development.   He also recognised that the well-being and condition of a state depended on the well-being of its citizens and their understanding of morality.", "5570411": "Thierry of Chartres (Theodoricus Chartrensis) or Theodoric the Breton (Theodericus Brito) (died before 1155,[1] probably 1150[2]) was a twelfth-century philosopher working at Chartres and Paris, France./nThe cathedral school at Chartres promoted scholarship before the first university was founded in France. Thierry was a major figure in twelfth-century philosophy and learning, and, like many twelfth-century scholars, is notable for his embrace of Plato's Timaeus and his application of philosophy to theological issues.[3] Some modern scholars believed Thierry to have been a brother of Bernard of Chartres who had founded the school of Chartres, but later research has shown that this is unlikely.[4]/nThierry became chancellor of Chartres after his predecessor, Gilbert of Poitiers, returned to his native city in 1141. John of Salisbury,[5] Herman of Carinthia, and Clarembald of Arras were among Thierry's students.[6]/nThe Hexaemeron interprets the Genesis with reference to Plato's \"Timaeus\". The text serves as a reasoned defense of God's existence, by relying on Platonic natural philosophy and Aristotelian logic to explain the creation of the world.[6] Thierry establishes that the moment of divine creation was the very beginning of time, and following that, creation evolved naturally through combinations of the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth).[7] According to Thierry, God created the four elements in the first moment. Fire, which is constantly moving, rotated and lit up the air, causing the first night and day. On the second day, fire warmed the water, causing it to rise into the heavens and form clouds. Because of the reduction of water, land emerged on the third day. The continued heating of the waters above the firmament caused the water to create the heavenly bodies on the fourth day. The continued warming of land caused the plant, animal, and human life to arise on the fifth and sixth days./nThierry's explanation of the creation of the world is based on a theological interpretation of Aristotle's four causes, which he identifies with the three persons of the Trinity plus matter (made up of the four elements): the Father is the efficient cause, the Son is the formal cause, the Holy Spirit is the final cause and the four elements are the material cause./nAccording to Thierry, the act of divine creation is limited to the creation of the four elements, which then evolve by themselves, mix according to mathematical proportions and make up the physical world./nThe Heptateuch is a broad encyclopedia of information relating to the liberal arts, all within the context of academic and theologic unity. It particularly examines the ways in which different types of knowledge can be distinguished, while still supporting a single purpose: explaining order in reality. The trivium (logic, grammar, and rhetoric) address the veracity, consistency, and beauty of the language of expression. The quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, and music) provide the intellectual content in need of expression./nThierry also wrote some commentaries on Boethius' De Trinitate.", "19922800": "Kenneth George Mills (January 25, 1923 \u2013 October 8, 2004) was a Canadian metaphysical/philosophical speaker and author. An exponent of the oral tradition, he gave spontaneous lectures and poetry for over 37 years. At the same time, he became noted for his accomplishments in music, particularly as the conductor of the choral ensemble The Star-Scape Singers. He excelled at composing, painting and design and has been described by some as a New Age man, a man for all seasons, and a Renaissance man.[1][2][3]/nMills was born in St. Stephen, New Brunswick in January 1923. He attended Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.[4] Trained from the age of 7 in music, he became a concert pianist, with debuts in Toronto in 1952 and New York City in 1961.[5] Though he chose to end his career as a concert pianist in 1963, he concentrated on teaching piano and adjudicating young musicians for another ten years.[6] Living in Toronto, he began speaking spontaneously to those who requested that he do so,[7] ultimately offering many thousands of hours of metaphysical/philosophical lectures and meetings over his lifetime./nMills extended his musical interests in 1976 when he formed the a cappella vocal ensemble The Star-Scape Singers. He and his singers would eventually give concerts throughout Eastern and Western Europe and the United States. Mills also engaged in musical composition, creating both choral and orchestral works. In addition, he explored various types of designing, and in 1993 created a line of haute couture fashions. His interest in painting yielded more than 200 large canvases.[6] He was recognized for mentoring and sponsorship of artists in all these disciplines, and he continued his mentoring and spontaneous speaking until shortly before his death in October 2004./nIn 1964, Mills decided to speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this agreement after he received the same message from two different sources: \"You must learn to speak the Word again.\"[7] Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures.[8] He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as \"an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living beyond the limits of three dimensions and translating what seems to be the ordinary into another level of consideration.\"[9] He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.[6]/nMany of Mills\u2019 spontaneous lectures were recorded and transcribed. Ultimately, a number of them were gathered together and published as books or as spoken word recordings, described by one reviewer as offering metaphysical ideas which are \"provocative and deeply inspiring.\"[10][11] A reviewer of one of his poetry books observed that Mills\u2019 universal themes \"revolve around wonder, light and love,\"[12] while an endorsement on another of his books described Mills as having fun with the language and the sounds of words.[13] It has also been pointed out that Mills\u2019 lectures and books \"give a universal, metaphysical perspective on some of the most perplexing problems faced by men and women today.\"[11]/nIn 1989, the Earth-Stage Actors, a New York City\u2013based ensemble, began to dramatize excerpts from Mills\u2019 publications. Critics have called these dramatizations \"a theatre of philosophy\" and \"modern-day Shakespeare.\"[6]/nMills\u2019 philosophy always possessed for him strong musical implications. \"The purpose of Music is to reveal to man his innate at-one-ment with a harmonic state of Being\", he said.[14] When three singers (from the vocal group The Free Design) asked him for help with their voices in 1976, Mills soon found himself re-engaging the world of concertizing. Within a short time, the three singers were joined by seven others, and the a cappella vocal ensemble he called The Star-Scape Singers was formed. These singers were ultimately acclaimed in the United States and abroad as creators of a renaissance in choral art.[15]/nStar-Scape made their American debut at Carnegie Hall in 1981, ultimately performing seven different concerts there between 1981 and 1986.[16] New York City critics described them as \"an instrument of bright and extraordinary varied capacity\"[17] and \"a vocal ensemble of rare distinction.\"[18] In 1983, the Singers embarked upon their first tour to Europe, performing at several large choral festivals, and on subsequent tours at many of the great halls and cathedrals of both Western and Eastern Europe. One critic in Munich described their work with Mills as \"phenomenal, artistic, one-of-a-kind vocal art.\"[19] Mills and the ensemble made a total of seven lengthy European and Soviet tours. While on tour in 1984, they were asked to make a recording for broadcast on Radio Vatican, inaugurating the World Year of Music in 1985.[16] One of their performances of The Fire Mass, considered the ensemble\u2019s major work, at Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto was broadcast nationwide by the (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) in 1988.[5] On their tour to the then-USSR in 1991, Mills and the Singers led the first non-military Victory Day Parade down Gorky Street in Moscow.[16]/nMills co-composed or arranged over 150 pieces for the Star-Scape repertoire in collaboration with composer Christopher Dedrick.[6] In 1996, Mills began composing spontaneous orchestral works, using four MIDI keyboards plus foot pedals to capture his instantaneous compositions. Critics have credited him with bridging the classical and new age genres.[20] His goal was to approximate the sounds of real instruments as closely as possible with the keyboards, and in 2002 a CD of several of his orchestral compositions, titled Majestic Tonescape, was released, performed by musicians from the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.[21]/nIn February 1993, Mills began to draw and paint for the first time. He soon became a prolific painter of large canvasses, creating more than 200 in less than three years. Most of his paintings depict huge flowers or otherworldly landscapes, and they have been recognized for the bold use of color and their energy. The paintings have been exhibited in both Canada and the U.S., and some are found in private collections./nMills also ventured into the realm of fashion design. Ultimately, he created an elegant line of haute couture fashions, Moulins Originales, many of which were debuted in a fashion show titled The Integrity of Elegance. This showing was captured on a pioneering high-definition television recording at New York City\u2019s Ed Sullivan Theater in February 1993.[6] Another showing of Mills\u2019 designs occurred at the Design Exchange in Toronto during the PRIME Mentors\u2019 10th Anniversary Celebration, in 1997.[22]/nAt the gala banquet of the MedArt International 1992 World Congress, a gathering of physicians and artists who specialize in bringing the arts to medicine, Mills was presented with a Special Recognition Award \"for the outstanding healing power of his art\"[4] (i.e. his music)./nA lifelong supporter of the arts, Mills founded Patrons of Wisdom in 1980, a non-profit organization that supported and encouraged young classical musicians and artists. In recognition of his continuous support of deserving individuals and \"for being an exemplary mentor and for serving as a role model par excellence whom society could look up to for inspiration and guidance,\" he was chosen Honorary PRIME Mentor of Canada in April 1997.[23]/nIn 1998, Mills was awarded an honorary doctorate of Humanities from Wolfe\u2019s University. That same year, the Senate of Canada recognized Mills with their Award of Excellence \"for outstanding achievement in humanity, education, philosophy and arts.\"[4]", "2883450": "Koloth Thattarath Sukumaran, popularly known as Sukumar Azhikode (26 May 1926 \u2013 24 January 2012) was an Indian academic, orator, critic and writer of Malayalam literature, known for his contributions to Malayalam language and insights on Indian philosophy.[1] He was a scholar in Sanskrit, Malayalam, and English languages and his work, Tatvamasi, published in 1984, is a notable work for its detailed interpretation of Indian philosophy, Vedas and Upanishads.[2] He was a recipient of several honours including Sahitya Akademi Award, Kerala Sahithya Akademi Award, Vayalar Award, Vallathol Award and Ezhuthachan Puraskaram, the highest literary award of the Government of Kerala. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2007, which he refused citing the award was a discrimination./nSukumar Azhikode, was born on May 12, 1926, at Azhikode, a coastal village in Kannur district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Vidwan Panankavil Damodharan, a teacher, and his wife, Koloth Thattarathu Madhaviyamma, as the fourth of their six children.[3] His early schooling was at Azhikode South Elementary School and he passed intermediate examination from Rajas High School Chirakkal in 1941 before studying ayurveda at Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Patasala for one year. Subsequently, he joined St. Aloysius College, Mangalore from where he graduated in commerce in 1943. He started his career as a clerk at the Kannur branch of Indian Overseas Bank but soon quit the job to pursue a teaching career for which he completed the teachers' training course from Government College of Teacher Education, Kozhikode (GCTE) and joined his alma mater, Rajas High School, Chirakkal, as a teacher in 1948.[4] While serving as a teacher, he continued his studies through distance education and earned master's degrees in Sanskrit and Malayalam languages. He followed it up with a bachelor's degree in education from GCTE in 1952. During the next three and a half decades, he worked at various institutions, starting with St. Joseph's College, Devagiri and St. Aloysius College, Mangalore as a lecturer, as the principal at SNM Training College, Moothakunnam, before joining the University of Calicut as the founder head and professor of the department of Malayalam.[5] In between, he secured a PhD in Malayalam literature in 1981, for his thesis, Western Influence in Malayalam Literary Criticism. Later, he served as the pro vice chancellor and acting vice chancellor of the university.[3]/nSukumar Azhikode lived a bachelor throughout his life; his relationship with Vilasini teacher, to whom he had proposed, did not result in a marriage.[6] He lived in Eravimangalam near Thrissur, towards the later part of his life and died on 24 January 24, 2012, at Amala Institute of Medical Sciences.[7] He was 85 years old and was suffering from bone cancer for which he had been hospitalized since 7 December 2011.[8][5]/nAnecdote: Azhikode had an accident in the early 2000s when he was returning to his Thrissur home after a speech. He had caught an auto from Thrissur railway station but had an accident resulting in wound to head. Since this happened in the early hours of the morning, the auto driver drove him to some of the private hospitals in Thrissur. Unfortunately since this was an accident case and Azhikode had blood over his white kurtha, he was refused treatment. The staff that refused him treatment did not realise his identity in the early morning hours. After a few failed attempts , Azhikode himself requested the auto driver to drive him to his friends house at Punkunnam. This friend was Dr TI Radhakrishnan, a renowned physician and neurologist. This is the same Doctor who had looked after some of the other literary and cultural giants such as Vailopilli, G Kumarapillai, MK Menon Vilasini, Krishnankutty Poduval of Kathakali etc. Azhikode was provided with all necessary care including Dr Nalini Radhakrishnan suturing his forehead wound. Azhikode stayed at his friend Dr Radhakrishnan\u2019s clinic for few weeks before going home. They remained very close friends until his death./nSukumar Azhikode, considered by many as the leading Malayalam literary critic after the era of Joseph Mundassery, M. P.

He also translated Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn into Malayalam under the title, Huckleberry Finninte Vikramangal.[22]/nSukumar Azhikode was an active commentator on the changes in the society and his speeches on the demolition of the Babri Masjid were reported to have been notable; his speeches regularly featured comments on historical figures such as Buddha, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Gandhiji and Ram Manohar Lohia.[5] He was also vocal on contemporaries including V. S. Achuthanandan,[23] G. Sankara Kurup and K. Karunakaran, among others.[11] His war of words with Mohanlal, the Malayalam film actor, drew public interest, and led to Azhikode serving a legal notice on the actor.[24] He was also involved in public exchanges of differences with Vellapally Natesan, the general secretary of Sree Narayana Trust[25] and Innocent, the film actor[26] and contested an election to the Lok Sabha, unsuccessfully, the only time he was involved in active politics.[27]/nSukumar Azhikode received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for literary criticism in 1984 for his work, Malayala Sahitya Vimarshanam;[28] a year later, Akademi honoured him again with their award for miscellaneous works; Thatvamasi earning him the award.[29] Thatvamasi received another honour the next year in the form of 1985 Sahitya Akademi Award,[30] followed by yet another award, Vayalar Award in 1989.[31] He was the recipient of the 1997 DALA Award of the Dubai Art Lovers Association.[32] The Government of Kerala awarded him for their highest literary honour, the Ezhuthachan Puraskaram, in 2004[5] and the Government of India selected him for the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri in 2007.[33] However, Azhikode refused the award, citing that the gradation of civilian honours were a form of discrimination.[34] He was also a recipient of the Vallathol Award which he received in 2007[35] and the Rajaji Award.[36] The Government of Kerala acquired the property of Sukumar Azhikode in 2013 and set up a memorial for him.

Among Hartman's publications are the report on Value Theory for the Institut International de Philosophis 1949-1955, published by UNESCO; his magnum opus The Structure of Value (1967 Southern Illinois University Press); and at the time of his death in 1973 he was working on a manuscript entitled The Measurement of Value./nAnother critical work is his Knowledge of Good (Robert S. Hartman, Arthur Ellis and Rem B. Edwards, 2002 Rodopi Press) a thorough study of all the philosophical discussions of goodness and what gaps exist in a complete philosophy of value.  Hartman shows how his Formal Value Theory fills these gaps./nThe Robert S. Hartman Institute for Formal and Applied Axiology was founded in 1976[4] and exists for the sole purpose of advancing the axiological work of Robert S. Hartman.[5] The Institute was developed in cooperation with heirs of Robert S. Hartman to advance study relating to Robert S. Hartman's unpublished and unfinished works held in the collections of the graduate library of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.[6]/nThe Hartman Institute affirms the importance of a diversity of approaches to the formalization, interpretation, and application of Hartman\u2019s theory, and it has no allegiance to any particular business model or organization.[5]/nThe Journal of Formal Axiology is published once a year, since 2008, by the Robert S. Hartman Institute. Each edition is focused on advancing formal axiology and the value theory of Robert.S. Hartman and includes articles dealing primarily with axiological practice and application, as well as with theoretical issues.[7] Articles may be critical, constructive, creative, theoretical, or applied, and are focused on advancing our understanding of Hartmanian axiology and/or what can be done with it.[7]/nThe Robert S. Hartman Institute is a volunteer-run organization made up of a global membership base.[8] Membership types include Professional Membership, Teacher/Instructor Membership, Student Membership, and Axiological Service Provider Membership.[9]/nHartman was a prolific writer with some of his works published and many available in their original manuscript form at the University of Tennessee Knoxville Archives.[10] The Robert S. Hartman Institute is working diligently to bring as many of these manuscripts to publication as possible./nHartman's revolutionary book introduces formal orderly thinking into value theory. It identifies three basic kinds of value, intrinsic goods (e.g. people as ends in themselves), extrinsic goods (e.g. things and actions as means to ends), and systemic goods (conceptual values). All good things share a common formal or structural pattern: they fulfill the ideal standards or \"concepts\" that we apply to them. Thus, this theory is called \"formal axiology\" Some values are richer in good-making property-fulfillment than others, so some desirable things are better than others and form patterned hierarchies of value. How we value is just as important as what we value, and evaluations, like values, share structures or formal patterns, as this book demonstrates. Hartman locates all of this solidly within the framework of historical value theory, but he moves successfully and creatively beyond philosophical tradition and toward the creation of a new value science[11]/nThis book presents Robert S. Hartman's formal theory of value and critically examines many other twentieth century value theorists in its light.[12]/nDuring the final decade or so of his life, Hartman frequently delivered a series of lectures in which he outlined the need for a scientific theory of human values, the theoretical requirements demanded of an effective value theory, and his rationale behind the development of the particular value theory he developed, which he named formal axiology. He named these lectures, collectively, Five Lectures in Formal Axiology. Written as they were for oral delivery, they have a cadence and clarity to them that make them a pleasure to read./nHartman concludes these lectures with a description of how his theory might be applied in various real-world situations. Specifically, he discusses how formal axiology can be applied to studies of economics and political economies, including profit sharing; to international affairs, including matters of war and peace; and to personal ethics. To Hartman, nothing less than the survival of human existence depends on this.[13]/nHartman devoted much of his extraordinary intellectual capacity to understanding and articulating the political, philosophical, psychological, and spiritual causes of war so that humankind could stop waging war and start living together in peace. This collection of essays by Hartman reveal, for the first time in one place, the range and depth of his thoughts on this subject. It also traces how his own understanding of the role of war in human society evolved during his lifetime. It was his study of war that led, in large part, to his development of the value theory for which he is best known\u2014formal axiology. Hartman's ideas, if understood and embraced, may well lead to fulfillment of his hope that we can learn to live in peace.[14]", "2916220": "Critolaus (/kra\u026ato\u028a\u02c8le\u026a\u0259s/; Greek: \u039a\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2 Kritolaos; c. 200 \u2013 c. 118 BC)[1] of Phaselis was a Greek philosopher of the Peripatetic school. He was one of three philosophers sent to Rome in 155 BC (the other two being Carneades and Diogenes of Babylon), where their doctrines fascinated the citizens, but frightened the more conservative statesmen. None of his writings survive. He was interested in rhetoric and ethics, and considered pleasure to be an evil. He maintained the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of the world, and of the human race in general, directing his arguments against the Stoics./nHe was born in Phaselis, a Greek colony in Lycia, c. 200 BC, and studied philosophy at Athens under Aristo of Ceos, and became one of the leaders of the Peripatetic school by his eminence as an orator, a scholar and a moralist. There has been considerable discussion as to whether he was the immediate successor of Aristo, but the evidence is confused.[2]/nThe great reputation which Critolaus enjoyed at Athens, as a philosopher, an orator, and a statesman, induced the Athenians to send him to Rome in 155 BC, together with Carneades and Diogenes the Stoic, to obtain a remission of the fine of 500 talents which the Romans had imposed upon Athens for the destruction of Oropus. They were successful in the object for which they came; and the embassy excited the greatest interest at Rome. Not only the Roman youth, but the most illustrious men in the state, such as Scipio Africanus, Laelius, Furius, and others, came to listen to their discourses. The novelty of their doctrines seemed to the Romans of the old school to be fraught with such danger to the morals of the citizens, that Cato induced the senate to send them away from Rome as quickly as possible.[3] Gellius describes his arguments as \"elegant and polished\" (Latin: scita et teretia). We have no further information respecting the life of Critolaus. He lived upwards of eighty-two years, but died c. 118 BC. By the time Licinius Crassus arrived at Athens c. 111 BC, he found Critolaus' pupil Diodorus of Tyre at the head of the Peripatetic school.[4]/nCritolaus seems to have paid particular attention to rhetoric, though he considered it, like Aristotle, not as an art, but rather as a matter of practice. Cicero speaks in high terms of his eloquence.[5] Next to Rhetoric, Critolaus seems to have given his chief attention to the study of moral philosophy, and to have made some additions to Aristotle's system.[6] In general, he deviated very little from the philosophy of the founder of the Peripatetic school,[7] though in some respects he went beyond his predecessors. For example, he held that pleasure is an evil,[8] and definitely maintained that the soul consists of aether. The end of existence was to him the general perfection of the natural life, including the goods of the soul and the body, and also external goods. Cicero says in the Tusculanae Quaestiones that the goods of the soul entirely outweighed for him the other goods (Latin: tantum propendere illam bonorum animi lancem).[2]/nFurther, he defended against the Stoics the Peripatetic doctrine of the eternity of the world and the indestructibility of the human race. There is no observed change in the natural order of things; humankind recreates itself in the same manner according to the capacity given by Nature, and the various ills to which it is heir, though fatal to individuals, do not avail to modify the whole. Just as it is absurd to suppose that humans are merely earth-born, so the possibility of their ultimate destruction is inconceivable. The world, as the manifestation of eternal order, must itself be immortal.[2]/nA Critolaus is mentioned by Plutarch[9] as the author of a work on Epirus, and of another entitled Phenomena; and Aulus Gellius[10] also speaks of an historical writer of this name. Whether the historian is the same as the Peripatetic philosopher, cannot be determined.

Accused of conspiring against the Spanish rulers of Calabria in 1599, he was tortured and sent to prison, where he spent 27 years. He wrote his most significant works during this time, including The City of the Sun, a utopia describing an egalitarian theocratic society where property is held in common./nBorn into poverty in Stilo,[2] in the province of Reggio di Calabria in Calabria, southern Italy, Campanella was a child prodigy. Son of an illiterate cobbler, he entered the Dominican Order before the age of fourteen,[3]  taking the name of fra' Tommaso in honour of Thomas Aquinas. He studied theology and philosophy with several masters./nEarly on, he became disenchanted with the Aristotelian orthodoxy and attracted by the empiricism of Bernardino Telesio (1509\u20131588), who taught that knowledge is sensation and that all things in nature possess sensation. Campanella wrote his first work, Philosophia sensibus demonstrata (\"Philosophy demonstrated by the senses\"), published in 1592, in defence of Telesio.[4]/nIn 1590 he was in Naples where he was initiated in astrology; astrological speculations would become a constant feature in his writings. Campanella's heterodox views, especially his opposition to the authority of Aristotle, brought him into conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities. Denounced to the Roman Inquisition, he was arrested in Padua in 1594 and cited before the Holy Office in Rome, he was confined in a convent until 1597.[5]/nAfter his liberation, Campanella returned to Calabria, where he was accused of leading a conspiracy against the Spanish rule in his hometown of Stilo. Campanella's aim was to establish a society based on the community of goods and wives, for on the basis of the prophecies of Joachim of Fiore and his own astrological observations, he foresaw the advent of the Age of the Spirit in the year 1600.[6] Betrayed by two of his fellow conspirators, he was captured in 1599 and incarcerated in Naples, where he was tortured on the rack.[7] Even from the confinement of the jail, Campanella managed to influence the intellectual history of the early seventeenth century, by maintaining epistolary contacts with European philosophers and scientists, Neapolitan cultural circles, and Caravaggio's commissioners.[8] Finally, Campanella made a full confession and would have been put to death had he not feigned madness and set his cell on fire. He was tortured further, a total of seven times. Crippled and ill, Campanella was sentenced to life imprisonment.[9][page\u00a0needed]/nCampanella spent twenty-seven years imprisoned in Naples, in various fortresses. During his detention, he wrote his most important works: The Monarchy of Spain (1600), Political Aphorisms (1601), Atheismus triumphatus (Atheism Conquered, 1605\u20131607), Quod reminiscetur (1606?), Metafisica (1609\u20131623), Theologia (1613\u20131624), and his most famous work, The City of the Sun (originally written in Italian in 1602; published in Latin in Frankfurt (1623) and later in Paris (1638)./nHe defended Galileo Galilei in Galileo's first trial with his work The Defense of Galileo (written in 1616, published in 1622).[10] In 1632, before Galileo's second trial, Campanella wrote to Galileo:[11]/nTo my great disgust I have heard that wrathful theologians of the Congregation aim to prohibit the Dialogues of Your Excellency, and [that] no one will be present who understands mathematics or recondite things. Be aware that while Your Excellency does state that it was appropriate to prohibit the theory of the earth's motion, you are not obliged to believe that the reasons of those who contradicted you are good. This is a theological rule, and is proved by the second Council of Nicaea which decreed that Angelorum imagines depingi debent, quam'am vere corporei sunt (Images of angels must be depicted as they are in the flesh): while the decree is valid, the reasoning behind it is not, since all scholars today say angels are incorporeal. There are many other fundamental reasons. I fear violence from people who do not understand this. Our Pope makes a lot of noise against this and speaks as the Pope, but you haven't heard about that, nor can think about it. In my opinion Your Excellency should write to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, that since they are putting Dominicans, Jesuits, Theatines, and secular priests who are against your books in this council, they should also admit Father Castelli and me./nCampanella was finally released from prison in 1626,[3] through Pope Urban VIII, who personally interceded on his behalf with Philip IV of Spain. Taken to Rome and held for a time by the Holy Office, Campanella was restored to full liberty in 1629 as Urban badly needed Campanella's magical skills to protect him from the dangers of two upcoming eclipses. The Pope's enemies thought they could take advantage of his credulity, and they confidently predicted that the eclipses in 1628 and 1630 surely heralded the Pope's demise. Campanella put into effect the natural magic practices described in his short treatise De siderali fato vitando (How To Avoid the Fate Dictated by the Stars).[3] Campanella's magic worked and the Pope survived. In return the latter allowed the magician to set up a school in Rome to preach his ideas, while ignoring his blatant heresies.[12] He lived for five years in Rome, where he was Urban's advisor in astrological matters./nIn 1634, a new conspiracy in Calabria, led by one of his followers, threatened fresh troubles. With the aid of Cardinal Barberini and the French Ambassador de Noailles, he fled to France, where he was received at the court of Louis XIII with marked favour.[3] Protected by Cardinal Richelieu and granted a pension by the king, he spent the rest of his days in the convent of Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris. His last work was a poem celebrating the birth of the future Louis XIV (Ecloga in portentosam Delphini nativitatem)./nCampanella's De sensu rerum et magia (1620) partly inspired the first fully-fledged it-narrative in English, Charles Gildon's The Golden Spy (1709).[13]/nThe historian John Headley described Campanella as \"a man who strove to destabilize the regnant forces of what he identified as tyranny, sophistry, and hypocrisy and to shake the world into a new order.\"[14]", "32571274": "John Bate (died 1429) was an English or Welsh theologian and philosopher./nBate was, according to Leland's account, born west of the River Severn (inter Transabrinos), but seems to have been brought up in the Carmelite monastery at York, where his progress in learning was so great that he was dispatched to complete his studies at Oxford.

His Muslim name in Arabic was Sa'd al-Din (Arabic: \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 Sa'd ad-D\u012bn; simplified Chinese: \u8d5b\u5c14\u6566\u4e01; traditional Chinese: \u8cfd\u723e\u6566\u4e01; pinyin: s\u00e0i \u011br d\u016bn d\u012bng). Although he was born Sufi and turned Wahhabi, he changed his views and turned his back on Wahhabism after a Hajj to Mecca and later became an important imam, scripturalist, and leader of the Yihewani Muslim sect in China. He was influential and played an important role in Chinese Islam in this position as he propagated reformist doctrines in Ningxia in his later life. Hu also played a role in rallying Muslims against the Japanese invasion of China.[5]/nHu's father was a Gansu ahong (imam) belonging to the Khafiya menhuan, a Chinese-style Naqshbandi Sufi order. When Hu Songshan was 18, he joined Wang Naibi of Haicheng. At age 21, he became imam of the anti-Sufi Yihewani (Ikhwan in Arabic) sect, which was founded by the Wahhabi Ma Wanfu. Hu opposed wasteful rituals and cash payments for religious services, which Sufi orders practiced. Being a member of the Yihewani, he was so against Sufism and the menhuan to the point where he destroyed his own father's gongbei (a Hui Islamic shrine centered around a Sufi master's grave) built at Tongxin.[6]/nHe went on Hajj to Mecca in 1924 at age 45, traveling through Shanghai and he reached Mecca in 1925. When Hu was in Mecca, he did not feel solidarity with other Muslims, he was treated racistly on hajj because he was from China, so he became a Chinese nationalist working to build a strong China, and abandoned salafism.[7][8][9][10][11][12] Instead of advocating an Islamic state, he wanted Muslims to practice their religion in a strong China. He saw that Hui and Han people were treated the same and abused by foreigners. He rallied against foreign Imperialism and preached Chinese nationalism and unity between all Chinese. In Wuzhong County, Ningxia, Hu was the principal of an Arabic school.[13] Hu Songshan had changed from being a Wahhabi Salafi to a modernist and influenced the Yihewani to change its ideology along that trend.[14] One of his followers was Muhammad Ma Jian.[15] Another one of his followers was the Yihewani Imam Ma Fulong (d. 1970).[16] Hu became a prominent reformist and modernist Imam and Muhammad Ma Jian studied alongside him in 1928.[17][18]/nHu encouraged unity and cooperation both between Muslims in China, and between non-Muslims and Muslims in China too, using Chinese classics to advance Chinese nationalism. He studied modern science, promoted sports for his students, and permitted people to take pictures of his mosque and him, which made him stand out from less-liberal Yihewani.[19] Hu promoted reform of traditional Islamic education as his views while a follower of the Yihewani changed.[20]/nHu Songshan and the Hui Muslim warlord of Ningxia, General Ma Hongkui cooperated in founding several Sino-Arabic schools (\u4e2d\u963f\u5b78\u6821) in Ningxia to promote Chinese and Arabic language Islamic education for Chinese Muslims in the 1930s and 1940s.[21] Hu Songshan became head of the Ningxia Private Sino- Arabic College at Dongdasi Mosque, which was founded by Ma Hongkui in Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province 1932. Students flocked to it from province across China after it became a public institution in the following year. Ten days prior to Ramadan's end in 1935, Ma Hongkui arranged for Chinese New Year celebrations. Hu Songshan pronounced kufr upon Ma Hongkui for this, while delivering an aggressive and fierce sermon in public. Ma Hongkui then sacked Hu from his position and exiled him. Hu then received clemency from Ma and was sent to head the Sino-Arabic Normal School in Wuzhong in 1938.[22]/nWhen Japan invaded China in 1937 during the Second Sino Japanese War, Hu Songshan ordered that the Chinese Flag be saluted during morning prayer, along with deference to nationalism[clarify]. A prayer was written by him in Arabic and Chinese which prayed for the defeat of the Japanese and support of the Chinese government. The Quran was used to justify struggling against the Japanese.[23][24] Hu Songshan helped spread anti-Japanese propaganda among Muslims during the war.[25] Unlike his teacher Ma Wanfu, a strict Wahhabi scripturalist who led the Yihewani with an anti modernist and anti Chinese culture and language ideology, Hu Songshan encouraged Muslims to study Chinese language and learn about modern sciences and education in Chinese./nImams such as Hu Songshan led the Chinese Muslim Brotherhood (the Yihewani) to incorporate Chinese nationalism and emphasize education and independence.[26]/nThe Ma clique Muslim generals Ma Fuxiang and Ma Bufang gave support to Hu Songshan.[27]/nHu added subjects such as Chinese language and other modern subjects such as foreign sciences, mathematics and foreign languages to the Islamic curriculum and he translated Islamic texts into Chinese.[28] Hu was close to the Kuomintang Muslim General and governor of Ningxia, Ma Hongkui, and cooperated with him.[29] All imams in Ningxia were required to preach Chinese nationalism during prayer at the mosque during the war with Japan.[26][30] Hu was active in promoting this curriculum at Sino-Arabic schools in Ningxia. Hu often reminded the Muslim masses that \"If we object to natural science, then clothing, food, and shelter could not be talked about.\", whenever someone challenged his introduction of modern subjects such as mathematics and science to the Islamic curriculum./nHu also cited a Hadith(\u8056\u8a13),[31] a saying of the prophet Muhammad, which says \"Loving the Motherland is equivalent to loving the Faith\" (traditional Chinese: \u611b\u8b77\u7956\u570b\u662f\u5c6c\u65bc\u4fe1\u4ef0\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u4efd; simplified Chinese:

In college he was a member of the Young People's Socialist League and was part of a small but vocal group of Trotskyist anti-Soviets who later became known as the New York Intellectuals. It was at these meetings that Kristol met historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, whom he married in 1942. They had two children, Elizabeth Nelson and Bill Kristol.[7][8]/nDuring World War II, he served in Europe in the 12th Armored Division as a combat infantryman.[9]/nKristol was affiliated with the Congress for Cultural Freedom. He wrote in Commentary magazine from 1947 to 1952 under the editor Elliot E. Cohen (not to be confused with Eliot A. Cohen, the writer of today's magazine). With Stephen Spender, he was co-founder of and contributor to the British-based Encounter from 1953 to 1958; editor of The Reporter from 1959 to 1960. He also was the executive vice-president of the publishing house Basic Books from 1961 to 1969, the Henry Luce Professor of Urban Values at New York University from 1969 to 1987, and co-founder and co-editor (first with Daniel Bell and then Nathan Glazer) of The Public Interest from 1965 to 2002. He was the founder and publisher of The National Interest from 1985 to 2002. Following Ramparts' publication of information showing Central Intelligence Agency funding of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which was widely reported elsewhere, Kristol left in the late 1960s and became affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute.[10]/nKristol was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute (having been an associate fellow from 1972, a senior fellow from 1977 and the John M. Olin Distinguished Fellow from 1988 to 1999). As a member of the board of contributors of The Wall Street Journal, he contributed a monthly column from 1972 to 1997. He served on the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1972 to 1977./nIn 1978, Kristol and William E. Simon founded The Institute For Education Affairs, which as a result of a merger with the Madison Center became the Madison Center for Educational Affairs in 1990./nKristol died from complications of lung cancer, aged 89, on September 18, 2009, at the Capital Hospice in Falls Church, Virginia.[1][11]/nDefunct/nEconomics/nGun rights/nIdentity politics/nNationalism/nReligion/nWatchdog groups/nYouth/student groups/nMiscellaneous/nOther/nNewspapers/nJournals/nTV channels/nWebsites/nOther/nDuring the late 1960s up until the 1970s, neoconservatives were worried about the Cold War and that its liberalism was turning into radicalism, thus many neoconservatives including Irving Kristol, Norman Podhoretz and Daniel Patrick Moynihan wanted Democrats to continue on a strong anti-communist foreign policy.[12] This foreign policy was to use Soviet human rights violations to attack the Soviet Union.[12] This later led to Nixon's policies called d\u00e9tente.[12]/nIn 1973, Michael Harrington coined the term, \"neo-conservatism\", to describe those liberal intellectuals and political philosophers who were disaffected with the political and cultural attitudes dominating the Democratic Party and were moving toward a new form of conservatism.[13] Intended by Harrington as a pejorative term, it was accepted by Kristol as an apt description of the ideas and policies exemplified by The Public Interest. Unlike liberals, for example, neo-conservatives rejected most of the Great Society programs sponsored by Lyndon B. Johnson and, unlike traditional conservatives, they supported the more limited welfare state instituted by Franklin D. Roosevelt./nIn February 1979, Kristol was featured on the cover of Esquire. The caption identified him as \"the godfather of the most powerful new political force in America \u2013 Neo-conservatism\".[14] That year also saw the publication of the book, The Neo-conservatives: The Men Who Are Changing America's Politics. Like Harrington, the author, Peter Steinfels, was critical of neo-conservatism, but he was impressed by its growing political and intellectual influence. Kristol's response appeared under the title \"Confessions of a True, Self-Confessed \u2013 Perhaps the Only \u2013 'Neo-conservative'\".[15]/nNeo-conservatism, Kristol maintained, is not an ideology but a \"persuasion\", a way of thinking about politics rather than a compendium of principles and axioms.[16] It is classical, rather than romantic, in temperament and practical and anti-utopian in policy. One of Kristol's most celebrated quips defines a neo-conservative as \"a liberal who has been mugged by reality\". These concepts lie at the core of neo-conservative philosophy to this day.[17]/nWhile propounding the virtues of supply-side economics as the basis for the economic growth that is \"a sine qua non for the survival of a modern democracy\", he also insists that any economic philosophy has to be enlarged by \"political philosophy, moral philosophy, and even religious thought\", which were as much the sine qua non for a modern democracy.[18]/nOne of his early books, Two Cheers for Capitalism, asserts that capitalism, or more precisely, bourgeois capitalism, is worthy of two cheers. One cheer because \"it works, in a quite simple, material sense\" by improving the conditions of people; and a second cheer because it is \"congenial to a large measure of personal liberty\". He argues these are no small achievements and only capitalism has proved capable of providing them. However, it also imposes a great \"psychic burden\" upon the individual and the social order. Because it does not meet the individual's \"'existential' human needs\", it creates a \"spiritual malaise\" that threatens the legitimacy of that social order. As much as anything else, it is the withholding of that potential third cheer that is the distinctive mark of neo-conservatism as Kristol understood it.[19]/nIn July 2002, he received from President George W. Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor./nAuthored/nEdited/nContributed", "48398228": "Paul Bernard Cliteur (born 6 September 1955) is a Dutch professor of jurisprudence at Leiden University, as well as a politician, philosopher, writer, publicist and columnist. He is known for his conservative perspective, his atheism, his republicanism, and his dislike of Islam. He is a member of De Vrije Gedachte.[1] Since 2015, Cliteur is a member of the Dutch political party Forum voor Democratie, where he is chairman of the advisory board and the party's official think tank. In 2019 he was elected to be parliamentary group leader for Forum voor Democratie in the Dutch Senate.[2]/nCliteur has also been on the board of several organisations, including supervisor of the Telders Foundation (think tank of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy), and from 1993 until 1995 chair of the Humanist League (Humanistisch Verbond).[3]/nCliteur studied law and philosophy, and graduated on 22 March 1989 with his dissertation Conservatisme en cultuurrecht (\"Conservatism and cultural law\", published in 2005 under the title Natuurrecht, Cultuurrecht, Conservatisme, \"Natural law, Cultural law, Conservatism\"). From 1995 until 2002, he was Professor of Philosophy at Delft University. He is Professor of Jurisprudence at Leiden University, where he delivered his maiden speech on 28 May 2004 on \"The neutral state, particular education and multiculturalism\". His activities mainly include law, cultural history, philosophy and ethics./nCliteur is mainly known for his opining works, in which he expresses his political views. He served as a columnist for, amongst others, Trouw, and had a spoken column in the TV show Buitenhof. In these, he first and foremost expresses his liberal opinions, his own vision of multiculturism, and also advocates for animal rights./nIn March 2004, Cliteur told Het Parool in an interview that he felt he was being limited in freely expressing his opinions on Islam after others branded him a \"racist\" and \"stigmatiser\". This was partly due to an AIVD report, which argued criticism of Islam is counterproductive for the social integration of Muslims.

From 2006 to 2011, he served as the George F. Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton./nAvishai Margalit was born in Afula, Mandatory Palestine, and grew up in Jerusalem. He was educated in Jerusalem and did his army service in the airborne Nahal. In 1960 he started his studies at the Hebrew University, majoring in philosophy and economics. He earned his B.A. in 1963 and his M.A. in philosophy in 1965, his M.A. thesis focusing on Karl Marx's theory of labor. During his years of study he worked as an instructor in a youth village, working with immigrant children who arrived with the mass wave of immigration in the 1950s. Thanks to a British Council scholarship he went to Queens College in Oxford University, where he stayed from 1968 to 1970. His doctoral dissertation, \"The Cognitive Status of Metaphors\", written under the supervision of Professor Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, earned him his Ph.D summa cum laude 1970 from the Hebrew University./nIn 1970, Margalit started teaching as an assistant professor at the philosophy department of the Hebrew University where he stayed throughout his academic career, climbing the ladder of academic promotions. In 1998\u20132006 he was appointed the Shulman Professor of Philosophy, and in 2006 he retired as a professor emeritus from the Hebrew University. Since 2006 Margalit has been the George Kennan Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He is also a member of the Center for the Study of Rationality at the Hebrew University./nMargalit was a visiting scholar at Harvard University (1974\u20135); a visiting fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford (1979\u201380); a visiting professor at the Free University of Berlin and a fellow at the Max Planck Institute, Berlin (1984\u20135); a visiting fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford (1990); a Rockefeller fellow at the Center for Human Values, Princeton University (1995\u20136), a scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York (2001\u20132002) and Senior Fellow at the Global Law Program at NYU (2004\u20135). In addition, he held short-term visiting professorships at the Central European University in Budapest and at the European University Institute in Florence.[1][2]/nIn 1999, Margalit delivered the Horkheimer Lectures at the University of Frankfurt, on The Ethics of Memory. In 2001\u20132002 he delivered the inaugural lectures at Oxford University as the first Bertelsman Professor there. In 2005 he delivered the Tanner Lectures at Stanford University.[3]/nMargalit was among the founders of the \"Moked\" political party in 1973 and contributed to the writing of its platform. In 1975 he participated in the founding of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, and in 1978 he belonged to the first group of leaders of Peace Now.[4] In addition, in the 1990s Margalit served on the board of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories./nSince 1984, Margalit has been a frequent contributor to the New York Review of Books (NYRB),[5] where he published articles on social, cultural and political issues; his political profiles included Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres, as well as cultural-philosophical profiles of thinkers like Baruch Spinoza, Martin Buber and Yeshayahu Leibowitz. A collection of his NYRB articles was published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, under the title Views in Review: Politics and Culture in the State of the Jews (1998)./nMargalit's early research topics included the philosophy of language and of logic, general analytical philosophy and the concept of rationality. Gradually he shifted toward social and political philosophy, the philosophy of religion and culture, and the philosophical implications of social and cognitive psychology./nIn the preface to his book The Ethics of Memory, Margalit offers a distinction between \"i.e. philosophy\" and \"e.g. philosophy\". The idea is to distinguish between explicating philosophy, based on conceptual analysis, and exemplifying philosophy, which focuses on real-life examples from history or literature. Without judging between the two, Margalit adopts the second approach. Most of his work since the 1990s reflects this approach to the analysis of philosophical questions./nIn contrast to many in the philosophical tradition, who tend to accompany their abstract philosophical discussion with examples that are intentionally artificial or trivial, Margalit often starts from historical examples, whose richness and complexity precede their theoretical conceptualization. Through analyzing these examples he gradually builds up concepts and distinctions that serve him as the philosophical tools needed for the understanding of the phenomena he investigates./nThus, for example, in his Ethics of Memory he uses the case of an officer who forgets the name of one of his subordinate soldiers who was killed in a heroic battle, as a test-case for discussing the issue of the moral responsibility that attaches to memory, on the one hand, and of the centrality of names in constituting memory, on the other. He also poses the following dilemma: were you a painter, would you prefer your paintings to survive you after your death, even if your name will be forgotten, or would you rather have your name remembered even if none of your paintings survive. Margalit's way of philosophizing reflects historical, literary and cultural insights and concerns that are not ordinarily encountered in philosophical discussions./nWritten jointly with Margalit's doctoral student Moshe Halbertal, the book Idolatry presents the history of the notion of idolatry and discusses its religious and ideological significance and ramifications.[6] Based largely on the philosophy of language and on the philosophy of Wittgenstein (whom Margalit had studied for many years), the book argues that the critique of ideology finds its first expression in the critique of idolatry. Idolatry, on this view, is not just an error but a sinful error; as such it makes the idolaters miss their life's purposes. Bacon's critique of the tribal gods, and the critique of political ideology in the sense Marx used it, are shown to be the continuation of this move concerning the attitude toward the sinful and sin-causing error./nFrom Plato on, political philosophy has dealt with the question of the just society, but not with the question of the decent society. In the book The Decent Society, Margalit argues that the pursuit of decency, understood primarily in terms of the absence of humiliation, takes precedence over the pursuit of the ideal of justice.[7]/nA decent society, in Margalit's view, is a society whose institutions do not humiliate its members. He presents the logical, moral and cognitive reasons for choosing \"philosophica negativa\": it is not justice that brings us to politics but injustice \u2013 the avoidance of evil rather than the pursuit of the good. In contrast to the elusiveness of the abstract notion of human dignity, the phenomenon of humiliation is tangible and instantly recognizable; so too is the notion of evil associated with it./nIn essence, Margalit argues that the ideal of the decent, non-humiliating society is not only more urgent but also a more realistic and achievable ideal than that of the just society. He examines the essential manifestations of the decent society: respect for privacy, full citizenship, full employment, and resisting the trend to replace mechanisms of just distribution with organs of welfare and charity. In the second part of the book Margalit gives an account of institutions that are in particular danger of generating humiliation, like prisons, the security services, the army, and the media./nTo a large extent because of its discussion of the idea of humiliation, Margalit's book has become a major source[citation needed] for the study of the notions of human dignity and human respect, which constitute the cornerstones of contemporary ethics, politics and legal theory. The book offers a deep analysis of the entire semantic field of the notions of dignity, respect, self-respect, honor, esteem, and their cognates. Margalit presents a \"skeptical\" solution to the question of human dignity. Rather than attempting to tie it to a particular characteristic shared by all humans and intrinsically worthy of respect (an attempt he believes has failed in the history of philosophy), Margalit proposes to turn this explanation on its head: the practice of according humans respect, he suggests, precedes the idea of human dignity as a character trait. This move does not evade the problem of human dignity, Margalit argues, but rather it points the way toward salvaging it from the futile and inconclusive metaphysical analysis./nThe book The Ethics of Memory takes up the question of the duties of memory.[8] While fundamental in the Jewish tradition, the obligation to remember (\"zachor\") is rarely brought up in philosophical discussions. In general, memory is not regarded as a moral concern: people remember or forget as a matter of fact, and since normally we do not control our memory, theories of ethics do not consider memory a duty. In this book, Margalit explores the evaluative and ethical dimensions of memory both in the private and in the collective spheres./nThe question whether we are under a moral obligation to remember (or to forget) certain things is discussed in the book in light of a central distinction Margalit introduces, between ethics and morality. Duties of memory exist, he claims, with regard to our ethical relationships, namely the \"thick\" relationships we have with the members of our tribe, family, nation and circle of friends \u2013 namely, those with whom we have a shared history. Without memory there is no community; memory is a constitutive element in the making of a community./nOur moral relationships, on the other hand, are \"thin\". Morality regulates the relationships we have with others who are strangers to us and to whom nothing more concrete ties us than our shared humanity. Regarding our moral relationships, Margalit contends, there are no obligations to remember./nOne of Margalit's central theses in the book is that a \"community of memory\", as a political concept, is more significant and weighty than the notion of the nation. Memory forms a large part of our relationships, and a faulty memory damages the quality or strength of our thick relationships. In addition to the large question of the duty to remember, the book takes up a variety of other questions like what is a moral witness, what is a community of memory, how do we remember feelings (as distinct from moods), what is the proper relationship between remembering and forgetting, does remembering aid forgiving or does it rather hinder it, and more. Margalit believes that memory is the key to our ethical relationships, and that communities of memory are built upon a network of divisions of labor for the different representations of memory. These networks are constituted, in part, of particular people who remember the past and whose job it is to deal with it, like historians, archivists and journalists, and also of the idea that the large social network connects us all./nThis book Occidentalism: the West in the Eyes of its Enemies, written jointly with the writer and journalist Ian Buruma,[9] originated in a 2002 article in the New York Review of Books. According to the book, Occidentalism is a worldview that influences many, often conflicting, ideologies. As a view about the West and about Western civilization, it is infused with strong elements of de-humanization: the western man, on this view, is a machine-like creature. He is efficient yet soul-less, emotionally obtuse and led by a perverse value system./nThe book claims that the occidental worldview is itself rooted in the West. It emerges, the authors argue, out of the Romantic Movement, especially in its German version, later to be taken up by the Slavophil movement. In the 20th century it can be traced to fascism \u2013 prominently in its German and Japanese varieties \u2013 on the one hand, and to communist Maoism on the other. Nowadays it is political Islam that is thoroughly imbued with a particularly pernicious version of Occidentalism. In it, the additional idea is found, that the West, via its representatives who are currently ruling many Moslem countries, is the carrier of a new Jahiliyya \u2013 namely, ignorance and barbarism of the sort that ruled the world before the evangelical mission of the prophet Mohamed./nThe book On Compromise and Rotten Compromises deals with political compromises: what compromises are morally acceptable and what are to be rejected as unacceptable, or \"rotten\".[10] The argument of the book assigns great value to the spirit of compromise in politics, while warning against rotten ones. A rotten compromise is taken to be a compromise with a regime that exercises inhuman policies, namely systematic behavior that mixes cruelty with humiliation or and treats humans as inhuman./nThe book examines central historical examples, like the Great Compromise that paved the way for the US constitution, which accepted the institution of slavery despite its inhuman, cruel and humiliating nature. Other test cases include the Munich agreement and the Yalta agreement \u2013 working from the assumption that WWII is a sort of laboratory for testing out our moral-political concepts and intuitions. The forced return by the Allies of the Russian POWs to Joseph Stalin's hands served in the book as a paradigm case of a rotten compromise./nOn Compromise focuses on the tension between peace and justice, and warns against seeing these two as complementary products, like fish and chips. The author claims that compromise is justified for the sake of peace, sometimes even at the expense of justice. Yet rotten compromises, totally unjustifiable that they are, are to be avoided come what may./nIn On Betrayal, Margalit argues for and investigates the persistent significance of betrayal.[11] He identifies four main types of betrayal, belonging to four spheres of human experience: political betrayal (treason), personal betrayal (adultery), religious betrayal (apostasy), and betrayal of one's class. The book defends the significance of the concept of betrayal even in modern societies, where treason no longer carries the weight it once did, where adultery is not a crime, and where apostasy, or changing one's religious affiliation, is considered a basic right. Building on his earlier distinction between thick and thin relations, Margalit argues that betrayal still matters because thick relations still matter and betrayal is the undermining of thick relations. \"The basic claim in the book is that betrayal is betrayal of a thick human relationship. A thick human relationship comes very close to what fraternity means. So betrayal is the flip side of fraternity\" (2)./nBy Margalit's analysis, betrayal is a ternary relation, that is a relation holding between three objects. Thus the standard form of betrayal is: A betrays B with/to C. For betrayal to occur the relations between A and B must be thick relations. In cases of double betrayal, the betrayed stands in thick relations to both the betrayer and the one with whom the betrayal took place (e.g.: A betrayed B with her best friend C). Thick political relations should be based neither on blood, nor on seed, nor on soil, but on shared historical memory. They consist in \"thick trust\". Its breach is political betrayal, or treason. Idolatry is the betrayal of thick relations with god and apostasy of thick relations with one's religious community./nThick relations provide individuals with a sense of meaning and belonging, an orientation in the world, a home. The feature of thick relations which is eroded by betrayal is belonging, rather than trust. Belonging is not based on achievement, it is not a possession, but a bond. Betrayal undermines this bond because it \"provides the betrayed party with a good reason to reevaluate the meaning of the thick relation with the betrayer\" (92). But its ethical significance consists in the kind of reason it provides for this reevaluation, namely the violation of a commitment. As Michael Walzer summarizes in his review of the book, \"betrayal isn't leaving a relationship but breaking it\u2013\u2013and breaking it in a way that hurts, that leaves the other or others vulnerable, frightened, alone, at a loss.\"/nHowever, not every case of disloyalty toward a thick relation is an instance of betrayal, only disloyalty to relations deserving of loyalty constitute betrayal. This gives rise to ambiguities and disagreements. Betrayal, Margalit says, is an essentially contested concept, \"that is to say, in all its uses the concept of traitor is always subject to dispute along ideological lines\" (24). When an alleged traitor is caught between two competing deserving loyalties, he will be regarded by one side as a traitor and by the other as a hero. When one of the loyalties is morally undeserved, the actor is either an uncontestable hero (Willy Brandt is an example) or an uncontestable traitor (e.g. Benedict Arnold). Assessments of deservedness can vary not only across societies, but also within societies. This is often the case with whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, seen by some as heroes and by others as traitors. The difference between a traitor worthy of contempt and a whistleblower worthy of applause, Margalit says, consists in the righteousness of their cause and the purity of their motives. The fact that both can be mixed and ambiguous explains why public opinion is often split in such cases./nBesides the four general kinds of betrayal, the book explores specific forms of potential betrayal, including collaboration with an enemy, class betrayal, secrecy and hypocrisy. It investigates with nuance complicated historical cases like Josephus Flavius, Willy Brandt, and Marshal Petain (\"Petain betrayed by trying to form a France that would eradicate the memory and the legacy of the French Revolution\" (215))./nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.[20]/nAvishai Margalit was married to Edna Ullmann-Margalit, a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University.

Appayya studied the Hindu scriptures under his Guru, Rama Kavi. He completed the fourteen Vidyas at his young age./nDikshitar travelled widely, entering into philosophical disputations and controversies in many centers of learning. He had the rare good fortune of being revered and patronized in his own lifetime by kings of Vellore, Tanjore, Vijayanagara, and Venkatagiri./nSaiddhantika/nNon - Saiddhantika/nHe was well-read in every branch of Sanskrit learning and wrote as many works, large and small. Only 60 of them are, however, extant now. These include works on Vedanta,  Shiva Advaita, Mimamsa, Vyakarana, Kavya vyakhyana, Alankara, and devotional poetry.  He was a member of the Advaita school and a devotee of Shiva.[1] Though  the followers of the Shiva Advaita school claim him as belonging to their school,  it is not so easy to determine whether he was more inclined to Shiva Advaita or Advaita.[1] Shiva Advaita is very much akin to Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja, except for the role of Vishnu being taken by Shiva.[2]:\u200a67/nDikshitar wrote the Chatur-mata-sara to illustrate the philosophical thoughts of the four prominent schools of interpretation of Brahma sutras. The Naya-manjari deals with Advaita, the Naya-mani-mala with Srikanta mata, the Naya-mayukha-malika with Ramanuja's philosophy, and the Naya-muktavali with Madhva's philosophy. He wrote a commentary on Vedanta Desika's Yadavabhyudaya./nAmong the Vedantic works of Appayya Dikshitar, the Siddhanta-lesha-sangraha is most famous. In this elaborate and original treatise, he brings together in one place, all different dialectical thinking belonging to the advaitic school. Traditional students of Vedanta begin their study of Vedantic commentaries only after studying this Siddhanta Lesha sangraha. All the different views of different subschools of advaita, like those of `eka-jiva-vada', `nana-jiva-vada', `bimba-pratibimba vada'  `sakshitva-vada' etc. are all discussed and the contrary views properly explained in this work with Appayya Dikshitar's masterly touch.[2]:\u200a89\u201390/nIt is a Vedantic work, an extremely readable commentary on the very difficult commentary called Kalpataru by an advaitic teacher named Amalananda. That Kalpataru is itself a commentary on Bh\u0101mat\u012b by V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra, which in turn is the famous commentary on the Sutra-Bhashya of Adi Shankara. While the Parimala follows the advaitic approach, Dikshitar has written another commentary Sivaarka-mani-deepika on the Brahmasutras. But this is written from the point of view of Siva-visishtadvaita.. These two works \u2013 Sivaarka-mani-deepika and Parimala \u2013 are his magnum opus both in bulk and importance. Though both are commentaries on the Brahma sutra, Parimala aligns itself to the advaitic interpretation while the other work expounds on the Sivadvaita philosophy of Srikanta Shivacharya. Dikshitar's patron, King Chinna Bomma Nayak of Vellore, made endowments for the maintenance of a college of 500 scholars who studied Sivaarka maniDipika under Sri Dikshitar himself, thus equipping themselves for the Saivite propaganda work, which had been organized with a view to stemming the tide of Vaishnavite attacks and encroachments.[citation needed]/nDikshitar graphically describes Shivadvaita and Advaita, which are very close to each other as the highest steps. He makes it clear in his work that Srikantha-Bhashya on the Brahmasutra has been written in very close approximation to the trend of thought of Adi Sankara in his own bhashya. Srikanta, according to Dikshitar, propagated his cult on the understanding that sagunopasana (Worship of name and form) is only the first step to nirgunopasana (Propitiation of the nameless and formless), and that it was the real intention of Srikanta that the final truth lies only in Advaita. Dikshitar's great dialectical skill is fully reflected in the work called 'Anandalahari chandrika', where he tries to narrow down the differences between the apparently divergent schools of thought./nAmong his works in devotional hymns, the 'Durga Chandrakala Stuti' is a profound work, and hailed by sages as a hymn, which if chanted with devotion, would invoke the blessings of Goddess Durga./nSpecial issue of Journal of Indian Philosophy (March 2016, edited by Christopher Minkowski):/nOther (scholarly journal articles):/nStill other:", "62619550": "Lawrence Michael Hinman (born September 26, 1944) is an American philosopher and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of San Diego.[1]\nHe is known for his expertise on moral philosophy.[2][3][4][5][6]/n/nThis biography of an American philosopher is a stub.

Widely regarded as the founder of modern academic study of the Kabbalah, Scholem was appointed the first professor of Jewish mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.[1]/nScholem is acknowledged as the single most significant figure in the recovery, collection, annotation, and registration into rigorous Jewish scholarship of the canonical bibliography of mysticism and scriptural commentary that runs through its primordial phase in the Sefer Yetzirah, its inauguration in the Bahir, its exegesis in the Pardes and the Zohar to its cosmogonic, apocalyptic climax in Isaac Luria's Ein Sof  that is known collectively as Kabbalah.[2][3]/nAfter generations of demoralization and assimilation in the European enlightenment,[4] the disappointment of messianic hopes,[4] the famine of 1916 in Palestine,[5] and the catastrophe of the Final Solution in Europe[6] Scholem gathered and reassembled these sacred texts from many of the archives that had been disarranged, orphaned, confiscated under Nazi rule or otherwise washed up in Genizah cataloging the flood of fragments and disordered, decontextualized manuscripts into an annotated and relatively organized sequence of texts available to scholars and seekers within the reception of this tradition. Many other Jewish scholars assisted in this process of recovery once it was underway, but it is broadly recognized that Scholem initiated this process of textual and archival recovery and rebirth./nAs Scholem points out in his memoirs, the canon of sacred Jewish writings from the diaspora and the Middle Ages (re: \"Kabbalah\") had fallen into such a state of disrepair and oblivion\u2014fragmented and effaced by persecutions from without as well as contortions, conversions and schisms from within Judaism\u2014that many of the \"finest writings...\"[7] from the major currents of Jewish mysticism could only be found in long block quotations in antisemitic texts, where some \"nincompoop who had quoted and translated the most wonderful, the most profound things,\"[7] had assembled them \"in order to decry them as blasphemies.\"[7] (This was a strong, somewhat exaggerated statement for expressive effect that Scholem attributes to Ernst Bloch in his memoirs\u2014but there he co-signs the sentiment and appropriates it as his own description of the state of affairs in other places.)[8][2][3]/nThanks to Scholem's efforts, and those of his students and colleagues, the confused and inscrutable condition of Kabbalistic bibliography and provenance would be significantly remedied after the end of the World Wars and the foundation of the modern state of Israel where Scholem worked as head librarian of the National Library in Jerusalem./nGerhard (Gershom) Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His  father was a printer. His older brother was the German Communist leader Werner Scholem. He studied Hebrew and Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi.[9]/nScholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended when Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 in the wake of Nazi persecution. Scholem dedicated his book Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Die j\u00fcdische Mystik in ihren Hauptstr\u00f6mungen), based on lectures 1938\u20131940, to  Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew. There he met Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha'am, and Zalman Shazar.[9]/nIn Berlin, Scholem befriended Leo Strauss and corresponded with him throughout his life.[10] He studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in Semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.[9] Together with Benjamin he established a fictitious school \u2013 the University of Muri.[11]/nScholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, Sefer ha-Bahir. The following year it appeared in book form as \"Das Buch Bahir\", having been published by his father's publishing house.[9]/nDrawn to Zionism and influenced by Buber, he immigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine.[12] It may be considered notable that though Scholem's allegiance to the Zionist cause (or the reclamation of Palestine by the Jewish diaspora) is incontrovertible, his relationship to the manifest ethics of Zionism was more ambiguous and critical than Buber's.[13][14][15][16]/nAfter his emigration from Berlin to Palestine, Scholem became a librarian, heading the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. In 1927 he revamped the Dewey Decimal System, making it appropriate for large Judaica collections. Scholem's brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left \"Fischer-Maslow Group\" and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, or Weimar Diet, representing the Communist Party of Germany. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Unlike his brother, Gershom was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud. Fania, who had been his student and could read Polish, was helpful in his later research, particularly in regard to Jacob Frank.[17]/nIn 1946 Scholem was sent by the Hebrew University to search for Jewish books that had been plundered by the Nazis and help return them to their rightful owners. He spent much of the year in Germany and Central Europe as part of this project, known as \"Otzrot HaGolah\".[9]/nScholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery.

He taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor./nScholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th-century school of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (\"Science of Judaism\"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was \"both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,\" and \"changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.\"[19]/nJewish mysticism was acknowledged as Judaism's weakest scholarly link by many of the scholars, publishers and cultural leaders of the Jewish community and gentile German scholars who sponsored Scholem's early career, including Martin Buber, Salman Schocken, Franz Rosenzweig, Robert Eisler, Philipp Bloch\u00a0[de], Moses Marx, Clemens Baumker, Fritz Hommel and Walter Benjamin.[6][13]/nScholem told the story of his early research \"at the start of my path\" in 1922 when he went to Berlin to visit \"the only Jewish scholar scholar who had engaged in the study of Kabbalah in the previous generation.\"[20]* Gesturing at the rabbi's library of documents, manuscripts and autographs written by the authors of the Kabbalah, some of which had been inscribed in early modern or medieval centuries, Scholem remarked, \"How wonderful it is, Herr Professor, that you have read and learned all this!\" to which \"...the elderly gentleman replied: 'What! And I also have to read all this nonsense?!\"[20]/n*(Though he does not mention the name of the Rabbi in his canonical account of this visit, Scholem explains elsewhere that this scholar--once the Rabbi of Poznan\u2014was Phillip Bloch.[6][20] )/nThe analysis of Judaism carried out by the Wissenschaft school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem: It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism; and it did not consider the proper foundations of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing./nIn Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber's personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel./nIn the worldview of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the Gegengeschichte of  Friedrich Nietzsche, he ended up including less normative aspects of Judaism in the public history./nSpecifically, Scholem in his scholarly writing that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:/nElsewhere, in oral presentation or informal reflection, Scholem inflected the three periods within a different frame of reference:[21][22][9] there was the primordial inscription and enunciation of the Law in the Torah and the Talmud, the mystical reflections of the Kaballah, and the post-metaphysical phase of mystical writings represented by (for example) the writings of Franz Kafka or the critical mysticism of his friend and correspondent Walter Benjamin. Scholem often told his students that the modern reader must read Franz Kafka in order to enter into the frame of mind native to the Kaballah, and elsewhere remarked that, \"among the peculiarities\" Benjamin's writings was its \"enormous suitability for canonization; I might almost say for quotation as a kind of Holy Writ.\"[22]/nThe notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as Sabbateanism, was developed from the Lurianic Kabbalah. In order to neutralize Sabbateanism, Hasidism had emerged as a Hegelian synthesis. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an Orthodox congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement./nIn the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism./nThe historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to Walter Benjamin, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. His special regard for the spiritual potency of the Hebrew language was expressed in his 1926 letter to Franz Rosenzweig  regarding his concerns over the \"secularization\" of Hebrew. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation./nScholem's closest peers included, most famously, Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss./nThough his relationship with Franz Rosenzweig was of shorter duration, it was also a deeply influential one. Likewise, though Scholem was never directly introduced to Franz Kafka, he found out later in life that Kafka approved of his comments in a debate.[7] Scholem and Benjamin's discussions of Kafka, spanning decades, played no small role in the elevation Kafka's literary and epistolary writings to canonical status in both secular and mystical literature as writing that was prophetic or premonitory of the Holocaust while also having qualities of a kind of post-metaphysical kabbalah.[23][24][25][21][15]/nIt is a measure of the depth of Scholem's friendship with Benjamin that he wrote two memoirs at the end of his life: his own autobiography[26] tends to be less read or frequently cited than his \"Autobiography of a Friendship\" recounting his lifelong relationship and work in partnership with Benjamin prior to the latter's death in flight from the Gestapo in 1940.[7] In addition to his Kabbalah scholarship, a significant portion of Scholem's working life postwar was spent recovering, editing and promoting the literary estate of his dead friend.[5]/nMartin Buber was a patron, publisher and sponsor of the careers of both Scholem and his best friend Benjamin (despite Benjamin's frequent ingratitude and incorrigible blowing of deadlines and Scholem's occasionally scathing critiques of the elder figure).[7][5]/nThough Scholem's relationships with Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, Hans Jonas, and Ernst Bloch were more characteristically turbulent than those relationship just mentioned, the frequent citation of these figures in Scholem's published writings and private correspondence demonstrates that they were among his closest and most influential colleagues. Selected letters from his correspondence with thinkers, critics and philosophers have been published./nThough appearing as a friend and proteg\u00e9 late in his career, Cynthia Ozick merits mention among those in Scholem's inner-circle. His late-career relationships with Allen Ginsberg, Harold Bloom, and George Steiner were also significant (though his relationship with Steiner was, characteristically, somewhat combative). Scholem was also friendly with the author Shai Agnon and the Talmudic scholar Saul Lieberman./nAs a major, unofficial but widely acknowledged figurehead of mystical, historical and theological currents within both Reform and (much more controversially) Conservative Judaism after World War II and the Destruction of the European Jewry in the Holocaust, Scholem's stature within Jewish tradition is roughly comparable to the role played before the First World War and during the interwar period by Martin Buber.[27][28]/nIn the aftermath of the Adolf Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised Hannah Arendt's book, Eichmann in Jerusalem and decried her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \"love of one's fellow Jews\", \u02beah\u0259va\u1e6f \u02bei\u015br\u0101\u02be\u0113l).[29] Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them.[30] The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, led to a rift between Scholem and Arendt though they remained mutually respectful thereafter and continued to work alongside one another on various projects, particularly in their work on the literary estate of Walter Benjamin.[31]  In an apparently wrathful moment, Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he \"knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and... when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.\"[32] Differing perspectives on the appropriate penalty for Adolph Eichmann further illuminate differences between the two authors.  Whereas Arendt felt that Eichmann should be executed, Scholem was opposed, fearing that his execution would serve to alleviate the Germans' collective sense of guilt.[33][34]/nVarious stories and essays of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges were inspired or influenced by Scholem's books.[38] He has also influenced ideas of Umberto Eco, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Italian  philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and George Steiner.[39] American author Michael Chabon cites Scholem's essay, The Idea of the Golem, as having assisted him in conceiving the Pulitzer-Prize winning book The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.[40] The same essay influenced, and is cited by, Bruce Chatwin's Utz.  Chaim Potok's The Book of Lights features a lightly disguised Scholem as \"Jacob Keter.\"[41]", "32680": "Vilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto[4] (UK: /p\u00e6\u02c8re\u026ato\u028a, -\u02c8ri\u02d0t-/ parr-AY-toh, -\u2060EE-,[5] US: /p\u0259\u02c8re\u026ato\u028a/ p\u0259-RAY-toh,[6] Italian: [vil\u02c8fre\u02d0do pa\u02c8re\u02d0to], Ligurian: [pa\u02c8\u027ee\u02d0tu]; born Wilfried Fritz Pareto;[7] 15 July 1848 \u2013 19 August 1923) was an Italian polymath (civil engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher). He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals' choices.  He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term \"elite\" in social analysis./nHe introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics. He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. The Pareto principle was named after him, and it was built on his observations that 80% of the wealth in Italy belonged to about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of sociology and mathematics./nPareto was born of an exiled noble Genoese family on 15 July 1848 in Paris,[8] the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812\u20131882), was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much as Giuseppe Mazzini and other Italian nationalists had.[9] His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, his parents named him Wilfried Fritz, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858.[10] In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the newly created Istituto Tecnico Leardi where Ferdinando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor.[11] In 1869, he earned a doctorate in engineering from what is now the Polytechnic University of Turin[9] (then the Technical School for Engineers), with a dissertation entitled \"The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies\". His later interest in equilibrium analysis in economics and sociology can be traced back to this dissertation. Pareto was among the contributors of the Rome-based magazine La Ronda between 1919 and 1922.[12]/nFor some years after graduation, he worked as a civil engineer, first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works.[9]/nHe did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career a fiery advocate of classical liberalism, besetting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the free market. In 1886, he became a lecturer on economics and management at the University of Florence. His stay in Florence was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian woman, Alessandrina Bakunina.[8]/nIn 1893, he succeeded L\u00e9on Walras to the chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life.[9] He published there in 1896-1897 a textbook containing the Pareto distribution of how wealth is distributed, which he believed was a constant \"through any human society, in any age, or country\".[9] In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy, later generalised by Joseph M. Juran into the Pareto principle (also termed the 80\u201320 rule)./nPareto maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists, but he always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their motives and denounced socialist leaders as an 'aristocracy of brigands' who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of the Italian statesman Giovanni Giolitti for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labor in the Kingdom of Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp.[13] His attitude towards Italian fascism in his last years is a matter of controversy.[14][15]/nPareto's relationship with scientific sociology in the age of the foundation is grafted in a paradigmatic way in the moment in which he, starting from the political economy, criticizes positivism as a totalizing and metaphysical system devoid of a rigorous logical-experimental method. In this sense we can read the fate of the Paretian production within a history of the social sciences that continues to show its peculiarity and interest for its contributions in the 21st\u00a0century.[16] The story of Pareto is also part of the multidisciplinary research of a scientific model that privileges sociology as a critique of cumulative models of knowledge as well as a discipline tending to the affirmation of relational models of science.[17][18]/nIn 1889, Pareto married Alessandrina Bakunina, a Russian woman. She left him in 1902 for a young servant. Twenty years later in 1923, he married Jeanne Regis, a French woman, just before his death in Geneva, Switzerland on 19 August 1923.[8]/nPareto's later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, Trattato di sociologia generale (1916) (The Mind and Society, published in 1935). His final work was Compendio di sociologia generale (1920)./nIn his Trattato di Sociologia Generale (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by Harcourt, Brace in a four-volume edition edited by Arthur Livingston under the title The Mind and Society (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the circulation of elites, the first social cycle theory in sociology. He is famous for saying \"history is a graveyard of aristocracies\".[19]/nPareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain \"residues\" and by \"derivations\" from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the \"foxes\" or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the \"lion\" mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.[20]/nAmong those who introduced Pareto's sociology to the United States were George Homans and Lawrence J. Henderson at Harvard, and Paretian ideas gained considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons, who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional.[21]  The American historian Bernard DeVoto played an important role in introducing Pareto's ideas to these Cambridge intellectuals and other Americans in the 1930s. Wallace Stegner, in his biography of DeVoto, recounts these developments and says this about the often misunderstood distinction between \"residues\" and \"derivations\":  \"Basic to Pareto's method is the analysis of society through its non-rational 'residues,' which are persistent and unquestioned social habits, beliefs, and assumptions, and its 'derivations,' which are the explanations, justifications, and rationalizations we make of them.  One of the commonest errors of social thinkers is to assume rationality and logic in social attitudes and structures; another is to confuse residues and derivations.\"[22]/nRenato Cirillo wrote that Vilfredo Pareto had frequently been considered a predecessor of fascism as a result of his support for the movement when it began. However, Cirillo disagreed with this interpretation, suggesting that Pareto was critical of fascism in his private letters.[23]/nPareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason, he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed Benito Mussolini's rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the \"pure\" economic forces.[24]/nWhen he was still a young student, the future leader of Italian fascism Benito Mussolini attended some of Pareto's lectures at the University of Lausanne in 1904. It has been argued that Mussolini's move away from socialism towards a form of \"elitism\" may be attributed to Pareto's ideas.[25] Franz Borkenau, a biographer, argued that Mussolini followed Pareto's policy ideas during the beginning of his tenure as prime minister.[26]:\u200a18/nKarl Popper dubbed Pareto the \"theoretician of totalitarianism\",[27] but, according to Renato Cirillo, there is no evidence in Popper's published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgement in anti-fascist circles.[14]/nPareto Theory of Maximum Economics/nPareto turned his interest to economic matters, and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in conflict with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of L\u00e9on Walras that economics is essentially a mathematical science. Pareto was a leader of the \"Lausanne School\" and represents the second generation of the Neoclassical Revolution. His \"tastes-and-obstacles\" approach to general equilibrium theory was resurrected during the great \"Paretian Revival\" of the 1930s and has influenced theoretical economics since.[28]/nIn his Manual of Political Economy (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of \"objectives and constraints\". He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the \"Edgeworth-Bowley\" box.[29]/nPareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with, and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility[30] \u2013 that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering.  With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy (which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said \"good\" cannot be measured). He replaced it with the notion of Pareto-optimality, the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.  Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.[31]/nSome economic concepts in current use are based on his work:/nHe argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:/nwhere N is the number of people with wealth higher than x, and A and m are constants. Over the years, Pareto's Law has proved remarkably close to observed data:", "13926315": "Patro (Greek: \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd) was an Epicurean philosopher. He lived for some time in Rome, where he became acquainted, among others, with Cicero, and with the family of Gaius Memmius. At this point, or subsequently, he also gained the friendship of Atticus. From Rome he either removed or returned to Athens, and there succeeded Phaedrus as head of the Epicurean school, c. 70 BC. Memmius had, while in Athens, procured permission from the Areopagus court to pull down an old wall belonging to the property left by Epicurus for the use of his school. This was regarded by Patro as a sort of desecration, and he accordingly addressed himself to Atticus and Cicero, to induce them to use their influence with the Areopagus to get the decree rescinded. Atticus also wrote to Cicero on the subject. Cicero arrived at Athens the day after Memmius had departed for Mytilene. Finding that Memmius had abandoned his design of erecting the edifice with which the wall in question would have interfered, he consented to help in the matter; but thinking that the Areopagus would not retract their decree without the consent of Memmius, he wrote to the latter, urging his request in an elegant epistle, which is still in existence.[1]", "5537708": "Cecil Alec Mace (22 July 1894 \u2013 7 June 1971) usually cited as C.A.

Chronologically, he lived in the 1st century BC, and did his work prior to Strabo and Arius Didymus, both of whom quote him.[3] He was involved in a plagiarism controversy with Aristo of Alexandria, one of Antiochus of Ascalon's students, as they had both written a work on the Nile.[4] but he is not mentioned by Antiochus' contemporary Cicero, implying he was not one of Antiochus' students.[3] Eudorus also wrote a survey of philosophy, at least one portion of which dealt with ethics, of which a summary by Arius Didymus is preserved in Stobaeus.[5][3] He also wrote a commentary on Plato's Timaeus which is referred to by Plutarch,[3] and may also have written a commentary on the Categories of Aristotle.[3]/nEudorus combined Platonist, Pythagorean and Stoic ideas in his philosophy.[6] He divided philosophy into ethics, physics, and logic, taking Ethics as prior to Physics, as opposed to the Stoics, who considered physics to come before ethics.[3]  In ethics, Eudorus formulated a teleological principle for Platonism, derived from the Theaetetus: \"as much as we can, become like God.\"[7] In this he believed that he had found an apt definition of the common goal of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato.[6] In physics, Eudorus' account of first principles,[8] postulates the existence of a highest principle, called \"The One,\" above the Pythagorean Monad and Dyad, which Eudorus called God.[9] Although Eudorus considers this to be a Pythagorean doctrine, modern scholars such as John M. Dillon consider this to have likely originated with Eudorus, based on the extant Pythagorean fragments recorded by Alexander Polyhistor, which show little or no trace of this doctrine.[9] In logic, Eudorus appears to have rejected Aristotle's theory of categories, preferring to derive them from the Old Academy categories of \"Absolute\" and \"Relative\" which were developed by Xenocrates.[10]/nEudorus is mentioned by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics.[11][12] Simplicius refers to him as a Peripatetic philosopher, and relates that he had written on the Aristotelian Categories./nThe way Aristotle's texts were available to Eudorus is now an open field for research.[13]", "7143365": "Tad M.

During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in Boston, Massachusetts, while studying for a Harvard PhD in philosophy, which he completed in 1941.[5]  His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards aesthetics, where he became better known than in logic and analytic philosophy. During World War II, he served as a psychologist in the US Army.[6]/nHe taught at the University of Pennsylvania, 1946\u20131964, where his students included Noam Chomsky, Sydney Morgenbesser, Stephen Stich, and Hilary Putnam. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at Brandeis University from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.[7]/nIn 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.[8]/nGoodman died in Needham, Massachusetts./nIn his book Fact, Fiction, and Forecast, Goodman introduced the \"new riddle of induction\", so-called by analogy with Hume's classical problem of induction. He accepted Hume's observation that inductive reasoning (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons)./nHempel's confirmation theory argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and evidence statements, which apply to only one thing.  Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate grue, which applies to all things examined before a certain time t just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time t. If we examine emeralds before time t and find that emerald a is green, emerald b is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds a, b, c,..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue.  Thus, before time t, the apparently law-like statements \"All emeralds are green\" and \"All emeralds are grue\" are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously \"All emeralds are grue\" is not a law-like statement./nGoodman's example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial dilemma that \"anything can confirm anything\"./nGoodman, along with Stanislaw Lesniewski, is the founder of the contemporary variant of nominalism, which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with set theory. Goodman's nominalism was driven purely by ontological considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with W. V. O. Quine, Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with set theory \u2013 discredited as sole foundations of mathematics as of 1913 (Russell and Whitehead, in Principia Mathematica)./nThe program of David Hilbert to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1931 by G\u00f6del.  Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, Quine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman's Penn colleague Richard Milton Martin argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward./nAccording to Thomas Tymoczko's afterword in New directions in the philosophy of mathematics, Quine had \"urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation\", putting the \"key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context.\"  In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of science were merged into quasi-empiricism:  the emphasis of mathematical practice as effectively part of the scientific method, an emphasis on method over result./nThe Goodman\u2013Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of mereology. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman's 1951 The Structure of Appearance, a revision and extension of his PhD thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his PhD thesis still did).[9] Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed.  Mereology is accordingly \"ontologically neutral\" and retains some of Quine's pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as American Pragmatism)./nSource: Complete International Bibliography[12]", "163791": "Manuel (or Emmanuel) Chrysoloras (Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u1f74\u03bb \u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u1fb6\u03c2; c. 1350[1] \u2013 15 April 1415) was a Byzantine Greek classical scholar, humanist, philosopher, professor, and translator of ancient Greek texts during the Renaissance.[1][2] Serving as the ambassador for the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos in medieval Italy, he became a renowned teacher of Greek literature and history in the republics of Florence and Venice, and today he's widely regarded as a pioneer in the introduction of ancient Greek literature to Western Europe during the Late Middle Ages.[1][2]/nChrysoloras was born in Constantinople, at the time capital of the Byzantine Empire, to a distinguished Greek Orthodox family. In 1390, he led an embassy sent to the Republic of Venice by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos to ask the aid of the Christian princes of Medieval Europe against the invasions of the Byzantine Empire by the Muslim Ottoman Turks. Roberto de' Rossi of Florence met him in Venice, and, in 1395, Rossi's acquaintance Jacopo d'Angelo set off for Constantinople to study Greek with Chrysoloras. In 1396, Coluccio Salutati, the Chancellor of Florence, invited him to Florence to teach Greek grammar and literature.[3] In a letter to Poggio Bracciolini, quoting the Roman lawyer and statesman Cicero, Salutati wrote:/nChrysoloras arrived in the winter of 1397, an event remembered by one of his most famous pupils, the Italian humanist scholar Leonardo Bruni,[1] as a great new opportunity: there were many teachers of law, but no one had studied Greek in northern Italy for 700 years. Another very famous pupil of Chrysoloras was Ambrogio Traversari, who became general of the Camaldolese order. Chrysoloras remained only a few years in Florence, from 1397 to 1400, teaching Greek, starting with the rudiments. He moved on to teach in Bologna, and later in Venice and Rome. Though he taught widely, a handful of his chosen students remained a close-knit group, among the first humanists of the Renaissance. Among his pupils were numbered some of the foremost figures of the revival of Greek studies in Renaissance Italy.[1] Aside from Bruni, d'Angelo, and Ambrogio Traversari, they included Guarino da Verona, Coluccio Salutati, Roberto Rossi, Niccol\u00f2 de' Niccoli, Carlo Marsuppini, Pier Paolo Vergerio, Uberto Decembrio, Poggio Bracciolini, Palla Strozzi, and many others.[1]/nHaving visited Milan and Pavia, and having resided for several years in Venice, he went to Rome on the invitation of Bruni, who was then secretary to Pope Gregory XII. In 1408, he was sent to Paris on an important mission from the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. In 1413, he went to Germany on an embassy to the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the object of which was to fix a place for the church council that later assembled at Constance. Chrysoloras was on his way there, having been chosen to represent the Greek Church, when he died suddenly. His death gave rise to commemorative essays of which Guarino da Verona made a collection in Chrysolorina./nChrysoloras translated the works of Homer, Aristotle, and Plato's Republic into Latin. His own works, which circulated in manuscript in his lifetime, include brief works on the Procession of the Holy Ghost, and letters to his brothers, to Bruni, Guarino, Traversari, and to Strozzi, as well as two which were eventually printed, his Erotemata (Questions) which was the first basic Greek grammar in use in Western Europe, first published in 1484 and widely reprinted, and which enjoyed considerable success not only among his pupils in Florence, but also among later leading humanists, being immediately studied by Thomas Linacre at Oxford and by Desiderius Erasmus at Cambridge; and Epistol\u00e6 tres de comparatione veteris et nov\u00e6 Rom\u00e6 (Three Letters on the Comparison of Old and New Rome, i.e. a comparison of Rome and Constantinople). Many of his treatises on morals and ethics and other philosophical subjects came into print in the 17th and 18th centuries, because of their antiquarian interest. He was chiefly influential through his teaching in familiarizing men such as Leonardo Bruni, Coluccio Salutati, Jacopo d'Angelo, Roberto de' Rossi, Carlo Marsuppini, Pietro Candido Decembrio, Guarino da Verona, Poggio Bracciolini, with the masterpieces of Western philosophy and ancient Greek literature.[1]/nThis article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

The ancient text Mozi contains material ascribed to him and his followers./nMozi taught that everyone is equal in the eyes of heaven. He believed that the decision of who is in power should be based on meritocracy, or those who are worthy of power should receive power. Mozi invoked heaven and called upon the Sage Kings to support his precedents./nBorn in what is now Tengzhou, Shandong Province, Mozi founded the school of Mohism, which argued strongly against both Confucianism and Daoism. Mozi's philosophy emphasized universal love, social order, the will of heaven, sharing, and honoring the worthy. During the Warring States period, Mohism was actively developed and practiced in many states, but fell out of favor when the legalist Qin dynasty came to power in 221 BCE. During the Qin period, many Mohist classics are thought to have been destroyed when the emperor Qin Shi Huang supposedly carried out the burning of books and burying of scholars. The importance of Mohism further declined when Confucianism became the dominant school of thought during the Han Dynasty, disappearing almost entirely by the middle of the Western Han dynasty.[5]/nMozi is referenced in the Thousand Character Classic, which records that he was saddened when he saw the dyeing of pure white silk, which embodied his conception of austerity (i.e., simplicity and chastity)./nThe concept of Love (\u611b) was developed by Mozi in the 4th century BCE in reaction to the Confucian concept of benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of \"universal love\" (\u517c\u611b, ji\u0101n'\u00e0i). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mozi stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term Ai (\u611b) was adopted to refer to a passionate, caring love, and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, Ai was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element in growth towards enlightenment./nMost historians believe that Mozi was a member of the lower artisan class who managed to climb his way to an official post. Mozi was a native of the State of Lu (modern Tengzhou, Shandong), although for a time he served as a minister in the State of Song.[6] Similar to Confucius, Mozi was known to have maintained a school for those who desired to become officials serving in the different ruling courts of the Warring States.[7]/nMozi was a carpenter and was extremely skilled in creating devices (see Lu Ban). Though he did not hold a high official position, Mozi was sought out by various rulers as an expert on fortification. He was schooled in Confucianism in his early years, although he viewed Confucianism as being too fatalistic, with an overemphasis on elaborate celebrations and funerals, which Mozi considered to be detrimental to the livelihood and productivity of the common people. Mozi managed to attract a large following during his lifetime, rivaling that of Confucius. His followers \u2014 mostly technicians and craftspeople \u2014 were organized in a disciplined order that studied both Mozi's philosophical and technical writings./nAccording to some accounts of the popular understanding of Mozi at the time, he had been hailed by many as the greatest hero to come from Henan. His passion was said to be for the good of the people, without concern for personal gain or even for his own life or death. His tireless contribution to society was praised by many, including Confucius's disciple Mencius. Mencius wrote in Jinxin (Chinese: \u5b5f\u5b50\u76e1\u5fc3; pinyin: Mengzi Jinxin) that Mozi believed in love for all mankind, noting that, as long as something benefitted mankind, Mozi would pursue it even if it meant \"hurting his head or his feet\". Zhang Tai Yan said that, in terms of moral virtue, even Confucius and Laozi could not compare to Mozi./nMozi travelled from one crisis zone to another throughout the ravaged landscape of the Warring States, trying to dissuade rulers from their plans of conquest. According to the chapter \"Gongshu\" in the Mozi, he once walked for ten days to the State of Chu in order to forestall an attack on the State of Song. At the Chu court, Mozi engaged in nine simulated war games with Gongshu Ban, the chief military strategist of Chu, and overturned each one of his stratagems. When Gongshu Ban threatened him with death, Mozi informed the king that his disciples had already trained the soldiers of Song in his fortification methods, so it would be useless to kill him. The Chu king was forced to call off the war. On the way back, however, the soldiers of Song, not recognizing Mozi, would not allow him to enter their city, and he had to spend a night freezing in the rain. After this episode, he also prevented the State of Qi from attacking the State of Lu. He taught that the defense of a city did not depend only on fortification, weaponry, and food supply, but rather that it was also important to keep talented people close by and to put trust in them./nMozi's moral teachings emphasized introspection, self-reflection, and authenticity, rather than obedience to rituals. He observed that people often learned about the world through adversity.[8] By reflecting on one's own successes and failures, one attains true self-knowledge rather than mere conformity to ritual.[9] Mozi exhorted people to lead a life of asceticism and self-restraint, renouncing both material and spiritual extravagance./nLike Confucius, Mozi idealized the Xia Dynasty and the ancients of Chinese mythology, but he also criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. Mozi argued that what is thought of as \"ancient\" was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation.[10] Though Mozi did not believe that history necessarily progresses, as did Han Fei Zi, he shared the latter's critique of fate (\u547d, m\u00ecng). Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives, which could be achieved by applying one's senses to observing the world, as well as judging objects and events by their causes, functions, and historical bases.[11] This was the \"three-prong method\" Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements. His students later expanded upon this theory to form the School of Names./nMozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese ideal of strong attachments to family and clan structures with the concept of \"impartial caring\" or \"universal love\" (\u517c\u611b, ji\u0101n \u00e0i). He argued directly against Confucians, who had philosophized that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, in contrast, argued that people in principle should care for all people equally, a notion that philosophers in other schools found absurd, as they interpreted this notion as implying no special amount of care or duty towards one's parents and family./nOverlooked by those critics, however, was a passage in the chapter on \"Self-Cultivation\" which stated, \"When people near-by are not befriended, there is no use endeavoring to attract those at a distance.\"[12] This point was also precisely articulated by a Mohist in a debate with Mencius (in the Mengzi), where the Mohist argued, in relation to carrying out universal love, that \"we begin with what is near.\" Also, in the first chapter in the Mozi on the topic of universal love, Mozi argued that the best way of being filial to one's parents is to be filial to the parents of others. The foundational principle was therefore that benevolence, as well as malevolence, is requited, and that one would be treated by others as one treats others. Mozi quoted a popular passage from the Book of Odes to bring home this point: \"When one throws to me a peach, I return to him a plum.\" One's parents will be treated by others as one treats the parents of others. Mozi also differentiated between \"intention\" and \"actuality\", thereby placing a central importance on the will to love, even though in practice it might very well be impossible to bring benefit to everyone./nIn addition, Mozi argued that benevolence comes to human beings \"as naturally as fire turns upward or water turns downward\", provided that persons in positions of authority illustrate benevolence in their own lives. In differentiating between the ideas of \"universal\" (jian) and \"differential\" (bie), Mozi said that \"universal\" originated from righteousness while \"differential\" entailed human effort./nMozi also held a belief in the power of ghosts and spirits, although he is often thought to have only worshipped them pragmatically. In fact, in his discussion on ghosts and spirits, he remarked that, even if they did not exist, communal gatherings for the sake of making sacrificial offering would play a role in strengthening social bonds. Furthermore, for Mozi the will of Heaven (\u5929, ti\u0101n) was that people should love one another, and that mutual love by all would bring benefit to all. Therefore, it was in everyone's interest that they would love others \"as they love themselves\". According to Mozi, Heaven should be respected because failing to do so would subject one to punishment. For Mozi, Heaven was not the \"amoral\", mystical nature of the Daoists; rather, it was a benevolent, moral force that rewarded good and punished evil. Similar in some ways to the beliefs systems found in the Abrahamic religions, Mozi believed that all living things lived in a realm ruled by Heaven, and Heaven possessed a will which was independent from, and higher than, the will of people. Thus Mozi wrote that \"Universal love is the Way of Heaven\", since \"Heaven nourishes and sustains all life without regard to status.\"[13] Mozi's ideal of government, which advocated a meritocracy based on talent rather than background, also followed his idea of Heaven./nMozi opposed the Confucian idea of \"Destiny\",[14] promoting instead an idea of \"anti-fatalism\" (\u975e\u547d). Where the Confucian philosophy held that a person's life, death, wealth, poverty, and social status were entirely dependent upon destiny and therefore could not be changed, Mozi argued that hard work and virtuous acts could change one's position in life./nMohist ethics is considered a form of consequentialism, according to which the morality of an action, statement, teaching, policy, judgment, and so on, is determined by the consequences that it brings about. In particular, Mozi thought that actions should be measured by the way they contribute to the benefit of all members of society. With this criterion, Mozi denounced things as diverse as offensive warfare, expensive funerals, and even music and dance, which he saw as serving no useful purpose. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BCE, is the \"world's earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".[15] Consequentialist theories vary over exactly which consequences are relevant, though they all share the same basic outcome-based structure. With Mozi's overwhelming focus on \"benefit\" (\u5229, li) among other ends, and his explicit focus on making moral evaluations in light of them, Mozi's ethics indeed shares this consequentalist structure. For interpreting Mozi, however, there is some debate over how to understand the consequences Mozi seems most concerned with, and therefore over which kind of consequentialism to ascribe to him./nSome believe the best descriptor to be state consequentialism.[16] According to this reading, Mohist ethics makes moral evaluations based on how well the action, statement, etc., in question contributes to the stability of a state.[16] Such state-related goods include social order, material wealth, and population growth. By centering his ethical theory around the promotion of such state-related ends, Mozi shows himself to be a state consequentialist. Unlike hedonistic utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, \"the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are ... order, material wealth, and increase in population\".[17] During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. Mozi opposed wars because they wasted life and resources while interfering with the fair distribution of wealth, yet he recognized the need for strong urban defenses so he could maintain the harmonious society he desired.[18] The \"material wealth\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the \"order\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.[19] Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in The Cambridge History of Ancient China, writes that the moral goods of Mohism \"are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth ... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically\".[17] In contrast to Jeremy Bentham, Mozi did not believe that individual happiness was important; the consequences of the state outweigh the consequences of individual actions.[17]/nAlternative readings locate the main focus of Mozi's consequentialism in the welfare of the people themselves rather than that of the state as a whole.[20] Such interpretations as Chris Fraser's argue that it is a mistake to view Mozi's focus on the collective well-being of a population as a focus on the well-being of the state itself rather than its constituents. In this way, Mozi tended to evaluate actions based on whether they provide benefit to the people, which he measured in terms of an enlarged population (states were sparsely populated in his day), a prosperous economy, and social order. Indeed these are collective goods rather than individual ones, which is a major difference between Mohist consequentialism and modern, Western versions. However, this reading emphasizes that collective goods are better considered as aggregated individual goods rather than as state goods./nThis consequentialist structure supports Mohist ethics and politics, which survives in the form of 10 core doctrines. These doctrines are as follows:/nEach of these doctrines is justified on the grounds that it produces the best consequences for society, and that all people stand to benefit from adopting them. Promoting the worthy, for example, encourages people in positions of power to hire competent and worthy subordinates to fill posts, rather than hire friends and relatives instead. The reasoning here is that someone better qualified for the job will perform better and enable society as a whole to benefit. Identifying upward refers to the idea that people in subordinate positions in society must look to their superiors as models for their own conduct. Provided that the superiors are indeed morally competent and worthy of emulation, the rest of society will always have a reliable guide for their own actions, thereby giving rise to social benefits./nUniversal love refers to the basic normative attitude the Mohists encourage us to adopt towards others. The idea is that people ought to consider all others as being part of their scope of moral concern. Indeed this is perhaps the most infamous of Mohist doctrines, and was criticized early on by philosophers such as Mengzi, who held that the doctrine was akin to renouncing one's family. However, close readings of the texts by modern scholars have shown the demands of Mohist universal love to be much more mild and reasonable.[21] Additionally, given the accretional nature of the texts, the audience of such texts may have changed depending upon the Mohists' social influence, and so the demands for universal love made on rulers, for example, is considerably higher than that made on the masses.[22] At its most basic, however, the doctrine merely encourages a general attitude of care towards others. However, this does not require that we renounce all forms of special relationships we have with our families and friends. In fact, the Mohists introduce the problem that universal love is meant to solve by lamenting the fact that fathers and sons don't care for each other, and so must instead adopt an attitude of universal love.[23] Conversely, the Mohists hope, when people adopt an attitude of universal love, society as a whole will benefit./nDovetailing with this idea is that of condemning aggression. The main targets of this doctrine are undoubtedly the rulers of the various warring states in China, who regularly embarked on expansionist military campaigns in order to increase their territory, power, and influence. However, such campaigns were enormously taxing on the population, disrupting regular farming cycles by conscripting able-bodied people for these military ends. Additionally, the practices is ethically wrong for the same reason that robbery and murder are wrong. In fact, according to Mozi, the two are actually one and the same; for what is an expansionist war of aggression other than robbery and murder on a grand scale? And yet, Mozi laments, those rulers who execute robbers and murderers engage in the very same practices. With respect to universal love, indeed part of the reason why rulers believe it is acceptable to invade and conquer other states while it is not acceptable for their own subjects to rob and steal from one another is that the people in neighboring states are not part of the rulers' scope of moral concern. If rulers were to instead include these people and refrain from wars of aggression, all states, those attacking and those defending, will benefit./nModeration in use and moderation in burials are the main Mohist ideas about frugality. In one's own projects, utility ought to be the only consideration./nWhat is the purpose of houses? It is to protect us from the wind and cold of winter, the heat and rain of summer, and to keep out robbers and thieves. Once these ends have been secured, that is all. Whatever does not contribute to these ends should be eliminated.[19]/nThe Mohists took particular offense to the practice of extremely lavished funerals and demanding mourning rituals. Such funerals and rituals would potentially bankrupt an entire clan, at least temporarily, and disrupt its farming practices. For the dead in higher positions of authority, this disruption would affect an even greater number of people. Again, the point here is to promote benefit across society, and the Mohists believe that adopting frugal practices will do so./nMozi's ideas about ghosts and spirits follow from their religious beliefs in a morally consistent universe. Heaven, it is argued, is the ultimate moral standard, while ghosts and spirits serve as Heaven's enforcers. Both doctrines, when adopted, promote societal benefit both by enabling people to rely upon an objective standard to guide their actions (namely, Heaven), and by acting as a sort of cosmic authority capable of enacting rewards and punishments./nMozi's condemnation of music rests on the same economic considerations as their general ideas of frugality. In ancient China, grand musical ceremonies established by rulers would place enormous financial and human strains on populations, and so Mozi condemned such ceremonies for this reason. It's worth noting that Mozi did not object to music in principle\u2014\"It's not that I don't like the sound of the drum\" (\"Against Music\")\u2014but only because of the heavy tax burden such activities placed on commoners and also due to the fact that officials tended to indulge in them at the expense of their duties./nFinally, the Mohists rejected the idea of fatalism, or the idea that there is fate. The Mohists reject this idea on the grounds that it encourages lazy and irresponsible behavior. When people believe that there is fate, and that the consequences of their actions lie beyond their control, people will not be encouraged to improve themselves, nor will they be willing to take responsibility for disasters. As a result, society will suffer, and so the doctrine that there is fate ought to be rejected./n\"Mozi\" is also the name of the philosophical anthology written and compiled by followers of Mozi. The text was formed by an accretional process that took place over a period of hundreds of years, beginning perhaps during or shortly after Mozi's lifetime, and lasting until perhaps the early Han dynasty.[24] During the Han dynasty, as Confucianism came to be the official school of political thought, Mohism gradually lost both its adherents and influence while simultaneously being partly incorporated into more mainstream political thought.[25] The text was eventually neglected, and only 58 of the text's original 71 books (pian) survive, some of which, notably the later Mohist Canons, contain significant textual corruptions and are fragmentary in nature.[26] The anthology can be divided into 5 main groups, which are determined on the basis of both chronological and thematic features:/nThe Mozi is a rich source of insight into early Chinese dynastic history, culture, and philosophy. The text frequently cites ancient classics, such as the Shang Shu, and at times departs from the received version, giving scholars insight into the textual development of such classics as well./nThe texts portray Mozi as a mouthpiece for Mohist philosophy and not much else. This picture contrasts that of Confucius and Mencius found in the Lunyu (Analects) and Mengzi respectively, wherein the thinkers in question are portrayed as expressing emotions, chiding students, and even making mistakes. (Consider Mengzi's disastrous advice to the King of Qi to invade the state of Yan.)[27] To contrast, Mozi has little if any personality in the text, instead serving only as a mouthpiece for Mohist philosophy./nMohism, like other schools of thought at the time, was suppressed under the Qin and died out completely under the Han, as its more radical adherents gradually dissolved and its most compelling ideas became absorbed by mainstream political thought. The influence of Mozi is still visible in many Han dynasty works written hundreds of years later. For example, the Confucian scholar Gongsun Hong describes the Confucian virtue of ren (\"benevolence\") in Mohist terms.[28] Additionally, Mohist epistemology and philosophy of language had a profound influence on the development of classical Chinese philosophy in general.[29] In fact, Mohism was so prominent during the Warring States period that philosophical opponents, including Mencius and some authors of the Daoist anthology, the Zhuangzi, lament the very prevalence and widespread influence of their ideas.[30]/nIn modern times, Mohism has been given a fresh analysis. Sun Yat-Sen used \"universal love\" as one of the foundations for his idea of Chinese democracy. More recently, Chinese scholars under Communism have tried to rehabilitate Mozi as a \"philosopher of the people\", highlighting his rational-empirical approach to the world as well as his \"proletarian\" background. The body in the Mozi is constructed by xing (\u5f62, 'body'), xin (\u5fc3, 'heart'), qi (\u6c23, 'energy') 'which is in accord with the Pre-Qin thinkers' understanding to the body. While xing refers to the flesh-bloody part of human being, the concept of xin focuses on the aspect of cognition and is closely related to the concept of shan (\u5584, 'goodness'), ai (\u611b, 'love'), zhi (\u5fd7, 'will') and xing.[31]/nSome views claim that Mozi's philosophy was at once more advanced and less so than that of Confucius. Indeed the Mohists were radical political reformers who sought primarily to benefit the masses and challenge the practices of the ruling orthodoxy, often targeting a perceived wasteful aristocracy whom they referred to as \"the gentlemen of the world.\" The Mohist idea of \"universal love\" embraced a broader idea of human community than that of the Confucians, arguing that the scope of individuals' moral concern should include all people. Opponents of this idea often claimed that \"universal love\" was akin to renouncing one's family,[32] and indeed more strict Mohists living in Mohist communities as the school flourished may have exhibited such behavior. However, there is some scholarly debate over just how radical the provisions of universal love actually are, and, as can be seen from the example of Gongsun Hong above, the less radical components of the doctrine were eventually absorbed by mainstream thought./nMozi is also famous for his ideas about frugality, such as those concerning moderating expenses and eliminating wasteful ceremonies including music and funerals. A common misconception is that the Mohists eschewed all forms of art, but of course the Mohists' targets are more specifically elaborate, state-sponsored rituals that would place incredible financial burdens upon a mostly peasant population. This can be seen from Xunzi's own arguments against Mozi in book 10 of the Xunzi \"Enriching the State,\" where Xunzi argues against Mozi that prominent displays of wealth on the part of the state is necessary to maintaining social order./nSome modern-day supporters for Mozi[who?] (as well as Communism) make the claim that Mohism and modern Communism share a lot in terms of ideals for community life.  Others[who?] would claim that Mohism shares more with the central ideas of Christianity, especially in terms of the idea of \"universal love\" (in Greek, \"agape\"), the \"Golden Rule\", and the relation of humanity to the supernatural realm. However, Mohism is undoubtedly a product of Warring States China, a period of tremendous political violence and turmoil. The Mohists were political reformers, but they did not seek to challenge the monarchical model of government that prevailed during that time, and sought instead to reform from within by encouraging governments to hire competent people to carry out political tasks, care for their people inclusively, eliminate frivolous government spending, and halt all wars of aggression./nIn many ways the influence of Mohism was a victim of its own successes, and it is fairly easy to understand its decline. The Mohists' ideas about the importance of meritocracy and universal love were gradually absorbed by mainstream Confucian thinking. Their opposition to offensive warfare became irrelevant once the various Warring States were unified under the Qin and later Han dynasty, and their religious superstitions were eventually replaced with less supernatural accounts. So their most promising ideas were metabolized by the tradition, while their more radical and anachronistic ones were gradually discarded, leading to their demise during the Han dynasty./nAccording to Joseph Needham, Mozi (collected writings of those in the tradition of Mozi, some of which might have been by Mozi himself) contains the following sentence: 'The cessation of motion is due to the opposing force... If there is no opposing force... the motion will never stop. This is as true as that an ox is not a horse.' which, he claims, is a precursor to Newton's first law of motion.[33] Mozi also contains speculations in optics and mechanics that are similarly strikingly original, although their ideas were not taken up by later Chinese philosophers. The Mohist tradition is also highly unusual in Chinese thought in that it devoted time to developing principles of logic.[34]/nHe is the first to describe the physical principle behind the camera, also known as the camera obscura.[35][note 1][36]", "50659312": "John Hadley (born 27 September 1966) is an Australian philosopher whose research concerns moral and political philosophy, including animal ethics, environmental ethics, and metaethics. He is currently a senior lecturer in philosophy in the School of Humanities and Communication Arts at Western Sydney University. He has previously taught at Charles Sturt University and the University of Sydney, where he studied as an undergraduate and doctoral candidate. In addition to a variety of articles in peer-reviewed journals and edited collections, he is the author of the 2015 monograph Animal Property Rights (Lexington Books) and the 2019 monograph Animal Neopragmatism (Palgrave Macmillan). He is also the co-editor, with Elisa Aaltola, of the 2015 collection Animal Ethics and Philosophy (Rowman & Littlefield International)./nHadley is known for his account of animal property rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, on the basis of the interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists./nOther work has included a defence of a neopragmatist approach to animal ethics, along with criticism of the metaethical and metaphilosophical assumptions of mainstream animal ethicists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others, and utilitarianism./nHadley read for a Bachelor of Arts and doctorate in philosophy at the University of Sydney (USYD).[1] His doctoral thesis was supervised by Caroline West,[2] in USYD's Department of Philosophy, and was submitted in 2006 under the title of Animal Property: Reconciling Ecological Communitarianism and Species-egalitarian Liberalism.[3] During his doctoral research, the \"basic elements\" of his animal property rights theory were \"first assembled\",[2] leading to the publication of \"Nonhuman Animal Property: Reconciling Environmentalism and Animal Rights\" in the Journal of Social Philosophy.[4] During this time, he also published in the Journal of Value Inquiry,[5] Philosophy in the Contemporary World,[6] and the Journal of Applied Philosophy,[7] as well as working as a lecturer in the USYD philosophy department and a guest lecturer for the USYD Laboratory Animal Services.[1]/nAfter his PhD, Hadley worked as a lecturer in communication ethics in the Charles Sturt University (CSU) School of Communication and a lecturer in philosophy at the CSU School of Humanities and Social Sciences.[8] He then joined the University of Western Sydney School of Humanities and Communication Arts, first as a lecturer in philosophy,[8] and then as a senior lecturer in philosophy.[1] Animal Ethics and Philosophy: Questioning the Orthodoxy, a collection edited by Hadley with the Finnish philosopher Elisa Aaltola, was published in 2015 by Rowman & Littlefield International. The book aimed to move debate in animal ethics beyond developing extensionist accounts and to examine the metaphilosophical and metaethical problems with extensionist accounts.[9] Hadley's own contribution drew attention to a perceived inconsistent triad in animal rights philosophy: the idea that moral status is determined by psychological factors (like sentience), and not species; that human and nonhuman animals are of the same kind; and that genomic plasticity offers the best explanation for change in natural selection.[10] In the same year, Hadley published a monograph with Lexington Books entitled Animal Property Rights: A Theory of Territory Rights for Wild Animals. The book, partially building upon his doctoral research, presents a large amount of new material on Hadley's animal property rights theory.[2] A second monograph, Animal Neopragmatism, was published in 2019 by Palgrave Macmillan. This presented a neopragmatist approach to animal ethics.[11]/nHadley is known for his theory of animal property rights, according to which animals should be afforded property rights over their territory.[12][13][14][15][16] Hadley has developed his theory of animal property rights through his doctoral research,[17] his 2015 monograph,[18] and other academic works.[4][19] In addition, he has authored popular articles on the subject for The Guardian,[20] The Conversation[21] and The Ethics Centre.[22] He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan.[23] His proposal has received attention in the popular press, with strong criticism from farmers' groups and journalists writing on rural affairs.[24]/nThe practical side of Hadley's proposal rests on two key principles: a guardianship system, according to which knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, and the use of animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property.[25] Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation,[26] and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified.[19] First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory.[4][19][27] Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments.[19][28] Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism,[29] and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.[4][28]/nHadley's proposal has been placed in the context of the \"political turn\" in animal ethics; the emergence of animal ethics literature focused on justice.[14][15] Another academic who has proposed that wild animals be afforded property rights over their habitats is the British philosopher Steve Cooke. Like Hadley, he utilises an interest-based account of animal rights, but, unlike Hadley, he suggests that sovereignty would be an appropriate tool to protect animals' interest in their habitat if property fails.[13][19] Other theorists exploring the normative aspects of human relationships with wild animals explicitly deny that they are extending property rights to animals. The US-based ethicist Clare Palmer, for instance, argues for a duty to respect wild animals' space, but claims that arguing for a property right for these animals would be \"difficult\", and instead bases her account on the fact that human actions can make animals \"painful, miserable and vulnerable\".[30]/nThe Canadian theorists Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka are critical of Hadley's proposal to extend property rights to animals, claiming that property rights are insufficient to protect animals' interests.[31] Instead, they argue that animals should be considered sovereign over their territories.[32] They write that/nIt is one thing to say that a bird has a property right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den \u2013 specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory \u2013 animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird's nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It's not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.[31]/nThey also compare the possibility of extending property rights to animals to the approach of European colonists, who were prepared to extend property, but not sovereignty, rights to native peoples, resulting in oppression.[33] Hadley, however, is himself critical of Donaldson and Kymlicka's sovereignty proposal,[34] though the British philosopher Josh Milburn suggests that the proposals may not be as far apart as the authors indicate.[16]/nThe British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane also questions the extension of property rights to animals in his Animal Rights Without Liberation. Though describing Hadley's proposal as \"ingenious\",[35] he criticises it on two grounds. First, he questions Hadley's claim of a relationship between property and basic needs, and, second, denies that animal property rights would appease environmentalists, given that they would allow the destruction of environments which do not contain sentient animals.[36] However, in his Sentientist Politics, Cochrane includes animal property rights as part of his critique of Donaldson and Kymlicka's sovereignty model, writing that it \"seems perfectly possible to argue, as John Hadley and others have, that wild animals ought to be granted habitat or property rights over their territories\".[37] In a book review, Milburn stresses the significance of Hadley's theory, but questions the extent to which the implementation of animal property rights would be desirable without the achievement of other animal rights and the extent to which Hadley's account is genuinely about property rights.[15]/nHaving published a number of papers critical of the metaethical and metaphilosophical stances of mainstream animal ethicists in the 2010s,[10][38][39][40] in 2019, Hadley published Animal Neopragmatism.[11] In the book, Hadley sets out a neopragmatist approach to animal ethics. This theory responds to both the \"political problem of welfare\" and the \"philosophical problem of welfare\". The former is a perceived difficulty with the democratic legitimacy of animal welfare law, given that folk understanding of welfare stretches beyond the measurable suffering with which a policy approach is concerned. The latter is that, given metatheoretical assumptions of contemporary animal ethicists (especially moral realism), any attempt to extend discussion of welfare beyond feelings is met with the accusation that the subject is being changed:[41] hence Hadley's earlier exploration of the \"changing the subject problem\".[40] In response to these problems, Hadley outlines his vision of \"relational hedonism\", according to which a concern for the pain of animals underlies a broader concern that extends beyond a narrow sense of animal welfare, and endorses both experiential pluralism (welfare can be affected by things other than pleasure and pain) and expressivism.[42] The theory of \"animal neopragmatism\", Hadley argues, is able to overcome metalevel problems in mainstream animal rights theory.[43][10]/nHadley has considered the ethics of humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues that there is a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired.[7] He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments,[44] and has elsewhere explored libertarian theory's denial of moral powers (including the power to acquire property) to animals.[45]/nHadley has conducted research on animal rights extremism, concluding that the phenomenon is a complex one, and that a full understanding of individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism.[46] He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.[47]/nWith O'Sullivan, Hadley has conducted research on utilitarianism and the relationship between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals,[48] and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.[49]/nHadley has been critical of the views of Tibor Machan[5] and J. Baird Callicott.[50] He has also written on J. M. Coetzee,[51] the ethics of \"disenhancing\" animals,[52] the ethics of animal testing,[53] the relationship of self-defence theory to abortion and animal ethics,[39] and the ethics of street photography.[54]", "3997685": "Stewart Shapiro (/\u0283\u0259\u02c8p\u026a\u0259ro\u028a/; born 1951) is O'Donnell Professor of Philosophy at the Ohio State University and distinguished visiting professor at the University of Connecticut.

In his youth he attended a Talmudic school in Germany for a short time, but instead of confining his studies to the Talmud, he took up philosophy and other sciences also, in spite of the interdiction of his teachers. Duran became a tutor in the Crescas family, and during the bloody riots of 1391 was forcibly baptized, becoming a marrano./nAfter escaping Spain, he returned to practicing Judaism openly, and wrote a number of works including polemics against Christianity and grammar. He appears to have also attempted to reach Palestine, however it is unclear whether he made it. He died in 1414/1415 in Iberia, France, or the East.[1][2][3][4]/nDuran is the author of a famous satiric epistle called, after the repeatedly recurring phrase, Al Tehi Ka-Aboteka (Be Not Like Your Fathers). It was written about 1396, and was circulated by Don Me\u00efr Alguades, to whom it had been sent. It is so ingeniously ambiguous that the Christians, who called it Alteca Boteca, interpreted it in their favor; but, as soon as they recognized its satirical import they burned it publicly. This epistle, with a commentary by Joseph ibn Shem-Tov and an introduction by Isaac Akrish, was first printed at Constantinople in 1554, and was republished in A. Geiger's Melo Chofnajim, 1840, in the collection \u1e32obe\u1e93 Wikku\u1e25im, 1844, and in P. Heilpern's Eben Bo\u1e25an, part 2, 1846. Geiger also translated most of it into German (Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift, iv. 451)./nAccording to an account written at the top of one of the manuscripts of the epistle, Duran and his friend David Bonet Bonjourno made up a plan to emigrate to Palestine in order to return to Judaism. The two friends set out on their journey, getting as far as Avignon, where they met up with another converso, Paul of Burgos (who had become a believing Christian priest, and had achieved the rank of Bishop).  Paul disrupted their plan[citation needed] by persuading Bonjourno to become a true Christian, and Duran was forced to return to Catalonia.  In response to these events, Duran wrote Be Not Like Your Fathers./nSome scholars (Frank Talmage, among others[citation needed]) have dismissed this fanciful account as implausible.  However, there is a certain amount of corroborating evidence.  The notarial ledgers of Perpignan show several transactions in 1393 and 1394 in which Duran (known officially by his Christian name Honoratus de Bonafe) moved assets across the border to France.  Also, Paul of Burgos is documented to have been in Avignon in 1394 for the conclave in which the Antipope Clement VII was elected./nConnected with this epistle is the polemic Kelimmat ha-Goyim (\"Shame of the Gentiles\"), a criticism of Christian dogmas, written in 1397 at the request of Don Hasdai Crescas, to whom it was dedicated.[5]  In it, Duran states the principle that the most convincing polemical technique is to argue within one's opponents own assumptions.  Using the knowledge of Latin he gained from his medical studies and the indoctrination he received as a converso, he identifies what he sees as internal contradictions within the New Testament, and discrepancies between its literal text and church dogma.  The work can be seen as a precursor of modern textual criticism. In about 1397 Duran wrote an anti-Christian polemic, Kelimat ha-Goyim (\u201cShame of the Gentiles\u201d) which some have seen as having discredited the Gospels and other early Christian writings. Although he did not accept the defence used by Nachmanides at the Disputation of Barcelona (1263) of \"two Jesuses\" in the Talmud.[6] He argued that the old Spanish word for pigs, Marrano [see too: Marranos], was derived from the Hebrew word for conversion, hamarah./nIn 1395 Duran compiled an almanac in twenty-nine sections entitled \u1e24esheb ha-Efod (\"The ephod's girdle\"), and dedicated to Moses Zarzal, writer and physician to Henry III of Castile (1379\u20131406). That Duran was familiar with the philosophy of Aristotle as interpreted by Muslim philosophers, is apparent from his synoptic commentary on Maimonides' The Guide for the Perplexed, which was published at Sabbionetta in 1553, at Je\u00dfnitz in 1742, and at Zhovkva in 1860./nDuran's chief work, praised by both Christians and Jews, is his philosophical and critical Hebrew grammar, Ma'aseh Efod (\"The making of the ephod\"), containing an introduction and thirty-three chapters, and finished in 1403. He wrote it not only to instruct his contemporaries, who either knew nothing about grammar or had erroneous notions concerning it, but especially to refute mistakes promulgated by the later grammarians. He frequently cites the otherwise unknown Samuel Benveniste as an eminent grammarian. See the edition of J. Friedl\u00e4nder and J. Kohn (Vienna, 1865). In 1393 Duran wrote a dirge on Abraham ben Isaac ha-Levi of Gerona, probably a relative; three letters containing responsa, to his pupil Me\u00efr Crescas; and two exegetical treatises on several chapters of II Samuel, all of which have been edited as an appendix to the Ma'aseh Efod./nIn the introduction, he discusses music, contrasting two varieties, cantillation (ta'amei ha-miqra) and post-Biblical hymns (piyyutim). He states that while the latter appeals to the senses, the former appeals to the mind. He prefers cantillation, following his belief that the Torah is perfect, and uses it for both liturgical reading and study.[7]/nAt the request of some members of the Benveniste family, Duran wrote an explanation of a religious festival poem by Abraham ibn Ezra (printed in the collection Ta'am Ze\u1e33enim of Eliezer Ashkenazi), as well as the solution of Ibn Ezra's well-known riddle on the quiescent letters of the Hebrew alphabet (quoted by Immanuel Benvenuto in his grammar Liwyat \u1e24en, Mantua, 1557, without mentioning Duran), and several explanations relating to Ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch./nDuran was also a historian. In a lost work entitled Zikron ha-Shemadot he gave the history of Jewish martyrs since the destruction of the Temple. Heinrich Graetz has shown that this work was used by Solomon Usque and Judah ibn Verga./nThis article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Singer, Isidore; et\u00a0al., eds.

He is a leading member of New Confucianism,[1] a philosophical movement initiated by Xu's teacher and friend, Xiong Shili. Other important members of the New Confucian Movement include Xu's two friends and professorial colleagues who also studied with Xiong Shili: Mou Zongsan and Tang Junyi./nXu was born in 1902 or 1903[2] in a family of farmers and scholars in Hubei Province, China. Hsu's father taught at a private school established for village children who showed academic promise and could sit the imperial examinations to become scholar officials. In his teen-age years, Xu made his way to the provincial capital Wuhan which was then the cultural center where foreign influences and trends abounded. Wuhan was also an important staging area for the 1911 Republican Revolution that ended China's 2000-year-old imperial rule. Xu spent fifteen years with the Nationalist army attaining the rank of senior colonel. Trusted by Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, Xu was sent to Yan'an to discuss Nationalist and Communist cooperation against the invading Japanese. In Yan'an, Xu met senior Communist officials including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. After leaving the army, Xu then took various teaching positions, published a scholarly magazine, and then involved himself in politics, working as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek until 1946. He then devoted himself to \"the study of books\" (editing academic papers) on the island of Taiwan where the Nationalists had retreated in 1949. Between 1955 and 1969, he taught in the Chinese Department of Tunghai University. Because the university had no philosophy department, Xu welcomed students interested in philosophy into the Chinese Department. Many of these students, such as Tu Weiming, rose to academic prominence. Xu also taught at the New Asia Research Institute in Hong Kong[3] and helped found New Asia Middle School.[4]/nXu was a prolific writer and thinker and his collected works run to several volumes. While in both Taiwan and Hong Kong, Xu wrote frequently for newspapers. Xu was the driving force behind the 1958 manifesto on Chinese Culture that is viewed by many scholars as a crowning achievement of New Confucianism. Regarding this manifesto, Xinzhong Yao states:\n\"The first effort in reviving Confucianism in the 1950s was a document drawn up by Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, Zhang Junmai and Xu Fuguan and published on the first day of 1958, entitled 'A Declaration of Chinese Culture to the Scholars of the World' (wei zhongguo wenhua jinggao shijie renshi xuanyan \u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u656c\u544a\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u58eb\u5ba3\u8a00). The declaration restates the authors' concerns about the direction of human development, the value of Chinese culture, and urges Western and Chinese scholars to understand Chinese culture, claiming that without a proper understanding of Chinese culture, the perception of China will be distorted and the Chinese will have no future.\"[5]/nXu died in Hong Kong in 1982./nXu believes that the emphasis of moral self-cultivation in Confucianism is the manifestation of Chinese humanistic spirit.  According to Xu, the basic attribute of Chinese tradition is its origin in anxiety (youhuan yishi), whereas the beginning of Western tradition is in curiosity.  Although Xu claims that every civilization first begins with the fear of deities, he also believes that the essence of a civilization then diverges its focus into different core values based on the development of distinctive emotions. The sense of anxiety leads Chinese tradition to value self-discovery and moral virtue rather  the pursuit of knowledge in the external world.[6]  Respectively, Xu provides the examples of ancient Greek culture pursuing knowledge as a leisure activity leading to the development of science and technology, while people in the Zhou dynasty stresses on self-reliance and autonomy of oneself and thus leading to the creation of virtue based moral systems:/n\"During the Zhou Dynasty (1459-249 BC), the preoccupation with earthly matters had started: the spirit of self-conscience was beginning to work and those people developed clear will and purpose.  They were moving progressively from the realm of religion to the realm of ethics.  Since that early stage, the Chinese people were free from metaphysical concerns. Unlike the Greeks, who at the same critical stage in history moved from religion to metaphysics, the Chinese moved from religion to ethics.\"[7]/nXu defines the sense of anxiety as feeling responsible in overcoming difficulties by one's own efforts.[6]  Xu further explains this concept as being concerned of the responsibility for improving one's own moral quality to achieve autonomy and freedom.[8]  In contrast to religion, rather than placing one's dependency and sense of responsibility to a deity, ancient Chinese culture stresses on the cultivation of one's heart mind and developing self-reliance, and as a result, developed their own ethical and moral systems.[7]/nThe attainment of the sense of anxiety in ancient Chinese culture transform itself from a culture of religion in Shang Dynasty to a humanistic society in Zhou Dynasty.[6]  First, Xu points out that the extrication of religion begin when ancient Chinese people gradually discovered that human virtue and human efforts superseded spiritual beings or deities.  Specifically, Xu provides the example that people used to believe in supporting every ruler as being appointed by the ultimate authority of the Mandate of Heaven.[8]  However, as people of Zhou became anxious of certain unjust rulers who are not in accord with the will of the people, they declared that the Mandate of Heaven can be passed down to a more suitable ruler with superior and defining moral characteristics.  As a result, people developed responsibility to the problems occurring in their own society and they developed self-dependency.  Thus, ancient Chinese virtues that stresses on the importance of regulating society and human relations such as jing (reverence), li (rules of propriety), and ren (human heartedness, mutuality) as a means to focus on real world issues by creating self-existing moral laws.[8]/nSimilar to Mencius, Xu believes that the nature of all human being is good and one can realize their own good nature through \u201cbodily recognition\u201d (tiren)--or gongfu in Neo-Confucianism terminology.  \u201cBodily recognition\u201d is a retrospective process in which the subject discover moral subjectivity by bringing one's experiences to their heart mind and see whether they are able to take the feelings or ideas at ease or not.[6]  Although this might suggest a hedonistic approach for discovering one's own moral subjectivity, Xu maintains that \u201cbodily recognition\u201d involves the use of reflective reasoning and the reduction of sensual desires.  Xu follows Mencius's distinction between a great man (junzi) and a small man (xiaoren) in the sense that a great man relies on his heartmind rather than simply relying on one's own senses in perceiving the world.[9]  However, Xu also stresses that one must engage in a \u201ctracing-back bodily experiencing\u201d (zhui tiyan) process to achieve moral perfection and character transformation.[6]  He provides an example of this process in reinterpretation books, chapters sentences, and words.  Ultimately, Xu believes that through \u201ctracing-back bodily experiencing,\u201d one is able to attain moral perfection and greater autonomy./nXu asserts that technique is associated with beauty.  Through the learning and mastery of technique, one is able to achieve the realm of artistic creativity, or in which one is experiencing dao.[10] Specifically, Xu examined early Chinese aesthetic implication of Zhuangzi and thus believed that perfection of art is essential in dissolving sensual desires and allowing subjectivity to emerge.[6]  Xu analyzes the story of Cook Ding (Guo Xiang) in Zhuangzi's recession and highlights how Cook Ding not only cuts up an ox with ease and in \u201cperfect rhythm,\u201d but he also derives enjoyment and contentment from it.  Xu claims that this state of satisfaction is the learning technique of the dao, where perception and thinking ceases and the spirit of the movement freely moves wherever it wants.[6]/nHowever, to achieve this state of satisfaction, Xu affirms that one must first engage in \u201cfast the mind\u201d or \u201csit in forgetfulness\u201d (jingzuo) to get rid of the constraints in one's cravings or one's sense of \u201cusefulness.\u201d  An instance of this is shown when Xu expressed disdain for \u201cdark, ugly, and chaotic\u201d of Dada art, as he disagreed with the way they expressed anger.[11]  Thus, similarly, Xu compares this notion of technique in Zhuangzi to gongfu or \u201cbodily recognition,\u201d in which one gains greater autonomy by overcoming sensual desires and allowing one's own subjectivity to emerge./nXu makes a two-fold argument for the relationship between Confucianism and democracy: Confucianism by nature has elements of liberal democracy ideas and it has the possibility of enhancing a liberal democracy society.[12]  First, he draws Mencius\u2019 core idea of \u201cthe people as foundation\u201d to claim that Confucianism stresses on the importance of human dignity and equality.  In this sense, Confucianism inherently has some elements of liberal democracy ideas.  In addition, Xu urges that one should not mistaken Confucianism as being more consistent with despotism due to the long history of Confucian imperial rule, and instead, one should view it as being unable to develop due to historical factors.  Specifically, Xu claims that the emergence of autocracy in the Qin Dynasty inhibited the development of democracy in China and the value of the people.[13]  Second, Xu maintains that democracy should indeed have the rule of law, protection of freedom, and the importance of elections, and at the same time, be infused with the idea of \u201crule by virtue\u201d in Confucianism.  However, he believes that rules and laws should not function as consequences or punishment in coercing people to be more morally good, rather they should function as rituals in shaping a person's character.[12]  An issue Xu points out in modern liberal democracy societies is the exploitation of laws in attaining one's selfish gains.  Although Xu does seem to stress on the importance in the role of the government for shaping people's character, he also believes that government should be more limited in interfering with morality, as he states that moral subjectivity is secondary and cannot replace the \u201cprimary value,\u201d or the value of human life.[12]", "14188542": "Barry Stroud (/stra\u028ad/; 18 May 1935 \u2013 9 August 2019) was a Canadian philosopher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1958, he was appointed a research professor at the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes scientifiques (IH\u00c9S) and remained there until 1970, when, driven by personal and political convictions, he left following a dispute over military funding. He received the Fields Medal in 1966 for advances in algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and K-theory.[12] He later became professor at the University of Montpellier[1] and, while still producing relevant mathematical work, he withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political and religious pursuits (first Buddhism and later, a more Catholic Christian vision).[13] In 1991, he moved to the French village of Lasserre in the Pyrenees, where he lived in seclusion, still working on mathematics and his philosophical and religious thoughts until his death in 2014.[14]/nGrothendieck was born in Berlin to anarchist parents. His father, Alexander \"Sascha\" Schapiro (also known as Alexander Tanaroff), had Hasidic Jewish roots and had been imprisoned in Russia before moving to Germany in 1922, while his mother, Johanna \"Hanka\" Grothendieck, came from a Protestant German family in Hamburg and worked as a journalist.[a] As teenagers, both of his parents had broken away from their early backgrounds.[16] At the time of his birth, Grothendieck's mother was married to the journalist Johannes Raddatz and initially, his birth name was recorded as \"Alexander Raddatz.\" That marriage was dissolved in 1929 and Schapiro acknowledged his paternity, but never married Hanka Grothendieck.[16] Grothendieck had a maternal sibling, his half sister Maidi./nGrothendieck lived with his parents in Berlin until the end of 1933, when his father moved to Paris to evade Nazism. His mother followed soon thereafter. Grothendieck was left in the care of Wilhelm Heydorn, a Lutheran pastor and teacher in Hamburg.[17][18] According to Winfried Scharlau, during this time, his parents took part in the Spanish Civil War as non-combatant auxiliaries. [19][20] However, others state that Schapiro fought in the anarchist militia.[21]/nIn May 1939, Grothendieck was put on a train in Hamburg for France. Shortly afterward his father was interned in Le Vernet.[22] He and his mother were then interned in various camps from 1940 to 1942 as \"undesirable dangerous foreigners.\"[23] The first camp was the Rieucros Camp, where his mother contracted the tuberculosis that would eventually cause her death in 1957. While there, Grothendieck managed to attend the local school, at Mendel. Once, he managed to escape from the camp, intending to assassinate Hitler.[22] Later, his mother Hanka was transferred to the Gurs internment camp for the remainder of World War II.[22] Grothendieck was permitted to live separated from his mother.[24]/nIn the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, he was sheltered and hidden in local boarding houses or pensions, although he occasionally had to seek refuge in the woods during Nazi raids, surviving at times without food or water for several days.[22][24]/nHis father was arrested under the Vichy anti-Jewish legislation, and sent to the Drancy internment camp, and then handed over by the French Vichy government to the Germans to be sent to be murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942.[8][25]/nIn Le Chambon, Grothendieck attended the Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol (now known as the Le Coll\u00e8ge-Lyc\u00e9e C\u00e9venol International), a unique secondary school founded in 1938 by local Protestant pacifists and anti-war activists. Many of the refugee children hidden in Le Chambon attended Coll\u00e8ge C\u00e9venol, and it was at this school that Grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics.[26]/nIn 1990, for risking their lives to rescue Jews, the entire village was recognized as \"Righteous Among the Nations\"./nAfter the war, the young Grothendieck studied mathematics in France, initially at the University of Montpellier where at first he did not perform well, failing such classes as astronomy.[27] Working on his own, he rediscovered the Lebesgue measure. After three years of increasingly independent studies there, he went to continue his studies in Paris in 1948.[17]/nInitially, Grothendieck attended Henri Cartan's Seminar at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high-powered seminar. On the advice of Cartan and Andr\u00e9 Weil, he moved to the University of Nancy where two leading experts were working on Grothendieck's area of interest, topological vector spaces: Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Laurent Schwartz. The latter had recently won a Fields Medal. He showed his new student his latest paper; it ended with a list of 14 open questions, relevant for locally convex spaces. Grothendieck introduced new mathematical methods that enabled him to solve all of these problems within a few months.[28]/nIn Nancy, he wrote his dissertation under those two professors on functional analysis, from 1950 to 1953.[29] At this time he was a leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces.[30] In 1953 he moved to the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, where he immigrated by means of a Nansen passport, given that he had refused to take French nationality (as that would have entailed military service against his convictions). He stayed in S\u00e3o Paulo (apart from a lengthy visit in France from October 1953 - March 1954) until the end of 1954. His published work from the time spent in Brazil is still in the theory of topological vector spaces; it is there that he completed his last major work on that topic (on \"metric\" theory of Banach spaces)./nGrothendieck moved to Lawrence, Kansas at the beginning of 1955, and there he set his old subject aside in order to work in algebraic topology and homological algebra, and increasingly in algebraic geometry.[31][32] It was in Lawrence that Grothendieck developed his theory of Abelian categories and the reformulation of sheaf cohomology based on them, leading to the very influential \"T\u00f4hoku paper\".[33]/nIn 1957 he was invited to visit Harvard by Oscar Zariski, but the offer fell through when he refused to sign a pledge promising not to work to overthrow the United States government\u2014a refusal which, he was warned, threatened to land him in prison. The prospect of prison did not worry him, so long as he could have access to books.[34]/nComparing Grothendieck during his Nancy years to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure-trained students at that time  (Pierre Samuel, Roger Godement, Ren\u00e9 Thom, Jacques Dixmier, Jean Cerf, Yvonne Bruhat, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Bernard Malgrange), Leila Schneps said:/nHe was so completely unknown to this group and to their professors, came from such a deprived and chaotic background, and was, compared to them, so ignorant at the start of his research career, that his fulgurating ascent to sudden stardom is all the more incredible; quite unique in the history of mathematics.[35]/nHis first works on topological vector spaces in 1953 have been successfully applied to physics and computer science, culminating in a relation between Grothendieck inequality and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox in quantum physics.[36]/nIn 1958, Grothendieck was installed at the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes scientifiques (IH\u00c9S), a new privately funded research institute that, in effect, had been created for Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Grothendieck.[3] Grothendieck attracted attention by an intense and highly productive activity of seminars there (de facto working groups drafting into foundational work some of the ablest French and other mathematicians of the younger generation).[17] Grothendieck practically ceased publication of papers through the conventional, learned journal route. He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for approximately a decade, gathering a strong school.[37]/nOfficially during this time, he had as students Michel Demazure (who worked on SGA3, on group schemes), Luc Illusie (cotangent complex), Michel Raynaud, Jean-Louis Verdier (co-founder of the derived category theory), and Pierre Deligne. Collaborators on the SGA projects also included Michael Artin (\u00e9tale cohomology), Nick Katz (monodromy theory, and Lefschetz pencils). Jean Giraud worked out torsor theory extensions of nonabelian cohomology there as well. Many others such as David Mumford, Robin Hartshorne, Barry Mazur and C.P. Ramanujam were also involved./nAlexander Grothendieck's work during what is described as the \"Golden Age\" period at the IH\u00c9S established several unifying themes in algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, category theory, and complex analysis.[29] His first (pre-IH\u00c9S) discovery in algebraic geometry was the Grothendieck\u2013Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, a generalisation of the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced K-theory. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians, he introduced the theory of schemes, developing it in detail in his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (EGA) and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time.[17] He went on to introduce the \u00e9tale cohomology theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the Weil conjectures, as well as crystalline cohomology and algebraic de Rham cohomology to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated topos theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in categorical logic). He also provided, by means of a categorical Galois theory, an algebraic definition of fundamental groups of schemes giving birth to the now famous \u00c9tale fundamental group and he then conjectured the existence a further generalization of it, which is now known as the fundamental group scheme. As a framework for his coherent duality theory, he also introduced derived categories, which were further developed by Verdier.[38]/nThe results of his work on these and other topics were published in the EGA and in less polished form in the notes of the S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (SGA) that he directed at the IH\u00c9S.[17]/nGrothendieck's political views were radical and pacifistic. He strongly opposed both United States intervention in Vietnam and Soviet military expansionism. To protest against the Vietnam War, he gave lectures on category theory in the forests surrounding Hanoi while the city was being bombed.[39] In 1966, he had declined to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Moscow, where he was to receive the Fields Medal.[7] He retired from scientific life around 1970 after he had found out that IH\u00c9S was partly funded by the military.[40] He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the University of Montpellier./nWhile the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IH\u00c9S, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran more deeply. Pierre Cartier, a visiteur de longue dur\u00e9e (\"long-term guest\") at the IH\u00c9S, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the IH\u00c9S's fortieth anniversary.[41] In that publication, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find Bures-sur-Yvette as \"une cage dor\u00e9e\" (\"a gilded cage\"). While Grothendieck was at the IH\u00c9S, opposition to the Vietnam War was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world.[3] In addition, after several years at the IH\u00c9S, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. David Ruelle, a physicist who joined the IH\u00c9S faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about physics.[b] Biology interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.[41]/nIn 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, Claude Chevalley and Pierre Samuel, created a political group entitled Survivre\u2014the name later changed to Survivre et vivre. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues. It also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.[42] Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.[1]/nAlthough Grothendieck continued with mathematical enquiries, his standard mathematical career mostly ended when he left the IH\u00c9S.[8] After leaving the IH\u00c9S, Grothendieck became a temporary professor at Coll\u00e8ge de France for two years.[42] He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the CNRS.[1]/nWhile not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content./nProduced during 1980 and 1981, La Longue Marche \u00e0 travers la th\u00e9orie de Galois (The Long March Through Galois Theory) is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the Esquisse d'un programme.[43] It also includes a study of Teichm\u00fcller theory./nIn 1983, stimulated by correspondence with Ronald Brown and Tim Porter at Bangor University, Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript entitled Pursuing Stacks. It began with a letter addressed to Daniel Quillen. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see External links below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between algebraic homotopy theory and algebraic geometry and prospects for a noncommutative theory of stacks. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, Les D\u00e9rivateurs. Written in 1991, this latter opus of approximately 2000 pages, further developed the homotopical ideas begun in Pursuing Stacks.[7] Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development during the mid-1990s of the motivic homotopy theory of Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky./nIn 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal Esquisse d'un Programme (\"Sketch of a Programme\")[43] for a position at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the moduli space of complex curves. Although Grothendieck never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians to work in the area by becoming the source of dessin d'enfant theory and Anabelian geometry. Later, it was published in two-volumes and entitled Geometric Galois Actions (Cambridge University Press, 1997)./nDuring this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on Bertini-type theorems (EGA\u00a0V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992\u20131993 and later made available on the Grothendieck Circle web site in 2004)./nIn the 1,000-page autobiographical manuscript, R\u00e9coltes et semailles (1986), Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner, but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status. He complains about what he saw as the \"burial\" of his work and betrayal by his former students and colleagues after he had left the community.[17] The R\u00e9coltes et semailles work is now available on the internet in the French original,[44] and an English translation is underway. A Japanese translation of the whole book in four volumes was completed by Tsuji Yuichi (1938\u20132002), a friend of Grothendieck from the Survivre period. The first three volumes (corresponding to Parts 0 to III of the book) were published between 1989 and 1993, while the fourth volume (Part IV) was completed and, although unpublished, copies of it as a typed manuscript are circulated. Grothendieck helped with the translation and wrote a preface for it, in which he called Tsuji his \"first true collaborator\".[45][46][47][48][49][50] Parts of R\u00e9coltes et semailles have been translated into Spanish,[51] as well as into a Russian translation that was published in Moscow.[52] The French original was finally published in two volumes in January 2022, with additional texts by people of various professions who discuss certain aspects of the book.[53]/nIn 1988, Grothendieck declined the Crafoord Prize with an open letter to the media. He wrote that he and other established mathematicians had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community that was characterized by outright scientific theft that he believed had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views were \"in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy's aims in the administration of its funds\" and he added, \"I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy.\"[54]/nLa Clef des Songes,[55] a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck's account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that a deity exists.[56] As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and the work of 18 \"mutants\", people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age.[1] The only mathematician on his list was Bernhard Riemann.[57] Influenced by the Catholic mystic Marthe Robin who was claimed to have survived on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988.[1] His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter entitled Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle sent to 250 friends in January 1990. In it, he described his encounters with a deity and announced that a \"New Age\" would commence on 14 October 1996.[7]/nThe Grothendieck Festschrift, published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.[58]/nMore than 20,000 pages of Grothendieck's mathematical and other writings are held at the University of Montpellier and remain unpublished.[59] They have been digitized for preservation and are freely available in open access through the Institut Montpelli\u00e9rain Alexander Grothendieck portal.[60][61]/nIn 1991, Grothendieck moved to a new address that he did not share with his previous contacts in the mathematical community.[1] Very few people visited him afterward.[62] Local villagers helped sustain him with a more varied diet after he tried to live on a staple of dandelion soup.[63] At some point, Leila Schneps and Pierre Lochak located him, then carried on a brief correspondence. Thus they became among \"the last members of the mathematical establishment to come into contact with him\".[64] After his death, it was revealed that he lived alone in a house in Lasserre, Ari\u00e8ge, a small village at the foot of the Pyrenees.[65]/nIn January 2010, Grothendieck wrote the letter entitled \"D\u00e9claration d'intention de non-publication\" to Luc Illusie, claiming that all materials published in his absence had been published without his permission. He asked that none of his work be reproduced in whole or in part and that copies of this work be removed from libraries.[66] He characterized a website devoted to his work as \"an abomination\".[67] His dictate may have been reversed in 2010.[68]/nOn 13 November 2014, aged 86, Grothendieck died in the hospital of Saint-Girons, Ari\u00e8ge.[26][69]/nGrothendieck was born in Weimar Germany. In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war. Thus, he became a stateless person for at least the majority of his working life and he traveled on a Nansen passport.[4][5][6] Part of his reluctance to hold French nationality is attributed to not wishing to serve in the French military, particularly due to the Algerian War (1954\u201362).[3][6][15] He eventually applied for French citizenship in the early 1980s, after he was well past the age that exempted him from military service.[3]/nGrothendieck was very close to his mother to whom he dedicated his dissertation. She died in 1957 from the tuberculosis that she contracted in camps for displaced persons.[42]/nHe had five children: a son with his landlady during his time in Nancy;[3] three children, Johanna (1959), Alexander (1961), and Mathieu (1965) with his wife Mireille Dufour;[1][34] and one child with Justine Skalba, with whom he lived in a commune in the early 1970s.[1]/nGrothendieck's early mathematical work was in functional analysis. Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at Nancy, supervised by Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Laurent Schwartz. His key contributions include topological tensor products of topological vector spaces, the theory of nuclear spaces as foundational for Schwartz distributions, and the application of Lp spaces in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had become a leading authority on this area of functional analysis\u2014to the extent that Dieudonn\u00e9 compares his impact in this field to that of Banach.[70]/nIt is, however, in algebraic geometry and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From approximately 1955 he started to work on sheaf theory and homological algebra, producing the influential \"T\u00f4hoku paper\" (Sur quelques points d'alg\u00e8bre homologique, published in the Tohoku Mathematical Journal in 1957) where he introduced abelian categories and applied their theory to show that sheaf cohomology may be defined as certain derived functors in this context.[17]/nHomological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by Jean-Pierre Serre[71] and others, after sheaves had been defined by Jean Leray. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to his relative point of view (pairs of varieties related by a morphism), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems.[42] The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the higher direct images of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space./nIn 1956, he applied the same thinking to the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, which recently had been generalized to any dimension by Hirzebruch. The Grothendieck\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem was announced by Grothendieck at the initial Mathematische Arbeitstagung in Bonn, in 1957.[42] It appeared in print in a paper written by Armand Borel with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. Grothendieck went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which at the time were in a state of flux and under discussion in Claude Chevalley's seminar. He outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians./nHis foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed generic points, which led to the theory of schemes. Grothendieck also pioneered the systematic use of nilpotents. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry infinitesimal information, in purely algebraic settings. His theory of schemes has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as its technical depth. In that setting one can use birational geometry, techniques from number theory, Galois theory, commutative algebra, and close analogues of the methods of algebraic topology, all in an integrated way.[17][72][73]/nGrothendieck is noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation.[37] Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the learned journal, circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal. His influence spilled over into many other branches of mathematics, for example the contemporary theory of D-modules. Although lauded as \"the Einstein of mathematics\", his work also provoked adverse reactions, with many mathematicians seeking out more concrete areas and problems.[74][75]/nThe bulk of Grothendieck's published work is collected in the monumental, yet incomplete, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (EGA) and S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (SGA). The collection, Fondements de la G\u00e9ometrie Alg\u00e9brique (FGA), which gathers together talks given in the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, also contains important material.[17]/nGrothendieck's work includes the invention of the \u00e9tale and l-adic cohomology theories, which explain an observation made by Andr\u00e9 Weil that argued for a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties.[42] For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a finite field reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the complex numbers. Weil had realized that to prove such a connection, one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to accomplish this until such a theory was expressed by Grothendieck./nThis program culminated in the proofs of the Weil conjectures, the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student Pierre Deligne in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.[17]/nIn Grothendieck's retrospective R\u00e9coltes et Semailles, he identified twelve of his contributions that he believed qualified as \"great ideas\".[76] In chronological order, they are:/nHere the term yoga denotes a kind of \"meta-theory\" that may be used heuristically; Michel Raynaud writes the other terms \"Ariadne's thread\" and \"philosophy\" as effective equivalents.[77]/nGrothendieck wrote that, of these themes, the largest in scope was topoi, as they synthesized algebraic geometry, topology, and arithmetic. The theme that had been most extensively developed was schemes, which were the framework \"par excellence\" for eight of the other themes (all but 1, 5, and 12). Grothendieck wrote that the first and last themes, topological tensor products and regular configurations, were of more modest size than the others. Topological tensor products had played the role of a tool rather than of a source of inspiration for further developments; but he expected that regular configurations could not be exhausted within the lifetime of a mathematician who devoted oneself to it. He believed that the deepest themes were motives, anabelian geometry, and Galois\u2013Teichm\u00fcller theory.[78]/nGrothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the twentieth century.[11] In an obituary David Mumford and John Tate wrote:/nAlthough mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves\u2013and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.[11]/nBy the 1970s, Grothendieck's work was seen as influential, not only in algebraic geometry and the allied fields of sheaf theory and homological algebra,[79] but influenced logic, in the field of categorical logic.[80]/nGrothendieck approached algebraic geometry by clarifying the foundations of the field, and by developing mathematical tools intended to prove a number of notable conjectures. Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as algebraic curves and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of ring theory. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined, is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic./nGrothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces (\"spectra\") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end, he developed the theory of schemes that informally can be thought of as topological spaces on which a commutative ring is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.[81]/nHis generalization of the classical Riemann\u2013Roch theorem related topological properties of complex algebraic curves to their algebraic structure and now bears his name, being called \"the Grothendieck\u2013Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch theorem\". The tools he developed to prove this theorem started the study of algebraic and topological K-theory, which explores the topological properties of objects by associating them with rings.[82] After direct contact with Grothendieck's ideas at the Bonn Arbeitstagung, topological K-theory was founded by Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch.[83]/nGrothendieck's construction of new cohomology theories, which use algebraic techniques to study topological objects, has influenced the development of algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, and representation theory. As part of this project, his creation of topos theory, a category-theoretic generalization of point-set topology, has influenced the fields of set theory and mathematical logic.[79]/nThe Weil conjectures were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in arithmetic geometry. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called local zeta functions, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension.  Grothendieck's discovery of the \u2113-adic \u00e9tale cohomology, the first example of a Weil cohomology theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student Pierre Deligne.[82] Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a \"visionary program\".[84] The \u2113-adic cohomology then became a fundamental tool for number theorists, with applications to the Langlands program.[85]/nGrothendieck's conjectural theory of motives was intended to be the \"\u2113-adic\" theory but without the choice of \"\u2113\", a prime number. It did not provide the intended route to the Weil conjectures, but has been behind modern developments in algebraic K-theory, motivic homotopy theory, and motivic integration.[86] This theory, Daniel Quillen's work, and Grothendieck's theory of Chern classes, are considered the background to the theory of algebraic cobordism, another algebraic analogue of topological ideas.[87]/nGrothendieck's emphasis on the role of universal properties across varied mathematical structures brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems.[88] His notion of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra.[89] The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, although unintentional.[90]/nThe novel Colonel L\u00e1grimas (Colonel Tears in English, available by Restless Books) by Puerto Rican\u2013Costa Rican writer Carlos Fonseca is a semibiographic novel about Grothendieck.[91]/nThe band Stone Hill All Stars have a song named after Alexander Grothendieck.[92]/nIn the novel When We Cease to Understand the World, Benjamin Labatut dedicates one chapter to the story of Grothendieck.[93]/nIn the novel The Passenger and its sequel Stella Maris by Cormac McCarthy, one of the main characters is a student of Grothendieck.

He earned universal recognition and, in 1771, when the Russian Academy of Sciences affiliated new members, Lexell was admitted as an Astronomy academician, he also became a member of the Academy of Stockholm and Academy of Uppsala in 1773 and 1774, and became a corresponding member of the Paris Royal Academy of Sciences./nIn 1775, the Swedish King appointed Lexell to a chair of the mathematics department at the University of \u00c5bo with permission to stay at St. Petersburg for another three years to finish his work there; this permission was later prolonged for two more years. Hence, in 1780, Lexell was supposed to leave St. Petersburg and return to Sweden, which would have been a great loss for the Russian Academy of Sciences. Therefore, Director Domashnev proposed that Lexell travel to Germany, England, and France and then to return to St. Petersburg via Sweden. Lexell made the trip and, to the Academy's pleasure, got a discharge from the Swedish King and returned to St. Petersburg in 1781, after more than a year of absence, very satisfied with his trip./nSending academicians abroad was quite rare at that time (as opposed to the early years of the Russian Academy of Sciences), so Lexell willingly agreed to make the trip. He was instructed to write his itinerary, which without changes was signed by Domashnev. The aims were as follows: since Lexell would visit major observatories on his way, he should learn how they were built, note the number and types of scientific instruments used, and if he found something new and interesting he should buy the plans and design drawings. He should also learn everything about cartography and try to get new geographic, hydrographic, military, and mineralogic maps. He should also write letters to the Academy regularly to report interesting news on science, arts, and literature.[4]/nLexell departed St. Petersburg in late July 1780 on a sailing ship and via Swinem\u00fcnde arrived in Berlin, where he stayed for a month and travelled to Potsdam, seeking in vain for an audience with King Frederick II. In September he left for Bavaria, visiting Leipzig, G\u00f6ttingen, and Mannheim. In October he traveled to Stra\u00dfbourg and then to Paris, where he spent the winter. In March 1781 he moved to London. In August he left London for Belgium, where he visited Flanders and Brabant, then moved to the Netherlands, visited The Hague, Amsterdam, and Saardam, and then returned to Germany in September. He visited Hamburg and then boarded a ship in Kiel to sail to Sweden; he spent three days in Kopenhagen on the way. In Sweden he spent time in his native city \u00c5bo, and also visited Stockholm, Uppsala, and \u00c5land. In early December 1781 Lexell returned to St. Petersburg, after having travelled for almost a year and a half./nThere are 28 letters in the archive of the academy that Lexell wrote during the trip to Johann Euler, while the official reports that Euler wrote to the Director of the academy, Domashnev, were lost. However, unofficial letters to Johann Euler often contain detailed descriptions of places and people whom Lexell had met, and his impressions.[5]/nLexell became very attached to Leonhard Euler, who lost his sight in his last years but continued working using his elder son Johann Euler to read for him. Lexell helped Leonhard Euler greatly, especially in applying mathematics to physics and astronomy. He helped Euler to write calculations and prepare papers. On 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, during a conversation with Lexell about the newly discovered Uranus and its orbit, Euler felt sick. He died a few hours later.[3]/nAfter Euler's passing, Academy Director, Princess Dashkova, appointed Lexell in 1783 Euler's successor. Lexell became a corresponding member of the Turin Royal Academy, and the London Board of Longitude put him on the list of scientists receiving its proceedings./nLexell did not enjoy his position for long: he died on 30 November 1784./nLexell is mainly known for his works in astronomy and celestial mechanics, but he also worked in almost all areas of mathematics: algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus, geometry, analytic geometry, trigonometry, and continuum mechanics. Being a mathematician and working on the main problems of mathematics, he never missed the opportunity to look into specific problems in applied science, allowing for experimental proof of theory underlying the physical phenomenon. In 16 years of his work at the Russian Academy of Sciences, he published 62 works, and 4 more with coauthors, among whom are Leonhard Euler, Johann Euler, Wolfgang Ludwig Krafft, Stephan Rumovski, and Christian Mayer.[5]/nWhen applying for a position at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Lexell submitted a paper called \"Method of analysing some differential equations, illustrated with examples\",[6] which was highly praised by Leonhard Euler in 1768. Lexell's method is as follows: for a given nonlinear differential equation (e.g. second order) we pick an intermediate integral\u2014a first-order differential equation with undefined coefficients and exponents. After differentiating this intermediate integral we compare it with the original equation and get the equations for the coefficients and exponents of the intermediate integral. After we express the undetermined coefficients via the known coefficients we substitute them in the intermediate integral and get two particular solutions of the original equation. Subtracting one particular solution from another we get rid of the differentials and get a general solution, which we analyse at various values of constants. The method of reducing the order of the differential equation was known at that time, but in another form. Lexell's method was significant because it was applicable to a broad range of linear differential equations with constant coefficients that were important for physics applications. In the same year, Lexell published another article \"On integrating the differential equation andny + ban-1dm-1ydx + can-2dm-2ydx2 + ... + rydxn = Xdxn\"[7] presenting a general highly algorithmic method of solving higher order linear differential equations with constant coefficients./nLexell also looked for criteria of integrability of differential equations. He tried to find criteria for the whole differential equations and also for separate differentials. In 1770 he derived a criterion for integrating differential function, proved it for any number of items, and found the integrability criteria for \n\n\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nV\nd\nx\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle dx\\int {Vdx}}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nV\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle dx\\int {dx\\int {Vdx}}}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nd\nx\n\u222b\n\nV\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle dx\\int {dx\\int {dx\\int {Vdx}}}}\n\n. His results agreed with those of Leonhard Euler but were more general and were derived without the means of calculus of variations. At Euler's request, in 1772 Lexell communicated these results to Lagrange[8] and Lambert.[9]/nConcurrently with Euler, Lexell worked on expanding the integrating factor method to higher order differential equations. He developed the method of integrating differential equations with two or three variables by means of the integrating factor. He stated that his method could be expanded for the case of four variables: \"The formulas will be more complicated, while the problems leading to such equations are rare in analysis\".[10]/nAlso of interest is the integration of differential equations  in Lexell's paper \"On reducing integral formulas to rectification of ellipses and hyperbolae\",[11] which discusses elliptic integrals and their classification, and in his paper \"Integrating one differential formula with logarithms and circular functions\",[12] which was reprinted in the transactions of the Swedish Academy of Sciences. He also integrated a few complicated differential equations in his papers on continuum mechanics, including a four-order partial differential equation in a paper about coiling a flexible plate to a circular ring.[13]/nThere is an unpublished Lexell paper in the archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences with the title \"Methods of integration of some differential equations\", in which a complete solution of the equation \n\n\n\nx\n=\ny\n\u03d5\n(\n\nx\n\u2032\n\n)\n+\n\u03c8\n(\n\nx\n\u2032\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x=y\\phi (x')+\\psi (x')}\n\n, now known as the Lagrange\u2013d'Alembert equation\u00a0[ru], is presented.[14]/nPolygonometry was a significant part of Lexell's work. He used the trigonometric approach using the advance in trigonometry made mainly by Euler and presented a general method of solving simple polygons in two articles \"On solving rectilinear polygons\".[15] Lexell discussed two separate groups of problems: the first had the polygon defined by its sides and angles, the second with its diagonals and angles between diagonals and sides. For the problems of the first group Lexell derived two general formulas giving \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n equations allowing to solve a polygon with \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n sides. Using these theorems he derived explicit formulas for triangles and tetragons and also gave formulas for pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons. He also presented a classification of problems for tetragons, pentagons, and hexagons. For the second group of problems, Lexell showed that their solutions can be reduced to a few general rules and presented a classification of these problems, solving the corresponding combinatorial problems. In the second article he applied his general method for specific tetragons and showed how to apply his method to a polygon with any number of sides, taking a pentagon as an example./nThe successor of Lexell's trigonometric approach (as opposed to a coordinate approach) was Swiss mathematician L'Huilier. Both L'Huilier and Lexell emphasized the importance of polygonometry for theoretical and practical applications./nLexell's first work at the Russian Academy of Sciences was to analyse data collected from the observation of the 1769 transit of Venus. He published four papers in \"Novi Commentarii Academia Petropolitanae\" and ended his work with a monograph on determining the parallax of the Sun, published in 1772.[16]/nLexell aided Euler in finishing his Lunar theory, and was credited as a co-author in Euler's 1772 \"Theoria motuum Lunae\".[17]/nAfter that, Lexell spent most of his effort on comet astronomy (though his first paper on calculating the orbit of a comet is dated 1770). In the next ten years he calculated the orbits of all the newly discovered comets, among them the comet which Charles Messier discovered in 1770. Lexell calculated its orbit, showed that the comet had had a much larger perihelion before the encounter with Jupiter in 1767 and predicted that after encountering Jupiter again in 1779 it would be altogether expelled from the inner Solar System. This comet was later named Lexell's Comet./nLexell also was the first to calculate the orbit of Uranus and to actually prove that it was a planet rather than a comet.[18] He made preliminary calculations while travelling in Europe in 1781 based on Hershel's and Maskelyne's observations. Having returned to Russia, he estimated the orbit more precisely based on new observations, but due to the long orbital period it was still not enough data to prove that the orbit was not parabolic. Lexell then found the record of a star observed in 1759 by Christian Mayer in Pisces that was neither in the Flamsteed catalogues nor in the sky by the time Bode sought it. Lexell presumed that it was an earlier sighting of the same astronomical object and using this data he calculated the exact orbit, which proved to be elliptical, and proved that the new object was actually a planet. In addition to calculating the parameters of the orbit Lexell also estimated the planet's size more precisely than his contemporaries using Mars that was in the vicinity of the new planet at that time. Lexell also noticed that the orbit of Uranus was being perturbed. He then stated that, based on his data on various comets, the size of the Solar System can be 100 AU or even more, and that it could be other planets there that perturb the orbit of Uranus (although the position of the eventual Neptune was not calculated until much later by Urbain Le Verrier).", "648527": "Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky (Russian: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, IPA: [n\u02b2ik\u0250\u02c8laj \u026a\u02c8van\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 l\u0259b\u0250\u02c8t\u0255\u025bfsk\u02b2\u026aj] \u24d8; 1 December\u00a0[O.S. 20 November]\u00a01792 \u2013 24 February\u00a0[O.S. 12 February]\u00a01856) was a Russian mathematician and geometer, known primarily for his work on hyperbolic geometry, otherwise known as Lobachevskian geometry, and also for his fundamental study on  Dirichlet integrals, known as the Lobachevsky integral formula./nWilliam Kingdon Clifford called Lobachevsky the \"Copernicus of Geometry\" due to the revolutionary character of his work.[f][g]/nNikolai Lobachevsky was born either in or near the city of Nizhny Novgorod in the Russian Empire (now in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia) in 1792 to parents of Russian and Polish origin \u2013 Ivan Maksimovich Lobachevsky and Praskovia Alexandrovna Lobachevskaya.[11][12][h] He was one of three children. When he was seven, his father, a clerk in a land-surveying office, died, and Nikolai moved with his mother to Kazan. Nikolai Lobachevsky attended Kazan Gymnasium from 1802, graduating in 1807, and then received a scholarship to Kazan University,[11][12] which had been founded just three years earlier in 1804./nAt Kazan University, Lobachevsky was influenced by professor Johann Christian Martin Bartels, a former teacher and friend of the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855).[11] Lobachevsky received a Master of Science in physics and mathematics in 1811. In 1814 he became a lecturer at Kazan University, in 1816 he was promoted to associate professor. In 1822, at the age of 30, he became a full professor,[11][12] teaching mathematics, physics, and astronomy.[12] He served in many administrative positions and became the rector of Kazan University[11] in 1827. In 1832, he married Varvara Alexeyevna Moiseyeva. They had a large number of children (eighteen according to his son's memoirs, though only seven apparently survived into adulthood). He was dismissed from the university in 1846, ostensibly due to his deteriorating health: by the early 1850s, he was nearly blind and unable to walk. He died in poverty in 1856 and was buried in Arskoe Cemetery, Kazan./nIn 1811, in his student days, Lobachevsky was accused by a vengeful supervisor of atheism\n(Russian: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0436\u0438\u044f, lit.\u2009'signs of godlessness').[14][15][16][17]/nLobachevsky's main achievement is the development (independently from J\u00e1nos Bolyai) of a non-Euclidean geometry,[12] also referred to as Lobachevskian geometry. Before him, mathematicians were trying to deduce Euclid's fifth postulate from other axioms. Euclid's fifth is a rule in Euclidean geometry which states (in John Playfair's reformulation) that for any given line and point not on the line, there is only one line through the point not intersecting the given line. Lobachevsky would instead develop a geometry in which the fifth postulate was not true. This idea was first reported on February 23 (Feb. 11, O.S.), 1826 to the session of the department of physics and mathematics, and this research was printed in the periodical 'Kazan University Course Notes' as On the Origin of Geometry (\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0438) between 1829 and 1830. In 1829 Lobachevsky wrote a paper about his ideas called \"A Concise Outline of the Foundations of Geometry\" that was published by the Kazan Messenger but was rejected when it was submitted to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences for publication./nThe non-Euclidean geometry that Lobachevsky developed is referred to as hyperbolic geometry. Lobachevsky replaced Playfair's axiom with the statement that for any given point there exists more than one line that can be extended through that point and run parallel to another line of which that point is not part. He developed the angle of parallelism which depends on the distance the point is off the given line. In hyperbolic geometry the sum of angles in a hyperbolic triangle must be less than 180 degrees.  Non-Euclidean geometry stimulated the development of differential geometry which has many applications. Hyperbolic geometry is frequently referred to as \"Lobachevskian geometry\" or \"Bolyai\u2013Lobachevskian geometry\"./nSome mathematicians and historians have wrongly claimed that Lobachevsky in his studies in non-Euclidean geometry was influenced by Gauss, which is untrue. Gauss himself appreciated Lobachevsky's published works highly, but they never had personal correspondence between them prior to the publication. Although three people\u2014Gauss, Lobachevsky and Bolyai\u2014can be credited with discovery of hyperbolic geometry, Gauss never published his ideas, and Lobachevsky was the first to present his views to the world mathematical community.[18]/nLobachevsky's magnum opus Geometriya was completed in 1823, but was not published in its exact original form until 1909, long after he had died. Lobachevsky was also the author of New Foundations of Geometry (1835\u20131838). He also wrote Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels (1840)[19] and Pangeometry (1855).[20][i]/nAnother of Lobachevsky's achievements was developing a method for the approximation of the roots of algebraic equations. This method is now known as the Dandelin\u2013Gr\u00e4ffe method, named after two other mathematicians who discovered it independently. In Russia, it is called the Lobachevsky method. Lobachevsky gave the definition of a function as a correspondence between two sets of real numbers (Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet gave the same definition independently soon after Lobachevsky)./nE. T. Bell wrote about Lobachevsky's influence on the following development of mathematics in his 1937 book Men of Mathematics:[22]/nThe boldness of his challenge and its successful outcome have inspired mathematicians and scientists in general to challenge other \"axioms\" or accepted \"truths\", for example the \"law\" of causality which, for centuries, have seemed as necessary to straight thinking as Euclid's postulate appeared until Lobachevsky discarded it. The full impact of the Lobachevskian method of challenging axioms has probably yet to be felt. It is no exaggeration to call Lobachevsky the Copernicus of Geometry, for geometry is only a part of the vaster domain which he renovated; it might even be just to designate him as a Copernicus of all thought./nLobachevsky is the subject of songwriter/mathematician Tom Lehrer's humorous song \"Lobachevsky\" from his 1953 Songs by Tom Lehrer album.  In the song, Lehrer portrays a Russian mathematician who sings about how Lobachevsky influenced him: \"And who made me a big success / and brought me wealth and fame? / Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name.\"  Lobachevsky's secret to mathematical success is given as \"Plagiarize!\", as long as one is always careful to \"call it, please, research\".  According to Lehrer, the song is \"not intended as a slur on [Lobachevsky's] character\" and the name was chosen \"solely for prosodic reasons\".[23]/nIn Poul Anderson's 1969 fantasy novella \"Operation Changeling\" \u2013 which was later expanded into the novel Operation Chaos (1971) \u2013 a group of sorcerers navigate a non-Euclidean universe with the assistance of the ghosts of Lobachevsky and Bolyai./nRoger Zelazny's science fiction novel Doorways in the Sand contains a poem dedicated to Lobachevsky.", "3210629": "Jim Hoffman is a conspiracy theorist from Oakland, California, who created several web sites about the September 11, 2001 attacks that analyze and suggest alternative accounts for the events of that day.

Sierpi\u0144ski was awarded a gold medal for his essay, thus laying the foundation for his first major mathematical contribution. Unwilling for his work to be published in Russian, he withheld it until 1907, when it was published in Samuel Dickstein's mathematical magazine 'Prace Matematyczno-Fizyczne' (Polish: 'The Works of Mathematics and Physics')./nAfter his graduation in 1904, Sierpi\u0144ski worked as a school teacher of mathematics and physics in Warsaw. However, when the school closed because of a strike, Sierpi\u0144ski decided to go to Krak\u00f3w to pursue a doctorate. At the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, he attended lectures by Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba on mathematics. He also studied astronomy and philosophy. In 1908, he received his doctorate and was appointed to the University of Lw\u00f3w. In 1910, he became head of the Faculty of Mathematics at the university.[3]/nIn 1907 Sierpi\u0144ski first became interested in set theory when he came across a theorem which stated that points in the plane could be specified with a single coordinate. He wrote to Tadeusz Banachiewicz (then at G\u00f6ttingen), asking how such a result was possible. He received the one-word reply 'Cantor'. Sierpi\u0144ski began to study set theory and, in 1909, he gave the first ever lecture course devoted entirely to the subject.[3]/nSierpi\u0144ski maintained an output of research papers and books. During the years 1908 to 1914, when he taught at the University of Lw\u00f3w, he published three books in addition to many research papers. These books were  The Theory of Irrational Numbers (1910), Outline of Set Theory (1912), and The Theory of Numbers (1912)./nWhen World War I began in 1914, Sierpi\u0144ski and his family were in Russia. To avoid the persecution that was common for Polish foreigners, Sierpi\u0144ski spent the rest of the war years in Moscow working with Nikolai Luzin. Together they began the study of analytic sets.

In set theory he made contributions on the axiom of choice and on the continuum hypothesis. He proved that Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory together with the Generalized continuum hypothesis imply the Axiom of choice. He also worked on what is now known as the Sierpi\u0144ski curve.
