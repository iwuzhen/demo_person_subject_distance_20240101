His surname is variously romanized as Ljapunov, Liapunov, Liapounoff or Ljapunow. He was the son of the astronomer Mikhail Lyapunov and the brother of the pianist and composer Sergei Lyapunov./nLyapunov is known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system, as well as for his many contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory./nLyapunov was born in Yaroslavl, Russian Empire. His father Mikhail Vasilyevich Lyapunov (1820\u20131868) was an astronomer employed by the Demidov Lyceum. His brother, Sergei Lyapunov, was a gifted composer and pianist. In 1863, M. V. Lyapunov retired from his scientific career and relocated his family to his wife's estate at Bolobonov, in the Simbirsk province (now Ulyanovsk Oblast). After the death of his father in 1868, Aleksandr Lyapunov was educated by his uncle R. M. Sechenov, brother of the physiologist Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov. At his uncle's family, Lyapunov studied with his distant cousin Natalia Rafailovna, who became his wife in 1886. In 1870, his mother moved with her sons to Nizhny Novgorod, where he started the third class of the gymnasium. He graduated from the gymnasium with distinction in 1876.[1]/nIn 1876, Lyapunov entered the Physico-Mathematical department at the University of Saint Petersburg, but after one month he transferred to the Mathematics department of the university./nAmong the Saint Petersburg mathematics professors were Chebyshev and his students Aleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin and Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. Lyapunov wrote his first independent scientific works under the guidance of the professor of mechanics, D. K. Bobylev. In 1880 Lyapunov received a gold medal for a work on hydrostatics. This was the basis for his first published scientific works On the equilibrium of a heavy body in a heavy fluid contained in a vessel of a fixed form and On the potential of hydrostatic pressure. Lyapunov also completed his university course in 1880, two years after Andrey Markov who had also graduated at Saint Petersburg University. Lyapunov maintained scientific contact with Markov throughout his life./nA major theme in Lyapunov's research was the stability of a rotating fluid mass with possible astronomical application. This subject was proposed to Lyapunov by Chebyshev as a topic for his masters thesis which he submitted in 1884 with the title On the stability of ellipsoidal forms of rotating fluids./nIn 1885, Lyapunov became privatdozent and was proposed to accept the chair of mechanics at Kharkiv University, where he went the same year. About the initial stay at Kharkiv, Smirnov writes in his biography of Lyapunov:/nHere at first, the research activity of Lyapunov was cut short. It was necessary to work out courses and put together notes for students, which took up much time.[1]/nHis student and collaborator, Vladimir Steklov, recalled his first lecture in the following way: \"A handsome young man, almost of the age of the other students, came before the audience, where there was also the old Dean, professor Levakovsky, who was respected by all students. After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems. This subject was already known to the students from the lectures of professor Delarue. But what Lyapunov taught us was new to me and I had never seen this material in any textbook. All antipathy to the course was immediately blown to dust. From that day students would show Lyapunov a special respect.\"[1]/nThe main contribution was published in the celebrated  monograph  'A.M. Lyapunov, The general problem of the stability of motion. 1892. Kharkiv Mathematical Society, Kharkiv, 251p. (in Russian)'.[2] This led on to his 1892 doctoral thesis The general problem of the stability of motion.[3] The thesis was defended in Moscow University on 12 September 1892, with Nikolai Zhukovsky and V. B. Mlodzeevski as opponents. In 1908, the Kharkiv edition was translated to French and republished by the University of Toulouse: 'Probleme General de la Stabilite du Mouvement, Par M.A. Liapounoff. Traduit du russe par M.Edouard Davaux'./nLyapunov returned to Saint Petersburg in 1902, after being elected acting member of the Academy of Science as well as ordinary professor in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the university. The position had been left vacant by the death of his former teacher, Chebyshev. Not having any teaching obligations, this allowed Lyapunov to focus on his studies and in particular he was able to bring to a conclusion the work on the problem of Chebyshev with which he started his scientific career./nIn 1908, he took part to the Fourth International Mathematical Congress in Rome. He also participated in the publication of Euler's selected works: he was an editor of the volumes 18 and 19.[1]/nBy the end of June 1917, Lyapunov traveled with his wife to his brother's palace in Odessa. Lyapunov's wife was suffering from tuberculosis so they moved in accordance with her doctor's orders. She died on 31 October 1918. The same day, Lyapunov shot himself in the head, and three days later he died.[4] By that time, he was going blind from cataracts.[1]/nLyapunov contributed to several fields, including differential equations, potential theory, dynamical systems and probability theory. His main preoccupations were the stability of equilibria and the motion of mechanical systems, especially rotating fluid masses, and the study of particles under the influence of gravity. His work in the field of mathematical physics regarded the boundary value problem of the equation of Laplace. In the theory of potential, his work from 1897 On some questions connected with Dirichlet's problem clarified several important aspects of the theory. His work in this field is in close connection with the work of Steklov. Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system. In the theory of probability, he generalized the works of Chebyshev and Markov, and proved the Central Limit Theorem under more general conditions than his predecessors. The method of characteristic functions he used for the proof later found widespread use in probability theory.[1]/nLike many mathematicians, Lyapunov preferred to work alone and communicated mainly with few colleagues and close relatives. He usually worked late, four to five hours at night, sometimes the whole night. Once or twice a year he visited the theatre, or went to some concert. He had many students. He was an honorary member of many universities, an honorary member of the academy in Rome and a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris.[1]/nLyapunov's impact was significant, and the following mathematical concepts are named after him:", "37388179": "Frances Hardcastle (13 August 1866 \u2013 26 December 1941) was an English mathematician, in 1894 one of the founding members of the American Mathematical Society.[3] Her work included contributions to the theory of point groups.[4]/nBorn in Writtle, just outside Chelmsford, Essex,[4][5] Hardcastle was a daughter of Henry Hardcastle, a barrister,[6] by his marriage in 1865 to Maria Sophia Herschel,[7] daughter of the astronomer, mathematician, and chemist Sir John Herschel.[4]/nShe was educated at Girton College (Tripos Part I 1891 & Part II 1892), and obtained a Certificate in Mathematics.[4][8]/nIn 1892, she went to the University of Chicago for a year as an honorary fellow, then spent another year at Bryn Mawr College studying under Charlotte Scott.

In 1904 she was given permission to take her Abitur at the Royal Gymnasium in Bad Hersfeld. Thus she belonged to the small elite of young women in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century who were allowed to take the Abitur externally at boys' schools.

In addition, Kahn attended lectures and tutorials in mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and G\u00f6ttingen. At the University of G\u00f6ttingen she attended lectures given by, among others, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Woldemar Voigt, and Georg Elias M\u00fcller; in Berlin she attended lectures by Hermann Amandus Schwarz and Paul Drude at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences. Her field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with L\u00f6benstein she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem.[5] Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. Kahn and L\u00f6benstein developed methods to address this problem./nAgainst opposition in particular from the Berlin faculty, but supported by the University of G\u00f6ttingen and Felix Klein, Kahn obtained a doctorate in 1909 under David Hilbert in G\u00f6ttingen, with a dissertation titled Eine allgemeine Methode zur Untersuchung der Gestalten algebraischer Kurven [A general method to investigate the shapes of algebraic curves] and was therefore one of the first German women to obtain a doctorate in mathematics (the mathematics division was part of the faculty of philosophy then).

He studied and taught philosophy, mathematics, and psychophysics.[1] He published works across a diverse range of subjects including the curative effects of hypnotism.[2]/nJoseph Delboeuf was born in the French speaking town of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.[3] His father, a pewter craftsman, died early in Delboeuf\u2019s life.[3] He studied at the University of Li\u00e8ge, earning his PhD in philosophy in 1855, followed by physics and mathematics in 1858.[4][5]  He received a scholarship from the University of Bonn and continued his postdoctoral research under philosopher and mathematician Friedrich Ueberweg.[3] In 1860, he began teaching Greek at l\u2019Ecole Normale des Humanit\u00e9s de Li\u00e8ge.[3] In 1863, he was given the post of Maitre de Conf\u00e9rences, which he only held for a few months before being appointed Chair of Philosophy at University of Ghent, leaving his research in mathematics.[4][3] There, he met Joseph Plateau, who helped him publish his first two notes on optical illusions in the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Belgium.[5] He then began his research in psychophysics with Gustav Fechner in 1865.[3]/nDelboeuf began his psychophysical experimentation on brightness in 1865 with Gustav Fechner. Delboeuf introduced the concept of sense distance (contraste sensible).[6]/nDelboeuf is known for his description of the Delboeuf illusion in 1893. Many experiments have been performed on this illusion since that time./nAfter completing work on sleep and dreams, Delboeuf started researching magnetism and hypnotism.[7] At the First International Congress on scientific and experimental hypnotism (1889), a motion was put forward to ban non-medical practitioners from using hypnosis.[8] However, Delboeuf argued that a medical degree was not required to practice hypnotism; rather, it should be used freely, yet with caution.[8] Along with a group of magnetizers in Verviers, he argued that hypnotists had specific personal skills that could not be acquired by all doctors.[7] Thus, the clinical technique of hypnotism was proposed as an alternative to traditional medical therapies.[7]/nMost of the work Delboeuf published was on the curative effects of hypnotism. However, his hypotheses were often difficult to test and falsify.[9] To test his hypotheses, he suggested that he would need two identical patients to be treated with different approaches. Instead, he used the symmetry of the opposite sides of the body.[9] He would make two identical lesions on two parts of the body (e.g., arms) and would apply hypnotism to one area while leaving the other alone for nature to act upon.[9] He found that not only can the consequences of pain be avoided from hypnotic suggestion (i.e., no pain experienced), but that over the course of the injury or disease, the actual effects of the operation could be halted over time.[9] Hypnotism's mode of action, concluded Delboeuf, is like pain, in that it \"hypnotizes\" by calling attention to itself.[9] Thus, hypnotic suggestion prevents the effects of pain by withdrawing attention from it./nDelboeuf, with Hippolyte Bernheim in 1885, introduced a new solution to the problem of post hypnotic suggestion.[2] They argued that subjects drifted into a dream-like state in which they became aware of the suggestion and time remaining in this state. Their idea was very similar to a double consciousness theory suggested by Pierre Janet. They highlighted that subjects are unable to remember the suggestion when they wake because the memory is only available in the dream-like or hypnotic state.[2] In other words, they describe the memory being in a \u201cdormant\u201d state that returns during the hypnotic state. Delboeuf argued that the amnesia from waking from hypnotic sleep was similar to that from waking up from regular sleep. We tend not to remember our dreams because we are unable to establish a connection between the waking and dream state. We do, however, tend to remember dreams when we wake up in the middle of a dream because our waking and dreaming state bridge together. Therefore, Delboeuf predicted that subjects should be able to recall their hypnotic sleep if they were awakened in the middle of it. He tested his predictions in an experiment with Marie Wittman, who was awakened in the middle of a hypnotic hallucination and remembered everything. Delboeuf repeated his experiment with other subjects with similar results. His experiments convinced him of the similarity between normal dreams and hypnotic states.[2]/nDuring his time at the University of Bonn, Delboeuf published Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes philosophiques \u00e0 la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1860), disputing his mentor Ueberweg\u2019s concept of Euclidean space and earning the praise of Bertrand Russell.[10] He argued that,\u00a0 in order to use geometry to find the fundamental qualities of \u201cdeterminations of space,\u201d we must first understand the concepts of both \u201cdetermination\u201d and \u201cspace.\u201d In this paper, he independently discovered Euclidean postulate 5.[11] Postulate 5 states that, if a line intersects two straight lines that together form two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than 180 degrees, then the two straight lines must meet on that side.[12]/nDelboeuf first conducted psychophysics experiments at the University of Gand (1855-1866).[13] He primarily worked on Weber's Law (proposed by Fechner):[14]/nS = K logI - Where S is equivalent to the strength of a sensation, I is equivalent to the intensity of an external stimulus, and K is a constant.[14]/nDelboeuf proposed two main changes to Fechner's formula.[13] The first change was related to mathematical aspects.[13]  Delboeuf argued that, in some cases, Fechner's formula would result in negative values for S.[13]  For example if I=0, then S<0.[13]  Delboeuf proposed that, because S did not make sense as a negative value, the formula could not be applicable to all cases.[13] For example, in cases where the strength of a sensation may lead to inability to view an external stimulus (e.g., due to glare),  the formula would not be applicable.[13] To address this issue, Delbeouf added a term to the end of Fechner's equation:[13]/nS = K log [(I+c)/c] - Where c is equivalent to the physiological level of excitation within the senses.[13]/nDelboeuf's second change to Fechner's formula was the addition of a supplementary equation:[13]/nf=log [m/m-I'] - Where f is equivalent to the amount of fatigue from effort of the sense organ, m is equivalent to the amount of available sensitivity, and I is equivalent to the intensity of an external stimulus.[13] This supplementary equation accounted for the amount of change that a sense organ experiences due to the magnitude of excitation from an external stimulus.[13] By adding this equation, Delboeuf was accounting for the effect that sensations have on sense organs.[13]/nDelboeuf investigated the laws of nature and sensation in his paper \"General Theory of Sensitivity.\"[15] Delboeuf proposed that a sensation consists of two aspects: (1) formation of the sensation and (2) how sense organs function.[15] Delboeuf further proposed three laws that can be applied to determine sensation strength:[15]/n1. Law of Degradation: as soon as a sensation occurs, the strength of a sensation begins to degrade.[15]/n2. Law of Intensity: in order for a sensation to increase in strength, it must be stimulated by excitations that are also increasing in magnitude.[15]/n3. Law of Tension: as the strength of a sensation increases, the level of tension also increases.[15] Tension is associated with unpleasantness, pain, fatigue and even the destruction of the sensation itself.[15]/nDelboeuf started researching perception after meeting Joseph Plateau (1801-1883), a physicist known for his work on vision.[5] After this encounter, Delboeuf changed his focus from Fechnerian psychophysics to the psychology of perception.[5] His first work on illusions was a discussion of Zollner's Pseudoscopy (1865) in which he proposes a theory that all optical illusions could be explained by the muscular strength and structure of the eye.[5] He went on to publish a work on Optico-Geometric Illusions, in which he reinforces his proposed theory.[5] These works led Delboeuf to develop an experiment on an optico-geometric illusion that later became known as the Delboeuf illusion (1865).[5] This illusion is based on the idea that stimuli can be perceived as larger or smaller based on their illumination and surroundings.[16] Delboeuf is well known for his work on this illusion.[5] Later in his career, he published an explanation of the Muller-Lyer Illusion in terms of eye movements instead of the mis-estimation of angles theory Brentano had published.[5] Many studies have been conducted on the Delboeuf illusion (1865) since the publication of his original study, and many explanations for this illusion have been put forth.[5]", "491426": "Sir Thomas Muir CMG FRS FRSE[1] (25 August 1844 \u2013 21 March 1934) was a Scottish mathematician, remembered as an authority on determinants.[2][3][4]/nHe was born in Stonebyres in South Lanarkshire, and brought up in the small town of Biggar.

Diaconis is often cited for the simplified proposition that it takes seven shuffles to randomize a deck.  More precisely, Diaconis showed that, in the Gilbert\u2013Shannon\u2013Reeds model of how likely it is that a riffle results in a particular riffle shuffle permutation, it takes 5 riffles before the total variation distance of a 52-card deck begins to drop significantly from the maximum value of 1.0, and 7 riffles before it drops below 0.5 very quickly (a threshold phenomenon), after which it is reduced by a factor of 2 every shuffle.

He is generally regarded as one of the most important scientific figures of the Enlightenment in Spain.  As a military officer, he undertook sensitive diplomatic missions for the Spanish crown and contributed to the modernization and professionalization of the Spanish Navy.  In his lifetime, he came to be known as el sabio espa\u00f1ol (\"the Spanish savant\").  His career as a public servant constitutes an important chapter in the Bourbon Reforms of the 18th century./nAs a young naval lieutenant, Juan participated in the French Geodesic Mission to the Equator of 1735\u20131744, which established definitively that the shape of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, flattened at the poles, as predicted in Isaac Newton's Principia.  With his fellow lieutenant Antonio de Ulloa, Juan travelled widely in the territories of the Viceroyalty of Peru and made detailed scientific, military, and political observations of the region.  They also helped to organize the defense of the Peruvian coast against the English squadron of Commodore Anson, after the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739./nAfter returning to Spain in 1746, Juan became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and collaborator of Zen\u00f3n de Somodevilla, 1st Marquess of Ensenada, a leading minister under King Ferdinand VI.  Under Ensenada's orders, Juan undertook an eighteen-month mission of industrial espionage in London, after which he worked tirelessly to modernize and professionalize naval architecture and other operations in Spain.  Juan's influence declined somewhat after Ensenada fell from power in 1754.  In 1760 Juan was appointed as Squadron Commander, the most senior officer in the Spanish Navy, but ill health soon forced him to give up that role and instead take up diplomatic and educational missions./nAs a mathematician and educator, Juan promoted the study and application of the infinitesimal calculus at a time when the subject was not taught in Spanish universities.  He served as ambassador plenipotentiary to the Sultan of Morocco in 1766\u20131767, and as director of the Seminary of Nobles of Madrid from 1770 until his death in 1773./nJorge Juan was born of two distinguished hidalgo families: his father was don Bernardo Juan y Canicia, a relative of the Counts of Pe\u00f1alba, while his mother was do\u00f1a Violante Santacilia y Soler de Cornell\u00e1, who came from a prominent land-owning family in Elche. Both of his parents were widowed and had several children from their respective first marriages. Jorge Juan was born in a home in the estate El Fondonet (also known as El Hond\u00f3n, in Castilian), owned by his grandfather don Cipriano Juan Vergara and located in Novelda, a town in the province of Alicante. He was baptised in the church of the neighboring town of Monforte del Cid.  The family lived in a home on the Plaza del Mar in the city of Alicante and vacationed in Novelda./nAs a younger son, Jorge was not expected to inherit his father's estate.  His family therefore intended him for a career in the military or the church, as was customary for younger sons of noble families.  In fact, Jorge had been baptized in the parish of Monforte, rather than that of Novelda (his actual place of birth) in order to render him eligible for a benefice attached to the Collegiate Church of Saint Nicholas, in Alicante, should he eventually pursue an ecclesiastical career.  His paternal uncle Antonio Juan was a canon of that church./nHis father Bernardo died when Jorge was only two years old.[1]  Jorge received his first education at the Jesuit school in Alicante, under the supervision of his uncle, the priest Antonio Juan.  Another of Jorge's paternal uncles, Cipriano Juan, was the bailiff of Caspe in the Order of Malta (also known as the \"Order of Saint John\", or the \"Knights Hospitaller\").  Cipriano eventually took charge of the education of the young Jorge, sending him to study grammar in Zaragoza as preparation for higher education./nThrough Cipriano's influence, Jorge was admitted to the Order of Malta at the age of twelve.  This required him to show that all four of his grandparents were of noble birth, by proving their armigerous status and \"purity of blood\".  The young Jorge Juan then traveled to the island of Malta to serve as page to Grand Master Ant\u00f3nio Manoel de Vilhena./n\"Hospitaller Malta\" was at that time a vassal state of the Kingdom of Sicily, ruled by Habsburg emperor Charles VI.  Juan stayed in Malta for nearly four years.  There he took religious vows as a Knight of Saint John, which imposed upon him the requirement of lifelong celibacy.  He took the first steps in his naval career by sailing in warships of the Order's navy.  In 1729, at the age of sixteen, Juan received from the Grand Master the title of Commander of Aliaga (Comendador de Aliaga), a rank that he held for the rest of his life and which provided him with a benefice./nJuan then returned to Spain and applied for admission to the Royal Company of Marine Guards, the Spanish naval academy, located in the port city of C\u00e1diz.  He entered the academy in 1730 and proceeded to study modern technical and scientific studies subjects such as geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, navigation, hydrography, and cartography. He also completed his education in the humanities with lessons in drawing, music, and dancing. He earned a reputation as a brilliant student and his fellow students nicknamed him \"Euclid\"./nAs a naval cadet (guardia marina), Juan participated in the successful expedition against Oran.  He finished his studies at the academy in 1734 and took part in the Battle of Bitonto against the Austrians in the Kingdom of Naples.  Juan remained in the service of the Spanish Navy (the Armada) for the rest of his life./nIn light of the long-running debate between Cartesians and Newtonians over the figure of the Earth, the French Academy of Sciences decided to sponsor two geodesic expeditions: one to measure the arc length corresponding to one degree of latitude near the equator, and the other to carry out a similar measurement near the Arctic circle.  The only feasible location for the equatorial expedition was in the territory of the Audiencia of Quito, in what is now the country of Ecuador.  At the time, this was part of the Viceroyalty of Peru under the Spanish Crown./nIn 1734, King Philip V of Spain agreed to allow the French expedition to carry out its work in Quito, under the condition that the French scientists should be joined by two Spanish naval officers capable of understanding and collaborating with the scientific work involved.  Upon the recommendation of his First Secretary of State Jos\u00e9 Pati\u00f1o, Philip appointed to that role Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa, who were then 21 and 18 years old, respectively.  The two were promoted to the rank of naval lieutenant (teniente de nav\u00edo) so that they would have the appropriate seniority for the mission.[2]/nThe equatorial expedition was led by three members of the French Academy of Sciences: the astronomer Louis Godin, and geographers Charles Marie de La Condamine and Pierre Bouguer.  Their collaborators included the physician and naturalist Joseph de Jussieu and the engineer Jean-Joseph Verguin.[3]  On 26 May 1735, Juan and Ulloa left C\u00e1diz in the company of the Marquess of Villagarc\u00eda, who had been appointed as the new Viceroy of Peru.  They met the French scientists at the Caribbean port of Cartagena de Indias, on the mainland of South America.  They then sailed together to Portobelo, crossed the Isthmus of Panama, and proceeded by boat to the Pacific port of Guayaquil.  Juan and Ulloa then traveled inland with Godin, reaching the city of Quito in May of 1736./nThe Arctic expedition was led by Pierre Louis Maupertuis and carried out its measurements in 1736\u20131737 in a part of Lapland that belonged at the time to the Kingdom of Sweden.  Meanwhile, the mission to the equator, which had been organized first, proved much more challenging and took almost ten years to complete.  Its members had to contend with the harsh climate and topography of the region, the prevalence of tropical diseases, and the suspicions of the local population and authorities./nThe geodesic work around the equator finally began in September 1736 with the measurement of the distance between two base points chosen to lie on the plain of Yaruqu\u00ed, outside the city of Quito.  Those points then served as baseline for the triangulation with which the members of the mission measured an arc of about three degrees of latitude that extended to the south, past Riobamba and up to an endpoint near the city of Cuenca./nIn 1737, a personal dispute between Ulloa and the new president of the Audiencia de Quito, Joseph de Araujo y R\u00edo, caused Araujo to order the arrest of both Ulloa and Juan, while announcing his intention to have them killed.[4] The young officers took refuge in a church and Ulloa then escaped through the cordon of Araujo's men, reaching Lima and obtaining the protection of the Viceroy.[4]   In 1739 surgeon Jean Seniergues, one of the French members of the mission, was killed by a mob in the bullring in Cuenca.[2]/nAfter the War of Jenkins' Ear broke out between Spain and Great Britain in 1739, Juan and Ulloa were called upon to help organize the defense of the Peruvian coast.[4] Commodore Anson had set out in from England in September of 1740 with orders to sail around Cape Horn and then attack Spanish ships and settlements along the Pacific coast.  Anson successfully circumnavigated the globe in 1740\u20131744, but in Peru his only significant action was the attack against the town of Paita, which was plundered and burned in November 1741.  Their military responsibilities due to the war with Britain kept Juan and Ulloa from scientific work for long periods and further delayed the completion of the geodesic measurements./nLa Condamine was eager to mark the two base points of the triangulation with permanent monuments.  In 1740 he began to erect these, each in the form a pyramid above a square base.  This initiative, however, soon led to a dispute between the French and Spanish scientists.  One source of contention was the inclusion of an ornament in the shape of a fleur-de-lis (the traditional symbol of the French monarchy) at the apex of the pyramid.  Juan and Ulloa also objected to the proposed inscription, which named only the three scientists who were members of the French Academy of Sciences: Godin, Bouger, and La Condamine.  The young Spanish officers then rejected La Condamine's offer to list their names as \"assistants\" or \"auxiliaries\", leading to protracted lawsuits in the Spanish courts that were not resolved before all of the members of the mission had returned to Europe.[5]  The corregidor of Cuzco, Diego de Esquivel y Navia, wrote to La Condamine in 1742 that/nThe legal papers presented in this case would much more appropriately be given to Moli\u00e8re for one of his comedies than presented before a judicial tribunal.[5]/nDespite this dispute, La Condamine continued to express high regard for the skills of the two Spanish officers and for their contribution to the mission.  All of the topographical and astronomical measurements were concluded towards the end of 1742, and by March 1743 the members of the mission agreed on the result that they had been seeking: one degree of latitude around the equator corresponded to an arc length of 56,753 toises.[2]  Together with the work of the Arctic expedition led by Maupertuis and with geodesic measurements carried out in France, this established unequivocally that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, i.e. flattened at the poles, as Newton had predicted.  During the mission, Juan also successfully used a barometer to measure the heights of several of the peaks of the Andes, based on the formulas developed for that purpose by Edme Mariotte and Edmond Halley.[1]/nAt the end of 1744, Juan and Ulloa embarked for Europe on two different French ships, each carrying their own copies of their scientific and other papers, in order to minimize the risk that their work would be lost in the homeward journey.  At the time, Great Britain was at war with both France and Spain, and Ulloa's ship was captured by the British Navy.  Initially held as a prisoner of war in Portsmouth, Ulloa's scientific work attracted the attention of the new First Lord of the Admiralty, the Duke of Bedford.  Bedford allowed Ulloa to travel to London, where Ulloa was elected as fellow of the Royal Society.  Thank to the intervention of the President of the Royal Society, Martin Folkes, Ulloa was eventually allowed to continue on to Spain./nJuan, for his part, landed safely in Brest on October 1745.  Juan then travelled to Paris, where his contribution to the Geodesic Mission was rewarded by election as corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences.  Juan finally arrived in Spain at the start of 1746, a few months ahead of Ulloa.[1]  They were both promoted to the rank of frigate captain (capit\u00e1n de fragata)./nJuan and Ulloa jointly published several works based on their South American observations.  Juan, who was the more mathematically inclined of the two, was largely responsible for writing the Astronomical and Physical Observations Made by Order of His Majesty in the Kingdoms of Peru, which contained his calculations of the figure of the Earth.  The publication of the book was held up by the Spanish Inquisition because Juan worked within the framework of the heliocentric cosmology, which the Catholic church still officially regarded as heretical after the condemnation of Galileo more than a century earlier.[1]  The Inquisition allowed the publication of the book to proceed in 1748, after Juan modified the text to present heliocentrism as a hypothesis adopted for purposes of calculation./nUlloa, for his part, wrote most of the four volumes of the Historical Report of the Voyage to Southern America, which also appeared in 1748.  Both authors collaborated in the composition of the Historical and Geographical Dissertation on the Demarcation Meridian between the Dominions of Spain and Portugal, published in 1749.[1]  The purpose of that work was to determine precisely the line of demarcation as defined by the terms of the Treaty of Tordesillas between Spain and Portugal, signed in 1494 under the sponsorship of Pope Alexander VI./nJuan and Ulloa also jointly signed a confidential report, written by Ulloa around 1746 and addressed to the Marquess of Ensenada, a powerful minister in the new government of Ferdinand VI.  That report, titled Discourse and Political Reflections on the Present State of the Kingdoms of Peru, remained unknown to the public until it was published in London in 1826 by an otherwise obscure Englishman, David Barry, under the title Noticias secretas de Am\u00e9rica (\"Secret News from America\").[6]  That report paints a dire picture of the social and political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1730s and 1740s, alleging many grave instances of lawlessness and mismanagement by the civil and church authorities in the region.  It also denounces in very strong terms the exploitation of the Native American population by unscrupulous governors (especially the corregidores) and priests (especially the members of the mendicant orders).  The importance and reliability of that confidential report have been subjects of enduring controversy among historians of Spanish America.[6]/nIn March of 1749, the Marquess of Ensenada gave Juan a sensitive mission of industrial espionage in England.  Juan traveled to London incognito as \"Mr. Joseus\", communicating back to Ensenada using a numerical cipher.  Juan's principal task was to learn about the design of the latest British warships and to recruit some of the constructors in order to help the Spanish Navy to improve its outdated fleet.  He was also tasked with collecting information about the English manufacture of fine cloth, sealing wax, printing plates, dredges, and armaments, to purchase surgical instruments for the Royal College of Naval Surgeons, in C\u00e1diz, and to procure steam engines to pump water out of mines./nIn London, Juan befriended Admiral Anson and the Duke of Bedford.  In November 1749 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society.[7]  With the help of a Catholic priest, Father Lynch, Juan was able to recruit about fifty naval artisans and workmen who defected to Spain.  Some of these men, such as Matthew Mullan and Richard Rooth, went on to build the Spanish ships that would later fight in the American Revolutionary War and at the battle of Trafalgar./nIn 1750, Juan was elected as member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences upon the recommendation of its director, Pierre Louis Maupertuis.  Maupertuis had been one of the key figures in the determination of the figure of the Earth from geodesic measurements and was therefore aware of Juan's contribution to that effort and of his mathematical skills.  After eighteen months in England, Juan finally fled the country to avoid arrest as a foreign spy./nBack in Spain, Juan was promoted to the full rank of captain (capit\u00e1n de nav\u00edo).  The Marquess of Ensenada then put him in charge of all naval construction.  Juan established his own system of shipbuilding, approved by the authorities in 1752.  He carried out major improvements of the military shipyards, including those in Cartagena, C\u00e1diz, Ferrol, and Havana. He implemented a modern industrial system of division of labor among the different disciplines involved in the construction of warships, such as dry-docks, shipyards, furnaces, rigging, and canvas making.  Juan also modernized the armaments used by the navy./nJuan was chiefly concerned to build ships with the least possible expenditure of wood and iron consistent with the vessel's stability.  Among the warships built under Juan's \"English system\" were the Oriente (1753) and the Aquil\u00f3n (1754).  However, after the Marquess of Ensenada fell from power in 1754, Juan's \"English system\" started to be abandoned in favor of the \"French system\" promoted by Juli\u00e1n de Arriaga, the new Secretary of the Navy./nDuring Juan's lifetime, the universities in Spain were wholly controlled by the Catholic Church and offered no modern scientific instruction.  Juan promoted the teaching of differential and integral calculus in the Spanish military academies and helped to supply those institutions with modern scientific equipment.[1]  In 1752, the King appointed Juan as Captain of the Royal Company of Marine Guards (Capit\u00e1n de la Real Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Guardias Marinas), which effectively put him in control of the Naval Academy in C\u00e1diz.  Juan appointed the French astronomer Louis Godin, with whom he had worked during the mission in South America, as director of the Academy.  Together, in 1753 Juan and Godin established Spain's first astronomical observatory, the Royal Naval Observatory, based in C\u00e1diz.[1]  In 1757, Juan published a new textbook, the Navigational Compendium, for the instruction of the Academy's cadets./nJuan was corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences (since 1745), fellow of the Royal Society of London (since 1749), and member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (since 1750).  In 1755, Juan founded the Asamblea Amistosa Literaria de C\u00e1diz (\"Friendly Literary Assembly of C\u00e1diz\"), which for several years met every Thursday to discuss various intellectual subjects, and which was composed principally of teachers of the Naval Academy.  Juan's goal was to lay the groundwork for the future establishment of a Spanish Academy of Sciences, something that came about only in 1847, long after Juan's death.  Juan was made a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, in Madrid, in 1767, based on his contribution to architecture./nIn 1770, King Charles III appointed Juan as director of the Seminary of Nobles in Madrid.  That institution had been created in 1725 by Philip V to train the children of Spain's aristocracy in military and civil administration, but it had declined after the expulsion of the Jesuits (who had been in charge of the Seminary) in 1767.  As its director, Juan succeeded in overhauling the faculty, modernizing the curriculum, and increasing the student enrollment.[1]/nJuan's principal scientific work was the Maritime Examination, published in two volumes in 1771.  That work was principally concerned with practical naval architecture, but it also contained Juan's own original work on the theory of water's resistance to a ship's motion and of the generation of shock waves.[1]  Juan criticized Leonhard Euler's theory of fluid resistance, which was based on the impact of the water flow upon the ship's solid surface, and proposed an alternative based on the action of gravity.[8]  Both Euler's and Juan's theories were eventually found to be incorrect and have been superseded by the modern theory based on viscosity./nIn 1760 Juan was appointed as Squadron Commander of the Royal Navy (Jefe de Escuadra de la Real Armada), making him the most senior Naval officer in Spain.  Shortly after that, however, Juan began to suffer from a biliary colic that forced him to retire temporarily to the spa at Busot, in his native province of Alicante. In 1766\u201367, he served as ambassador plenipotentiary to the Sultan of Morocco, Mohammed ben Abdallah, for the purpose of concluding the negotiation of a peace treaty between Spain and Morocco.  After accomplishing that mission, Juan returned to Madrid.  In 1768, Juan was again forced to seek relief for his health ailments, this time at the baths in Trillo.  His last official appointment was as director of the Seminary of Nobles in Madrid./nJorge Juan died in Madrid in 1773 at the age of 60.  His reported symptoms, including muscle stiffness and seizures, may have resulted from a cerebral amebic infection. He was buried in the church of San Mart\u00edn.  In 1860 he was re-buried in the Pantheon of Illustrious Sailors in C\u00e1diz./nAmong other posthumous honours, a mayor street in the Salamanca district of Madrid and a Churruca-class destroyer of the Spanish Navy were named after him.[9]  In the last series of peseta banknotes (the Spanish currency before the adoption of the euro in 2002), the highest denomination bill (10,000 pesetas) carried Juan's portrait on the reverse side.", "524280": "Ernest Benjamin Esclangon (17 March 1876 \u2013 28 January 1954) was a French astronomer and mathematician./nBorn in Mison, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in 1895 he started to study mathematics at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, graduating in 1898. Looking for some means of financial support while he completed his doctorate on quasi-periodic functions, he took a post at the Bordeaux Observatory, teaching some mathematics at the university./nDuring World War I, he worked on ballistics and developed a novel method for precisely locating enemy artillery. When a gun is fired, it initiates a spherical shock wave but the projectile also generates a conical wave. By using the sound of distant guns to compare the two waves, Escaglon was able to make accurate predictions of gun locations./nAfter the armistice in 1919,[1] Esclangon became director of the Strasbourg Observatory and professor of astronomy at the university the following year. In 1929, he was appointed director of the Paris Observatory and of the International Time Bureau, and elected to the Bureau des Longitudes in 1932. He is perhaps best remembered for initiating in 1933 the first speaking clock service, reportedly to relieve the observatory staff from the numerous telephone calls requesting the exact time. He was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in 1939./nEsclangon was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1933\u20131935.[2] In 1935, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the society's highest award./nServing as director of the Paris Observatory throughout World War II and the German occupation of Paris, he retired in 1944.

In later life, he owned a modest sized country estate in Stratton Strawless, Norfolk and became friendly with the naturalist Gilbert White, with whom he carried on a lengthy correspondence and who described him as a 'painful and accurate naturalist' (by \"painful\" he would have meant \"painstaking\")./nHe is best known for his Indications of Spring, the phenology notes in which he recorded 27 signs of spring, starting in 1736 and continuing for over 60 years. Successive generations of his family added to his work until well into the 20th century and this information now provides immensely valuable data to the UK phenology database, giving us a wealth of knowledge about how spring is influenced by prevailing weather conditions, This is now of huge interest in the climate change debate. Marsham was the first to record the effects of nature and seasonal change./nMarsham provided insight into the winter of 1739/40, the coldest year on record, when the contents of his chamber pot frequently froze overnight and the turnip crop was completely destroyed. Turnips, being a Norfolk speciality, feature elsewhere: he regularly recorded turnip flowering dates (needed when turnips were to produce seed). He was amazed at the size a turnip achieved.[2]/nMy farm produced me a Turnip that weighed 19lbs&2oz, & was 39&half round/nMarsham is still the only person in Norfolk to have recorded the wallcreeper bird./nHis interest in trees resulted in his being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1780.[3] His Indications of Spring were published in 'Philosophical Transactions' by the Royal Society in 1789./nHe married twice. His first wife was Mary Browne of Yaxham, who died in 1752, with whom he had one son, Robert. From his second marriage to Elizabeth Newby of Stratton, he had another son, Thomas who died at the age of 14./nIn 1747 Marsham planted an example of a Cedrus atlantica, now known as the 'Great Cedar'. The tree, which is  located in Reed-house grove to the east of Stratton Strawless Hall, was last measured in 2000, at which time it had attained a height of 31 metres (102\u00a0ft) and a circumference of 7 metres (23\u00a0ft).[2]", "1572874": "Dawn Prince-Hughes (born 1964[1]) is an American anthropologist, primatologist, and ethologist.

She has had a long career in forest ecology and has been a leader in quantitative ecology and education. Most of her research has focused in the Sinharaja rain forest in Sri Lanka. She considers her main contribution to forest ecology to be spreading the idea that successful forest conservation depends on local conservationists. In line with this, she is proud of her students and their accomplishments in the field of conservation./nMalwattage Celestine Violet Savitri Gunatilleke was born July 30, 1945, in Bandarawela, Uva Province, Sri Lanka[1] to M. Joseph Peeris and Ruth Peeris. She is the eldest of 6 girls. She received primary education at Little Flower Convent in Bandarawela, an agricultural city in the Badulla District from 1949 to 1953.[1] From 1954 to 1964, she attended secondary school, corresponding to middle and high school,[2] at St. Bridget's Convent in Colombo, the largest city and commercial capital of the island.[3]/nIn 1965, she began attending the University of Ceylon in Colombo, the only university in Sri Lanka at the time.[3] In 1967 she transferred to the Peradeniya location. By 1969, Gunatilleke graduated First Class Honours with a Special Degree in Botany. She was the second person to qualify for this degree and the first woman.[1] She also earned a subsidiary degree in chemistry.[1] Shortly after graduation, in 1970, she began teaching as an assistant lecturer in the Department of Botany at the University of Ceylon in Peradeniya. Initially, Gunatilleke was planning on teaching plant pathology, the study of organisms and environmental conditions that cause disease in plants.[4] However, upon receiving the position, the head of the Botany Department, Professor Abeywickrama, told her the department already had a plant pathologist and she would be teaching Forest Ecology, shifting the direction of her academic career.[5][6][1]/nIn 1971, Gunatilleke was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship and moved to the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, United Kingdom for postgraduate education where she earned her master's degree in general ecology and a Ph.D. in Tropical Forest Ecology and Conservation. While in Peradeniya, she had been inspired by a presentation from Peter Ashton, a prominent tropical forest expert, on \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s lowland forests\u201d to study forests and land use issues. She was impressed not only with his knowledge of the tree family he was in Sri Lanka to study, but also his knowledge of the island's geography, roads, and waterways. She wrote to several plant ecologists in the US and UK, including Peter Ashton. Again, Abeywickrama would have an influential role in guiding her path; he suggested she be trained under Ashton because he wanted to strengthen the topic Ashton was offering in his botany department.[1] Gunatilleke did choose to study with Ashton for her Ph.D. Her thesis, \u201cEcology of the Endemic Tree Species of Sri Lanka concerning their Conservation\u201d[1] is considered a landmark project in quantitative ecological research. The study revealed that a great proportion of endemic tree species were confined to Sri Lanka's lowland rain forests and highlighted the need to conserve them.[7] This research required one year of fieldwork in 6 lowland primary forests in Sri Lanka: Kottawa, Kanneliya and Gilimale (wet zones), Daragoda and Barigoda (intermediate zones), and Ritigala (dry zone).[8]/nAlthough she pursued education outside of Sri Lanka, Gunatilleke planned on spending her career in her home country.

She has stated one of her proudest accomplishments is avoiding the \"brain drain\".[8]/nSince 1977, Gunatilleke's main research focused in the Sinharaja rain forest. This forest is located in southwest Sri Lanka and the country's last area of primary tropical rain forest large enough to be sustainable. More than 60% of the tree species are endemic, as are many wildlife, especially birds.[9] In this forest, she investigated the value of tree species diversity. Her work contributed to declaring the Sinharaja rain forest a World Heritage Site on October 21, 1988.[9] This was important as the area was still being logged by the State Timber Corporation in the 1970s at the time of her research. Her research also included recommendations on how to improve conservation in the Sinharaja.[10] For one project, they looked at conditions required for growth to enable nearby villagers to grow tree species in the buffer zone around the protected area so they could continue to use forest resources. Another component focused on planting canopy species in the degraded peripheral areas of the forest to help encourage recruitment of species outside of the preserve. The third main component of their research looked into reconnecting fragmented patches to increase their chance of survival.[10]/nShe has also conducted research in Kanneliye Rainforest Reserve, Hiniduma, Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, and the Knuckles Forest Reserve./nAs a professor, she was also uniquely influential. She had finished her undergraduate studies without visiting a forest and was still a novice with identifying plants in the field when she started her Ph.D., so she wanted to give her students a chance to visit the \u201coutdoor laboratories\u201d Sri Lanka has to offer.[5] She convinced the University of Peradeniya of the importance of field classes and encouraged the school to devote resources to including field work into curriculums. Additionally, she and her colleagues established an arboretum and herbarium for students so specimens from around the island would be available for them to study.[3]/nShe was also involved with exchange programs with other universities. She was an adviser for students visiting Sri Lanka on exchange programs with Harvard University, Yale University, and Aberdeen University./nShe particularly enjoyed interacting with students and seeing their responses to what she taught them. For example, one of the most rewarding parts of teaching for Gunatilleke was when a student understood a topic they had been struggling with.

Their mother Yulia (nee Reiman), was a cellist, and their father, Alexander Medvedev, was a philosopher in a military academy in Leningrad.[1] Zhores, named after French socialist leader Jean Jaur\u00e8s (his twin was named after Indian revolutionary M. N. Roy),[1] was drafted into the Red Army in 1943, but was soon discharged after being seriously wounded in a battle on the Taman Peninsula.[2] He then began his studies in biology at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy in Moscow.[2] In December 1950, Zhores was awarded a PhD degree for his research into sexual processes in plants./nHe became a junior research scientist in the Agrochemistry and Biochemistry Department at Timiryazev Academy and he was promoted to senior research scientist in 1954 and remained at the academy until 1963. Beginning in 1952, Medvedev had focused his attention on the problems of aging, concentrating on the turnover of proteins and nucleic acids. In 1961, he published the first paper suggesting that aging is the result of an accumulation of errors in the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. In 1962, Medvedev wrote his book on the history of Soviet genetics, which passed an editorial review but was withheld by state censors.[2] It was later published in the United States in 1969 as The Rise and Fall of T.D. Lysenko.[3]/nIn 1963, Medvedev moved to Obninsk to the Institute of Medical Radiology, where he was appointed head of the molecular radiobiology laboratory. He published two books, Protein Biosynthesis and Problems of Heredity Development and Ageing[4] and Molecular Mechanisms of Development.[a]/nMedvedev was dismissed from his position in 1969. Between 1968 and 1970, Medvedev wrote two more books: International Cooperation of Scientists and National Frontiers [5] and Secrecy of Correspondence is Guaranteed by Law (about postal censorship in the USSR). These works were widely circulated in the USSR among scientists, along with a copy of his 1962 history of Soviet genetics (which had been published in Grani, a Russian journal published outside the USSR), and this activity resulted in Medvedev's arrest and forced detention in the Kaluga psychiatric hospital in May 1970. This action, however, produced many protests from scientists (academics Andrei Sakharov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Igor Tamm, Vladimir Engelgardt, Boris Astaurov,[6] Nikolai Semyonov, and others) and writers (including Solzhenitsyn, Tvardovsky, Vladimir Tendryakov, Vladimir Dudintsev), which resulted in Medvedev's release (this experience was reflected in Zhores and Roy Medvedev's book A Question of Madness[b])./nIn 1971, Medvedev was given the job of senior scientist of the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of Farm Animals in Borovsk, in the Kaluga region./nIn 1972, Medvedev was invited for one year's research by the National Institute for Medical Research in London at its new Genetic Division. In August 1973, however, his Soviet passport was confiscated and he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship. He remained in London and worked as senior research scientist at the National Institute for Medical Research until his retirement in 1991./nIn 1977, Medvedev published Hazards of Nuclear Power, which mentioned the Kyshtym nuclear disaster in passing. At the time, the disaster was essentially unknown, and his work was dismissed as baseless propaganda even by his Western colleagues.[2] Medvedev responded by publishing Soviet Science in 1978, which assembled evidence from Soviet publications that taken together comprised conclusive evidence of the disaster's occurrence. He followed this with the book The Nuclear Disaster in the Urals in 1979, and a further critique The Legacy of Chernobyl (1990), which connected the two disasters as being a product of the same attitudes toward science and engineering in the USSR.[2]/nIn London, Medvedev acted as his brother Roy's representative, managing his publishing contracts and financial affairs. In 1975 he created a small publishing house, \"T.C.D. publications\", for the purpose of publishing the Russian-language version of Roy Medvedev's samizdat journal XX Century.[7] The two brothers also coauthored Khrushchev: The Years in Power (1978) and several other books, the last one The Unknown Stalin (2007)./nMedvedev died in London on 15 November 2018, one day after his 93rd birthday, with his family by his side.[8][9] \nIn 2019, his memoirs posthumously appeared in Russian under the title A Dangerous Profession.[10]/nMedvedev published about 170 research papers and reviews, about sixty of them during his time in London. In 1973 he was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto.[11] He received the Aging Research Award from the United States Association of Biogerontology in 1984 and the Rene Schubert Prize in Gerontology in 1985./nAccording to Michael Gordin, a professor of history at Princeton University, Medvedev provided critiques of the Soviet Union that were \"powerful, persuasive and principled\", with Medvedev being \"sympathetic to the dreams of the [Russian] Revolution\" but opposed to the \"cronyism and Stalinism [that] had contaminated the early promise.\"[2]", "983089": "Sir Charles Wyville Thomson FRSE FRS FLS FGS FZS (5 March 1830 \u2013 10 March 1882) was a Scottish natural historian and marine zoologist. He served as the chief scientist on the Challenger expedition; his work there revolutionized oceanography and led to his being knighted./nThomson was born at Bonsyde, in Linlithgow, West Lothian, on 5 March 1830, the son of Andrew Thomson, a surgeon in the service of the East India Company, and his wife Sarah Ann Drummond Smith. He was baptised Wyville Thomas Charles Thomson, but changed his name formally upon being knighted in 1876.[3][1]/nHe was educated under Charles Chalmers at Merchiston Castle School, then from 1845 studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating with an MD. However, his focus turned from medicine to natural science, and he joined the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1847, and soon after became secretary to the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. In 1850 he was attending the botany class of John Hutton Balfour at the University./nIn 1850 he was appointed lecturer of botany, and in 1851 professor of botany, at the University of Aberdeen. In 1853 he became a professor of natural history in Queen's College, Cork, Ireland, succeeding Professor Hincks. A year later he was nominated to the chair of mineralogy and geology at the Queen's University of Belfast.[4]/nIn 1855 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being his former tutor, John Hutton Balfour. He served as the society's vice president from 1877 to 1882. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1869.[3]/nIn 1860 was transferred to the chair of natural history at the same institution. In 1868 he assumed the duties of professor of botany at the Royal College of Science, Dublin, and finally in 1870 he received the natural history chair at the University of Edinburgh.[4] Here he taught Arthur Conan Doyle.[5]/nIn 1871\u201372 he served as President of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh.[6]/nThomson is remembered for his studies of the biological conditions of the deep seas. Being interested in crinoids, and prompted by the results of the dredgings of Michael Sars in the deep sea off the Norwegian coasts, he persuaded the Royal Navy to grant him use of HMS\u00a0Lightning and HMS\u00a0Porcupine for deep sea dredging expeditions in the summers of 1868 and 1869. They showed that animal life existed down to depths of 650 fathoms (1200 m), that all marine invertebrate groups are present at this depth, and that deep-sea temperatures are not as constant as had been supposed, but vary considerably, and indicate oceanic circulation. These results were described in The Depths of the Sea, which he published in 1873.[4]/nThe remarkable hydrographic and zoological results which Thomson had demonstrated, in addition to the growing demands of ocean telegraphy, soon led to the Royal Navy to grant use of HMS\u00a0Challenger for a global expedition. Wyville Thomson was selected as chief scientist, and the ship sailed on 23 December 1872.[7]/nThe Challenger expedition was deemed a great success, and on his return Thomson received a number of academic honours, as well as a knighthood. In 1877 he published in two volumes The Voyage of the Challenger\u00a0\u2013 The Atlantic, a preliminary account of the results of the voyage. He spent the next two years working on administrative duties connected with the publication of the full monograph of the voyage. Thomson had a highly strung mentality, and his health was generally poor throughout his life. He found dealing with publishers in the course of completing the full reports of the voyage to be enormously stressful. In 1879 he ceased to perform his university duties, gave up overseeing the reports of the expedition in 1881 (after publishing the introduction to the zoological series in 1880),[1] then took to his bed and died a broken man at Bonsyde on 10 March 1882.[4] Thomson's friend and colleague Sir John Murray took over the publication of the reports; they eventually spanned 50 volumes, the last of which was issued in 1895.[1]/nThomson is commemorated in the stained glass window above the altar in St. Michael's Parish Church, Linlithgow and his headstone is in the churchyard. In addition the Wyville Thomson Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean is named after him./nThomson had criticised natural selection, stating it was not enough to explain the evolution of species. Replying in the Nature journal, Charles Darwin commented that \"I am sorry to find that Sir Wyville Thomson does not under stand the principle of natural selection, as explained by Mr. Wallace and myself... Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any one who has said that the evolution of species depends only on natural selection?\"[8]/nIn 1853 he married Jane Ramage Dawson. They were parents to Frank Wyville Thomson FRSE (1860\u20131918)./nThe Pallid sculpin, Cottunculus thomsonii (G\u00fcnther, 1882) is named after him.[9]", "852018": "Sir William Henry Flower KCB FRS FRCS FRAI (30 November 1831\u00a0\u2013 1 July 1899) was an English surgeon, museum curator  and comparative anatomist, who became a leading authority on mammals and especially on the primate brain. He supported Thomas Henry Huxley in an important controversy with Richard Owen about the human brain and eventually succeeded Owen as Director of the Natural History Museum in London./nBorn on 30 November 1831 in his father's house at Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, he was the second son of Edward Fordham Flower, founder of the town brewery, and his wife Celina Greaves (1804\u200d\u2013\u200d1884), eldest daughter of John Greaves and his wife Mary Whitehead.[1] His paternal grandfather Richard Flower had married Elizabeth Fordham and settled at Albion, Illinois, where his father grew up./nHis uncles included the slate entrepreneur John Whitehead Greaves and William Pickering, Governor of Washington. His elder brother Charles Edward Flower ran the family brewery with the third brother Edgar Flower, while he chose a scientific career./nFirst taught at home by his mother, he went to a school in Edgbaston at the age 11 and then from age 13 to a Pestalozzian school at Worksop under a Swiss headmaster, Dr B. Heldenmaier.[2] There were ten hours schooling each day which included, rare at that time, science. Already a collector of natural history objects, he was made curator of the school museum and for almost all the rest of his life was a museum curator of one kind or another./nHe then attended University College, London, followed by the Middlesex Hospital, where he studied medicine and surgery. Graduating as an MB of London University in 1851, he won a gold medal in physiology and a silver in zoology and comparative anatomy.[1] In 1852 he read his first paper before the Zoological Society of London, of which he was made a Fellow./nAppointed a junior house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital, after six months he was promoted to senior house surgeon and in 1854 passed the exam to become an MRCS (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons). Also in 1854 he became Curator of the Middlesex Hospital Museum./nHowever, with the outbreak of the Crimean War that year, he joined the British Army and was appointed as Assistant-Surgeon to the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot. Embarking at Cork in July 1854, they sailed for Constantinople and then on to the Crimea, landing at Kalamita Bay in August. Within four months, the regiment was reduced in strength by almost one half from cold, exposure, infectious disease and, lastly, enemy action. His own health broke down and he had to be invalided home, never fully recovering.[3] In recognition of his services, he received from the hands of Queen Victoria the Crimea Medal with clasps for Alma, Inkerman, Balaclava, and Sebastopol. Later, he received the Turkish Crimean War medal as well./nWhen fit to work he returned to London, taking the diploma to become an FRCS (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) in 1857 and joining the staff of the Middlesex Hospital as a Demonstrator in Anatomy. In 1858 he married, and during the next year became Assistant-Surgeon at the Middlesex, curator of the Anatomical Museum and also Lecturer on Comparative Anatomy.[1] In his 1859 lecture to the Royal United Services Institute on practical surgery for naval and military officers, as a direct result of his Crimean experience  he summarised the first aid knowledge needed by soldiers and sailors to help the wounded before a surgeon was available./nIn 1860, intellectual circles in London were alive with talk of evolution. Long interested in the wider sphere of natural history rather than just human physiology, he decided to move his career in that direction. A probable influence was Thomas Henry Huxley, also a comparative anatomist and Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution at the time, and his first contact with Huxley came through the naval surgeon, zoologist, and palaeontologist George Busk./nWith Huxley he became engaged in controversy with Richard Owen, who claimed that the human brain had unique structures not present in simians. Huxley had contradicted this at the British Association meeting at Oxford in 1860, which included a debate on evolution, and promised proof. He was among experts consulted by Huxley and gave demonstrations at Huxley's public lectures, using monkey brains rather than scarce ape brains. He published papers on the brains of four species of monkey, and at the 1862 meeting of the British Association in Cambridge, after Owen read a paper repeating his claims, stood up saying \"I happen to have in my pocket a monkey's brain\" and produced the object in question.[4]:\u200a66/nIn the evolution debate he was among those who, like his wife's brother-in-law. the Reverend Professor Baden Powell, saw no threat to religious belief in accepting the theory. In 1883 he expounded his view in an address to the Church Congress in Reading under the title: \"The bearing of science on religion\"./nOn the recommendation of Huxley and others, in 1862 he became Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, holding the post for 22 years, and in 1864 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[1]/nIn 1870 he became Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy, in succession to Huxley, and began a series of lectures that ran for fourteen years, all on aspects of the Mammalia. The essence was published in his books of 1870 and 1891. He was elected President of the Zoological Society of London in 1879, holding the post for life, and in 1882 was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. From 1883 to 1885 he was President of the Anthropological Institute.[1]/nIn 1884, on the retirement of Sir Richard Owen, he was appointed to the directorship of what were then the Natural History departments of the British Museum in South Kensington. The four departments of Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy and Geology each had its own Keeper, who was largely autonomous from the Director, who was himself subject to the Principal Librarian and to the Trustees of the British Museum. Facing a wide array of personalities to contend with and a heavy load of administrative duties, he was a more or less instant success, testifying to his strong but tactful personality.[3]/nIn 1889 he showed his devotion by installing a statue of Charles Darwin in the Museum. In that year he was chosen as President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, having previously headed  its biological section in 1878 and its anthropological section in 1881 (being chosen again in 1894). In 1893 he served as President of the Museums Association.[1]/nIn 1895, in addition to his role as Director he took over the post of Keeper of Zoology, holding it until his retirement. He immediately set about rearranging the zoological galleries according to the theories he had evolved on effective presentation by de-cluttering the exhibits, ensuring each specimen had an easy-to-read label, and placing each stuffed animal beside its skeleton and remains of its extinct allies in order to give the displays depth and context.[3]/nBeyond his continuing interest in primates, he became an expert on the Cetacea, that is the whales and their relatives. He carried out dissections, went out on whaling boats, studied discoveries of whale fossils, and established a whale room at the Natural History Museum with skeletons and plaster casts.[5]\n[6] It was he who made public the \"absolute and complete destruction of two species of right whale by the reckless greed of the whalers\".[4]:\u200a75/nHe made valuable contributions to structural anthropology, for example by publishing complete and accurate measurements of 1,300 human skulls, and as a comparative anatomist in the field of Mammalia he ranked high.[7] He was the first person to show that lemurs are primates./nHe was a leading authority on the arrangement of museums. He insisted on the importance of distinguishing between collections intended for the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the general public, pointing out that it was as futile to present to the former a number of merely typical forms as to provide the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide approval and entitle him to be seen as a reformer who did much to improve methods of museum arrangement and management.[7]/nHe also laboured for wider access to museums, both by educated people who needed to know more about the rapidly developing world of science and by ordinary people whose mental horizons could be expanded. He personally led conducted tours for groups across the social spectrum, from royalty at one end to working men at the other.[8][9]/nHe became a public figure, his lectures being crowded and his views influential. In a study of deliberate deformation of the human body in various cultures, he included corsets and high heels, illustrating the effects with pictures of distorted female skeletons.[10] Horrified at the widespread slaughter of birds to provide feathers for fashionable hats, he said of the egret: \"one of the most beautiful of birds is being swept off the face of the earth under circumstances of peculiar cruelty, to minister to a passing fashion.\" Which led Beatrix Potter to write: \"I wonder what Sir W Flower's speciality is besides ladies' bonnets.\"[3]/nIn 1869, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[11]/nFlower married Georgiana Rosetta Smyth, on 15 April 1858, at Stone in Buckinghamshire. Georgiana was the youngest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth, an astronomer and hydrographer,[1] and his wife Eliza Anne (Annarella) Warington. Flower and Georgiana had four daughters and three sons, including the zoologist Stanley Smyth Flower (1871\u200d\u2013\u200d1946).[12]  He and his wife led an active life outside his work, over the years meeting many leading figures in British society. Among their friends were the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the leading churchman Dean Stanley./nHaving been created a Companion of the Bath in 1887, three years after his first appointment to the Museum, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1892. He also received the Jubilee Medal and the Royal Prussian order \"Pour le M\u00e9rite\"./nIllness and overwork led him to take retirement from the Natural History Museum in August 1898 and he died at his home in South Kensington on I July 1899, aged 67. His remains were buried with his wife's family at Stone in Buckinghamshire.[1]/nFlowers publications were all but a few on mammals (and surgery); he was not a field biologist, nor a student of the other vertebrate groups./nFlower wrote forty articles for the 9th edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, every one on a group of mammals.[13]", "61898805": "Kenneth W.

Christopher Garcia is an American scientist known for his research on the molecular and structural biology of cell surface receptors. Garcia is a professor in the Departments of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and Structural Biology at the Stanford University School of Medicine,[1] an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute[2] and a member of the National Academies of Science and Medicine.[3][4] In addition to his role at Stanford, Garcia is a co-founder of several biotechnology companies, including Alexo Therapeutics,[5] Surrozen,[6] and 3T Biosciences.[7]/nGarcia earned his B.S. in biochemistry from Tulane University. He attended graduate school at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he received his Ph.D. in Biophysics under the mentorship of L. Mario Amzel. After receiving his Ph.D., Garcia conducted postdoctoral research at Genentech in the laboratories of David Goeddel and Tony Kossiakoff, where he immersed himself in the nascent technologies of protein engineering and recombinant protein expression, and then at The Scripps Research Institute in the laboratory of Ian Wilson./nGarcia's research integrates approaches in structural biology, biochemistry and protein engineering to understand how cell surface receptors sense environmental cues through the engagement of extracellular ligands, and transduce signals. The overarching theme of the laboratory is to elucidate the structural and mechanistic basis of receptor activation in systems relevant to human disease, and to exploit this information to design and engineer new molecules with therapeutic properties. Thus there is a close integration of basic science discovery with translation. Garcia's laboratory at Stanford has published numerous scientific articles describing the molecular structure and signaling mechanisms of proteins important for immunity, neurobiology and development.[8] According to data from Google Scholar, Garcia's publication record yields an h-factor of 105 as of February 2023.[9]/nGarcia's earliest research as a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University focused on understanding how anti-idiotyopic antibodies recognize peptide antigens.[10] As a postdoctoral scholar at The Scripps Research Institute, Garcia conducted a groundbreaking study that revealed how T cells of the immune system survey peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex proteins (MHC), thus allowing them to distinguish between \"self\" and \"non-self\". Garcia's research led to the first visualization of a T cell receptor (TCR) bound to a peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex  and was published in the journal Science in 1996.[11] Garcia's 1996 article on the TCR-MHC interaction has had broad impact in the fields of immunology and immunotherapy.[12]/nAt Stanford University, the Garcia Laboratory reported the structure of the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) in 2007, which revealed how pre-BCRs oligomerize to signal in the absence of antigen.[13] Garcia's group has also authored several additional landmark articles exploring various aspects of TCR-pMHC interactions, including the first structure of a \u03b3\u03b4 TCR-pMHC complex,[14] the molecular basis for dual recognition of \"self\" and \"foreign\" MHCs by TCRs,[15] insights into the germline basis of TCR/MHC interactions,[16][17] the extent of cross-reactivity in the TCR repertoire,[18][19] and elucidation of the structural trigger for TCR signaling.[20] In Garcia's most recent work, his lab developed a peptide-MHC library technology that has enabled the discovery of antigens for orphan T cell receptors, such as those resident in tumors. This technology also enabled a breakthrough in understanding how signaling is initiated by pMHC engagement./nGarcia's research has established how structural and biophysical principles govern receptor binding and signal activation in many different cytokine systems. Key findings include determination of the first crystal structures of the following cytokine family members in complex with their surface receptors: gp130 family (IL-6),[21] common gamma (\u03b3c) family (IL-2),[22] Type I Interferons (IFN\u03b12/IFN\u03c9)[23] and Type III Interferons.[24] The Garcia Laboratory has also determined crystal structures of many other major cytokine-receptor complexes including those of IL-1, IL-4, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, LIF and CNTF. These structures have revealed a wide range of binding topologies and architectures, and demonstrate how convergent evolution has provided many solutions for cytokine receptors to transduce signals across the cell membrane. In addition to molecular studies of cytokines, Garcia's group has also used directed evolution to engineer high affinity cytokine variants (IL-2, IL-4, IFN-\u03bb) with improved therapeutic properties.[25][24][26]/nIn 2012, Garcia's laboratory determined the crystal structure of a Wnt protein in complex with its cellular receptor, Frizzled.[27] The Wnt-Frizzled structure indicated that Wnts utilize a post-translational lipid modification to directly engage the Frizzled extracellular domain, which represents a highly unusual binding mode among soluble ligands. Garcia's study revealed a striking, donut-shaped architecture adopted by the Wnt-Frizzled complex that adorns the cover of the July 6th, 2012 issue of Science.[27] More recently, Garcia's laboratory reported a breakthrough in being able to recapitulate canonical Wnt signaling using water-soluble bispecific ligands that dimerize Frizzled and Lrp6, which has important implications for the development of therapeutics for regenerative medicine.[28]/nIn 2015 and 2017, Garcia published articles in Science describing the first atomic-level visualizations of Notch signaling complexes.[29][30] Garcia's group used directed evolution to strengthen low-affinity interactions between the receptor Notch1 and ligands Delta-like 4 (DLL4) and Jagged1 (Jag1) as a means of stabilizing the complexes for co-crystallization. Notch1-DLL4 and Notch1-Jag1 structures were determined by x-ray crystallography and revealed long, narrow binding interfaces assisted by multiple O-linked fucose and glucose modifications on Notch1. O-linked glycans are rarely observed at protein-protein interfaces, and their presence at the Notch-ligand interface explained how changes in glycosylation state influence Notch signaling activity. Garcia's 2017 publication also established that Notch-ligand interactions form catch bonds, and that Delta-like and Jagged ligands have different mechanical force thresholds for Notch receptor activation.[30]/nIn 2015, the Garcia Laboratory reported the x-ray crystal structure of the virally encoded G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), US28, bound to its chemokine ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1).[31] The US28-Fractalkine structure was one of the first reports to visualize a protein ligand bound to a GPCR, and revealed that the  globular \"head\" of fractalkine docks onto the extracellular loops of US28, while fractalkine's flexible N-terminal \"tail\" threads into a cavity in the center of US28 as a means of fine-tuning its downstream signaling activity. In more recent studies, the lab has engineered biased chemokine ligands and shown that GPCR activation is governed by ligands that induce shape changes rather than highly specific bonding chemistries.[32]/nGarcia has conducted several studies targeting cellular receptors for applications in cancer immunotherapy. In 2013, Garcia's group developed high affinity antagonists of the receptor CD47 that potently enhance the antitumor effects of established therapeutic antibodies.[33] Garcia later determined that the therapeutic effects of CD47 blockade require combination therapy with checkpoint blockade antibodies in immunocompetent hosts, thus proving that CD47-based therapy relies upon stimulation of the adaptive immune system.[34] Garcia's lab published the creation of an \"orthogonal\" IL-2 receptor complex to enable the selective delivery of IL-2 signals to engineered T cells during adoptive cell therapy.[35] They also reported a new technology using yeast-displayed peptide-MHC molecules to identify tumor antigens recognized by Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes.[36]/nGarcia has published descriptions of several research findings online in the form of videos.[37][38]/nGarcia is a competitive long-distance runner and has run more than 120 ultramarathons, including several 100-mile races.", "70451260": "Maria Tonelli-Rondelli (1899 \u2013 1970) was an Italian entomologist who studied the taxonomy and identification of ticks (Ixodidae), especially South American species.[1]/nShe was born in Turin in 1899, the daughter of Alipio Rondelli and Maria Pia (Marina) Zanetti.[2] She studied at University of Turin, graduating in natural sciences in 1921 and then geography in 1923.

This was published with a preface by the Italian zoologist Umberto Pierantoni.[2] However the focus of her career was on ticks. She examined specimens in the collections at Milan and Turin museums and specimens from scientific expeditions.[4] In 1928 she described a new species, Ixodes nivalis from specimens obtained in the Gran Paradiso National Park in Italy.[5][6] She worked especially on ticks found in South America. These included Amblyomma, a genus of hard ticks which are particularly diverse in the Americas. Some species are vectors of disease. She was able to re-examine specimens described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1844[7] and provide improved illustrations and descriptions.[8] She also proposed that, because of differences in the morphology among specimens of the species Amblyomma cajennense, it should be divided into several different species. A. cajennense can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever so its unambiguous identification was important. Later workers considered that these differences were inherent variation between individuals of only one species and not sufficient to define new species.[9][10] The application of molecular taxonomic methods in the twenty-first century has, however, demonstrated that some of these morphological distinctions indeed mark distinct species.[11]/nIn 2014 the new species Amblyomma tonelliae was named after her.[12]", "58359870": "Norbert Becker (born 1949 in H\u00fcffelsheim, Landkreis Bad Kreuznach) is a biologist, university lecturer at the University of Heidelberg, scientific-technical director of  KABS, and managing director and vice-president of the European Mosquito Control Association (EMCA).

When Harmer created her own lab, she started to investigate circadian rhythms in plants and the plant clock's function in plant physiology, which continues to be her primary scientific interest.[1][2]/nThe Harmer Lab is a research group dedicated to studying the plant circadian clock, in particular the molecular processes and physiology underlying plant development and responses to environmental stimuli. The Harmer Lab was established when Dr. Harmer was recruited to the Department of Plant Biology at the University of California, Davis.[2]/nBy using Arabidopsis thaliana and the sunflower as models, the Harmer lab focuses on understanding how molecular mechanisms in plant circadian systems control responses to a variety of environmental cues through signaling pathways and physiological timing. Some of the lab's current research projects include investigating processes by which plants respond to fluctuations in light and identifying genes and pathways involved in regulating the plant circadian clock.[2][3]/nOver time, the Harmer Lab has made several important contributions to the field of plant chronobiology:/nThe Harmer Lab also collaborates with a number of outside research groups including:/nAt the forefront of the field, plants were used as models to establish the presence of circadian rhythms in organisms. With their accurate, endogenous clock to synchronize their physiology with the cycle of day and night, plants became model organisms to study within the field.[11][12] Circadian rhythms enable plants to anticipate seasonal changes and adjust accordingly in order to promote survival and overall fitness through the facilitation of leaf movement, growth, pollination, and more.[13] A prime example of a model plant is Arabidopsis thaliana, also used by Dr. Harmer in many of her papers. Due to its relatively small and non-repetitive genome, Arabidopsis thaliana was also used to elucidate the existence of a TTFL (transcription-translation feedback loop) that facilitates the workings of an endogenous clock.[14][15]/nWhile research is still being conducted on the intricacies of the plant TFFL, many proteins and genes have been identified such as CCA1, TOC1, LHY.[13][16] CCA1 and LHY are two, relatively well-researched transcription factors that work as repressors in the plant TFFL. These repressors target genes like ELF4, LUX, TOC1, GIGANTEA (GI), and more. The combination of activators and repressors and their oscillations within the plant circadian clock ultimately control phenotypic and physiological outputs.[13][16] Such findings are foundational for Dr. Harmer's work on plant circadian rhythms and their subsequent effect on plant physiology. In many of her papers, Dr. Harmer utilizes implicated genes in the plant TFFL to conduct experiments./nHarmer found that circadian clock regulation within plants promoted physiological daily rhythms in root, leaf, and stem growth that were in direct response to a number of external cues including water availability, temperature, and light. Through various experiments and collaborations, Harmer discovered that this plant growth advantage revealed an underlying relationship with the genomic and metabolic makeup of the circadian clock\u2014contributing to current models explaining plant optimization with the environment.[17]/nThe circadian mechanism within these plants involves numerous transcription factors that contribute to multiple transcriptional feedback loops that form a highly detailed, modeled network revolving around morning and evening outputs. Harmer suggests a simpler model that incorporates morning genes including CCA1 and LHY, and afternoon genes like RVE 4,6,8 within a regulatory system to investigate the robustness of plant rhythms in the face of changing environmental conditions. This central transcriptional feedback serves as a core part of the plant circadian clock and provides clues as to how solar tracking, water efficiency, and daily growth operate in plant systems.[5][18]/nThe lab is currently exploring the role the eukaryote protein XCT to find out more about its role in stunting plant growth and regulating the circadian oscillator. With Harmer's work on the Arabidopsis thaliana, XCT has been found to rescue growth in yeast mutants.[2]/nAuxin is a hormone essential to plant growth and development. Previous studies reported that the circadian clock coordinates plant growth to external environmental cues. Thus, the Harmer lab, in collaboration with another chronobiologist (Dr. Michael Covington), sought to investigate the clock regulation of auxin. In this investigation, Harmer and Covington conclude that auxin is clock-controlled in many aspects of its regulation (auxin production, auxin carriers, auxin sensors, etc.). Specifically, Harmer utilized Arabidopsis and its promoters of known clock-regulated genes in the plant TTFL (such as CCA1 and TOC1) to record expression of firefly reporter genes also known as a luciferase assay.[19] This method allows researchers to directly record and monitor the rhythmicity of circadian genes in plants./nDr. Harmer investigated the effects of auxin dosage on the rhythmic expression in Arabidopsis. She found that exogenous application of the auxin IAA to plants causes a lengthening of the plants' free-running period.[19] This dosage was also consistent when the luciferase assay was applied to other clock-associated promoters such as Gigantea (GI), CAB2, CCR2, and ELF3. Dr. Harmer then investigated circadian control over auxin signaling and its outputs such as plant growth. Harmer focused on the auxin-induced growth of the plant stem, specifically the hypocotyl. Under controlled conditions, Harmer recorded the rhythmic elongation of the stems in control and IAA-treated plants. She concluded that plants treated with exogenous auxin IAA had enhanced growth.[19] She further affirmed previous studies, stating that plant sensitivity to auxin varied with time of day, by displaying that the variable sensitivity is also a plant response regulated by circadian auxin transcriptional and growth responses.[19] Thus, by using these techniques, Dr. Harmer and Dr. Covington were able to conclude that plant responses to both endogenous auxin and exogenous auxin are regulated and controlled by the plant circadian clock. Such a link between the circadian clock and auxin signaling had never been documented before and broadened the field by connecting these two important mechanisms./nHarmer discovered that the circadian clock controls Arabidopsis seedlings\u2019 sensitivity, which was influenced by auxin; sensitive reaction to auxin was different depending on the time of day. Building off this work, Harmer wondered about the significance of circadian clock and auxin signaling network on plant growth, so she studied circadian clock in sunflower heliotropism, or solar tracking. The sunflower's long stem made it easy to identify its heliotropism. Following the sun's location, the sunflower's leaves and stems moved from east to west during light. Anticipating sunrise, the flowers moved from west to east during dark; thus, the plant clock played a role in heliotropism.[20]/nSince the sunflowers did not have pulvini, organs that controlled solar tracking for other plants, Harmer hypothesized that stem growth may cause heliotropism. She monitored growth of stems and solar tracking in ''dwarf2'' (dw2) sunflowers, which lack gibberellin growth hormones. Due to this deficiency, dw2 sunflowers have short stems and no heliotropism. After treating these flowers with gibberellin hormones, heliotropism was restored. As a result, this day and night movement was caused by the stem's elongation.[21]/nHarmer further hypothesized that heliotropism occurs from the irregular growth rates on the opposite sides of the stem. On the east side, the stem had more growth during the day and less growth during the night, but on the west side, the stem experienced the opposite. This contrast indicated that the east side of the stem lengthened during day and the west side lengthened during night, which enabled it to move east to west during day and west to east at night. This uneven growth was controlled by genes influenced by light and circadian rhythm. Harmer's findings showed how circadian rhythms regulated the sunflowers movement during light and dark.[21]/nCurrently, Harmer is interested in understanding the molecular mechanism behind the sunflower's growth rates. Current reports suggest that certain pathways control the stem's movements during day and night.[20]/nHarmer expanded her findings to search for the circadian clock's role in flower development and pollination. Sunflower heads are made up of hundreds or thousands of florets, or small individual flowers that are clustered to form a flower structure, which is a capitulum. To allow outcrossing, the florets constantly change their sex. From the outside to inside of the head, the florets are the oldest to youngest in development. In the capitulum, three to four rings of florets grow at the same time and day.[20]/nHarmer hypothesized that the specific time of sunflower anthesis, the opening of the flower, could involve a circadian regulator. To test her theory, she monitored the sunflower capitula in constant darkness. The circadian rhythms of ovary and stamen continued to free run, while florets bloomed every 24 hours similar to their anthesis during light-dark cycles. The daily rhythms and floret growth without environmental distractions suggested the control from the circadian clock.[21][22]/nCircadian processes maintain temperature compensation. During constant darkness at 18\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, the ovary and stamen development maintained free-running rhythms. The general periods of these growths were similar across all temperatures. The internal, rhythmic activity that modulated floret's anthesis was temperature-compensated, further pushing the hypothesis on the plant clock. Based on her studies, Harmer concluded that the circadian clock, light, and temperature signals modulate the developmental timing of florets. Harmer continues to investigate the pathways that control when late-stage florets grow. Her findings opened up the possibility that the floret's anthesis may seduce pollinators, thus encouraging reproductive performance.[21][22]/nHarmer has also investigated the interplay of internal and external cues in Arabidopsis circadian rhythms. Specifically, Harmer discovered dual modes of regulation of the phytochrome-interacting proteins PIF4 and PIF5, which promote plant growth, by the internal circadian clock at the transcript level and external light at the protein level. Her findings provide a framework for explaining how internal and external cues regulate rhythmic phenotypes such as plant growth.[23]/nHarmer is the recipient of several honors, both from professional societies and her institution:", "67895395": "Melissa Cristina M\u00e1rquez is a Puerto Rican marine biologist and science communicator.

He was a native of Eresos in Lesbos.[4] His given name was \u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (T\u00fartamos); his nickname \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (The\u00f3phrastos) was given by Aristotle, his teacher, for his \"divine style of expression\"./nHe came to Athens at a young age and initially studied in Plato's school. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle who took to Theophrastus in his writings. When Aristotle fled Athens, Theophrastus took over as head of the Lyceum.[4] Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly. He is often considered the father of botany for his works on plants.[5] After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was Strato of Lampsacus./nThe interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, including biology, physics, ethics and metaphysics. His two surviving botanical works, Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum) and On the Causes of Plants, were an important influence on Renaissance science. There are also surviving works On Moral Characters, On Sense Perception, and On Stones, as well as fragments on Physics and Metaphysics. In philosophy, he studied grammar and language and continued Aristotle's work on logic. He also regarded space as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, time as an accident of motion, and motion as a necessary consequence of all activity.[citation needed] In ethics, he regarded happiness as depending on external influences as well as on virtue./nMost of the biographical information about Theophrastus was provided by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius' Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus's time.[6] He was a native of Eresos in Lesbos.[7] His given name was Tyrtamus (\u03a4\u03cd\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2), but he later became known by the nickname \"Theophrastus\", given to him, it is said, by Aristotle to indicate the grace of his conversation (from Ancient Greek \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 'god' and \u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd 'to phrase', i.e. divine expression).[8]/nAfter receiving instruction in philosophy on Lesbos from one Alcippus, he moved to Athens, where he may have studied under Plato.[a] He became friends with Aristotle, and when Plato died (348/7 BC) Theophrastus may have joined Aristotle in his self-imposed exile from Athens. When Aristotle moved to Mytilene on Lesbos in 345/4, it is very likely that he did so at the urging of Theophrastus.[9] It seems that it was on Lesbos that Aristotle and Theophrastus began their research into natural science, with Aristotle studying animals and Theophrastus studying plants.[10] Theophrastus probably accompanied Aristotle to Macedonia when Aristotle was appointed tutor to Alexander the Great in 343/2.[9] Around 335 BC, Theophrastus moved with Aristotle to Athens, where Aristotle began teaching in the Lyceum. When, after the death of Alexander, anti-Macedonian feeling forced Aristotle to leave Athens, Theophrastus remained behind as head (scholarch) of the Peripatetic school,[9] a position he continued to hold after Aristotle's death in 322/1./nAristotle in his will made him guardian of his children, including Nicomachus, with whom he was close.[b] Aristotle likewise bequeathed to him his library and the originals of his works,[c] and designated him as his successor at the Lyceum.[11] Eudemus of Rhodes also had some claims to this position, and Aristoxenus is said to have resented Aristotle's choice.[12]/nTheophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-five years,[13] and died at the age of eighty-five according to Diogenes.[14][d]\nHe is said to have remarked, \"We die just when we are beginning to live\".[15]/nUnder his guidance the school flourished greatly\u2014there were at one period more than 2000 students, Diogenes affirms[16]\u2014and at his death, according to the terms of his will preserved by Diogenes, he bequeathed to it his garden with house and colonnades as a permanent seat of instruction. The comic poet Menander was among his pupils.[16] His popularity was shown in the regard paid to him by Philip, Cassander, and Ptolemy, and by the complete failure of a charge of impiety brought against him.[17][18] He was honored with a public funeral, and \"the whole population of Athens, honouring him greatly, followed him to the grave.\"[12][19] He was succeeded as head of the Lyceum by Strato of Lampsacus./nFrom the lists of Diogenes, giving 227 titles, it appears that the activity of Theophrastus extended over the whole field of contemporary knowledge. His writing probably differed little from Aristotle's treatment of the same themes, though supplementary in details. Like Aristotle, most of his writings are lost works.[12] Thus Theophrastus, like Aristotle, had composed a first and second Analytic (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd and \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd).[20] He had also written books on Topics (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b7\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd, \u03a4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd and \u03a4\u1f70 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd);[21] on the Analysis of Syllogisms (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd and \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2), on Sophisms (\u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd) and on Affirmation and Denial (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2)[22] as well as on the Natural Philosophy (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2, \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd, \u03a6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd and others), on Heaven (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6), and on Meteorological Phenomena (\u03a4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 and \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd).[23]/nIn addition, Theophrastus wrote on the Warm and the Cold (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6),[24] on Water (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f55\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), Fire (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u00f3\u03c2),[25] the Sea (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2),[25] on Coagulation and Melting (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03ae\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd), on various phenomena of organic and spiritual life,[25] and on the Soul (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2), on Experience (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) and On Sense Perception (also known as On the Senses; \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd).[26] Likewise, we find mention of monographs of Theophrastus on the early Greek philosophers Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Archelaus,[27] Diogenes of Apollonia, Democritus,[28] which were made use of by Simplicius; and also on Xenocrates,[29] against the Academics,[30] and a sketch of the political doctrine of Plato.[28]/nHe studied general history, as we know from Plutarch's lives of Lycurgus, Solon, Aristides, Pericles, Nicias, Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus, and Demosthenes, which were probably borrowed from the work on Lives (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03bd).[20] But his main efforts were to continue the labours of Aristotle in natural history. This is testified to not only by a number of treatises on individual subjects of zoology, of which, besides the titles, only fragments remain, but also by his books On Stones, his Enquiry into Plants, and On the Causes of Plants (see below), which have come down to us entire. In politics, also, he seems to have trodden in the footsteps of Aristotle.

Hort remarks.[6] \"There is no literary charm; the sentences are mostly compressed and highly elliptical, to the point sometimes of obscurity\".[6] The text of these fragments and extracts is often so corrupt that there is a certain plausibility to the well-known story that the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus were allowed to languish in the cellar of Neleus of Scepsis and his descendants.[44]/nThe most important of his books are two large botanical treatises, Enquiry into Plants (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, generally known as Historia Plantarum), and On the Causes of Plants (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd, Latin: De causis plantarum), which constitute the most important contribution to botanical science during antiquity and the Middle Ages,[12] the first systemization of the botanical world; on the strength of these works some, following Linnaeus, call him the \"father of botany\".[10]/nThe Enquiry into Plants was originally ten books, of which nine survive. The work is arranged into a system whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc.[45] The first book deals with the parts of plants; the second book with the reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; the sixth book deals with shrubs and spiny plants; the seventh book deals with herbs; the eighth book deals with plants that produce edible seeds; and the ninth book deals with plants that produce useful juices, gums, resins, etc.[45]/nOn the Causes of Plants was originally eight books, of which six survive. It concerns the growth of plants; the influences on their fecundity; the proper times they should be sown and reaped; the methods of preparing the soil, manuring it, and the use of tools; and of the smells, tastes, and properties of many types of plants.[45] The work deals mainly with the economical uses of plants rather than their medicinal uses, although the latter is sometimes mentioned.[45] A book on wines and a book on plant smells may have once been part of the complete work.[46]/nAlthough these works contain many absurd and fabulous statements, they include valuable observations concerning the functions and properties of plants.[45] Theophrastus observed the process of germination and recognized the significance of climate to plants. Much of the information on the Greek plants may have come from his own observations, as he is known to have travelled throughout Greece, and to have had a botanical garden of his own; but the works also profit from the reports on plants of Asia brought back from those who followed Alexander the Great:/nto the reports of Alexander's followers he owed his accounts of such plants as the cotton-plant, banyan, pepper, cinnamon, myrrh, and frankincense.[6]/nTheophrastus's Enquiry into Plants was first published in a Latin translation by Theodore Gaza, at Treviso, 1483;[e] in its original Greek it first appeared from the press of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495\u201398, from a third-rate manuscript, which, like the majority of the manuscripts that were sent to printers' workshops in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, has disappeared.[f] Christian Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas in the Vatican Library, which was not made known to J. G. Schneider, who made the first modern critical edition, 1818\u201321, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France./nHis book Characters (\u1f28\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1f76 \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2) contains thirty brief outlines of moral types. They are the first recorded attempt at systematic character writing. The book has been regarded by some as an independent work; others incline to the view that the sketches were written from time to time by Theophrastus, and collected and edited after his death; others, again, regard the Characters as part of a larger systematic work, but the style of the book is against this. Theophrastus has found many imitators in this kind of writing, notably Joseph Hall (1608), Sir Thomas Overbury (1614\u201316), Bishop Earle (1628), and Jean de La Bruy\u00e8re (1688), who also translated the Characters.[12] George Eliot also took inspiration from Theophrastus's Characters, most notably in her book of caricatures, Impressions of Theophrastus Such. Writing the \"character sketch\" as a scholastic exercise also originated in Theophrastus's typology.[citation needed]/nA treatise On Sense Perception (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd) and its objects is important for a knowledge of the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by Priscian of Lydia in the sixth century.[45] With this type of work we may connect the fragments on Smells, on Fatigue, on Dizziness, on Sweat, on Swooning, on Palsy, and on Honey.[44]/nFragments of a History of Physics (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f31\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd) are extant. To this class of work belong the still extant sections on Fire, on the Winds, and on the signs of Waters, Winds, and Storms.[48]/nVarious smaller scientific fragments have been collected in the editions of Johann Gottlob Schneider (1818\u201321) and Friedrich Wimmer (1842\u201362) and in Hermann Usener's Analecta Theophrastea.[12]/nThe Metaphysics (anachronistic Greek title: \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac),[49] in nine chapters (also known as On First Principles), was considered a fragment of a larger work by Usener in his edition (Theophrastos, Metaphysica, Bonn, 1890), but according to Ross and Fobes in their edition (Theophrastus, Metaphysica, Oxford, 1929), the treatise is complete (p.\u00a0X) and this opinion is now widely accepted. There is no reason for assigning this work to some other author because it is not noticed in Hermippus and Andronicus, especially as Nicolaus of Damascus had already mentioned it.[44]/nIn his treatise On Stones (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd), which would become a source for other  lapidaries until at least the Renaissance,[50] Theophrastus classified rocks and gems based on their behavior when heated, further grouping minerals by common properties, such as amber and magnetite, which both have the power of attraction.[51][52][53]/nTheophrastus describes different marbles; mentions coal, which he says is used for heating by metal-workers; describes the various metal ores; and knew that pumice stones had a volcanic origin. He also deals with precious stones, emeralds, amethysts, onyx, jasper, etc., and describes a variety of \"sapphire\" that was blue with veins of gold, and thus was presumably lapis lazuli.[51]/nHe knew that pearls came from shellfish, that coral came from India, and speaks of the fossilized remains of organic life.[51] He also considers the practical uses of various stones, such as the minerals necessary for the manufacture of glass; for the production of various pigments of paint such as ochre; and for the manufacture of plaster.[51]/nMany of the rarer minerals were found in mines, and Theophrastus mentions the famous copper mines of Cyprus and the even more famous silver mines, presumably of Laurium near Athens \u2013 the basis of the wealth of the city \u2013 as well as referring to gold mines. The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a fixed sum and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century BCE the output fell, partly owing to the Spartan occupation of Decelea from c.\u2009413 BCE. But the mines continued to be worked, though Strabo (c.\u200964 BCE to c.\u200924 CE) records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and Pausanias (c.\u2009110 to c.\u2009180) speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work On Mining,[24] which \u2013 like most of his writings \u2013 is a lost work./nPliny the Elder makes clear references to his use of On Stones in his Naturalis Historia of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on minerals himself. Although Pliny's treatment of the subject is more extensive, Theophrastus is more systematic and his work is comparatively free from fable and magic,[54] although he did describe lyngurium, a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the lynx (the best ones coming from wild males), which featured in many lapidaries until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.[55]\nIt is mistakenly attributed to Theophrastus the first record of pyroelectricity. The misconception arose soon after the discovery of the pyroelectric properties of tourmaline, which made mineralogists of the time associate the lyngurium with it.[56] Lyngurium is described in the work of Theophrastus as being similar to amber, capable of attracting \"straws and bits of wood\", but without specifying any pyroelectric properties.[57]/nThe extent to which Theophrastus followed Aristotle's doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss of so many of his writings.[44] Many of his opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius.[58]/nTheophrastus seems to have carried out still further the grammatical foundation of logic and rhetoric, since in his book on the elements of speech, he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 kuria lexis) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7 pathe) of speech.[59] He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (\u03c3\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 schisis) to things (\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 pragmata) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.[60]/nHe wrote at length on the unity of judgment,[61] on the different kinds of negation,[62] and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity.[63] In his doctrine of syllogisms he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the modi of the syllogisms,[64] partly in the proof of them,[65] partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion.[66] Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them;[67] and further, with hypothetical conclusions.[68] For the doctrine of proof, Galen quotes the second Analytic of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine.[69] In different monographs he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of science. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his Topics, that the principles of opposites are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus.[70] For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the Topica of Theophrastus.[71] Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas,[72] which, without doubt, corresponded to book \u0395 of Aristotle's Metaphysics.[44]/nTheophrastus introduced his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being corporeal and composite, requires principles,[73] and first and foremost, motion, as the basis of all change.[74] Denying the substance of space, he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position (taxis and thesis) of bodies.[75] Time he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion.[76] He attacked the doctrine of the four classical elements and challenged whether fire could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.[77]/nHe departed more widely from Aristotle in his doctrine of motion, since on the one hand he extended it over all categories, and did not limit it to those laid down by Aristotle.[78] He viewed motion, with Aristotle, as an activity, not carrying its own goal in itself (ateles), of that which only potentially exists,[79] but he opposed Aristotle's view that motion required a special explanation, and he regarded it as something proper both to nature in general and the celestial system in particular:/nSurely, then, if the life in animals does not need explanation or is to be explained only in this way, may it not be the case that in the heavens too, and in the heavenly bodies, movement does not need explanation or is to be explained in a special way?/nHe recognised no activity without motion,[81] and so referred all activities of the soul to motion: the desires and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment (kriseis) and contemplation to spiritual motion.[82] The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet he appears to have contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it.[83] Other Peripatetics, like Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and especially Strato, developed further this naturalism in Aristotelian doctrine./nTheophrastus seems, generally speaking, where the investigation overstepped the limits of experience, to have preferred to develop the difficulties rather than solve them, as is especially apparent in his Metaphysics.[44] He was doubtful of Aristotle's teleology and recommended that such ideas be used with caution:/nWith regard to the view that all things are for the sake of an end and nothing is in vain, the assignation of ends is in general not easy, as it is usually stated to be ... we must set certain limits to purposiveness and to the effort after the best, and not assert it to exist in all cases without qualification./nHe did not follow the incessant attempts by Aristotle to refer phenomena to their ultimate foundations, or his attempts to unfold the internal connections between the latter, and between them and phenomena.[44] In antiquity, it was a subject of complaint that Theophrastus had not expressed himself with precision and consistency respecting God, and had understood it at one time as Heaven, at another an (enlivening) breath (pneuma).[85]/nTheophrastus did not allow a happiness resting merely upon virtue,[86] or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of morality. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend,[87] and had allowed in prosperity the existence of an influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the Callisthenes, \"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom\" (vitam regit fortuna non sapientia).[88] That in the definition of pleasure, likewise, he did not coincide with Aristotle, seems to be indicated by the titles of two of his writings, one of which dealt with pleasure generally, the other with pleasure as Aristotle had defined it.[24] Although, like his teacher, he preferred contemplative (theoretical), to active (practical) life,[89] he preferred to set the latter free from the restraints of family life, etc. in a manner of which Aristotle would not have approved.[90]/nTheophrastus was opposed to eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. Non-human animals, he said, can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do.[91]/nThe marble herm figure with the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the explicit inscription, must be taken as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome.[g] This bust was formerly in the collection of marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L. Massimi at the time the engraving was made. It is now in the Villa Albani, Rome (inv. 1034).

Pharmacology of sex steroid receptors. Some androgens are estrogenic when they interact with estrogen receptors (ER) (1-3). As early as 1972, Henri Rochefort showed that antiestrogens inhibit tumor growth via ERs, which then facilitated their routine use in the treatment of positive ER breast cancers. Discovery of a metabolite with a high affinity for RE, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which is produced in vivo and accumulated in RE positive cancers. A mutation of the enzyme activating tamoxifen by hydroxylation is responsible for some innate tamoxifen resistance in patients treated for breast cancer. Antiestrogens also inhibit the effect of growth factors in the absence of estrogens. RU 486, a progesterone antagonist, inhibits the growth of breast cancer via the progesterone receptor, suggesting the value of anti-progestins for the treatment of antiestrogen-resistant breast cancers expressing this receptor./n2. By specifying the mechanism of estrogen mitogenic action in breast cancer lines, Henri Rochefort and his team discovered cathepsin D (cathe D) as an actor in tumor progression.\u00a0 (17-33) As early as 1980, H. Rochefort with F Vignon introduced the notion of autocrine regulation by mitogenic factors secreted and induced by estrogens.[1][2] He focused the activity of his research unit on a 52 kilo-dalton glycoprotein, induced by estrogens and growth factors; secreted in excess by breast cancer cells and endowed with autocrine mitogenic activity.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] With monoclonal antibodies, developed with Sanofi, an assay of 52 K protein in breast cancer extracts in several retrospective double-blind studies showed in a totally unexpected way that high concentrations of this protein in the primary tumor predicted the subsequent development of clinical metastases (an example of serendipity).[7][8][9]/nThe 52k protein was then identified as the precursor of cathepsin D (cathept D) a lysosomal protease diverted into the extracellular matrix.[5][6]/nHenri Rochefort has clarified the mechanism of its transcriptional regulation by estrogens and its deregulation in breast cancers leading to its secretion.[11][12][13][14][15] Pro cath D acts, depending on the pH of the extracellular tumor medium, as a protease or as the ligand of a membrane receptor to facilitate the survival and growth of micro-metastases that have escaped from the tumor before its removal. After confirmation in many Centres around the world, Cathedral D has become the first example of a protease, the measurement of which in the primary tumor has a prognostic value.[6][13] Its overexpression after transfection of the D-cath gene into tumor cells increases their metastatic power in athymic mice. Conversely, the inhibition of its production by transfection of anti-sense RNA into breast cancer cells inhibits their growth and metastatic power in these mice. (29-32) Thus, cath D is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancers, mainly triple-negative cancers[18] as well as other solid tumors that overexpress it, such as colorectal cancer and melanoma.[6][13]/n3.

He is introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a half-giant and half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures professor, and is later revealed to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix. A loyal, friendly, softhearted personality who is easily brought to tears, he is also known for his thick West Country accent./nHagrid was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane in all eight Harry Potter films, from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 in 2011.[1]/nHagrid was among the characters that Rowling says she created on \"the very first day\".[2] She has explained the source of his name as \"another old English word, meaning\u00a0\u2013 if you were hagrid\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s a dialect word\u00a0\u2013 you\u2019d had a bad night.

According to Goring, Hagrid\u2019s \"dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality.\" She also claims that Hagrid is physically \"modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who\u2019d swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair\".[5]/nThe character of Hagrid and conversations between him, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger in his hut are expository through the series, due to the fact that the trio frequently discover things about Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts by talking with Hagrid, as he has a habit of letting slip bits of information that were specifically confided to him. He was also one of the first characters to imply that the idea of thinking of wizards as \"pure-bloods\" and \"half-bloods\" is a dated concept./nRowling has stated in an interview that Hagrid was in Gryffindor house during his time as a student.[6] When he comes into possession of an acromantula, he is expelled from Hogwarts as his pet is believed to be the \"monster of Slytherin\". However, persuaded by Dumbledore (who at the time was Transfiguration teacher), Headmaster Armando Dippet agrees to train Hagrid as gamekeeper, allowing the boy to remain at Hogwarts. By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means \"that he will let you in and out of Hogwarts.\"[7] Part of his job includes leading the first years across the lake in boats, upon their initial arrival at Hogwarts./nWhen discussing the killing off of characters in her books, Rowling said that she always knew she was \"working towards the point where Hagrid carried Harry out alive\u00a0\u2013 but supposedly dead\u00a0\u2013 out of the forest\". She said she had planned from very early on that Harry would walk to his death accompanied by the 'ghosts', and that \"he would emerge in Hagrid's arms\".

She also liked the circular notion of Hagrid both bringing Harry into the world, and then bringing him back from the dead.[8]/nHagrid is introduced in the opening chapter of the first novel. Following the death of James and Lily Potter, Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with rescuing the infant Harry from his parents' house after they have been murdered by Lord Voldemort. When Minerva McGonagall expresses her concern about the fact that it was Hagrid who would carry Harry to the Dursleys', Dumbledore says that he would trust Hagrid with his life, a fact that is demonstrated several times during the series, as Dumbledore frequently asks him to carry out secret tasks. Ten years later, he is tasked to bring the Philosopher\u2019s Stone from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and provides the three-headed dog Fluffy to guard it. Dumbledore also gives him the task of locating Harry, helping him to find his bearings in the wizarding world and to buy his school things. Hagrid is the first member of the Hogwarts staff to be introduced to Harry before he began attending the school. Hagrid later becomes friends with Ron and Hermione as well. Later in the book, a hooded person (Quirinus Quirrell in disguise) gives him a dragon egg to elicit details about Fluffy. Hagrid lets slip to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that the way to get past Fluffy is to play music, for which they use the flute Hagrid himself carved for Harry, which allows them to pursue the potential thief. The three also assist Hagrid after the dragon egg hatches, by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to live in a dragon sanctuary in Romania where Ron\u2019s older brother, Charlie Weasley, works./nReaders first discover why Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in the second novel. It is revealed that Hagrid was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Marvolo Riddle, the wizard who later became Lord Voldemort. Hagrid was expelled during his third year, after being caught in the company of Aragog, a dangerous acromantula: this already serious crime seemed worse than it was, due to the belief that the acromantula was \u201cThe Monster of Slytherin\u201d, and that Hagrid had released it from the Chamber of Secrets and allowed it to attack students. Aragog escapes into the dark forest and starts a colony of spiders. The belief of Hagrid's guilt was encouraged by Tom Riddle, the actual criminal, who had been using the true monster (a basilisk) to attack students, and who had framed Hagrid to prevent the school from being closed, because he didn't want to return to the orphanage whence he had come. During the events of the second book, the Basilisk is unleashed once again and Hagrid is sent to the prison of Azkaban, as he is believed again to be responsible for the attacks. However, before being arrested, Hagrid tells Harry and Ron to \"follow the spiders\", so that they can meet Aragog and discover the identity of the true monster. After Harry defeats the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets and uncovers the truth, Hagrid is freed from prison./nFollowing the resignation of Silvanus Kettleburn, who, according to Dumbledore, wanted to spend time with his remaining limbs, Hagrid is assigned to teach the subject of Care of Magical Creatures in the third novel. He is also allowed to perform magic again since his name has been cleared after the events of the previous book.[citation needed] During his first class, in which he introduces the hippogriffs to third-years, one of the beasts, Buckbeak, attacks Draco Malfoy after the boy insults it. Although Dumbledore manages to prove that Hagrid is innocent, the Ministry of Magic sentences Buckbeak to death. Thus, Hagrid's classes become extremely boring, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend some time looking for information that would help Hagrid in Buckbeak\u2019s defence. Near the end of the book Hermione and Harry use a time-turner to save Buckbeak from death and Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss./nIn the fourth novel it is revealed that Hagrid is of mixed wizard and giant parentage, his mother having been the giantess Fridwulfa, who left his wizard father when Hagrid was a baby. Since giants have a reputation for being brutal, and were once allies of Voldemort, Hagrid keeps his parentage a secret and allows people to imagine other reasons for his great size (such as drinking a bottle of Skele-Gro when he did not need it). Hagrid\u2019s parentage is exposed in the Daily Prophet by Rita Skeeter, who portrays him as dangerous (because of his fascination for aggressive creatures) and incompetent. Hagrid is gravely affected by this and attempts to resign from his post as teacher, though Dumbledore does not accept his resignation. During the novel, Hagrid develops a romantic interest with Olympe Maxime\u00a0\u2013 another half-giant witch and Headmistress of the French magic school Beauxbatons. Hagrid is also one of the very few people who, since the beginning, believes Harry\u2019s word that he did not apply to enter the Triwizard Tournament. Later in the book, Barty Crouch Jr (disguised as Alastor Moody) suggests Hagrid should show Harry that the first task of the Tournament would involve dragons. Hagrid also provides Blast-Ended Skrewts for the third task./nHagrid is absent during the first part of the fifth novel. The character later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also found the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort\u2019s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime\u2019s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid\u2019s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring home with them. Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore and part giant, Umbridge being highly prejudiced against non-humans. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore\u2019s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts./nIn the sixth novel, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer students of Care of Magical Creatures, and Hagrid is both angry and disappointed with them during the first part of the book, but he soon realises that it is not because they do not like him. Later in the novel, Aragog dies, and Hagrid risks his life to recover the Acromantula's body to give it a proper funeral. After the funeral, he and Horace Slughorn drink excessive amounts of Firewhisky, and Harry takes advantage of this situation (under the influence of Felix Felicis potion, otherwise known as \"liquid luck\") to retrieve a certain memory from Slughorn. Towards the end of the book, Death Eaters attack Hogwarts and Hagrid's hut is set on fire as he tries to fight them.  During Dumbledore\u2019s funeral, Hagrid is seen carrying the Headmaster\u2019s body./nIn the seventh novel, Hagrid is part of the Order of the Phoenix delegation assigned to remove Harry from the Dursleys' home to the magic-protected Burrow. Hagrid takes Harry on the flying motorcycle he inherited from Sirius but the plan goes awry when the Order delegation is ambushed by Death Eaters. The pair narrowly make it to the Burrow after being attacked by Voldemort himself. After attending Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding reception, Hagrid does not appear again until near the end of the book when it is revealed he has been driven into hiding in the mountains by the new Death Eater regime at Hogwarts./nDuring the climactic battle, Hagrid attempts to come to the defence of Aragog's carnivorous children, who have been driven out of the Forbidden Forest by the Death Eaters and are now attacking both Hogwarts defenders and Death Eaters indiscriminately, but he is carried off by a swarm of them. He later turns up, captive in the Death Eaters' camp, when Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort. Hagrid is forced to carry Harry back to the school, not realising that Harry has survived again, and en route accuses the watching Centaurs of not doing enough to help. The Centaurs soon afterward join the fray and Hagrid takes part in the second half of the battle, felling his main nemesis among the Death Eaters, the magical-creature executioner Walden Macnair./nAccording to Rowling, the scene in the final book in which Hagrid is seen carrying Harry\u2019s apparently dead body is very significant as \"Hagrid brings Harry from the Dursleys. He takes him into the wizarding world ... He was sort of his guardian and his guide ... And now I wanted Hagrid to be the one to lead Harry out of the forest.\"[9] Rowling also commented that Hagrid was never in danger of dying, as she \"always had that picture in my head of the huge gigantic Hagrid walking through the forest crying with Harry in his arms\".[10]/nNineteen years after Voldemort\u2019s defeat, Hagrid is still at Hogwarts and invites Harry and Ginny Weasley's second son Albus Severus Potter to his hut for tea, just as he had once done for Harry himself, implying that he and Harry are still close. During an interview in 2007, when asked if Hagrid did marry, Rowling answered that Hagrid developed a relationship with a giantess but it did not work out.[11]/nScottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid in all of the film adaptations of the Harry Potter novels.[12] Robin Williams was interested for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the \"all-British and Irish cast\" policy.[13][14] Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start,[13] responding \"RobbieColtraneforHagrid\" all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices.[15][16] Coltrane was already a fan of the books[17] and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was \"a fantastic thing\".[18] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role.[17][19] She also stated that \"Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have\u00a0\u2013 you really do have to sense\u00a0\u2013 a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly.\"[16]/nFormer English rugby union player Martin Bayfield portrayed Hagrid as a stunt performer in longer shots due to his large size to emphasise Hagrid\u2019s height. Bayfield also appeared as a young Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets./nEnglish actor Greg Draven portrayed Hagrid as an acting double in rollercoaster Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure pre-show. Draven's performance was required due to Coltrane's poor health at the time of filming.[20][21]/nIn Philosopher\u2019s Stone, Hagrid is mentioned as being twice as tall as the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being 8\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (2.59\u00a0m) and in later books he is said to be three times as wide.[citation needed] Hagrid is known for his thick West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In Order of the Phoenix, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of Half-Blood Prince, during the chapter Flight of the Prince, withstanding a Death Eater\u2019s powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.[22]/nHe has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in Philosopher\u2019s Stone. He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in Philosopher\u2019s Stone, he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a \"crackpot old fool\"). He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of Hagrid, \"Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. He\u2019s like the king of the forest, or the Green Man. He\u2019s this semi-wild person who lives on the edge of the forest\".[23]/nFollowing his expulsion from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrid\u2019s oak wand and forbade him to perform magic.[24] Hagrid keeps the pieces of his wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since he is not a fully qualified wizard, he \"will always be a bit inept\" as compared to other adult wizards,[citation needed] but \"occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, by bringing off more impressive bits of magic\".[25] However, he is unable to produce a Patronus.[26] He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant blood. For example, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many of the stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed him to bend the barrel of a shotgun with one hand./nGrawp is the giant half-brother of Hagrid. Grawp and Hagrid were born of the same mother, the giantess Fridwulfa.[27] Grawp is about 16 feet (4.9\u00a0m) tall, which Hagrid claims is small for a giant. His knuckles are the size of cricket balls (~225\u00a0mm (8.9\u00a0in) in circumference). The other giants were bullying Grawp because of his diminutive size, and this is a factor in Hagrid\u2019s decision to bring him to the Forbidden Forest. Big and dim, he only knows a few words in English and his manners are wild and unpredictable, but he is also a child in giant years. In the film, this is elaborated on more as he is visibly portrayed as a big, excitable child who simply doesn't know his own strength or developed proper social cues yet. He responds to Hermione, who approaches him like a strict but caring mother figure, scolding him when doing something wrong, but giving him praise and playing with him when he does something good./nAt first, Grawp seems indifferent to his brother\u2019s attempts to civilise him, preferring to spend his time tearing down trees. After Hagrid leaves Hogwarts to avoid being imprisoned, he leaves Grawp in the care of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Much to their surprise, when they find themselves trapped in the forest during a confrontation with the local centaur population, Grawp inadvertently manages to divert the centaurs' attention from Harry and Hermione while looking for Hagrid, whom he calls 'Hagger'./nIn the Half-Blood Prince, Grawp is moved to the mountains, where he is apparently progressing much better. He also attends Dumbledore\u2019s funeral with Hagrid, much more civil and calm than before, and dressed formally. He also appears to understand emotions, at least to some extent, as he pats Hagrid\u2019s head to comfort him./nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Grawp, Hagrid, and Fang go into hiding after Hagrid throws a \"Support Harry Potter\" party and it is implied that Grawp helped them all escape. He is the only giant fighting on the good wizards' side in the Battle of Hogwarts, probably in an attempt to protect Hagrid, as he frequently calls his name while fighting the giants on the Death Eaters' side. Grawp participates in the victory celebration over Voldemort's defeat (albeit from a window, since he is too big to fit into the hall), and the Hogwarts students show their appreciation by tossing food into his laughing mouth./nIn the film adaptation of the fifth book Grawp is computer-generated using a new \"soul capturing\" process from Image Metrics.[28] Andrew Whitehead spent 18 months working on the giant Grawp for the film.[29] Grawp is voiced and motion-captured by Tony Maudsley.[30]/nIn the Goblet of Fire, the truth about Hagrid\u2019s parents is revealed: his father, who is never named in the stories, married a giantess, Fridwulfa. Fridwulfa left Rubeus to his father\u2019s care after his birth; according to Hagrid, she was not very maternal. Later she gave birth to Grawp. She died long before Hagrid returned to the giants in the Order of the Phoenix. Hagrid describes his father as \"a tiny little man\" whom he could pick up with one hand and place on the dresser at the age of six. Hagrid clearly felt great affection for him; in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, he says that his father\u2019s death when Hagrid was in third year at Hogwarts was one of his saddest memories./nHagrid keeps and has kept a variety of pets, including some which the Wizarding community considers impossible to domesticate. They are not always wrong. Rowling has said that Hagrid has little interest in tamer magical creatures because of the lack of a challenge,[citation needed] although he has a large but cowardly boarhound named Fang. Hagrid\u2019s love of dangerous magical creatures is central to the plot of several books of the series./nAragog was an Acromantula, an enormous, sentient spider capable of speech, who made a unique clicking noise as he moved in search of prey. Hagrid raised Aragog from an egg as a Hogwarts student, keeping him inside a cupboard. In his third year at Hogwarts, Hagrid was caught talking to Aragog in the dungeons by Tom Riddle, who alleged that Aragog was the \"Monster of Slytherin\", and that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, it was Riddle who had opened the Chamber, and the monster was actually a basilisk./nAfter Hagrid's expulsion and assignment as gamekeeper, Aragog lived in the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid found him a mate, Mosag, with whom Aragog bore an entire colony of giant spiders. He remained grateful to Hagrid for his entire life, and kept his carnivorous children from attacking him when he came to visit (to bring him and his family food). This courtesy was not extended to other creatures and people, even when they were friends of Hagrid's; he allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang when they encountered him in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Hagrid led Harry and Ron to Aragog by giving them the cryptic advice, \"follow the spiders\". An aging Aragog reveals to Harry and Ron Hagrid's innocence and the discovery of a girl's corpse in the bathroom, before giving them a clue of the Chamber's resident monster; it was born in the castle, and his species never speak of the creature nor give its name, despite Hagrid's numerous inquiries, as they fear it above all others. Though Aragog allowed his children to attack Harry, Ron, and Fang, they were saved at the last minute by Ron's father Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia, which had been lost in the forest months before. Aragog remained in the Forbidden Forest for the rest of his life, but eventually died of old age in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Hagrid retrieved Aragog\u2019s body from the forest so that he could give him a proper burial, fearing that his children would devour his body. From that point on, the spider colony was the only part of the Forbidden Forest that Hagrid could not enter safely./nAragog\u2019s children returned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows during the Battle at Hogwarts; having been driven from the forest, they began attacking Death Eaters and Hogwarts' inhabitants indiscriminately. Hagrid\u2019s love of the spiders endangered him and others because he tried to protect them; the spiders thanked Hagrid by capturing him and taking him to Voldemort. It is unknown what happens to them afterwards./nAragog was voiced by Julian Glover in the film adaptation of the Chamber of Secrets. In 2017, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of \"Harry Potter\" franchise, arachnologists Anton A. Nadolny and Alireza Zamani named a new species of Iranian wolf spiders (Lycosidae) after Aragog, as Lycosa aragogi. The single specimen was collected on 26 April 2016, just over 19 years after Aragog died (20 April 1997 in the world of the book).[31]/nBuckbeak, along with eleven other hippogriffs, is introduced during one of Hagrid\u2019s Care of Magical Creatures classes. Hagrid explains that hippogriffs are very calm, powerful, proud creatures, but are sensitive and demand respect. Harry successfully approaches Buckbeak, who allows him to ride him around the paddock./nDraco, in an arrogant attempt to show up his school nemesis, endeavours to approach Buckbeak as well. It becomes obvious that Draco neither listens to nor cares about Hagrid's warnings about the hippogriffs' sensitivity, as he makes contemptuous remarks about Buckbeak. Quickly angered, Buckbeak slashes Draco\u2019s arm with his claws. Pretending to be injured much more severely than he truly is, Draco persuades his father, Lucius Malfoy, to use his political power to sentence Buckbeak to death. Hagrid\u2019s numerous appeals fail, and members of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures come to Hogwarts to execute Buckbeak. With the use of a Time-Turner, Hermione and Harry free Buckbeak (they believed him earlier to have been executed, but it was revealed the executioner only swung his axe into the fence in anger; in the film he does this to a pumpkin) and rescue Sirius from the tower in which he is being held before being handed over to the Dementors. Sirius escapes with Buckbeak and flies to safety. During most of Harry\u2019s fourth year, Sirius and Buckbeak hide in a cave in the mountains above Hogsmeade. After this, they move to Number 12 Grimmauld Place, whereupon Buckbeak stays in Sirius' mother\u2019s former room. When Kreacher wants to lure Sirius away briefly, he wounds Buckbeak./nIn Half-Blood Prince, Harry inherits Buckbeak, and allows Hagrid to look after him again. To avoid suspicion from the Ministry of Magic, he is given the alias \"Witherwings\". A fiercely loyal creature, Buckbeak chases Severus Snape away from Harry by slashing his claws at the end of the book. Buckbeak also features in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the Deathly Hallows leading the Hogwarts Thestrals against Voldemort\u2019s giants./nFang is a large boarhound (portrayed in the films by a Neapolitan Mastiff) that, aside from his enormous size, appears to be an entirely ordinary dog. While Fang's appearance is intimidating, he is, in Hagrid's words, \"a bloody coward.\" Boisterous and loving with people he knows, he seems to enjoy licking Harry, Ron, or Hermione around the face or ears./nIn the Philosopher\u2019s Stone he accompanies Harry, Hagrid, Draco, and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest to look for an injured unicorn. In the following book, the Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron take Fang into the forest where he is scared stiff of both the gigantic acromantula and Mr Weasley\u2019s flying car. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, an escaping Death Eater sets fire to Hagrid\u2019s hut while Fang is inside; Hagrid enters the flaming hut, slings Fang over his shoulder, and carries him to safety. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fang and Hagrid participate in the Battle of Hogwarts; though Fang's exact involvement is not clear. He is last seen running away after a shattered vase frightens him. It's implied that Fang survives, as Hagrid is not seen mourning him at any time. It's unknown if Fang is still alive when Harry's children come to Hogwarts./nFluffy is a giant three-headed dog provided by Hagrid to guard the trapdoor leading to the underground chamber where the Philosopher's Stone was hidden until the end of Philosopher's Stone. The only known way to get past Fluffy is to lull him to sleep by playing music. Fluffy is based on Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the gates to the underworld. As with Fluffy, Cerberus was lulled to sleep with music by Orpheus./nIn Philosopher's Stone, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville accidentally run into Fluffy whilst hiding from Peeves, who was attempting to give them away to caretaker Argus Filch, who was searching for them. On Halloween, Harry and Ron witness Snape entering the door to Fluffy's chamber, and for the next few days having a pronounced limp. Harry also overhears him saying \"How are you meant to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" to Filch. However, it is later revealed that he followed then Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell into the chamber. While Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, Professor Quirrell penetrates Fluffy's defences by playing a harp, in order to access the trapdoor, while Harry uses a flute that Hagrid had given to him./nJ. K. Rowling later revealed that Dumbledore had repatriated Fluffy to Greece.[32]/nNorbert is a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon that Hagrid had acquired as an egg from a mysterious, hooded stranger in the Hog's Head, who turned out to be Professor Quirrell. Hagrid helps the dragon hatch from the egg. Norbert becomes very dangerous and much bigger in the weeks following. Norbert bit Ron\u2019s hand, causing him to require medical treatment due to the venom in her fangs.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally persuade Hagrid to send the dragon to Ron\u2019s older brother Charlie, who is studying dragons in Romania. In the Deathly Hallows, Charlie reveals to Hagrid that \"Norbert\" is actually female and had been renamed Norberta. Charlie adds that female Norwegian Ridgeback dragons \"are more vicious...\" which explained Norbert's biting and dangerous behaviour as a baby./nIGN listed Hagrid as their thirteenth top Harry Potter character, saying that Hagrid had become a surrogate for the audience and that the short scene in the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire film where he recollects memorable moments with Harry, Hermione and Ron gave them a \"cherished memory\".[33] IGN\u2019s Joe Utichi also listed Hagrid as his 7th favourite Harry Potter character.[34]/nHagrid has appeared in various animated and non-animated parodies of Harry Potter. He was featured in US skit comedy Saturday Night Live, portrayed by Horatio Sanz, in the same episode in which Lindsay Lohan played Hermione; Bobby Moynihan later portrayed Hagrid in 2012, when Daniel Radcliffe hosted the show.[35] In Alistair McGowan's Big Impression show, Hagrid appeared in a sketch called \"Louis Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Scone\", in which he was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane himself.[36] Hagrid is also parodied in Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan, a story released by Comic Relief in 2003, and he was played by Ronnie Corbett.[37][38] In the Potter Puppet Pals parodies by Neil Cicierega, Hagrid appeared in the episode \"Ron's Disease\",[39] and later in the episode \"Neville's Birthday\".[40] Hagrid also appears in the parody stage production Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice, interacting with Draco Malfoy and a dementor.[41] In one episode of the second series of Tracey Ullman's State of the Union, Tracey Ullman parodies Rowling as bossy and very keen on keeping her creations copyrighted, believing a hobo is impersonating Hagrid./nHagrid makes an appearance in the theme park attraction Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Orlando, Japan and Hollywood. A new rollercoaster, Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, opened at Universal Orlando's Islands of Adventure theme park on 13 June 2019, replacing the Dragon Challenge dual roller coasters and is themed around Hagrid and his love for magical creatures.", "62324919": "Anne L.

This system protects bacterial cells from viral infection./nThe research of Grete Kellenberger-Gujer had already demonstrated that phage DNA could be degraded by host bacterial cells.

ITS ran on PDP-6 and, later, PDP-10 computers./nIn 1968, Knight designed and supervised the construction of the first PDP-10 ARPANET interfaces with Bob Metcalfe./nKnight developed a system to use standard television sets as a terminal interface to the PDP-10./nIn 1972, Knight designed one of the first semiconductor memory-based bitmap displays.  This was later commercialized and led directly to the development of the Bedford Computer Systems newspaper layout system and influenced many of the bitmapped display devices available today.  That same year, along with Jeff Rubin, Knight designed and implemented a network file system that provided the first transparent remote file access over the ARPANET./nIn 1974, Knight designed and implemented the prototype version of the MIT Lisp Machine processor, with the production version following in 1976.  The Lisp Machine was a microprogrammed machine, tuned for high-performance emulation of other instruction sets.  The design of the Lisp Machine was directly implemented by both Symbolics and LMI and was the basis of all of their computers.  Texas Instruments implemented surface mount and single-chip versions of the architecture in 1983 and 1987, respectively./nKnight collaborated with Jack Holloway in designing and implementing the Chaosnet, a re-engineered version of the Xerox 3 Mbit/s Ethernet.  In 1975 this network became the first local area network on MIT's campus.  Chaosnet's innovation of a preamble bit string for packets was eventually incorporated into the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard./nIn 1980, Knight participated in the development of the Connection Machine architecture and its original implementation.  Other notable and diverse accomplishments during the 1980s included the creation of the first silicon retina in 1981, the creation of a single-chip optical mouse, the design of the Cross-Omega interconnection network architecture, and the design of the Transit multiprocessor interconnection architecture./nDuring the early 1990s, Knight was involved in the formation of Permabit and of Exa Corporation and the architecture of the latter's initial version of its FX/1 lattice gas parallel fluid flow computer.  Advances included using over-relaxation techniques to make 10x algorithmic improvements in lattice gas computations, landmark CFD accuracies, and correction of misconceptions about the origin of fluid turbulence in simple two-dimensional flow situations.  Within the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,  he led the Abacus SIMD project, worked on VLSI micro displays, and made advances in the field of adiabatic (reversible) computing./nIt was also during this period that Knight's interests in biological systems began. Inspired in part by the work of Harold J. Morowitz, a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within the MIT AI Laboratory.  In this lab he created the concept of the BioBrick plasmid DNA part[4] and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to simplify the genetic engineering of Escherichia coli cells.  Today, BioBricks form the basis of the enormous annual iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition[2] and Knight is sometimes referred to as the godfather of synthetic biology.[5] Knight co-founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company.", "4489461": "Akihiro Kusumi (\u6960\u898b \u660e\u5f18, Kusumi Akihiro, born October 1952[1]) is a Japanese biologist who proposed an explanation for reduced diffusion speed of lipid and protein molecules in the cell membrane, based on a model of hop diffusion in which lipids are confined to a reduced space, created by a membrane-skeleton-induced compartments. this compartments allow the lipids or proteins freely in a limited region and limiting also the diffusion to other parts of the membrane.

He is particularly known for his research into human herpesviruses and chronic fatigue syndrome, and for his discovery of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome genetic disorder. He headed the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and served as the founding director of the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine./nStraus was born in New York City in 1946,[1][2] and grew up in Brooklyn, attending the Yeshivah of Flatbush for Elementary and High School.[3] He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, switching from physics to biology,[3] and gained his BS in life sciences in 1968. He gained his MD from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1972.[1][2] He subsequently trained at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, and also held a fellowship in infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis.[1]/nIn 1973\u201375, Straus researched adenoviruses as a research associate at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).[1][2][4] He rejoined NIAID as a senior investigator in 1979, working in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation. He rose to head first the medical virology section and then, from 1991, the entire laboratory.[1][4] In October 1999, Straus was appointed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)'s first director (while continuing his work at NIAID), a position he held until November 2006.[1][4][5]/nStraus served on the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Research Roundtable and the NIH Steering Committee. He chaired the NIH Committee on the Recruitment and Career Development of Clinical Investigators, as well as multiple committees associated with the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. He also advised the NIH director, Elias Zerhouni.[2][4] He was on the editorial boards of the academic journals Journal of Virology and Virology, and co-edited several textbooks, including Fields Virology.[1][4]/nStraus is particularly known for his wide-ranging research on herpesviruses that infect humans, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV). His studies included herpesvirus pathogenesis, immune responses and transmission, as well as antiviral drugs and vaccines.[4]/nHe researched the mechanisms by which HSV establishes latency and later recurs. His group was one of the first to show that treating patients with the antiviral acyclovir can prevent genital and oral herpes from recurring.[4][6] He found that people with asymptomatic genital herpes can transmit the virus to their sexual partners.[4] With Lawrence Corey and David M. Knipe, Straus developed prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HSV, including a glycoprotein subunit vaccine.[4]/nWith William Ruyechan and John Hay, Straus cloned VZV and mapped its genome. They showed that chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster) are both caused by this virus.[4] Straus also studied the persistent pain that can occur after shingles has cleared up.[2][6] He worked with Mike Oxman and Myron Levin on the Shingles Prevention Study, a large clinical trial which demonstrated that a live-attenuated VZV vaccine is effective against shingles.[4][6][7]/nStraus discovered that infection with EBV very occasionally results in a life-threatening chronic progressive disease, now called chronic active EBV infection.[6][8][9] Other viral diseases Straus worked on include HIV/AIDS, influenza and chronic hepatitis B. He also researched Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia bacteria.[4][6]/nStraus started to research what is now known as chronic fatigue syndrome in 1979.[10][11] Working on the then-current hypothesis that the syndrome might be caused by EBV, he started a clinical trial of acyclovir therapy in 1984. Although the study showed no benefit from the drug, it provided evidence that EBV did not cause the syndrome.[4][10] In 1988, Straus was one of a group of physicians to propose the name \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" for the condition,[12] and was subsequently one of the lead authors of the International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group's guidelines.[13] He also pursued various virological, immunological, neuroendocrine and neuropsychological studies of the syndrome.[11]/nIn the early 1990s, Straus and colleagues discovered autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a rare genetic disorder in which the normal Fas-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes is disrupted, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.[2][4][6][14] He found mutations in the genes encoding Fas and Fas ligand, as well as caspase-10 and N-Ras, are associated with the disorder. He followed a cohort of over 200 people with ALPS, and showed that they have a substantially elevated risk of developing lymphoma.[4][6]/nNCCAM was founded as an independent NIH center in October 1998, replacing the Office of Alternative Medicine, and Straus was appointed the founding director,[1][4][5] responsible for an annual budget of a little under $90\u00a0million.[3] He stated in a 2001 interview that he did not use alternative therapies,[3] and he accepted the position because:/nI think the only way to change the dialogue on complementary and alternative medicine \u2013 what we call CAM \u2013 is to have a serious person here at the N.I.H., doing serious work, with serious funding. The fact is that Americans are using complementary and alternative therapies. If the public is spending billions of dollars on these things, they are either deluded en masse, or there is some communal wisdom they are expressing. I believe that the tools of science can provide very powerful answers on what they are doing.[3]/nUnder his leadership, NIH-funded research into complementary and alternative medicine tripled,[2][6] with NCCAM funding large (phase III) clinical trials of St John's wort for depression, Ginkgo biloba extracts for dementia, and acupuncture and glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate supplements for osteoarthritis of the knee joint, among other treatment modalities.[1][5][15] Early in his tenure as director, Straus prioritised the clinical assessment of treatments widely used in America which had previously shown promising results in small clinical trials.[3] He later wrote: \"In the early years of NCCAM, there was a sense of urgency to scientifically assess a range of CAM therapies that had been in long use by the public in the absence of proof of safety or efficacy.\"[15] By 2006, the center's research focus had shifted away from large clinical trials and towards investigating how treatments might work, as well as the optimal dosing strategy for botanical extracts and their interactions with prescription drugs.[15]/nNCCAM was criticised for funding trials of EDTA chelation therapy in coronary artery disease and the Gonzalez regimen in pancreatic cancer.[3][16][17] Donald M. Marcus and Arthur P. Grollman, in a 2006 Science opinion article, claimed that the center funded \"proposals of dubious merit\", and that its research strategy was \"shaped more by politics than by science\".[16] Straus responded that the center had \"made important contributions in a field that is fraught with controversy and challenges\" and that it was \"applying the same scientific standards to the conduct of research and its review as used by other NIH institutes\".[15]/nStraus was an elected fellow of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).[1][2][4] He was honored with the National ME Fund Award of the Netherlands in 1999,[1] IDSA's John F. Enders Lectureship in medical virology in 2005,[18] and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons's gold medal for Distinguished Achievements in Medicine in 2007.[19] He also received five US Public Health Service medals.[1][2] In 2009, NCCAM founded a lecture series, the Stephen E. Straus Distinguished Lecture in the Science of Complementary Therapies, as a memorial to him.[20]/nStraus's wife, Barbara, worked in education; the couple had a son and two daughters.

After graduation he stayed at the institute for a degree of master of science he received in 1879./nThen Helmanis relocated to the capital of Russian Empire St Petersburg, where he started to work as a veterinary of the guard cavalry regiment. There he organised a laboratory by the dispensary and started to study clinical symptoms of glanders in horses and laboratory animals. \nWhen Louis Pasteur created a vaccine against rabies in 1886, Kristaps Helmanis devoted himself to research of rabies in St Petersburg and reported his results to the Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg, who supported his studies. Kristaps Helmanis himself paid a visit to Paris. Louis Pasteur sent two collaborators to St Petersburg in order to create a station, and the second Pasteur station in the Russian Empire administered by Helmanis was founded. \nAt the Pasteur station he not only vaccinated bitten patients, but also tried to create diagnostic serums for tuberculosis, syphilis, smallpox and anthrax. He obtained diagnostic test for tuberculosis and informed Louis Pasteur about his discovery. On the same time Robert Koch at the Tenth International Medical Congress held 1890 in Berlin unexpectedly introduced a cure for tuberculosis, which he called tuberculin./nIn 1890 Kristaps Helmanis left the army service and joined newly founded Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg as the head of the division of epizootology. He was successful to obtain microbial extract of glanders called mallein.[1] Unfortunately several of Helmanis\u2019 collaborators and colleagues Alfr\u0113ds Bertu\u0161s (1849\u20141890), Roberts V\u0101gners (1861\u20141890) and Oto Kalni\u0146\u0161 (1856\u20141891) became infected and died from this disease./nOn 10 March 1892 Helmanis married Estonian singer Emmelin Strandman, but soon after he died from the brain tumour.

He had two sisters, Esther and Mary, and a brother, Meyer. In 1936, he and Meyer built a telescope to watch Peltier's comet.[2][3] Later that year, they built a larger telescope, for which they painstakingly ground a 6.5 inches (170\u00a0mm) lens.[2] He attended Woodward High School, where he played on the football team and was editor of the student newspaper. He graduated in 1937, and was elected to its Hall of Fame in 1986.[2]/nNovick was awarded a scholarship by the University of Chicago,[4] where he earned a Bachelor of Science (SB) degree in chemistry in 1940.[5] He went to on complete his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) there, writing his two-part 1943 thesis on \"A kinetic study of the chromic acid oxidation of isopropyl alcohol\" and \"The iodination of fibroin\".[6][7]/nAfter completing his degree, Novick joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago,[7] where he worked on the design of the nuclear reactors at the Hanford Site in Eastern Washington that were used to produce plutonium for atomic bombs. He was then transferred to the Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he worked on the preparations for the Trinity nuclear test, witnessing the blast on July 16, 1945.[4] \"I will never forget the sight of that explosion\", he later told his parents, \"the thing is really terrific\".[2]/nA similar bomb was used in the bombing of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.[8] He later expressed regret that he and his fellow scientists did not pay much attention to the moral and ethical issues of the use of nuclear weapons, as they were absorbed in the urgency and importance of their work, and fixated on the grim casualties lists in the newspapers.[4]/nAfter the war ended, Novick returned to Chicago, where he worked with Herbert L. Anderson at the Manhattan Project's Argonne National Laboratory, studying the properties of tritium, an important component in nuclear weapons. Tritium could be manufactured in nuclear reactors and used to produce helium-3, a crucial material in cryogenics research and in neutron detection. They measured the magnetic moment of both tritium and helium-3,[9][10] and Novick measured the half-life of tritium.[11]/nIn 1947, Novick became an associate professor at the University of Chicago.[5] He teamed up with Leo Szilard, with whom he had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. Szilard had secured a research professorship at the University of Chicago that allowed him to dabble in biology and the social sciences. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and that was ready for scientific breakthroughs.[12] They made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor,[13][14] and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism.[15]/nNovick married Jane Graham, a 1945 University of Chicago alumna, in Chicago on January 25, 1948.[1][5] They had two sons, David and Adam.[2] In 1953, he spent a year at the Pasteur Institute in Paris as a Guggenheim Fellow.[7][16] He left the University of Chicago in 1958 and moved to Eugene, Oregon, where he became director of the new Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Oregon on January 1, 1959.[7] It is believed to be the first research institute in the world to include \"molecular biology\" in its title,[17] and Novick is considered one of the founders of molecular biology.[1]/nFranklin W. Stahl, one of the researchers that Novick recruited, said that \"I think his life's major achievement was the wisdom in which he guided this institute. He went for a model of an intellectual commune, where ideas could be aggressively shared between research groups.\"[2] Novick built the Institute up from a single laboratory with one staff member, himself, to a multimillion-dollar research institute with many laboratories and dozens of research staff.[4] He investigated the processes by which genes are switched on and off, demonstrating that when one is turned on, it causes synthesis of messenger RNA, while when one is turned off, a protein must bind to the gene.[18] He was posthumously awarded the Medical Research Foundation of Oregon's Pioneer Award.[17]/nFor many years, Novick participated actively in the Atomic Scientists movement, and he served on the editorial board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.[7] In 1969, he was part of a successful campaign by Eugene residents to prevent the Eugene Water & Electric Board from switching to nuclear power. He was opposed to the Vietnam War, and at a meeting of the Arms Control Forum he was jeered by students shouting \"Go back to Russia, you commies!\"[19]/nNovick's career as a researcher ended when he became Dean of the Graduate School in 1971. He subsequently served as head of the Biology Department and as director of the Institute of Molecular Biology again.

He died from pneumonia in Eugene on December 21, 2000.[2] He was survived by his ex-wife and two sons.[1] He had been asked what he would like to have said about him at a memorial service.[18] He said: \"Say I was honest and a Democrat.\"[18]", "7569676": "Nicole King (born 1970) is an American biologist and faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley in molecular and cell biology and integrative biology.[1] She was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005.[2] She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) since 2013./nKing studies the evolution of multicellularity and choanoflagellates.  The goal of her work is to reconstruct how multicellular animals evolved from single-cell organisms./nKing identified choanoflagellates as key organisms to answer questions about the origin of multicellularity.  Prior to her work, it was unclear whether choanoflagellates or fungi were the closest outgroup to multicellular animals (also called \"metazoans\"). King's comparative genomics work in collaboration with Sean Carroll helped to elucidate the evolutionary \"tree of life.\"  In addition, work by King and colleagues showed that choanoflagellates possess several protein-coding genes that are highly related to protein-coding genes in animals at the base of the metazoan tree, such as sponges, cnidarians, and ctenophores./nMore recent work by King demonstrates that molecules thought to underpin the transition to multicellarity also exist in choanoflagellates and therefore were present in the single-celled and colonial ancestors of animals. For example, one of the most abundant and important cell adhesion molecules in the animal kingdom, cadherin, exists in choanoflagellates. In animals, cadherins are required to keep cells attached to their neighbors, so it was a surprising to discover that cadherins predate the evolution of animals. In addition, King found that choanoflagellates possess genes that animal cells use to \"talk\" or signal to one another, such as Receptor tyrosine kinase./nKing continues her studies on choanoflagellates and multicellularity as an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

Brought up in a Hebrew-speaking Jewish family, he learned German and Latin and studied anatomy before settling in Berlin as a physician. He amassed a large natural history collection, particularly of fish specimens. He is generally considered one of the most important ichthyologists of the 18th century, and wrote many papers on natural history, comparative anatomy, and physiology./nBloch was born at Ansbach in 1723 where his father was a Torah writer and his mother owned a small shop. Educated at home in Hebrew literature he became a private tutor in Hamburg for a Jewish surgeon. Here he learned German, Latin and anatomy.[1] He then studied medicine in Berlin and received a doctorate in 1762 from Frankfort on the Oder with a treatise on skin disorders. He then became a general practitioner in Berlin and married Breinche, daughter of \"protected Jew\" Ruben Joseph Rintel (1699\u20131765?) in 1765. This allowed him to settle in Berlin. Bloch helped found the Society of Friends of Natural Sciences in 1773 along with Moses Mendelssohn[2] serving also as Mendelssohn's physician. He began to establish a large natural history collection and a library. He also began to publish in journals. Breinche died in 1769 and their only son died aged 21 while on a trip to Paris to sell the book on fishes that his father had written. In 1774 he married Cheile, daughter of banker Joseph Veitel Ephraim (1775\u20131807) and they would have a daughter who married physician Wolf Davidson (1772\u20131800). After the death of Cheile, he married Rahel, daughter of a Jewish social worker Jeremias Bendix (1735 -1790), and they had a son and two daughters.[3]/nBloch became interested in fishes only in 1782 after finding fish that he could not find a name for in the works of Linnaeus. He then began to collect fishes and had fish specimens sent from around the world, including correspondents from as far as India like Johann Gerhard K\u00f6nig and Christoph Samuel John. The collection was of nearly 1400 specimens and about 800 are now in the Bloch Cabinet of the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde, Berlin. He began to catalog the fishes of Germany in publications from 1782 to 1784, and on fishes from abroad until 1795, printing the books with copper plate engravings made largely at his own expense. He later managed to get subscribers including the Queen and Prince of Prussia, the Prince of Saxe-Coburg, the royal families of Denmark, Sweden, Poland and the court banker Isaac Daniel Itzig. Bloch also published on medicine, writing on such topics as the waters of Pyrmont and on intestinal parasitic worms./nBloch visited Paris in 1797 to examine the fish collections there and returned via Holland. His health became poor and he went to Carlsbad where he died of a stroke.[4] He was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Lichtenstadt.[3]/nBloch is best known for his encyclopedic work in ichthyology. Between 1782 and 1795 he published his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte der Fische, a 12-volume, beautifully illustrated comprehensive work on fishes.

Early 1980s saw the revelation that nitric oxide was the substance endothelial cells produce to relax the smooth muscle around blood vessels, which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow.[10] This led to the speculation of and hunt for the inverse, an endothelium-derived vasoconstricting substance.[11] During his PhD study, Yanagisawa's supervisor, Tomoh Masaki, agreed to let him try to isolate the substance. This study became his PhD thesis, and he published his finding it 1988, naming the substance \"endothelin\" and reporting its peptide sequence.[12] He then published a number of reports on the function and regulation of endothelin, including working with Takeshi Sakurai to identify the receptor for endothelin.[13]/nHe kept studying endothelin after moving to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in the United States, for example discovering one of the mechanisms to activate endothelin[14] and that a mutation in endothelin receptor can cause Hirschsprung's disease.[15]/nEventually, his interest in endothelin diminished and Yanagisawa switched his focus to orphan receptors, which are receptors whose endogenous ligands have yet to be identified, particularly orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In 1998, again teaming up with Takeshi Sakurai, who has moved to the United States as a postdoctoral fellow at UTSW, Yanagisawa connected two orphan GPCRs with a family of neuropeptides as their ligands. They named it \"orexin\" after the Greek word for appetite, since the neuropeptide was found exclusively in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite, and because mice consumed more food after receiving a dose of orexin.[16] Another group at The Scripps Research Institute (now Scripps Research) made the same discovery in the same year, and named the neuropeptide \"hypocretin\".[17] Today, \"hypocretin\" (or HCRT) is used to refer to the gene and transcript, while \"orexin\" is used to refer to the peptide.[18]/nYanagisawa and his team then knocked out the orexin gene in mice, hoping to see the animal eating less. Instead, they observed behavior similar to the human condition of narcolepsy, whose cause at the time was still unknown.[19] The association between orexin and narcolepsy was definitively established not long afterwards in 2000.[20]/nSince then, his research has mostly focused on studying sleep and orphan receptors.

In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme that places its substrates in stereochemistry suitable for peptide bond formation and for substrate-mediated catalysis.

Bill, he completed his undergraduate education at UCLA in agriculture. He met his future wife, Marion Mitchelson, at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 1947 and the two were married in November 1948.[3] After spending a year working on a farm in the San Juaquin Valley, Gartler entered the Ph.D. program in Genetics at UC Berkeley in 1949.[2][3] He originally intended to apply genetics for agricultural uses, but near the end of his graduate work, he made a career switch and decided to enter the field of human genetics after enrolling in a course taught by Curt Stern.[1]/nIn 1952 Gartler began a public health postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University to study human genetics,[4] which he completed over the course of five years.[3][2] In 1957 Gartler was recruited by Arno G.

X chromosome inactivation randomly silences most of the genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of the embryo. The female thus becomes a mosaic for any X-linked gene for which she is heterozygous, and normal tissues are consequently composed of a nearly equal mixture of cells expressing the two different phenotypes.[6]  Gartler reasoned that, if a tumor begins from a single cell, then all the cells of that tumor should express the same, single X-linked allele. By examining expression of different isoenzymes of the sex-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) locus in heterozygous women, Gartler and Linder demonstrated that leiomyoma tumor cells, even those from cancers consisting of billions of cells, expressed only one form of the marker, whereas even small patches of normal tissue contained cells expressing both forms of the marker. This finding was consistent with the growth of a single founder cell into a tumor.[7][8]  The clonal origin of various tumors has been confirmed many times since, both initially through Gartler's work with a junior colleague, Philip J. Fialkow,[9][10] and by other groups./nIn 1967, Gartler became interested in establishing a system for studying human genetics in somatic cell culture. He initially studied eighteen (supposedly) independently derived established human cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, including HeLa. Examining isoenzymes, he typed them for a number of genetic polymorphisms, including the X-linked G6PD variant. The cell lines turned out to be genetically identical, and moreover, all carried the G6PD allele found almost exclusively in people of African descent. HeLa, which was the first successfully established human cell line, was derived from a woman of African descent named Henrietta Lacks, so this result suggested that the cell lines were not truly independent, but had instead been contaminated by HeLa cells.[11][12]/nIt was not realized at the time that nearly all attempts to establish human cell cultures resulted in cell lines with limited life spans. Dr. George Gey, the originator of HeLa, had sent those cells to all who requested them, and the contamination problem arose because many workers were growing the immortal HeLa cell and mortal human cell strains in close proximity. Since the use of genetic markers to characterize and distinguish cell lines at the time was virtually non-existent, contamination events from HeLa went undetected. In spite of the evidence, initially, the idea of laboratory errors leading to cross culture contamination was not universally accepted: an alternative explanation was that, when cultures became established, their G6PD phenotype changed.[13]  Gartler's original paper to Nature went to lengths to dismiss this possibility, surveying over 100 tumors to see if there was a phenotypic change in either G6PD or PGM, as well as trying other experimental approaches to test the idea. He concluded that \"all evidence seems to point to the stability of the G6PD and PGM phenotypes both in vivo and in vitro.\"[12]  Further evidence against the possibility of phenotypic conversion came when Nellie Auesperg and Gartler identified a truly independently established human cell line, which they showed to exhibit unique genetic markers./nCross-culture contamination is now a generally accepted risk in establishing cell lines, and there are many genetic markers available to accurately characterize human cell cultures. However, the problem of cross-culture contamination has not been eliminated. Walter Nelson-Rees took up the issue some ten years after the original Gartler report, and continued to write about the problem for almost 25 years./nGartler's later career reflected his continued interest in the X chromosome and X inactivation.  Such work included discovery of the presence of two functional X chromosomes within oocytes,[14] demonstrating the association between fragile X syndrome and delayed replication of FMR1[15][16], and identification of DNMT3B as the gene underlying Immunodeficiency\u2013centromeric instability\u2013facial anomalies syndrome,[17] the first recognized human hypomethylation disease./nIn 1991, evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen put forth an argument that the HeLa cell line constituted a new microbial species, which he proposed be designated Helacyton gartleri, in recognition of Gartler's work.[18]", "58229103": "Ernesta Di Capua (26 July 1875, Rome - 23 October 1943, Auschwitz) was an Italian botanist, taxonomist, and explorer.[1]  She was executed at the Auschwitz concentration camp for her Jewish heritage.[2]  The species Caralluma dicapuae was named in her honor.[3]/nThe standard author abbreviation Di Capua is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.[4]/n/nThis article about an Italian botanist is a stub.

S.) \u2013 22 October 1996) was a Ukrainian zoologist and ecologist. She was a specialist in the mole-rats and ground squirrels of Ukraine, and was the first scientist to describe the sandy blind mole-rat of southern Ukraine in 1939. She played a key role in keeping the National Museum of Natural History at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine operable in the inter-war and immediate post-war periods, in spite of arrests by both the Gestapo and Soviet authorities. She was one of the people involved in hiding specimens of the museum to prevent them being taken by the Germans. She is known for arguing that ecology, species distribution, populations, utility, and variability, should be weighed before making determinations that labeled certain animals as pests and harmful to the environment. Though she was responsible for maintaining the historiography of scientific development in Ukraine, her own legacy was lost until the twenty-first century./nEvdokia Grigoryevna Reshetnik was born on 14 March 1903 (N. S.) in the village of Koshmanovka\u00a0[uk] in the Poltava Oblast of the Russian Empire, in what is now Ukraine. Her father, Grigory Yefimovich Reshetnik, was a prosperous peasant who died before being de-Kulaked. He owned a sizeable acreage on which he raised cattle.[1] Probably because of her father's early death, Reshetnik was raised from childhood by her older sister and brother-in-law in Poltava. There she attended both primary school and seven years in gymnasium. In 1918, she began a three-year program in pedagogy, completed her practical work teaching at the local orphanage, and earned her teaching credentials from the Poltava Pedagogical University, under the rules of the Russian Institute of Public Education, in 1920.[2]/nContinuing as a student there, Reshetnik studied biology until 1924, with classmates Oksana Ivanenko, Pavlo Tychyna, and her future husband, Yakov Khomenko. While she was studying, she simultaneously continued to teach at the orphanage. She graduated with a specialty in biology in 1924, and was hired to work at the Osnovianskyi District worker's school on the outskirts of Kharkiv as a zoology instructor.[2] Khomenko worked as a philologist and translator at the Institute of Linguistics and Literature.[3] Reshetnik and Khomenko married in 1926 and had a son, Emil, two years later. After passing her examinations in 1931, Reshetnik began graduate studies at Kharkiv State University in the Zoology Research Institute.[2] From 1933, she also worked as a researcher at the Kharkiv Scientific Research Station. She graduated in 1934, after a successful defense of her work, which focused on the study of larks.[4][Notes 1]/nIn 1935, when the capital of Ukraine was transferred from Kharkiv to Kyiv, Reshetnik's husband was transferred with his employer and she followed him.[5] She found employment as a researcher at the Kyiv Zoo. In 1936, she was designated as a senior researcher at the I. I. Schmalhausen Institute of Zoology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, for which she served as secretary. In 1939, she published her paper describing Spalacidae (mole-rats) in Ukraine and the following year earned a Candidate degree in 1940,[6] although her diploma would not be awarded until 1946.[7] While on a research trip the following year in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Bessarabia, the war caused Reshetnik to return to Kyiv. Boarding the academic evacuation train for Ufa, she disembarked at Poltava, where her son was staying with her sister.[6][8] She was also reunited with her husband at the train station.[8] The curfew made it impossible for her to pick up her son and continue on the evacuation train, so they remained in Poltava until October 1941, when the Germans invaded the city.[6] They then went back to Kyiv on horseback, a difficult and lengthy journey.[6][9]/nAfter arriving in Kyiv, Reshetnik discovered her home had been ransacked and looted, so she and her son stayed with friends. Without work, she volunteered with the Red Cross, distributing clothes and food to captured Red Army prisoners, held at the Darnytsky concentration camp\u00a0[uk]. The prisoners were fed peas, which were shared with Reshetnik who was able to take them home and feed her family. On 10 February 1942, Red Cross workers, including Reshetnik, were arrested by the Gestapo. She was also charged with collaborating with the newspaper Ukrainian Word, although she had no affiliation with the publication. After eighteen days of imprisonment, her bail was paid by colleagues, Mykola Charlemagne\u00a0[uk] and Sergey Paramonov and Reshetnik was released.[10]/nIn May 1942, the Institute of Plant Protection and Pest Control\u00a0[uk] was established by the Reich Commissariat of Ukraine in the National Academy of Sciences.[10][11] Reshetnik was hired to work under the direction of Charlemagne and she secured a position there for her son as a bookbinding student to prevent him being removed to Germany.[10] She conducted work on ground squirrels, gophers, and groundhogs at this institute until September 1943.[10][12] Of particular interest to the Germans was research into drugs and other means of eliminating pests, particularly rodents, which might endanger agricultural plants.[13] Near the end of the war, the Germans began moving the Zoological museum collections to Pozna\u0144, and other locations in Germany and Poland.[14] Reshetnik was actively involved in successfully hiding some of the specimens to prevent their removal.[15]/nAt the end of the war, Reshetnik was awarded a research specialist designation in zoology in 1946 and was hired to work at the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences, where she remained until 1950. During this time, she published two papers on her earlier study of ground squirrels. One of them, which was published in 1946, identified new subspecies of the speckled ground squirrel (Citellus suslica ognevi and Citellus suslica volhynensis).[7][16] In her works, Reshetnik pointed out that rodents could be valuable for their skins as well as their fat, which was widely used during the war as a food source.[17] She published extensive analyses about the ecology, species distribution, populations, and variability of the types of rodents throughout Ukraine.[18] In these works, she argued that the economic or usefulness of rodents should be weighed against the potential damage they might do.[19][20]/nWhen the Soviets were restored to power, a period of repression began in Ukraine.[21] In 1948, Reshetnik's son was arrested for membership in the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and deported to Mordovia. Soon after, her husband was also arrested and imprisoned. Both of them were required to serve eight-year sentences.[7][9] She faced several fabricated charges \u2014 that she was to have been shot by the Gestapo and since she was not must have been a collaborator; that she had friendships with questionable people, such as Charlemagne and Paramonov; and that she had plagiarized other people's work \u2014 among other accusations and denunciations from colleagues.[9][21] In 1951, Reshetnik was remanded to the Chernihiv Penal Colony, where she remained until 1955. Upon her release, Reshetnik began working as a district entomologist for the Kyiv-Sviatoshyn District Sanitary and Epidemiology Station. Between 1956 and 1957, she was rehabilitated by the authorities, and in 1961 allowed to return to the Institute of Zoology, where she remained until her retirement in 1986.[21]/nMuch of her work at the Institute of Zoology was spent curating the museum's collections. As a skilled authority and taxidermist, she expanded the zoological specimens with hundreds of samples of species. As an archivist, and one with intimate knowledge of how history treats scientists, she was a meticulous record keeper and made sure that the personnel files of her colleagues retained their most important works, even if they had been repressed by the government.[19] Among the biographies of Ukrainian scientists Reshetnik preserved were Charlemagne, Ivan Demyanovich Ivanenko (Ukrainian: \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0414\u0435\u043c\u2019\u044f\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e), Sergey Medvedev\u00a0[uk], and Paramonov, among others.[22] In 1993, she dictated her memories of Olena Teliha to her son, because her eyesight was failing. The remembrance was published in the newspaper Ukrainian Word under the title \"\u041c\u043e\u044f \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0456\u0430\u043d\u0430\" (\"My Oleniana\") and told of their relationship when they were held by the Gestapo.[23]/nReshetnik died on 22 October 1996, in Kyiv and was buried Sovsky Cemetery\u00a0[uk].[21] Despite her name being remembered in Ukraine because of the papers she had published, Reshetnik's biography was not retold until the twenty-first century.[1]/nReshetnik is primarily known for her research on rodents, particularly mole-rats and ground squirrels.[19]  She published over twenty papers between 1939 and 1965 detailing new species and subspecies, including a unique blind mole-rat, Spalax arenarius, which she first identified in 1939 and is endemic to Ukraine.[19][24] Her work evaluated the ecology, varying shapes, and distribution of their populations.[19]", "67371380": "Mar\u00eda Teresa Miras Portugal (19 February 1948 \u2013 27 May 2021)[1] was a Spanish scientist, pharmacist, biochemist, molecular biologist and Emeritus professor at the Complutense University of Madrid.

Sullivan, Albert J. Fritsch) he met while working at the Center for the Study of Responsive Law in Washington, DC. When his colleagues left CSPI in 1977, Jacobson became its executive director.  In 2017 he was replaced as the executive director by Peter Lurie and held the position of Senior Scientist; he remained on the board of directors of the organization until 2022.[1]  He has been a national leader in the movement for healthier diets, focusing both on education and obtaining laws and regulations. It was Jacobson who coined the now widely used phrases \"junk food\"[2] and \"food porn\".[3]  In 2022 Jacobson founded the National Food Museum. [4]/nJacobson and his organization have both publicized healthy diets and criticized a wide variety of foods and beverages as unhealthful. He and CSPI frequently use colorful terms to emphasize their opposition to certain foods, for instance referring to fettuccine alfredo as a \"heart attack on a plate\".[5]  In addition to publicizing concerns about or praise for foods, Jacobson lobbied for improvements in government (U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture) regulations and guidelines and for new legislation./nHe founded Food Day,[6] a nationwide celebration of healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food and a grassroots campaign for better policies. Food Day was celebrated annually from 1975 to 1977 and from 2011 to 2015. Jacobson also founded Big Business Day[7] and the Center for the Study of Commercialism.[8]/n\"Soda is the quintessential junk food\u2014just sugar calories and no nutrients,\" says Jacobson. \"Americans are drowning in soda pop\u2014teenagers, in particular.

One-third of youths already are overweight or obese. Are we just going to sit around and do nothing? Or should we do something\u2014a modest, sensible step of putting a health message on cans and bottles?\"/nIn 2005, Jacobson's organization proposed mandatory warning labels on all containers of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, to warn consumers about the possible health risks of consuming these beverages on a regular basis.[10]/nBeginning in 1993, Jacobson spearheaded efforts to require that artificial trans fat, a potent cause of heart disease, be labeled on food packages.[11]  As evidence of trans fat's harmfulness accumulated, in 2004 CSPI petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to ban the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, the source of artificial trans fat.  The FDA banned that oil in 2015, with June 18, 2018, being the effective date to stop using it.[12]/nHe also led efforts to reduce the sodium content of processed foods, such as soups, snack foods, and processed meats.  Excess consumption of sodium increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes.  In addition to publishing several books and reports, CSPI's work led to the FDA's issuing voluntary sodium-reduction guidelines in October 2021./nTo bring about changes in eating habits, Jacobson advocates higher taxes on unhealthy foods, greater use of warning labels on food and beverage packaging, restrictions on advertising and selling junk foods (\"snack foods\"), and lawsuits against food producers and retailers whose practices he believes are detrimental to public health. His publicity campaigns and legal actions regarding such harmful ingredients as urethane (a carcinogen) in alcoholic beverages, sulfite preservatives (deadly allergen) in fresh vegetables, wine, and other foods; sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite (sources of cancer-causing nitrosamines) in bacon and other processed meats; olestra (an artificial fat); and acrylamide (a carcinogenic contaminant) in baked and fried foods led to governmental restrictions or voluntary actions to reduce or eliminate those substances.

That nascent institution \"explores food in all its dimensions.\"  [4]  The museum's exhibits and other activities will focus on the history of the human and American diets, food marketing, ethnic cuisines, farm animal welfare, and, especially, the impact of food and farming on health and the environment./nDue to the public-interest passion he brings to his efforts and in part to his criticisms of the food industry, Jacobson's methods have been questioned by the libertarian community, with the Center for Consumer Freedom awarding him \"nanny of the year\" on three occasions.[15] Some argue that parents have control over their children's diet and can moderate their intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks. However, Jacobson contends that \"kids know about vending machines, and they can go to 7-Eleven and get a Big Gulp which contains half a gallon (0.5\u00a0US\u00a0gal (1,900\u00a0ml))\u2014a thousand calories, almost!\u2014of soda pop in a single serving...

They also claim the interior Ice-Free Corridor is not the first route for early Americans moving south to lower North America from Alaska, given that it first became viable for human occupation at 12.6 thousand years ago, i.e., after Clovis and pre-Clovis occupation was seen in the lower 48 states./nWillerslev lead the team that published in 2011 a large-scale genetic study on the population dynamics of six Late Pleistocene megafaunal species across the northern hemisphere: woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, muskox, and reindeer, coupling their genetic data with climate nice modelling and the archaeological record.[27] They found that climate has been a major driver of population change over the past 50 thousand years. However, each species responded differently to the effects of climatic change and human contact. Climate change can explain the extinction the Eurasian musk ox and woolly rhinoceros, while it is more likely that a combination of climate and humans was responsible for the extinction of Eurasian steppe bison and wild horse. The causes behind the extinction of the woolly mammoth were ambiguous.[29] They did not find any genetic signature or any distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct (woolly mammoth and rhino) from surviving species (horse, musk ox, and reindeer), revealing the challenges associated with predicting future responses of extant mammals to climate and human-derived change to their habitats./nIn 2010, a team led by Willerslev sequenced the genome of a 4,000-year-old man from the Saqqaq culture of Greenland from his hair. This was the first ancient human genome to be sequenced. The DNA obtained from the hair was fragmented into an average size of 55 base pairs.[30][31] They revealed that the Saqqaq peoples represent a migration from Siberia to the Americas that is separate from that of Native American and Inuit ancestors. In 2014 his team showed that all paleoeskimos in the New World representing several distinct cultures all belonged to the same population as the Saqqaq man and that they lived in genetic isolation from Native Americans for almost 5,000 years before they died out some 700 years ago.[32] This was the first genetic evidence for cultural change happening in isolation through the spread of ideas within a population rather than through meetings between different groups of peoples as seen e.g. during the European Neolithisation./nIn 2008 Willerslev led the DNA study on coprolites from the Paisley Caves in Oregon showing human presence in North America more than 14,000 years ago and some 1000 years prior to Clovis.[33]/nIn 2013 his team discovered a genetic link between western Eurasians and Native Americans by sequencing the genome of the 24,000-year-old Mal\u00b4ta boy from central Siberia, showing that all contemporary Native Americans carry approximately 1/3 of their genome from the Mal\u2019ta population.[34]/nIn 2014 his team sequenced the Clovis-age genome from the 12,600-year-old Anzick boy from Montana and found it to be ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans thereby rejecting the Solutrean theory for early peopling of the Americas.[35] The skeleton of the boy was later reburied through the support of Willerslev, and this event facilitated his adoption into the Crow tribe.[36]/nIn 2015 Willerslev's team sequenced the genome of the Kennewick Man, a ca. 8,500 year old skeleton whose origin have been heavily debated. The DNA analyses showed Kennewick to be more closely related to Native Americans than to any other contemporary groups and rejecting claims of Kennewick Man being closely related to Japanese Ainu or Europeans.[37]/nIt has been discussed how the first people migrated into the Americas from Siberia. Two theories dominated: 1) People migrated through an ice-free corridor between the ice masses which around the end of the last ice age covered large areas of North America. 2) People migrated along the Pacific coast. In a paper in the scientific journal Nature in 2016 Willerslev and co-authors showed that this ice-free corridor could not sustain humans until much later thereby making it most likely that the early Americans migrated along the Pacific coast.[38]/nIn 2018, the Willerslev team found a new group of peoples in the Americas that they termed \u201cAncient Beringians\u201d \u2013 the earliest group of Native Americans to have diversified.[39] This was done through sequencing the genome of an 11.5-thousand-year-old skeleton from Upward Sun River (USR) in Alaska. From this genome they could infer that:/nTheir findings finally suggest that the far-northern North American presence of northern Native Americans is from a back migration that replaced or absorbed the initial founding population of \u201dAncient Beringians\u201d.[citation needed]/nIn 2011 Willerslev's team sequenced the first Aboriginal Australian genome from an historically ancient tuft of hair.[40] The study revealed that Aboriginal Australians diversified from the Africans some 20-30 thousand years prior to the evolutionary split between Europeans and Asians. Secondary gene flow has resulted in Aboriginal Australians being closer related to Asians than to Europeans./nThis study was followed up with a new study in 2016 in the journal Nature about the genetic history of the Australian Aboriginals.[41]/nWillerslev's team sequenced the genome of one of the earliest anatomically modern humans from Europe, Kostenki 14 from Russia dated to be between 36-38,000 years old.[42] The results show that most of the major genetic components present in Europeans today were present in Europe from early on. In 2014 his team undertook the first large scale past population genomic study reporting more than 100 ancient genomes from Bronze Age Europe and Asia.[43] They found that lactose tolerance that is common in northern Europe today was not common even as late as 2,000 years ago. They also found evidence for major population movements and replacements in both Europe and Asia during the Bronze Age time and that significant parts of contemporary European and Asian genetic diversity were created during this period. They later showed that plague was a likely driver of Bronze Age population dynamics, which as of 2015 is the oldest genomes of Yersinia pestis (the etiological agent of plague) reported.[44]/nIn 2018, Willerslev and colleges published 2 papers in Nature and Science the same day addressing the population history of Central and Southern Asia.[45][46] The Science paper deals with the spread of the Bronze Age pastoralists, such as Yamnaya and the peoples they met in Asia. They could show that descendants of the 24-thousand-year-old Malt\u00e1 boy from Siberia[34] survived in Central Asia until at least 5 thousand years ago and were the occupants of Botai \u2013 an archaeological site in Kazakhstan holding the oldest evidence of horse domestication some 5-6 thousand years ago. They further showed that in contrast to Europe, early Bronze Age expansion of Yamnaya into Asia had limited genetic and linguistic impact in either Central Asia or in South Asia, contrary to earlier claims by the Reich group from Harvard. The paper thereby challenges the so-called \u201cSteppe Hypothesis\u201d for early spread of the Indo-European languages that seem to explain the early expansion of Indo-European languages into Europe but not Asia. The latter is argued to have happened by later Bronze groups, such as the Sintashta, and reaching all the way to India and Pakistan./nThe accompanying Nature paper is based on 137 ancient human genomes of the Eurasian steppe mainly from the time following the Bronze Age.[46] They find the genetics of the mounted Scythian groups that dominated the Eurasian steppes throughout the Iron Age were highly diverse, consisting of several ethnicities of European and Asian origins despite its highly uniform culture. Later, Scythians admixed and were replaced by steppe nomads from the east coming out of the Xiongnu confederations of Mongolia and China, including the westward-expanding Huns (fourth\u2013fifth century AD). These were later admixed and replaced by expanding East Asian groups including Genghis Khan in the Medieval period. Accordingly, the events transformed the Eurasian steppes from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely West Eurasian ancestry to the mostly Turkic-speaking groups of the present day, who are primarily of East Asian ancestry. According to Willerslev, this was all due to the long-distance traveling enabled by domestication of the horse.[47]/nIn 2018 Willerslev lead an international research team sequencing 26 ancient human genome sequences from across Southeast Asia, some dating back 8 thousand years,[48] 4 thousand years earlier than previous sequences from the region.[49] This was made possible by a modified whole genome capture approach. They used this data to test two hypotheses on southeast Asian population history: One theory argues that the indigenous H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian hunter-gatherers who populated Southeast Asia from 44,000 years ago adopted agricultural practices independently, without the input from early farmers from East Asia. A second theory, referred to as the \u2018two-layer model\u2019 favours the view that migrating rice farmers from what is now China replaced the indigenous H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian hunter-gatherers.[50] They determined that neither interpretation fits the complexity of Southeast Asian history and that contemporary Southeast Asians have been influenced by at least four migration waves. The first wave is represented by H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian hunter-gatherers who were closely genetically related to traditional hunter-gatherers in Malaysia, the Philippines, and the Andaman Islands (so-called \u201cnegritos\u201d). The second wave derived from mainland China and brought with them farming economies such as rice 4000 years ago and mixed with the H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhians. These were followed by two additional migration waves; by 2 thousand years ago, Southeast Asian individuals carried additional East Asian ancestry components. One component likely represents the introduction of ancestral Kradai languages in Mainland southeast Asia, and another the Austronesian expansion reaching Indonesia by 2.1 thousand years ago and the Philippines by 1.8 thousand years ago. Among their genomes was also an ancient J\u014dmon genome from Japan that showed shared genetic history with the H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhians./nWillerslevs team has been the first to conduct large scale genome sequencing of ancient pathogens. In 2015 they showed that plague was a likely driver of Bronze Age population dynamics, which as of 2015 represents the oldest genomes of Yersinia pestis (the etiological agent of plague) reported.[44] \nLater they showed that westward-expanding Huns carried with them plague that was basal to the Justinian plague, and are thus the likely source of this plaque entering into Europe with the devastating consequence of killing millions as a result.[45]\nIn 2018 they published a large-scale study on ancient genomes of Hepatitis B (HBV).[51] They found evidence of a long-term association of modern HBV genotypes with humans dating back at least 4,5 thousand years, which includes genotypes that are now extinct. They also found that in several cases, the geographical locations of the ancient genotypes do not match present-day distributions. Genotypes that today are typical of Africa and Asia, as well as a subgenotype from India, are shown to have an early Eurasian presence with humans, revealing a complexity of HBV evolution that is not evident when considering modern sequences alone./nWillerslev also led a study showing that living bacteria can take up ancient DNA by natural transformation allowing for genomic recycling of ancient genetic traits,[52] and another study showing the survival of bacteria cells in permafrost for about 1/2 million years.[53]/nWillerslev and collaborators have sequenced the genome of a 700,000-year-old horse from Yukon in Canada, which as of 2016 was the oldest genome ever sequenced,[31] until the publication of a million-year-old mammoth genome in 2021.[54]/nWillerslev appears regularly in media such as magazines, newspapers, radio and TV when discussions turn to human evolution, migration, and the role of science in society. He and his staff at the Centre for GeoGenetics[55] have participated in documentaries including The Great Human Odyssey (PBS/CBC/DR), Code Breakers (CBC/DR) and Equus - Story of the Horse (CBC/PBS/DR/ZDF), First Peoples (PBS), Search for the Head of John the Baptist and How to Build and Ancient Man (both National Geographic).[citation needed]\nIn 2016 he was featured in a profile article in The New York Times.[3]/nHis father's education of Eske and his brother was rather authoritarian, and included frequent physical challenges, such as obstacle paths and swimming in ice water, already at the age of six. His father thought this would help them to become hardy later in life.[56]/nWillerslev's father was fiercely atheist.[57] However, influenced by numerous experiences living with native people, Willerslev came to respect, and to some extent believe, in supernatural powers unknown to science. Such experiences included encounters with descendants of Sitting Bull and trapper tribes in Siberia:/n\"Something similar happened to me when I shot a bear in Siberia. The tradition there is that you pin the bear's head high up in a tree, overlooking where the bear had its hunting grounds. I refused and instead took the bear's head with me home as a trophy. Back home, everything started to go wrong for me, and I suffered terrible nightmares. In Siberia the trappers had told me, if I didn't hang up the head as required, all the bears in the world would know about it and hate me for it. I then took a trip to our summer house in Sweden and pinned up the bear's head in a tree there, and the nightmares stopped.\"[57]/nAt the age of 32, he became baptized as Christian, although he declares himself as \"religious, but not Christian\".[57]\nWillerslev married Ulrikke Ji Mee Willerslev in 2007.

He is currently a Professor of Biology at Macquarie University, and an Emeritus Professor at The University of Sydney./nRick Shine was born in Brisbane in 1950. He attended schools in Melbourne, Sydney, and Canberra, and completed his university studies at the Australian National University with an Honours degree in zoology in 1971 (supervised by Dr Richard E. Barwick). His PhD was obtained from the University of New England in Armidale, under the supervision of Professor Harold F. Heatwole, and dealt with the field ecology of Australian venomous snakes. It was the first detailed ecological research on these animals. He also began working on broader questions in evolutionary biology, collaboratively with another student, James J. Bull, currently the Johann Friedrich Miescher Regents Professor in Molecular Biology at the University of Texas at Austin./nHis brother is scientist John Shine.[1] Uniquely, both brothers are Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science, have received awards from that body, and have won the nation\u2019s top award in research, the Prime Minister\u2019s Prize for Science (John in 2010, Rick in 2016)./nShine conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City (1976 to 1978) in the research groups of Professor Eric Charnov and Professor John M. Legler. He returned to Australia to take up a postdoctoral position at the University of Sydney (with Professor Charles L. Birch and Dr. Gordon C. Grigg) in 1978, and was appointed to a lectureship at that institution in 1980. He became a Research Associate of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in 1988.[2] He was appointed to a Professorship at the University of Sydney in 2003, having relinquished undergraduate teaching to concentrate on research and graduate training in 2002, under fellowships from the Australian Research Council (Australian Professorial Fellowship 2002-2005; Federation Fellowship 2006-2010; Laureate Fellowship 2013-2018)./nHis early research focused on the ecology of snakes, and on the evolutionary factors that have shaped patterns in reptile reproduction (such as the transition from egg-laying to live-bearing, and the evolution of size differences between the sexes, and the selective milieu driving variation in reproductive traits). His initial studies were based mostly in Australia, and mostly with venomous snakes, but he later conducted research on the behavioural ecology of snakes in several parts of the world, notably on red-sided gartersnakes Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis in Canada, vipers Vipera berus in Sweden and France, island pit vipers Gloydius shedaoensis in China, seasnakes Laticauda and Emydocephalus annulatus in the Pacific islands, and reticulated pythons Python reticulatus in Indonesia./nHe also dissected thousands of preserved snakes in museum collections to document basic natural history patterns of hundreds of species from Australia, the Pacific, and southern Africa. In Australia, he initiated three long-term field-based ecological research programs; one on developmental biology and phenotypic plasticity in scincid lizards of the Brindabella Range near Canberra, jointly with Melanie Elphick; one on the endangered broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) near Nowra, jointly with Jonathan Webb; and one on snakes of the Adelaide River floodplain near Darwin, jointly with several postdoctoral collaborators including Thomas Madsen and Gregory P. Brown./nThe arrival of the invasion front of the highly toxic cane toad  (Bufo marinus or Rhinella marina, in alternative naming schemes) at the tropical study site in 2005 prompted a major expansion of the research program, beginning with a central focus on the ecological impact of toads on native fauna, but later expanding to aspects of toad biology and toad control. The discovery that the toad invasion front had accelerated markedly through time, because of much more rapid dispersal by individual toads at the frontline, stimulated another new research program. With colleagues Benjamin L. Phillips and Gregory P. Brown, Shine proposed that the evolutionary acceleration of the toad invasion was caused by a process different from the adaptive processes envisaged by mainstream evolutionary biology. The new explanation relied upon spatial sorting of traits that affected dispersal rates of toads, with only the fastest-moving individuals being able to stay near the increasingly rapidly moving invasion front. Interbreeding among those fast-moving individuals produced progeny that in some cases were even quicker than their parents, giving rise to a progressive acceleration in invasion speed over time, even if there were no advantages to fast dispersal for the individuals concerned./nResearch by Shine\u2019s group (\u201cTeam Bufo\u201d) also measured ecological impacts of invasive cane toads, revealing a complex pattern whereby some native species benefit rather than suffer from toad invasion. The major victims are large predators (poisoned by eating toxic toads) and the main beneficiaries are the species previously consumed by those predators. The research then extended to new methods for toad control, and Shine (in collaboration with Michael Crossland and Robert Capon) found that the cannibalistic nature of cane toad tadpoles can be turned against them. Toad tadpoles are attracted to the toxins of adult toads (which they use as a cue to find newly laid toad eggs) and so can be trapped using the toxin as a bait. Within the first year of its use by community groups, this method is thought to have removed more than a million cane toad tadpoles from natural waterbodies. The same research team also discovered a suppression pheromone, produced by older toad tadpoles to kill younger ones, that may be useful for toad control./nShine suggested a new method of buffering the impact of cane toads on vulnerable native predators, by releasing small cane toads at the invasion front (to induce taste aversion, by inducing nausea and thus discouraging predators from eating fatally large toads). Although initially greeted with scepticism, field studies validated its effectiveness [3] and the method is now being widely applied in northwestern Australia./nAfter 40 years at The University of Sydney, Shine took up a position at Macquarie University in December 2018. He continues to conduct ecological and evolutionary research on reptiles and amphibians./nShine has published more than 1000 papers in professional journals,[4] written two books (Australian Snakes.

He enrolled at Lund University in 1812 where he studied medicine, and alternated with studies in Copenhagen, until he in 1818 became a licensed doctor of medicine. Through his friendship with J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, as early as 1824 he was appointed temporary professor of anatomy at the Karolinska Institute, an institute to which he dedicated much of his strength for many years. In 1830 he was also appointed temporary supervisor there, and in 1840 he was appointed both permanent professor and supervisor.[1] Pathologist Axel Key was one of his students.[2]/nDuring the next decades he made many anatomical discoveries, for instance about the finer parts of the teeth, of the skull, of the muscles and of the nervous system. He was also an anthropologist, whose studies of the human cranium led to the classifications dolichocephalic and brachycephalic. He was considered to be very knowledgeable and was elected into many of the scientific academies at the time. He is credited with defining the cephalic index, which is the ratio of width to length of one's head.[3]/nRetzius was a polygenist. Retzius studied many different skull types from different races; because the skulls were so different from each race, he believed that the races had a separate origin.[4]/nThe retropubic space of Retzius is named after him.[5] The peritoneum lies deep to the posterior layer of transversalis fascia and is very adherent to it. Distally, this close contact remains in the area lateral to the epigastrics. Medially, however, the peritoneum reflects on the roof of the bladder and runs sharply dorsally, away from the deep layer of transversalis fascia. The separation of transversalis fascia and peritoneum contains loose fatty tissue allowing for the filling of the bladder. This space is called the retropubic space of Retzius (from the Clinic of Digestive Surgery, University Hospital St-Pierre, Brussels)./nRetzius was active in the temperance movement, engaging himself in the battle against the Swedish drinking habits\u00a0\u2013 which at this time had a significant impact on Swedish society\u00a0\u2013 with works on the harmful effects liquor has on the body.

His stormy career ended in his enforced resignation. His words \u2013 \"If reason and charity cannot promote the cause of truth and piety, I cannot see how it should ever flourish under the withering fires of wrath and strife\" \u2013 epitomize his career.[1]/nSmith was born in Pequea, Pennsylvania, on March 15, 1751. He was the son of Robert Smith (1723\u20131793) and Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Blair) Smith (1725\u20131777). In 1769, he graduated as a salutatorian from the College of New Jersey (name later changed to Princeton University), and went on to study theology and philosophy under John Witherspoon.[2]/nIn his mid-twenties, he worked as a missionary in Virginia, and from 1775 to 1779, he served as the founder and rector of Hampden\u2013Sydney College, which he referred to in his advertisement of 1 September 1775 as \"an Academy in Prince Edward.\"[3] The school, not then named, was always intended to be a college-level institution; later in the same advertisement, Smith explicitly likens its curriculum to that of the College of New Jersey. \"Academy\" was a technical term used for college-level schools not run by the established church.[4] Stanhope Smith held honorary doctorates from Yale and Harvard and in 1785, was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.[5]/nSmith studied under president Witherspoon and returned to Princeton as a professor in 1779, and succeeded Witherspoon as president in 1795. The situation during the winter semester of 1806\u201307 under Smith's presidency was characterized by little or no faculty-student rapport or communication, crowded conditions, and strict school rules \u2014 a combination that led to a student riot on 31 March\u20131 April 1807. College authorities denounced it as a sign of moral decay. Smith was active in the affairs of the Presbyterian Church and served as moderator of the 11th General Assembly in 1799. Smith was an urbane and cultivated man who sought, in the tradition of Witherspoon, to maintain orthodoxy while opposing tendencies toward rigidity and obscurantism. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he was forced to resign from his office in 1812 as a result of criticism from within the church. In his efforts to reconcile reason and revelation Smith left himself vulnerable to charges of rationalism and Arminianism.[6]/nSmith was the first systematic expositor of Scottish Common Sense Realism in America. An empiricist in his anthropology and a Lamarckian before Lamarck, he sought to mediate between science and religious orthodoxy.[1]/nIn his work, Stanhope Smith expressed progressive views on marriage and egalitarian ideas about race and slavery. The second edition of his Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species (1810) became important as a powerful argument against the increasing racism of 19th-century ethnology.[7] He opposed the racial classifications of naturalists such as Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, and Carl Linnaeus.[8] In this text, his attempt to explain the variety of physical appearances among humans involved a strongly environmental outlook.

Taha worked hard to contribute to Iraqi weapons program. As a result of Taha\u2019s hard work she became known as the mother of all third world biological weapons programs. It was Taha who sold the idea of an Iraqi biological weapons program to Saddam Hussein and was given an award for her work in biological weapons, specifically the development of anthrax and botulinum weapons by Saddam Hussein. Moreover, she has been held up as an example to Iraqi women interested in science.[3]/nTaha first rose to prominence in the Western media after being named in a 2003 British intelligence dossier, released to the public by the Prime Minister Tony Blair, on Iraq's biological, chemical and nuclear capability. The dossier alleged that Taha had played a leading role in the manufacture of anthrax and other biological agents.[4] It was this dossier that triggered the chain of events that led to the suicide of British UN weapons inspector David Kelly, who was accused of telling a BBC reporter that some of the intelligence had been manipulated. Kelly, as an UNSCOM weapons inspector visiting Iraq on the occasions described below, had interrogated Taha so pitilessly that she was \"reduced to tears\".[5]/nBorn in 1957, and a graduate of the University of Baghdad, Taha received her Ph.D in plant toxins from the University of East Anglia's School of Biological Sciences in Norwich, which she attended from 1980 to 1984.

Taha met General Rashid, who has a Ph.D in engineering from the University of Birmingham, when they were both invited to New York City for a meeting with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in 1993./nIn 1997, Saddam Hussein awarded Taha a medal of scientific achievement and, prior to the 2003 war on Iraq, broadcasts were aired showing Taha and Saddam sitting next to each other. On 12 May 2003, the U.S. government announced that Taha had surrendered to coalition forces./nAlthough Taha told her fellow students at Norwich that she wanted to return to Iraq to teach biology, she went instead to work for Iraq's germ warfare program. In 1985, she worked in the al-Muthanna chemical plant near Baghdad, and later became chief production officer in al-Hakam (also spelled al-Hakum), Iraq's top-secret biological-warfare facility at the time./nDuring several visits to Iraq by United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities,[7] weapons inspectors were told by Taha that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant. \"There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant,\" Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM's deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, \"beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.\"/nAccording to the 1999 DIA report, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages when questioned about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, storming out of the room, before returning and smashing a chair.[8] However, in 1995, UNSCOM's principal weapons inspector Rod Barton from Australia showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM from the Israeli government that showed the Iraqi regime had just purchased 10 tons of growth media from a British company called Oxoid. Growth media is a mixture of sugar, proteins and minerals that allows microscopic life to grow; it is used in hospitals, where swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth media for diagnostic purposes. Iraq's hospital consumption of growth media was just 200\u00a0kg a year, yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it./nShown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to the inspectors that her biological weapons agency had grown 19,000 litres of botulism toxin;[9] 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver cancer; Clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin, a castor bean derivative which can kill by inhibiting protein synthesis. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha's work with camel pox that the U.S. and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in the 1970s and UNSCOM scientists believe the government would have retained contaminated material./nUNSCOM learned that, In August 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Taha's team was ordered to set up a program to weaponize the biological agents. By January 1991, a team of 100 scientists and support staff had filled 157 bombs and 16 missile warheads with botulin toxin, and 50 bombs and five missile warheads with anthrax. In an interview with the BBC, Taha denied the Iraqi government had weaponized the bacteria. \"We never intended to use it,\" she told journalist Jane Corbin of the BBC's Panorama program. \"We never wanted to cause harm or damage to anybody.\"[9] However, UNSCOM found the munitions dumped in a river near the facility at al-Hakam. UNSCOM also discovered that Taha's team had conducted inhalation experiments on donkeys from England and on beagles from Germany. The inspectors seized photographs showing beagles having convulsions inside sealed containers./nOn 18 March 2005, the Associated Press reported that Taha had provided an explanation for the 1,800 gallon discrepancy between the amount of anthrax the UN knew she had manufactured, and the amount she admitted to destroying. The missing anthrax was one of the stated reasons for the Iraq war and was emphasized by then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell during his February 2003 speech to the Security Council. However, according to an Iraq Survey Group report published on 6 October 2004, Taha told American investigators that she and her colleagues dumped the missing anthrax near the gates of one of Saddam's palaces in April 1991, but were afraid to admit to this for fear of incurring Saddam's wrath. The Iraqi biologists therefore told the UN weapons inspectors that the missing anthrax had never existed.[10]/nThe inspectors feared that Taha's team had experimented on human beings. During one inspection, they discovered two primate-sized inhalation chambers, one measuring 5 cubic metres, though there was no evidence the Iraqis had used large primates in their experiments. According to former weapons inspector Scott Ritter in his 1999 book Endgame: Solving the Iraq Crisis, UNSCOM learned that, between 1 July and 15 August 1995, 50 prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison were transferred to a military post in al-Haditha, in the northwest of Iraq, (Ritter, 1999). Iraqi opposition groups say that scientists sprayed the prisoners with anthrax, though no evidence was produced to support these allegations. During one experiment, the inspectors were told, 12 prisoners were tied to posts while shells loaded with anthrax were blown up nearby. Ritter's team demanded to see documents from Abu Ghraib prison showing a prisoner count. Ritter writes that they discovered the records for July and August 1995 were missing.

Armstrong and Hensley were killed within the first 72 hours, but Bigley was kept alive for three weeks. The only Iraqi women prisoners being held at that time, according to the British government, were Taha and another woman scientist, Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a bio-tech researcher who was on the U.S. list of the 55 most wanted members of Saddam's regime.[12] It was hoped that the release of these women, who had not been charged with any offence, would trigger the release of Bigley./nOn 22 September 2004, Noori Abdul-Rahim Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Iraqi Justice Ministry, said that Taha would be released on bail. He said the decision was not related to Zarqawi's demands, but that the government regularly reviews the cases of prominent detainees, and it was decided to release Taha because she had cooperated with the authorities. However, after a statement from U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell that there would be no negotiations with terrorists, Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced that neither Taha nor Ammash would be released in the near future.

He is recognized as the first microbiologist who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague. He tested the vaccines on himself. Joseph Lister, named him \"a saviour of humanity\".[1][2]/nHe was appointed Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in Queen Victoria's 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours. The Jewish Chronicle of that time noted \"a Ukraine Jew, trained in the schools of European science, saves the lives of Hindus and Mohammedans and is decorated by the descendant of William the Conqueror and Alfred the Great.\"[3] He naturalised as a British Subject in 1900.

Haffkine was injured while defending a Jewish home during a pogrom.  As a result of this action he was arrested but later released due to the intervention of biologist Ilya Mechnikov.[9]/nHaffkine continued his studies from 1879 to 1883 with Mechnikov at Odesa University, but after the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, the government increasingly cracked down on people it considered suspicious, including intelligentsia.[7] Haffkine graduated with a Doctor of Science at the age of 23.[5] Haffkine was also employed by the zoological museum at Odessa from 1882 to 1888. Debarred from professorship, as a Jew,[7] in 1888, Haffkine was allowed to emigrate to Switzerland and began his work at the University of Geneva, as an assistant professor of Physiology.[5] In 1889 he joined Mechnikov and Louis Pasteur in Paris at the newly established Pasteur Institute where he took up the only available post of librarian.[8][10]/nHaffkine began his scientific career as a protozoologist and protistologist, under the tutelage of Ilya Mechnikov at Imperial Novorossiya University in Odessa and later at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.[11] His early research was on protists such as Astasia, Euglena, and Paramecium, as well as the earliest studies on Holospora, a bacterial parasite of Paramecium.[11] In the early 1890s, Haffkine shifted his attention to studies in practical bacteriology.[11]/nThe euglenid genus Khawkinea is named in honor of Haffkine's early studies of euglenids, first published in French journals with the author name transliterated from Cyrillic as \"Mardoch\u00e9e-Woldemar Khawkine\"./nAt the time, one of the five great cholera pandemics of the 19th century ravaged Asia and Europe. Even though Robert Koch discovered Vibrio cholerae in 1883, the medical science at that time did not consider it a sole cause of the disease. This view was supported by experiments by several biologists, notably Jaume Ferran i Clua in Spain.[citation needed]/nHaffkine focused his research on developing a cholera vaccine, and produced an attenuated form of the bacterium. Risking his own life, on 18 July 1892, Haffkine performed the first human test on himself and reported his findings on 30 July to the Biological Society. Even though his discovery caused an enthusiastic stir in the press, it was not widely accepted by his senior colleagues, including both Mechnikov and Pasteur, nor by European official medical establishment in France, Germany and Russia.[citation needed]/nHaffkine considered India, where hundreds of thousands died from ongoing epidemics, as the best place to test his vaccine.[10] Through the influence of the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, who was in Paris as the British Ambassador, he was allowed to demonstrate his ideas in England. He proceeded to India in 1893 and established a laboratory at Byculla in 1896, which moved to Parel and was later called the Haffkine Institute. Haffkine worked on the plague and by 1902\u201303 half a million were inoculated but on 30 October 1902, 19 people died from tetanus out of 107 inoculated at Mulkowal. This \"Mulkowal disaster\" led to an enquiry.[12] He was briefly suspended but reappointed director of the Biological Laboratory in Calcutta.[citation needed] He retired in 1915 and suffering from malaria, had to return to France./n\"Unlike tetanus or diphtheria, which were quickly neutralized by effective vaccines by the 1920s, the immunological aspects of bubonic plague proved to be much more daunting.\"[13] In October 1896, an epidemic of bubonic plague struck Bombay and the government asked Haffkine to help. He embarked upon the development of a vaccine in a makeshift laboratory in a corridor of Grant Medical College. In three months of persistent work (one of his assistants experienced a nervous breakdown; two others quit), a form for human trials was ready and on 10 January 1897[14] Haffkine tested it on himself. \"Haffkine's vaccine used a small amount of the bacteria to produce an immune reaction.\"[15] After these results were announced to the authorities, volunteers at the Byculla jail were inoculated and survived the epidemics, while seven inmates of the control group died.  \"Like others of these early vaccines, the Haffkine formulation had nasty side effects, and did not provide complete protection, though it was said to have reduced risk by up to 50 percent.\"[13][15]/nDespite Haffkine's successes,  some officials still primarily insisted on methods based on sanitarianism: washing homes by fire hose with lime, herding affected and suspected persons into camps and hospitals, and restricting travel.[citation needed]/nEven though official Russia was still unsympathetic to his research,[citation needed] Haffkine's Russian colleagues, doctors V. K. Vysokovich and D. K. Zabolotny, visited him in Bombay.  During the 1898 cholera outbreak in the Russian Empire, the vaccine called \"\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0444\u0430 \u0425\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430\" (\"limfa Havkina\", Havkin's lymph) saved thousands of lives across the empire./nBy the turn of the 20th century, the number of inoculees in India alone reached four million and Haffkine was appointed the Director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called Haffkine Institute).[10] In 1900, he was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.[16]/nHaffkine was the first to prepare a vaccine for human prophylaxis by killing virulent culture by heat at 60\u00a0\u00b0C.[17] The major limit of his vaccine was the lack of activity against pulmonary forms of plague.[18]/nIn 1898, Haffkine approached Aga Khan III with an offer for Sultan Abdul Hamid II to resettle Jews in Palestine, then a province of the Ottoman Empire: the effort \"could be progressively undertaken in the Holy Land\", \"the land would be obtained by purchase from the Sultan's subjects\", \"the capital was to be provided by wealthier members of the Jewish community\", but the plan was rejected.[citation needed]/nIn March 1902, nineteen Indian villagers from Mulkowal in Punjab (inoculated from a single bottle of vaccine) died of tetanus, whilst the other 88 villagers were well. Evidence pointed to the contamination of one bottle - 53N. The procedure for sterilisation at the Parel lab had been changed from carbolic acid to sterilisation using heating, a process that had been used at the Pasteur Institute safely for two years but was new in the British Empire. The 1903 commission from the Indian government concluded this was the source of the contamination.[1]/nAn inquiry commission indicted Haffkine, and he was relieved of his position and returned to England. The report was unofficially known as the \"Little Dreyfus affair\", as a reminder of Haffkine's Jewish background and religion.[citation needed]/nThe Lister Institute reinvestigated the claim and overruled the verdict: it was discovered that an assistant used a dirty bottle cap without sterilizing it./nIn July 1907, a letter published in The Times called the case against Haffkine \"distinctly disproven\". It was signed by Ronald Ross, \nWilliam R. Smith, and Simon Flexner, among other medical dignitaries. This led to Haffkine's acquittal./nSince Haffkine's post in Bombay was already occupied, he moved to Calcutta and worked there until his retirement in 1914.[19]  Haffkine returned to France and later moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he spent the last years of his life./nHaffkine received numerous honors and awards. In 1925, the Plague Laboratory in Bombay was renamed the Haffkine Institute. In commemoration of the centennial of his birth, Haffkine Park was planted in Israel in the 1960s./nIn a biography of him, Nobelist Selman Abraham Waksman explains that, in this last phase of his life, Haffkine had become a deeply religious man. Haffkine returned to Orthodox Jewish practice and wrote A Plea for Orthodoxy (1916). In this article, he advocated traditional religious observance and decried the lack of such observance among \"enlightened\" Jews, and stressed the importance of community life, stating:/nA brotherhood built up of racial ties, long tradition, common suffering, faith and hope, is a union ready-made, differing from artificial unions in that the bonds existing between the members contain an added promise of duration and utility. Such a union takes many centuries to form and is a power for good, the neglect or disuse of which is as much an injury to humanity as the removal of an important limb is to the individual... no law of nature operates with more fatality and precision than the law according to which those communities survive in the strife for existence that conform the nearest to the Jewish teachings on the relation of man to his Creator; on the ordering of time for work and rest; on the formation of families and the duties of husband and wife, parents and children; on the paramount obligations of truthfulness and justice between neighbor and neighbor and to the stranger within the gates./nIn 1929, he established the Haffkine Foundation to foster Jewish education in Eastern Europe. Haffkine was also respectful of other religions, and \"he considered it of the utmost importance to promote the study of the Bible.\"[21]/nIn 1982, the Chabad Hasidic movement published three letters addressed to Haffkine by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, who had engaged Haffkine to support the Jews living in communist Russia.[22]:\u200a32\u201347", "44040939": "Urs Leupold (July 19, 1923 \u2013 October 9, 2006) was a Swiss geneticist whose studies of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe were instrumental in establishing this organism as a key model system for eukaryotic cell and molecular biology.[1][2]  Leupold began his studies of S. pombe in 1946 upon encouragement by \u00d8jvind Winge. In 1947, Leupold determined that a culture of S. pombe str. liquefaciens contained strains expressing four distinct mating types: h40,  h90, h+, and h\u2212. Most current S. pombe laboratory strains are derived from the h90, h+, and h\u2212 strains known as 968, 975, and 972.[3]/nLeupold went on to carry out postdoctoral studies with Norman Horowitz at Caltech and with Boris Ephrussi at the University of Paris. Notably, with Norman Horowitz, Leupold isolated the first conditional (temperature sensitive) mutations in the bacterium Escherichia coli as part of an effort to address criticisms raised by Max Delbr\u00fcck of the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis[4]/nIn 1952, Leupold returned to studying S. pombe first at the University of Z\u00fcrich from 1952 to 1963 and then as head of the Institute of General Microbiology at the University of Bern from 1963 to 1986. During this time, his laboratory made major contributions to the understanding of genetic mutations and suppressors in S. pombe, as well as the construction of a genetic map of this yeast. As the recognized leader in fission yeast genetics, Leupold had a great impact on the first generation of scientists to use S. pombe for genetic studies. In 1973, Paul Nurse spent a couple months with Leupold to learn S. pombe genetics before beginning his seminal studies on cell cycle control with Murdoch Mitchison in Edinburgh, Scotland. Other notable S. pombe scientists who trained with Leupold include Peter Munz, J\u00fcrg Kohli, Herbert Gutz, Matthias Sipiczki and the late Pierre Thuriaux.", "45253364": "Susan C.

Along with fellow physician Herophilus, he founded a school of anatomy in Alexandria, where they carried out anatomical research. As well, he is credited with helping to found the methodic school of teachings of medicine in Alexandria whilst opposing traditional humoral theories of Hippocratic ideologies.[1] Together with Herophilus, he is credited by historians as the potential founder of neuroscience due to his acknowledgements of nerves and their roles in motor control through the brain and skeletal muscles.[1]/nFurthermore, Erasistratus is seen as one of the first physicians/scientists to conduct recorded dissections and potential vivisections alongside Herophilus.[2][3][4] The two physicians were said by several Roman authors, notably Augustine, Celsus, and Tertullian, to have performed controversial vivisections on criminals to study the anatomy and possible physiology of human organs while they were in Alexandria.[2] Because of their research, Erasistratus and Herophilus were heavily criticized for their utilization of vivisections; specifically, by the author Tertullian who followed Christian values.[5] Erasistratus and Herophilus are thought to be the only physicians to perform systematic dissections on the human body until the Renaissance.[2]/nErasistratus is credited for his description of the valves of the heart, and he also concluded that the heart was not the center of sensations, but that it instead functioned as a pump. He was among the first to distinguish between veins and arteries, believing that the arteries were full of air and that they carried the \"animal spirit\" (pneuma). He considered atoms to be the essential body element, and he believed they were vitalized by the pneuma that circulated through the nerves. He also thought that the nerves moved a nervous spirit from the brain. He then differentiated between the function of the sensory and motor nerves, and linked them to the brain. He is credited with one of the first in-depth descriptions of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Erasistratus is regarded by some as the founder of physiology.[6][7]/nErasistratus is generally supposed to have been born at Ioulis on the island of Ceos,[8] though Stephanus of Byzantium refers to him as a native of Cos;[9] Galen, as a native of Chios;[10] and the emperor Julian, as a native of Samos.[11] Pliny says he was the grandson of Aristotle by his daughter Pythias,[12] but this is not confirmed by any other ancient writer; and according to the Suda, he was the son of Cretoxena, the sister of the physician Medius, and Cleombrotus. From the latter it is not quite clear whether Cleombrotus was his father or his uncle. He was a pupil of Chrysippus of Cnidos,[13] Metrodorus,[14] and apparently Theophrastus.[15][16]/nHe lived for some time at the court of Seleucus I Nicator, where he acquired great reputation by discovering the disease of Antiochus I Soter, the king's eldest son, probably 294 BC. Seleucus in his old age had lately married Stratonice, the young and beautiful daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and she had already borne him one child.[17] Antiochus fell violently in love with his stepmother, but did not disclose his passion, and chose rather to pine away in silence. The physicians were quite unable to discover the cause and nature of his disease, and Erasistratus himself was at a loss at first, till, finding nothing amiss about his body, he began to suspect that it must be his mind which was diseased, and that he might perhaps be in love. Erasistratus confirmed his conjecture when he observed that the skin of Antiochus grew hotter, his colour deeper, and his pulse quicker whenever Stratonice came near him, while none of these symptoms occurred on any other occasion. Accordingly, he told Seleucus that his son's disease was incurable, for he was in love, and that it was impossible to gratify his passion. The king wondered what the obstacle could be, and asked who the lady was. \"My wife,\" replied Erasistratus; upon which Seleucus began to persuade him to give her up to his son. The physician asked him if he would do so himself if it were his wife that the prince was in love with. The king protested that he would most gladly; upon which Erasistratus told him that it was indeed his own wife who had inspired his passion, and that he chose rather to die than to disclose his secret. Seleucus was as good as his word, and not only gave up Stratonice, but also resigned to his son several provinces of his empire. This celebrated story is told with variations by many ancient authors,[18] and a similar anecdote has been told of Hippocrates,[19] Galen,[20] Avicenna, and (if the names be not fictitious) Panacius[21] and Acestinus.[22] If this is the anecdote referred to by Pliny,[23] as is probably the case, Erasistratus is said to have received one hundred talents for being the means of restoring the prince to health, which would amount to one of the largest medical fees upon record./nVery little more is known of the personal history of Erasistratus: he lived for some time at Alexandria, which was at that time beginning to be a celebrated medical school, and gave up practice in his old age, that he might pursue his anatomical studies without interruption.[24] He and fellow physician Herophilus practiced anatomy with great success, and with such ardour that they are supposed to have dissected criminals alive.[25] These criminals were supposedly supplied by the king at the request of Herophilus.[2] By conducting these dissections on live subjects they were able to see the true color and shape of internal organs that were not present in deceased subjects.[2]  However, conducting these vivisections did not lead to the discovery that there was blood and not just pneuma present in the arteries, which should have been evident in dissecting a live person.[26] Erasistratus appears to have died in Asia Minor, as the Suda mentions that he was buried by mount Mycale in Ionia. The exact date of his death is not known, but he probably lived to a good old age, as, according to Eusebius, he was alive 258 BC, about forty years after the marriage of Antiochus and Stratonice. He had numerous pupils and followers, and a medical school bearing his name continued to exist at Smyrna in Ionia nearly till the time of Strabo, about the beginning of the 1st century.[27] The following are the names of the most celebrated physicians belonging to the sect founded by him: Apoemantes,[28] Apollonius Memphites, Apollophanes[29] Artemidoras, Charidemus, Chrysippus, Heraclides of Smyrna, Hermogenes, Hicesius, Martialius, Menodorus, Ptolemaeus, Strato, Xenophon.  An attack on Erasistratus and his followers is preserved in Anonymus Londinensis./nErasistratus wrote many works on anatomy, practical medicine and pharmacy, of which only the titles remain, together with a great number of short fragments preserved by Galen, Caelius Aurelianus, and other ancient writers. These, however, are sufficient to enable us to form a reasonable idea of his opinions both as a physician and an anatomist. It is as an anatomist that he is most celebrated, and perhaps there is not one ancient physician that did more to promote that branch of medical science than he./nHe appears to have been very near the discovery of the circulation of the blood, for in a passage preserved by Galen[30] he says:/nThe vein[31] arises from the part where the arteries, that are distributed to the whole body, have their origin, and penetrates to the sanguineous [or right] ventricle [of the heart]; and the artery [or pulmonary vein] arises from the part where the veins have their origin, and penetrates to the pneumatic [or left] ventricle of the heart./nThe description is not very clear, but seems to show that he supposed the venous and arterial systems to be more intimately connected than was generally believed. This idea is confirmed by another passage in which he is said to have differed from the other ancient anatomists, who believed that the veins arise from the liver, the arteries arise from the heart and the heart is the origin both of the veins and the arteries.[32] With these ideas, it can have been only his belief that the arteries contained air and not blood, that hindered his anticipating Harvey's discovery. These views also supported his belief that blood production started in the liver, and not the heart.[33] Erasistratus had a theory that if an artery was traumatized then it would be possible however to find blood at that point, not due to blood being present within the artery itself, but rather because of the body functioning like a vacuum.[33] When a hole would form in an artery, it would create a vacuum that would pull blood into it from a nearby vein.[33] With his discovery of the functioning of the four main valves of the heart, he saw that when material is moved out of the heart, new material moves in, but this does not happen constantly like a water pipe.[26] Once material has left the heart it can not come back in, and material that has entered the heart can not flow back out in the same direction.[26] This is accomplished by membranes that open and close their mouths on the valves of the heart.[26] However, according to Erasistratus the material moving through these valves is pneuma.[26] The tricuspid valves of the heart are generally said to have derived their name from Erasistratus.[34] This, however, appears to be an oversight, as Galen attributes it not to him, but to one of his followers.[35] Erasistratus also made observations on the morphology of the heart, describing the pulmonary artery and the aorta to have a sigmoid shape, a name which is still used presently.[16]/nErasistratus also appears to have paid particular attention to the anatomy of the brain, and in a passage from his works preserved by Galen[36] he speaks as if he had himself dissected a human brain. Galen says[37] that before Erasistratus had more closely examined into the origin of the nerves, he imagined that they arose from the dura mater and not from the substance of the brain; and that it was not until he was advanced in life that he satisfied himself by actual inspection that such was not the case. According to Rufus of Ephesus, he divided the nerves into those of sensation and those of motion, of which the former he considered to be hollow and to arise from the membranes of the brain and the latter from the substance of the brain itself and of the cerebellum.[38]/nHe asserted that the spleen,[39] the bile,[40] and several other parts of the body,[41] were entirely useless to animals. Erasistratus believed that fluids, when drunk, passed through the esophagus into the stomach. During his time, there was controversy that was carried on as to whether fluids when drunk passed through the trachea into the lungs, or through the esophagus into the stomach.[42] He is also supposed to have been the first person who added to the word arteria, which had hitherto designated the canal leading from the mouth to the lungs, the epithet tracheia, to distinguish it from the arteries, and hence to have been the originator of the modern name trachea. He attributed the sensation of hunger to emptiness of the stomach, and said that the Scythians were accustomed to tie a belt tightly round their middle, to enable them to abstain from food for a longer time without suffering inconvenience.[43]/nThe pneuma (spiritual substance) played a very important part both in his system of physiology and pathology: he supposed it to enter the lungs by the trachea, thence to pass by the pulmonary veins into the heart, and thence to be diffused throughout the whole body by means of the arteries;[44] that the use of respiration was to fill the arteries with air;[45] and that the pulsation of the arteries was caused by the movements of the pneuma. He accounted for diseases in the same way, and supposed that as long as the pneuma continued to fill the arteries and the blood was confined to the veins, the individual was in good health; but that when the blood from some cause or other got forced into the arteries, inflammation and fever was the consequence.[46]/nOf his method of cure the most remarkable peculiarity was his aversion to bloodletting and purgative medicines: he seems to have relied chiefly on diet and regimen, bathing, exercise, friction, and the most simple vegetables. Erasistratus was against bloodletting likely due to his theory of plethora.[26] This was a medical term that was commonly used in Hellanistic Greece, and Erasistratus believed it was where one's body parts were full of undigested fragments of food, causing the body to then function improperly.[26] This theory of plethora then was why many of his treatments pertained to diet, fasting, and use of drugs that would change digestion.[26] In surgery he was celebrated for the invention of a catheter that bore his name, and which was S-shaped.[47]/nMuch to the disagreement that Galen had towards Erasistratus's views regarding phlebotomy, the Alexandrian physician was said by Galen in his work entitled, Bloodletting, against the Erasistrateans at Rome, to have disregarded the importance of the practice and rather suggested alternative methods.[48] Notably, Erasistratus suggests the bandaging of a patient's armpits and groin to achieve the desired results associated with phlebotomy.[48] Galen continues in his work to highly criticize this viewpoint that the Alexandrian physician had regarding the medical practice, and points out that Erasistratus did not give enough evidence to support the avoidance of phlebotomy for other treatments.[48]/nErasistratus is frequently mentioned in historical documents with other significant figures of both his time period of the 3rd and 4th century BC and afterwards thanks to his accomplishments and advancements in the field of medicine.[26] The most prominent person he is referenced with from when he was living was that of Herophilus, another physician that was an important part of ancient Alexandrian medicine with Erasistratus.[26] Together, Erasistratus and Herophilus attributed to the revolutionary growth of knowledge in the Hellenistic period in not only science but culture as well in accordance to the writings of historians of antiquity.[26] Although, it is noted that Erasistratus and Herophilus did not share similar ideologies in the science of medicine as well as its practice.[48] One topic the two disagreed on what substance was actually carried by the arteries.[33] Herophilus believed that the arteries carried a mixture of pneuma and blood, while Erasistratus believed that they solely carried pneuma.[33] Erasistratus is said to have natural philosophical views as compared to others during the time, paving the way for the teaching of methodologists in the field of medicine.[26] The publications of some of Galen's work, from which there are many mentions of Erasistratus and Herophilus, led to further understanding of the differing ideologies.[26]/nErasistratus and Galen both supported the theory of pneuma, however their beliefs on how pneuma acquired the air it needed differed.[33] Erasistratus believed that pneuma received the air it needed from the lungs. Galen agreed that air from the lungs was used for pneuma, however in expelling also as much air as was breathed in there wasn't enough air present to account for all the pneuma needed to function. Galen also believed that air was brought in through pores of the skin, and through the nose which would move to the bony cavities of the brain to be used as psychic pneuma.[33]/nGalen also noted his disagreement with Erasistratus and Herophilus on their view of the composition of organic bodies.[49]  They adopted an Aristotelian view of organic bodies consisting of three levels: elements, uniform, and non-uniform parts.[49]  Elements consisted of the elements, earth, wind, water, and fire. Uniform parts consisted of the nature of animals such as bone and flesh.[49] Finally, non-uniform parts of nature were things such as a face or hand.[49]  Erasistratus and Herophilus believed that doctors should concern themselves with the uniform and non-uniform levels of the body, but not elements as that was the job of philosophers and scientists. This coincides with the role placed on physicians of the time to not act as scientists.[2] Galen however, believed that to understand the human body one had to understand the mixture of its elements.[49]/nMuch of what is known of Erasistratus and that of his work he did in the 3rd and 4th BC has become known through the work done by Galen.[26] Galen frequently notes the past ideas that had become prevalent from the work of Erasistratus when comparing it to that of his work and ideas.[26] Some historians have suggested that due to Erasistratus's disagreements with the ideologies found within Hippocratic teachings and beliefs, as well as notably phlebotomy, that Galen seems to ridicule some work that Erasistratus had synthesized.[26] However, there are numerous times that Galen backs the ideas of Erasistratus as well, leading to opposing claims that Galen was generally negative when discussing the ideologies produced by Erasistratus.[26]/nBy the time both Erasistratus and Herophilus had died, the empiricist school of medicine in Alexandria reigned as the most widely accepted ideology and method for practicing medicine for several centuries.[1] One notable event that historians credit to downfall of Erasistratus's ideas and influence was that of the Syrian War that occurred from 246\u2013241 BC due to its negative effect on the Alexandrian society, reducing its ability to fund programs that would continue the teachings of Erasistratus.[1] Although, even before the Syrian War devastated the culture and economy of the Alexandrian society, Ptolemy Malefactor in 145 BC negatively impacted the continuation of Erasistratus's teachings and ideas, as well as other Alexandrian teachings, as he pushed for Alexandrian intelligentsia to be removed from the Alexandrian society completely.[1] Ultimately, the destruction of many works, including that of Erasistratus and Herophilus, because of a fire that erupted at the great library in 391 AD may have been the greatest reason why there are limited sources of material to understand the teachings and work of Erasistratus outside that of the references to the Alexandrian physician from Galen's writings.[1] Furthermore, it may also be the event that resulted in none of Erasistratus's original writing remaining.[1]/nMuch of the documentation of the works of Erasistratus and Herophilus was undiscovered until the late 20th century,[26] so the importance of Erasistratus in the advancement of medical knowledge was not fully understood.  The only substantial collection of information about their work was several fragments of their writings assembled by K.F.H. Marx and R. Fuchs from German texts.[26] Before that, nearly the only way to learn about the work was by analyzing Galen's works, which mention Erasistratus.[26] Similar sets of fragmented texts were also collected in English by J.F. Dobson.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, H. von Staden and Garofalo also found many important sources of information on the Alexandrian physicians.[26]", "39093020": "Michael Morris Rosbash (born March 7, 1944) is an American geneticist and chronobiologist. Rosbash is a professor and researcher at Brandeis University[1] and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Rosbash's research group cloned the Drosophila period gene in 1984 and proposed the Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop[2] for circadian clocks in 1990. In 1998, they discovered the cycle gene, clock gene, and cryptochrome photoreceptor in Drosophila through the use of forward genetics, by first identifying the phenotype of a mutant and then determining the genetics behind the mutation. Rosbash was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. Along with Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall, he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm\".[3][4]/nMichael Rosbash was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His parents, Hilde and Alfred Rosbash, were Jewish refugees who left Nazi Germany in 1938.[5] His father was a cantor, which, in Judaism, is a person who chants worship services. Rosbash's family moved to Boston when he was two years old, and he has been an avid Red Sox fan ever since./nInitially, Rosbash was interested in mathematics but an undergraduate biology course at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and a summer of working in Norman Davidson's lab steered him towards biological research. Rosbash graduated from Caltech in 1965 with a degree in chemistry, spent a year at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique in Paris on the Fulbright Scholarship, and obtained a doctoral degree in biophysics in 1970 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Sheldon Penman. After spending three years on a postdoctoral fellowship in genetics at the University of Edinburgh, Rosbash joined the Brandeis University faculty in 1974./nRosbash is married to fellow scientist Nadja Abovich and he has a stepdaughter named Paula and daughter named Tanya.[6]/nRosbash's research initially focused on the metabolism and processing of mRNA; mRNA is the molecular link between DNA and protein. After arriving at Brandeis, Rosbash collaborated with co-worker Jeffrey Hall[7] and investigated the genetic influences on circadian rhythms of the internal biological clock. They used Drosophila melanogaster to study patterns of activity and rest. In 1984, Rosbash and Hall cloned the first Drosophila clock gene, period. Following work done by post-doctoral fellow, Paul Hardin, in discovering that period mRNA and its associated protein (PER) had fluctuating levels during the circadian cycle, in 1990 they proposed a Transcription Translation Negative Feedback Loop (TTFL) model as the basis of the circadian clock.[8] Following this proposal, they looked into the elements that make up other parts of the clock. In May 1998, Rosbash et al. found a homolog for mammalian Clock that performed the same function of activating the transcription of per and tim that they proceeded to call dClock.[9] Also in May 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered in Drosophila the clock gene cycle, a homolog of the mammalian bmal1 gene.[10] In November 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered the cryb Drosophila mutant, which lead to the conclusion that cryptochrome protein is involved in circadian photoreception.[11]/nRosbash began studying mRNA processing as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His work in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed the enzymes, proteins, and subcellular organelles and their convergence upon mRNA in a specific order in order to translate mRNA into proteins. Missteps in this process have been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, so this work is essential for better understanding and treatment of diseases.[12]/nIn 1990, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin discovered the role of the period gene (per) in the Drosophila' circadian oscillator. They found that PER protein levels fluctuate in light dark cycles, and these fluctuations persist in constant darkness. Similarly, per mRNA abundance also has rhythmic expression that entrains to light dark cycles. In the fly head, per mRNA levels oscillate in both 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycles as well as in constant darkness. Per mRNA levels peaked at the beginning of the subjective night followed by a peak in PER protein levels about 6 hours later. Mutated per genes affected the cycling of per mRNA. From this experimental data, Rosbash, Hall, and Hardin hypothesized that PER protein is involved in a negative feedback loop[2] that controls per mRNA levels, and that this transcription-translation feedback loop is a central feature of the Drosophila circadian clock.[8]/nThey also looked at two other single missense period mutations, perS and perL1. These mutations cause the peak of the evening activity to occur earlier and later, respectively, compared to wildtype per+ flies. They found that RNA levels for perS and perL1 also display clear rhythmicity. Like locomotor activity the peak expression is shifted earlier for perS and later for perL1.[8]/nThey transformed the period0 null mutation flies with a 7.2-kb piece of functional per DNA, and measured per mRNA levels at the per0 locus and new locus. Following transformation, per mRNA levels were rhythmic at both the original and new locus. The per0 locus was able to transcribe normal per mRNA and translate normal PER protein, meaning that rhythmicity was rescued by functional PER protein transcribed and translated from the 7.2-kb piece of per DNA. There is a feedback loop at play in which cycling of PER protein levels at the new locus feeds back to dictate cycling of per mRNA levels at the original per0 locus.[8]\nIn 1992, Rosbash again collaborated with Jeffrey Hall and Paul Hardin to more closely examine the mechanisms of the TTFL. They wondered specifically about the regulation of period mRNA level fluctuations, and found that per mRNA levels were transcriptionally regulated. This was supported by the evidence that per precursor RNA cycles with the same phase as mature transcripts, and oscillate with respect to Zeitgeber Time (ZT). Other evidence for transcriptional regulation is that per gene promoter is sufficient to confer cycling to heterologous mRNA.[13]/nThe Akhilesh Reddy group has shown, using a range of unbiased -omics techniques (RNA-sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics) that Drosophila S2 cells display circadian molecular rhythms.[14] These cells do not express known \"clock genes\" including per and tim.[14][15][16] Introduction of PER and TIM proteins into the cells does not cause rhythmicity of these cells as read out by abundance or phosphorylation of PER and TIM proteins.[16][17] These cells were thus regarded as \"clock-less\" by the fly field until now.[17][16] These findings substantiate the work above in demonstrating the TTFL model of the fly clockwork cannot explain the generation of circadian rhythms.[14]/nA likely homolog of the previously discovered mouse gene Clock was identified by Rosbash et al. by cloning of the Drosophila gene defined by the Jrk mutation. This gene was given the name Drosophila Clock. dClock has been shown to interact directly with the per and tim E-boxes and contributes to the circadian transcription of these genes. The Jrk mutation disrupts the transcription cycling of per and tim. It also results in completely arrhythmic behavior in constant darkness for homozygous mutants and about half demonstrated arrhythmic behavior in heterozygotes. The Jrk homozygotes expressed low, non-cycling levels of per and tim mRNA as well as PER and TIM protein. From this, it was concluded that the behavioral arrhythmicity in Jrk was due to a defect in the transcription of the per and tim. This indicated that dClock was involved in the transcriptional activation of per and tim.[9]/nIn 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered the novel clock gene cycle, a homolog of the mammalian Bmal1 gene. Homozygous cycle0 mutants are arrhythmic in locomotor activity and heterozygous cycle0/+ flies have robust rhythms with an altered period of rhythmicity. Western blot analysis shows that homozygous cycle0 mutants have very little PER and TIM protein as well as low per and tim mRNA levels. This indicates that lack of cycle leads to decreased transcription of per and tim genes. Meiotic mapping placed cyc on the third chromosome. They discovered bHLH-PAS domains in cyc, indicating protein binding and DNA binding functions.[10]/nIn 1998, Rosbash et al. discovered a Drosophila mutant exhibiting flat, non-oscillating levels of per and tim mRNA, due to a null mutation in the cryptochrome gene. This mutation was dubbed crybaby, or cryb. The failure of cryb mutants to synchronize to light dark cycles indicates that cryptochrome\u2019s normal function involves circadian photoreception.[11]/nIn Drosophila, certain lateral neurons (LNs) have been shown to be important for circadian rhythms, including dorsal (LNd) and ventral (LNV) neurons. LNV neurons express PDF (pigment dispersion factor), which was initially hypothesized to be a clock output signal. Mutants for the pdf neuropeptide gene (pdf01) as well as flies selectively ablated for LNV produced similar behavioral responses. Both entrained to external light cues, but were largely arrhythmic in constant conditions. Some flies in each cases showed weak free-running rhythmicity. These results lead the researchers to believe that LNV neurons were the critical circadian pacemaker neurons and that PDF was the principal circadian transmitter.[18]/nIn more recent years, Rosbash has been working on the brain-neuronal aspects of circadian rhythms. Seven anatomically distinct neuronal groups have been identified that all express the core clock genes. However, the mRNAs appear to be expressed in a circadian and neuron-specific manner, which his lab has taken interest in determining whether this provides a link to the distinct functions of certain neuronal groups. He has also researched the effects of light on certain neuronal groups and has found that one subgroup is light-sensitive to lights on (dawn) and another is light-sensitive to lights off (dusk). The dawn cells have been shown to promote arousal while the dusk cells promote sleep.[19]/nToday, Rosbash continues to research mRNA processing and the genetic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. He has also published an amusing reflection on his life in science.[20]", "4981547": "Robert Ernst Eduard Wiedersheim (21 April 1848 \u2013 12 July 1923) was a German anatomist who is famous for publishing a list of 86 \"vestigial organs\" in his book The Structure of Man: An Index to His Past History.[2]/nWiedersheim's father was Eduard Friedrich Wiedersheim (1819\u20131882), a medical doctor and naturalist. His mother, Bertha Friederike Wiedersheim (n\u00e9e Otto, 1825\u20131848) died a few days after his birth.[3] During his school years Wiedersheim showed an interest in botany and zoology. However, he was not a good student and barely passed the final examination./nInitially commencing a science degree at Lausanne in 1868 Wiedersheim switched after one semester to a medical degree at T\u00fcbingen, following his father's wishes. He studied at T\u00fcbingen from 1868 to 1870 under Franz Leydig. In 1871 he moved his studies to W\u00fcrzburg and the following year to Freiburg. In 1872 Wiedersheim finished a doctoral thesis on the finer structural relations of the glands in the gizzard of birds, a subject suggested to him by Carl Hasse while in W\u00fcrzburg./nIn 1873 Wiedersheim married Mathilde (Tilla) Sophie Gruber with whom he had one son, Walter Wiedersheim.[4]/nAfter finishing his studies Wiedersheim returned to W\u00fcrzburg where he worked as an assistant to Albert von Koelliker until 1876.[3] In 1876 he became an associate professor of anatomy at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg where he taught until 1918.[5]  He became an expert in comparative anatomy and published a number of relevant textbooks. He also collected early photographs and documents of scientists of his day. In 1883 Wiedersheim became a full professor of anatomy and succeeded Alexander Ecker as the director of Freiburg's Institute of Anatomy and Comparative Anatomy.[3]/nAt Freiburg Wiedersheim took part in a lengthy ongoing collaboration with Alexander Ecker and Ernst Gaupp to produce a comprehensive, illustrated atlas of anatomy for the European edible frog Rana esculenta. This collaboration took place over a 40-year period with several publications between 1864 and 1904 under the title Die Anatomie des Frosches[6] and the resulting work is still considered a standard reference on anuran anatomy.[7] A translation by George Haslam of the first two volumes of Die Anatomie des Frosches, including considerable new material, was published under the title The anatomy of the frog in 1889.[8]/nIn 1882 Wiedersheim published a book entitled Lehrbuch der vergleichende Anatomie der Wirbelthiere[9] or Elements of the comparative anatomy of vertebrates.[10] This book and its subsequent edition proved very popular and a shorter outline version  was published, this was also popular and went through several editions, gaining in size with each edition. In 1902 this outline version superseded the original and was published as Vergleichende Anatomie der Wirbelthiere[11] or Comparative anatomy of vertebrates.[12] English editions under both titles were translated by W.N. Parker an anatomist at University College of South Wales, now Cardiff University./nThe structure of Man: An Index to His Past History deals with various anatomical elements of the human body and attempts to frame them in an evolutionary context with other vertebrates. Wiedersheim himself suggests in the introduction that this work is in the same vein as  Thomas Huxley's earlier Evidence as to man's place in nature.[13] The structure of Man began as a much shorter academic treatise, Der Bau der Menschen, produced in 1887 with a small intended circulation. In its original form it lacked any illustrations and gave only a brief overview of many of its topics. Thanks to a high degree of interest and correspondence regarding the work Wiedersheim decided to publish a revised and expanded version.[14] The German second edition was published in 1893 with an English translation by Henry and Matilda Bernard following in 1895./nAs part of the book Wiedersheim included a list of the organs discussed in the text which might be considered vestigial. He writes, \"comparative morphology points not only to the essentially similar plan of organization of the bodies of all vertebrates, ... but also to the occurrence in them of certain organs, or parts of organs, now known as 'vestigial.' \"By such organs are meant those which were formerly of greater physiological significance than at present.\"[2]/nHe picked up on Darwin's concept of \"rudimentary\" organs such as listed in The Descent of Man: the muscles of the ear, wisdom teeth, the appendix, the coccyx (tail bone), body hair, and the semilunar fold in the corner of the eye. The list, however, contains structures which today are known to be essential, and thus represents a historical record of the physiologic understanding of the day./nEvolutionists have used the credited examples of this list as an argument for evolution as they are evolutionary leftovers, of little use to the current organism.  Creationists, on the other hand, have used the discredited examples as an argument against evolution. There is no \"scientific\" proof, they say, of the uselessness of a particular organ./nIt is important to note that a vestige is not necessarily a completely useless organ. Although defined as \"useless\" in popular media, a vestige as defined in evolutionary biology may still have some use, but the use has since diminished.  This definition is consistent with Wiedersheim, who said that vestigial organs are \"wholly or in part functionless\" (Wiedersheim 1893, p.\u00a0200) and have \"lost their original physiological significance\" (p.\u00a0205)./nAlthough Wiedersheim's originally published list contains 86 items, later interpretations enlarged his list to 180 vestiges. The zoologist Horatio Newman said in a written statement read into evidence in the Scopes Trial that \"There are, according to Wiedersheim, no less than 180 vestigial structures in the human body, sufficient to make of a man a veritable walking museum of antiquities.\"[15]/nRobert Wiedersheim is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of chameleon, Trioceros wiedersheimi.[19]", "42205996": "Priya Davidar is an Indian scientific researcher, conservation biologist, scholar, and author.[1][2] She retired as a Professor at Pondicherry University and has conducted ecological research in different regions of India.[2] She has authored a few books, including Whispers from the Wild, co-authored with E.R.C Davidar and published by Penguin India books.[2][3] She was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2012.[4] She is actively involved with the conservation of forests and wildlife.[2] She has published about 100 papers in scientific journals.[citation needed]/nDavidar grew up in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, which is known for its rich variety of fauna and flora.

In the middle of his PhD program, Jones spent 2 years at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basal Switzerland under the mentorship of Fred Meins.  His postdoctoral training was at the University of Wisconsin- Madison under the mentorship of Peter Quail.

This worked continued into his early years at the University of North Carolina and directed subsequent structure analyses of phytochrome by other labs./nDuring the 1970s, in collaboration with the organic chemist Nelson Leonard, Jones invented a photoaffinity labeling technique [3] to identify auxin receptors in plant extracts. He provided the first data proving that Auxin-binding Protein 1 (ABP1) binds auxin [4] and, in collaboration with Michael Sussman, proved that this receptor is essential for normal auxin-mediated growth[5][6]  The later discovery was only the second report of a gene knockout mutant in the genetic model, Arabidopsis thaliana.[7]    Despite his proof that auxin binding to ABP1 is the rate-limiting step for auxin signal transduction, the classification of ABP1 as a hormone receptor remains controversial among plant cell biologists because the structure and properties of ABP1 do not fit any animal hormone receptor paradigm./nIn the 1990s, Jones studied programmed cell death associated with plant cell differentiation.  He elucidated the role of the vacuole in hydrolytic-based plant cell death.[8]/nIn 2000, Jones switched his research effort to the study of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathway in Arabidopsis.  His rationalization was that Arabidopsis, having a simpler repertoire of G signaling elements than mouse and much easier to genetically engineer, would serve as a good multicellular model for G signaling research.

He attended several different schools before leaving education without qualifications in 1939.[1] During the Second World War, Spedding served aboard Royal Navy torpedo boats.[1] After the war, he secured a menial laboratory job, and studied as an evening student to gain a degree in zoology from the University of London.[1]/nBetween 1949 and 1975, Spedding worked at the Grassland Research Institute in Hurley, Berkshire. Thereafter, he became Professor of Agricultural Systems at the University of Reading, also serving as the university's Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food, and as its pro-vice-chancellor between 1986 and his nominal retirement in 1990.[2] He furthermore served as a governor of the Royal Agricultural College between 1982 and 1988, and was President of the Institute of Biology from 1992 to 1994.[1] As well as publishing over 200 academic papers, Spedding wrote or edited a total of 19 books both during and after his academic career, on subjects as diverse as farming, garden wildlife and proverbs.[1][2] He was appointed CBE in 1988, and knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours.[1][3]/nSpedding founded or chaired numerous animal welfare and organic certification organisations, including the Farm Animal Welfare Council, Assured Food Standards, the National Equine Forum, the Apple and Pear Research Council and the UK Register of Organic Food Standards.[1] While heading the Farm Animal Welfare Council in the 1990s, he presided over the development of five key tenets of animal welfare: \"freedom from hunger and thirst; from discomfort; from pain and disease; from fear; and freedom to express normal behaviour\".[1]/nSpedding married Betsy George in 1952. They had two sons and a daughter before Betsy's death in 1988;[2] one of their sons predeceased Spedding.[1] Spedding was a keen gardener, and kept a three-acre garden at his home in Berkshire, which he often opened to local schoolchildren for the study of wildlife.[2] He died in December 2012, aged 87.", "52167608": "Shantanu Chowdhury (born 1968) is an Indian structural biologist and a professor at Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.[1] He is known for developing a mechanism for gene regulation mediated by DNA Secondary-Structure in diverse cellular contexts.[2] An elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India,[3] he is a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology in 2010.[4] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2012, for his contributions to biological sciences.[5]/nShantanu Chowdhury, born on 9 September 1968 in the Indian state of West Bengal, completed his master's degree in chemistry at Jadavpur University, Kolkata before securing a PhD from the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad in 1998.[6] His post-doctoral studies were at the department of biochemistry of University of Nebraska and later at Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology.

A major archive of his work was housed at the International Center of Photography until 2018, when Vishniac's daughter, Mara Vishniac Kohn, donated it to The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life at the University of California, Berkeley.[1][2][3]/nVishniac was a versatile photographer, an accomplished biologist, an art collector and teacher of art history. He also made significant scientific contributions to photomicroscopy and time-lapse photography. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors, and strongly attached to his Jewish roots; he was a Zionist later in life.[4]/nRoman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photos of shtetlach and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and microscopic biology. His book A Vanished World, published in 1983, made him famous and is one of the most detailed pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in the 1930s.[2] Vishniac was also remembered for his humanism and respect for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work./nIn 2013, Vishniac's daughter Mara (Vishniac) Kohn donated to the International Center of Photography[5] the images and accompanying documents comprising ICP's \"Roman Vishniac Rediscovered\" traveling exhibition./nIn October 2018, Kohn donated the Vishniac archive of an estimated 30,000 items, including photo negatives, prints, documents and other memorabilia that had been housed at ICP to The Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life, a unit of the University of California at Berkeley's library system.[6]/nVishniac was born in his grandparents' dacha outside Saint Petersburg, in the town of Pavlovsk, and grew up in Moscow.[7] To live in this city was a right granted to few Jews but the Vishniac family lived there because Solomon Vishniac, Roman's father, was a wealthy manufacturer of umbrellas, and his mother, Manya, was the daughter of affluent diamond dealers. Vishniac also had a sister, Katja.[8] During the summer months, the Vishniac family left Moscow, as it became uncomfortably hot, and they retreated to a dacha a few miles outside the city./nAs a child, Vishniac was fascinated by biology and photography, and his room was filled with \"plants, insects, fish and small animals\".[9] On his seventh birthday, he got a microscope from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a cockroach's leg at 150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead insects to animal scales, to pollen and protozoa.[4]/nUntil the age of ten, Vishniac was homeschooled; from ten to seventeen, he attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for scholarship.[10] Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at the Shanyavsky Moscow City People's University (now Russian State University for the Humanities) in Moscow. At the institute he studied zoology.[9] As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist Nikolai Koltzoff, experimenting with inducing metamorphosis in axolotl, a species of aquatic salamander. While his experiments were a success, Vishniac was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the chaos in Russia and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of this, he went on to take a three-year course in medicine.[4]/nIn 1918, Vishniac's immediate family moved to Berlin because of anti-Semitism spurred by uprisings against the Bolsheviks. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and Wolf.[11] In his free time, he studied Far Eastern Art at the University of Berlin. Vishniac researched endocrinology and optics, and did some photography (see right). In Berlin, he also initiated his public speaking career by joining the Salamander Club, at which he often gave lectures on naturalism.[4]/nIn 1935, as anti-Semitism was growing in Germany, Vishniac was commissioned by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe as part of a fund-raising drive to help support these poor communities.[12] Vishniac developed and printed these pictures in his darkroom in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again at the behest of the JDC.[2] Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in Nice that summer.[4]/nVishniac traveled to Paris in late summer 1940, and was arrested by Marshal P\u00e9tain's police and interned at Camp du Ruchard, a deportation camp in Indre-et-Loire. This occurred because Latvia, of which he was a citizen, had been subsumed into the Soviet Union and Vishniac was considered a \"stateless person\". After three months, as a result of his wife's efforts and aid from the JDC, he obtained a visa that allowed him to escape via Lisbon to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while still in Nice.[4][8][13]/nThe Vishniac family fled from Lisbon to New York City in 1940,[7] arriving on New Year's Eve. Vishniac tried to get a job but failed: \"For me, it was a time of distraction and fear.\"[4] He was multilingual, speaking at least German, Russian and Yiddish, but he could not yet speak any English and thus had a difficult time.[14] He managed to do some portraiture work with mostly foreign clients; but business was poor. It was during this time, in 1942, that he took one of his most celebrated portraits, that of Albert Einstein. He arrived at Einstein's home in Princeton, New Jersey, getting into the scientist's study with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite./nIn 1946, Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do freelance work in the field of photomicroscopy.[4]/nOnce in the United States, Vishniac tried desperately to earn sympathy for impoverished Jews in Eastern Europe. When his work was exhibited at Teachers College, Columbia University in 1943,[15] he wrote to Eleanor Roosevelt (First Lady at the time), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not. He also sent some of his photographs to the President, for which he was politely thanked.[16][17]/nOf the 16,000 photographs taken in Eastern Europe by Vishniac, only 2,000 reached America.[17][18] Most of these negatives were carefully hidden by Vishniac and his family; others were smuggled in by Vishniac's good friend Walter Bierer through Cuba.[16] In the photographer's own words,/nI sewed some of the negatives into my clothing when I came to the United States in 1940. Most of them were left with my father in Clermont-Ferrand, a small city in central France. He survived there, hidden. He concealed the negatives under floorboards and behind picture frames.[18]/nEven when he grew older, Vishniac was very active. In 1957, he was appointed research associate at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and in 1961 was promoted to \"professor of biological education\".[19] In his seventies and eighties, Vishniac became \"Chevron Professor of Creativity\" at Pratt Institute (where he taught courses on topics such as the philosophy of photography[14]). During this time he lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his wife Edith, teaching, photographing, reading and collecting artifacts.[20] Items in his collection included a 14th-century Buddha, Chinese tapestries, Japanese swords, various antique microscopes, valued old maps and venerable books.[21] He taught Oriental and Russian art, general philosophy and religion in science, specifically Jewish topics, ecology, numismatics, photography and general science at City University of New York, Case Western Reserve University[19] and at various other institutions.[4]/nDuring his life, Vishniac was the subject and creator of many films and documentaries; the most celebrated of which was the Living Biology series. This consisted of seven films on cell biology; organs and systems; embryology; evolution; genetics; ecology; botany; the animal world; and the microbial world. It was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation.[10]/nVishniac received Honorary Doctoral degrees from the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia College of Art and the California College of Art,[22] before his death from colon cancer on January 22, 1990.[23]/nVishniac is best known for his dramatic photographs of poor and pious Jews in cities and shtetlach of Eastern Europe.[2] He was commissioned to take these pictures by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) as part of a fundraising initiative, but Vishniac had a personal interest in this subject matter. He traveled back and forth from Berlin to the ghettos of Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Lithuania between 1935 and 1938 as well as working for the JDC.[7][24]/nWhile touring Europe, Vishniac posed as a traveling fabric salesman, seeking aid where he could and bribing anyone who got in his way.[25] During his touring of Eastern Europe (1935\u20131939), he was often arrested by police for taking these pictures, sometimes because he was thought to be spying.[18] Later, when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be showcased as one-man shows at Columbia University, the Jewish Museum in New York, the International Center of Photography and other such institutions./nVishniac claimed that he had taken 16,000 photos in this period, every one a candid shot,[14] but the veracity of these claims has been challenged by research by Maya Benton, a curator at the International Center of Photography.[2][26]  To photograph small villages in these mountains, Vishniac claimed he carried heavy equipment (Leica, Rolleiflex, movie camera, tripods), 115\u00a0pounds (52 kilograms) by his estimate, on his back, up steep roads, trekking many miles.[16][20] [4] Vishniac captured thousands of impoverished Jews on film, \"... to preserve \u2014 in pictures, at least \u2014 a world that might soon cease to exist\".[27]/nWhen using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac sometimes brought a kerosene lamp (visible in some of his work) if there was insufficient light, keeping his back to a wall for support, and holding his breath.[14] The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes./nRoman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in Eastern Europe. \"Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]\", Mitgang.[20] In late 1938, for example, he sneaked into Zbaszyn, an internment camp in Germany near the border, where Jews awaited deportation to Poland. After photographing the \"filthy barracks\", as he described it, for two days,[28] he escaped by jumping from the second floor at night and creeping away, avoiding broken glass and barbed wire. These photos were sent to the League of Nations in Geneva to prove the existence such camps.[20]/nAfter Vishniac's death, many photos came to light depicting life in Berlin taken between 1920 and 1939. Some of these negatives were found at the end of rolls of film devoted to scientific work. An exhibition of Vishniac's Berlin photos was mounted at the Jewish Museum, Berlin in 2005,[29] and a book of the photos was published./nVishniac's photographs from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished.[2] His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: \"There is barely a hint of a smile on any of the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient casement windows and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners.\"[30] Gene Thornton, writer for The New York Times, called them \"somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter\".[31]/nThese pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or sometimes a lantern,[14] yet they are \"amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field\".[32] Indeed, \"There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby.\"[30] Vishniac is known to have exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.[2]/nVishniac's photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent display in many museums. Edward Steichen places his pre-Holocaust photographs, \"among photography's finest documents of a time and place.\"'[25]/nVishniac's photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated many books about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of The Only Flowers of her Youth, the drama of the photograph inspired Miriam Nerlove to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.[33]/nFor this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the American Society of Magazine Photographers in 1956. A Vanished World has won the National Jewish Book Award in the visual arts category in 1984;[34] The Only Flowers of her Youth was deemed \"most impressive\" at the International Photographic Exhibition in Lucerne in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, New York Coliseum.[4][9]/nIn 1955 Edward Steichen selected three of Vishniac's Eastern European photographs; of boys at a Cheder in Slonim (1938), of children and a woman in Lublin (1937), for the Museum of Modern Art world-touring The Family of Man exhibition that was seen by 9 million visitors, accompanied by a catalogue which has never been out of print.[35]/nThere has been criticism of Vishniac's work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their unprofessional qualities, citing \"errors of focus and accidents of design, as when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a hurrying scholar.\"[31]/nWhen photographic curator Maya Benton began to catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, in his book A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were not supported by the material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: \"The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935\u20131938.\" At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: \"The pogromshchiki\" (pogrom lynch mob) \"are coming. But the iron door was no protection.\" Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book \"almost certainly did not happen\".[2]/nSimilarly, Benton discovered negatives that showed the unsmiling little girl depicted in The Only Flowers of her Youth \u2013 whom Vishniac had claimed did not own a pair of shoes \u2013 smiling and wearing shoes.[2]/nMichael di Capua, who edited Vishniac's text for A Vanished World, has said that he felt disquiet while compiling the text, since so much information was unsubstantiated.[2] Benton also suggested that the terms of Vishniac's commission from the JDC \u2013 to photograph \"not the fullness of Eastern European Jewish life but its most needy, vulnerable corners for a fund-raising project\" \u2013 had led to his overemphasizing poor, religious communities in A Vanished World.[2]/nIn addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of photomicroscopy, (specifically interference microscopy and cinemicroscopy). He specialized in photographing living insects and had a talent for arranging the moving specimens in \"just the right poses\", according to Philippe Halsman, former president of the American Society of Magazine Photographers. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, \"a special kind of genius\".[4] He worked with all sorts of specimens, from protozoa, to fireflies to amino acids. Vishniac's work in photomicroscopy was, and is, highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the Biological Photographic Association in New York.[4]/nOne of Roman Vishniac's most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny ommatidia, complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of Boston University of the circulating blood inside a hamster's cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy.[19] His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses polarized light to penetrate certain formations of cell structure and may greatly improve the detail of an image.[4]/nIn the field of biology, Vishniac specialized in marine microbiology, the physiology of ciliates, circulatory systems in unicellular plants and endocrinology (from his work in Berlin) and metamorphosis.[19] Despite his aptitude and accomplishments in the field, most of his work in biology was secondary to his photography: Vishniac studied the anatomy of an organism primarily to better photograph it. Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis of axolotl, he also researched the morphology of chromosomes in 1920: both in Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized polyphyletic origin, a theory that life arose from multiple, independent biochemical reactions, spawning multicellular life. As a philosopher, he \"developed principles of rationalistic philosophy\" in the '50s.[4]/nVishniac is notable for his photographs of insects mating, sea bass feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an SLR equipped with an extension tube. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.[4]/nVishniac's subjects varied throughout his life. At times, he would focus on documenting everyday life, as in Berlin, and later portraiture, doing famous portraits of Albert Einstein and Marc Chagall. He was also a pioneer in time-lapse photography, on which he worked from 1915 to 1918,[4][10] and again later in life./nRoman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the Jewish aspect of it, \"From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors\". He was a Zionist[14][20] and a strong sympathizer with Jews who had suffered because of anti-Semitism, \"Oh yes, I could be a professor of anti-Semitism\", also stating then that he had one hundred and one relatives who were murdered in the Holocaust. A famous photo of his (pictured right) of a store in Berlin selling devices for separating Jews and non-Jews by skull shape was used by him to criticize the pseudoscience of German anti-Semites.[20]/nVishniac associated much of his work with religion, though not specifically Judaism. \"Nature, God, or whatever you want to call the creator of the Universe comes through the microscope clearly and strongly,\" he remarked in his laboratory one day./nLiving with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, \"an absolute optimist filled with tragedy. His humanism is not just for Jews, but for every living thing.\"[25] He probably believed in God or some similar concept, but he was non-denominational and did not adhere strictly to the principles of any religion. He even clashed with Orthodox Jews in one well-known instance: The religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be photographed, quoting the Bible and its prohibition of making of graven images. Vishniac's famous response was, \"the Torah existed for thousands of years before the camera had been invented.\"[20]/nVishniac was known for having great respect for all living creatures. Whenever possible, he returned a specimen to its precise home before it was captured[4] and one time \"[lent] his bathtub to tadpoles for weeks until he could return them to their pond\". In accordance with this philosophy, he photographed almost exclusively living subjects.[36]/n*The Vanished World: Jewish Cities, Jewish People", "59048908": "Hasan Bolkan is a retired research microbiologist who focused his career on plant pathology - diseases and infectious insects in tomato varieties and other produce.

At Rockefeller, Krause worked with his role models Oswald Avery and Rebecca Lancefield and became lifelong friends with Purnell W. Choppin and Maclyn McCarty.[1][2] The persistent theme underlying his research concerned the substances in bacteria that stimulate the body's immune system.

His family immigrated to the US in 1963. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College in 1983 (in Biochemistry) where he studied the assembly of icosahedral viruses under the supervision of Stephen C. Harrison. He received his PhD for Biochemistry as a Marshall Scholar from Trinity College, Cambridge for research on the transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes[2][3] under the supervision of Hugh Pelham at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England. He then trained as a Richard Childs Fellow and Lucille P. Markey Scholar with Harold Varmus and Andrew Murray at the University of California, San Francisco./nSorger joined the MIT Department of Biology in 1984 following a year as a visiting scientist with Anthony A. Hyman at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. Sorger became a full Professor in the MIT Biology and Biological Engineering Departments in 2004./nSorger's postdoctoral and early faculty research led to the first reconstitution of a chromosome-microtubule attachment (a yeast kinetochore) and the subsequent identification of multiple kinetochore proteins.[4][5] His group identified mammalian homologs of the checkpoint proteins that regulate entry into mitosis, and showed that mutations in these genes can be oncogenic because they cause chromosome instability.[6][7][8] This work contributed to the understanding of the faithful transmission of chromosomes from mother to daughter cells. Defects in these mechanisms cause aneuploidy that plays a major role in oncogenic transformation./nWorking closely with Doug Lauffenburger and funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Institutes of Health's National Centers for Systems Biology program,[9] Sorger's work in the 1990s increasingly focused on oncogenesis itself and on mammalian signal transduction.[10] Sorger and Lauffenburger's approach combined molecular genetics, live-cell microscopy and mechanistic computational modeling.[11][12] Their focus on biochemistry REF was unusual in an era dominated by genomics and ultimately led Sorger to co-found the software company Glencoe Software and the biotech company Merrimack Pharmaceuticals.[13] Subsequent work by Sorger' group led to a new understanding of stochastic fluctuation in cellular responses to natural ligands and drugs[14][15] and to the development of a range of innovative computational methods, including the biochemistry-specific Python PySB[16] and the natural language processing and knowledge assembly system INDRA.[17][18]/nIn 2011, Sorger was active in the development of the discipline of Quantitative Systems Pharmacology, including overseeing the preparation of a widely cited white paper for the NIH entitled \"Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology in the Post-genomic Era: New Approaches to Discovering Drugs and Understanding Therapeutic Mechanisms\".[19] This white paper envisioned the emergence of an empirically based but computationally sophisticated approach to the science underlying development of innovative new medicines. Sorger moved to Harvard Medical School[20] to pursue these approaches by establishing the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology, which merges laboratory experiments, computer science, and medicine to fundamentally improve drug discovery.[21] Funding from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center in 2014[22] and 2017[23][24] made the lab a reality and it now has 150 faculty trainees and staff from Boston-area institutions including Harvard University, MIT, Tufts University, Northeastern University and Harvard-affiliated Hospitals./nSorger's research involves multiple systems pharmacology approaches to cancer. The first focuses on preclinical pharmacology, the stage at which the molecular mechanisms of disease are studied and new drugs sought. An investigation into the causes of irreproducibility drug-response measurements[25] led to a series of conceptual,[26] computational,[27] and experimental improvements[28] in scoring drug action that are now widely used in academe and industry and have enabled the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs.[29] Recent work has focused on deep learning as means to further understand complex protein networks and drug mechanisms.[30][31] The second project involves developing methods to study drug mechanism at scale in patients through highly multiplexed tissue imaging[32][33] of the biopsies routinely acquired from patients (particularly cancer patients).[34] This has led to a very rapidly growing tissue imaging and digital histology program[35] that is part of the US National Cancer Institute Moonshot and promises to substantially advance precision cancer care.[36] The third project involves studying the clinical trial record to understand how successful and failed trials differ. An early success was the discovery that the great majority of approved combination cancer therapies exhibit independent action \u2013 not synergy.[37][38] As Merck & Co. investigators subsequently realized, this fundamentally changes how immunotherapy combinations should be developed.[39] The group is now engaged in a large-scale effort[40] to digitize and make freely available all survival data from Phase 3 clinical trials.[41]/nTo address the need for face masks, respirators and other personal protective equipment for healthcare workers in the early COVID-19 pandemic, Sorger, physician Nicole LeBoeuf and MD-PhD student Deborah Plana established the Boston Area Pandemic Fabrication team (PanFab).[42][43] This team of students and alumni from MIT and Harvard teamed up with local industry and led a series of 3D printing and rapid-turn manufacturing projects to make face shields,[44] mask frames,[45] powered air purifying respirators[46] and new ways to sterilize and reuse 95 respirators.[47] PanFab led to over a dozen open access publications and designs, including a thorough review of lessons learned[48] and a hope that we can be better prepared for future pandemics.", "70714373": "John Lafayette Magee (October 28, 1914 \u2013 December 16, 2005) was an American chemist known for his work on kinetic models of radiation chemistry,[2][3] especially the Samuel-Magee model for describing radiolysis in solution./nMagee obtained his A.B. at Mississippi College in 1935, M.S. at Vanderbilt University in 1936, and his Ph.D. in chemistry at University of Wisconsin in 1939, under the supervision of Farrington Daniels.

Off-patent generic pharmaceuticals produced at this site are intended to target severe oncological, cardiological, immunological, and chronic infectious diseases./nConstruction of the Boryspil facility began in April 2007 and was completed in March 2008; initial production was scheduled to begin in 2008. The stated intention was that high-quality pharmaceuticals would be produced and become an affordable source of therapy for millions of underprivileged who currently have no therapeutic options.[12] Abilek stepped down as President of MWB in the summer of 2008 shortly after the facility opened./nAlibek's main research focus was developing novel forms of therapy for late-stage oncological diseases and other chronic degenerative pathologies and disorders. He focuses on the role of chronic viral and bacterial infections in causing age-related diseases and premature aging. Additionally, he develops and implements novel systemic immunotherapy methods for late-stage cancer patients.[12]/nIn 2010, Alibek was invited to begin working in Kazakhstan as a head of the Department of Chemistry and Biology at the School of Science and Technology of Nazarbayev University in Astana, where he was engaged in the development of anti-cancer drugs and life-prolonging drugs, and was chairman of the board of the Republican Scientific Center for Emergency Medical Care and headed the National Scientific Center for Oncology and Transplantation. During his stay, he published a number of articles in research journals and taught various courses in various fields of biology and medicine. He focused on a possible role of chronic infections, metabolic disorders, and immunosuppression on cancer development. In 2011, he was awarded a prize from the Deputy Prime Minister for his contribution to the development of the educational system in Kazakhstan. In 2014, he was awarded a medal by the Minister of Education and Science of Kazakhstan for his contribution to research in Kazakhstan. He continues his work as an administrative manager of a research and medicine and education professor./nHowever, after seven years, no significant scientific results from Alibek's work developed. During these seven years, Alibek received more than 1 billion Tenge from the budget for  \"New Systemic Therapy for Cancer Tumors\" project he tried to implement. The promising Swedish technique has remained a common concept, a panacea for cancer treatment has not appeared. Three submitted Alibekov patent applications for registration were rejected by the National Institute of Intellectual Property of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan since there was no novelty.[13] After Kazakhstan realized that, under the guise of super-progressive technologies, Alibekov was promoting long-known foreign methods, and  Alibek was not a qualified specialist in oncology, medicine, or science, he terminated the contract and returned to the U.S./nIn 2016, Alibek was chosen as one of the nominees in the \"Science\" category of the national project El Tulgasy, which was designed to select the most significant citizens of Kazakhstan who are associated with national achievements. More than 350,000 people voted in this project, and Alibek was voted 10th place in his category.[14]/nStarting in 2007, Alibek began researching autism. He supports the idea that the disorder is the result of prenatal viral and bacterial infections. Despite the lack of formal physician experience, a legal physician license to practice medicine, and professional qualification to work with autistic children as either a scientist or physician, Alibek considers himself a scientist and a doctor and treats autistic children using antiviral, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory approaches.[15] His patients are located predominantly in nations in the former Soviet Union, and he consults mainly using free telemedicine services. Although Alibek claims to treat autism, there is no objectively evaluated and published data on the effectiveness of his approach./nIn a September 2003 news release, Alibek and another professor suggested, based on their laboratory research, that the smallpox vaccination might increase a person's resistance to HIV. The work was rejected after peer review by the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet and is no longer being pursued. According to smallpox expert and former White House science advisor Donald Henderson, \"This is a theory that... does not hold up at all, and it does not make any sense from a biologic point of view...This idea...was straight off the wall. I would put no credence in it at all.\" In 2010, an article coauthored by Alibek appeared in Biomed Central - Immunology, a scientific journal, that outlined the results of their research showing that prior immunization with the vaccine Dryvax may confer resistance to HIV replication.[16]/nAlibek also has promoted \"Dr. Ken Alibek's Immune System Support Formula,\" a dietary supplement sold over the Internet. It contains vitamins, minerals, and a proprietary bacterial mix that will purportedly \"bolster the immune system\".[17]/nAlibek has a wife and five children (two sons and three daughters); one of his daughters is autistic.", "24446044": "Ian Richard Swingland (born 2 November 1946) is a British conservationist, convicted in 2017 of conspiring to commit fraud by false representation.[1] He founded DICE (Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology) at the University of Kent in 1989, recognised as one of the first interdisciplinary research and postgraduate training institutes in the world concentrating on biodiversity, communities and sustainable development.

He is best known for his theories of \"catastrophic selection\"  and \"saltational speciation\", which are closely aligned with the concepts of quantum evolution and sympatric speciation. The concepts were first articulated in 1958 by Lewis and Peter H. Raven,[1] and later refined in a 1962 paper by Lewis[2] in which he coined the term  \"catastrophic selection\". In 1966,[3] he referred to the same mechanism as \"saltational speciation\"./nLewis was Dean of Life Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1962 to 1981, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1955), recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship (1955), president of the Pacific Division of the Botanical Society of America (1959), president of the Society for the Study of Evolution (1961), president of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists (1969), president of the International Organization of Plant Biosystematics (1969\u20131975), and president of the American Society of Naturalists (1971), as well as a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences. In 2006, he became the Dickson Emeritus Professor of the Year at UCLA.[4][5][6]/nLewis grew up on a ranch in Redlands, California, where his father grew apricots and oranges. His interest in plants dates at least from the age of 10 when his fifth grade teacher taught the class how to press flowers. His junior high and Redlands High School teachers continued to encourage his interest in plants. When he was in 10th grade he got permission to take a class in botany usually restricted to 11th and 12th graders. The teacher, Eva Maye Hyde, had been a student of Philip A. Munz; she also inducted him into the Samuel B. Parish Botanical Society, a group for amateur botanists in Southern California. He became president of the society in about 1939. During this time he attended a Botanical Society of America meeting, where he met Willis Linn Jepson.[5][6]/nHarlan Lewis graduated from Redlands High School in 1937, and got an A.A. degree in 1939 from San Bernardino Valley College./nHe transferred to UCLA in 1939 as a junior. He started work with Carl Epling as an undergraduate, and published a paper with him in 1940[7] as the first author on the distributions of three species pairs in Californian chaparral and coastal sage plant communities. He continued with Epling as a graduate student, and got his M.A. in 1942 working on the genus Trichostema in the family Lamiaceae. His Ph.D. work concerned diploid and tetraploid Californian species of Delphinium.  WWII interrupted his studies, and he completed his thesis in 1946.[5][6]/nLewis became a faculty member at UCLA in that same year, 1946.[5][6]/nHe joined the United States Army Air Corps at the start of WWII, working at Caltech with Frits Warmolt Went on camouflage.[6]/nHarlan Lewis' research interests were far ranging. They included taxonomy, cytogenetics, systematics, genetics, evolution, plant distributions, and even physiological ecology. And all of these manifested themselves before 1950. Indeed, as a young scientist he was involved with many research topics. His first publication was with Carl Epling in 1940[7] covered the distributions of three species pairs in Californian chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities. In this paper he shows his first interest in plant distributions as they relate to speciation. His next publications with Epling followed in 1942. One was taxonomic in nature, a continuing interest of his, and concerned itself with the genus Monarda in the Lamiaceae.[8] His second paper in 1942 concerned itself with the distributions of the chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities in cis-montane California, and they concluded that these two communities had their centers of distribution in San Diego County, and probably entered the Southwestern United States from the North American Pleateau.[9] He also received his M.A. degree in 1942 on a completely different subject: the taxonomy of Trichostema in the Lamiaceae, which was published in 1945.[10] As a result of his work with Frits Went at California Institute of Technology during the WWII years he published on yet a different subject: that of the response of 13 California annuals to photoperiod and temperature.[11] Although they were not able to correlate the plant's response under artificial conditions to nature, they did discover that Madia elegans was inhibited in flowering by intermediate day lengths, and was induced to flowering by either short or long days, a rare condition known as ambiphotoperiodism. His PhD work in Delphinium was reported in an abstract in 1946,[12] titled \"Polyploidy in the Californian Delphiniums\"; here he showed his first interest in the effects of ploidy on adaptation on three species that consisted of races that were diploid and tetraploid, and found that there were no morphological or ecological differences between the diploids and tetraploids. In 1947 he published on problems associated with using leaves for taxonomic purposes in Delphinium.[13]/nIn 1946 Lewis was introduced to the annual plant Clarkia as a research subject by G. Ledyard Stebbins, who served on his Ph.D. thesis committee.[5]  This suggestion by Stebbins was prophetic as Ford and Gottlieb estimated that as of 2003 there were more than 200 publications on Clarkia.[14]/nFor the rest of Lewis' career he devoted most of his energies to the genetics, taxonomy, and speciation of plants in the genus. In 1947 he was awarded a one-year postdoctoral fellowship to the John Innes Horticultural Institution in England with Kenneth Mather.[5] While there he worked on the cytogenetics of Clarkia, and published on chromosomal counts in Clarkia in their Annual Report.[15] It was not until 1951 that he published his next paper[16] in Clarkia, which was concerned with the widespread occurrence of supernumerary chromosomes in Clarkia elegans, now known as Clarkia unguiculata. He further noted that members of this species were heterozygous for one or more reciprocal translocations, and that these abnormalities had no genetic effect. However, he hypothesized that the supernumeraries were produced as by-products of translocation heterozygotes, and that the mechanisms producing supernumerary chromosomes could account for the \"various chromosome numbers found in this genus.\"[16]/nIn 1953 he published four papers which may have been foundational to the rest of his Clarkia career: he not only identified new species-pairs that were morphologically very similar, but he hypothesized a mode of speciation that would account for their origin. One paper described a new species, C. similis,[17] which he hypothesized was a tetraploid between C. modesta and C. epilobioides; all of which were morphologically very similar. Another paper[18] was a taxonomic study that changed some of the nomenclature in Clarkia, combining species of Clarkia with Godetia, and adding four new species. One of the new species was the now famous Clarkia lingulata which was observed to be closely related to C. biloba (this paper was also apparently the first that included his wife as a co-author, a team that would work together for many years). A second new species was C. affinis, an allohexaploid closely related to C. purpurea, an allohexaploid. A third new species was C. prostrata, an allohexapoid closely resembling C. davyi, a tetraploid. The fourth new species was C. imbricata, which was very similar to C. williamsonii./nThe third 1953 paper[19] discussed the relationship between changes in the basic chromosome number of Clarkia with Californian habitats. Specifically, he found that increased basal chromosomal numbers in diploid Clarkia were correlated with a xeric habitat, and hypothesized that the genus may have originated at the more mesic ecotone between the Arcto-Tertiary and Madro-Tertiary Floras and spread to more xeric habitats. His fourth paper in 1953[19] established what he hypothesized to be the primary mode of speciation in Clarkia:/nSpeciation in Clarkia...has probably resulted from a combination of a variety of factors. Of these perhaps the most important has been the differential accumulation in different populations of adapted gene combinations associated with particular chromosome rearrangements. A by-product of this accumulation of structural rearrangements has been the establishment of strong barriers to gene exchange...These phenomena both suggest that differentiation in Clarkia is often and perhaps usually a rapid process./nIn 1954 he published on yet another new species, C. exilis, which was morphologically very similar to C. unguiculata.[20]  In this paper he states:/nSeveral new species of Clarkia have recently been described which have a very restricted distribution and which are morphologically very similar to well known and widely ranging species...These sympatric species pairs offer an unusual opportunity for study of species differentiation./n1955 marked the publication of a complete taxonomic revision of the Genus Clarkia.[21] This was followed[22] by an analysis of three subspecies of Clarkia biloba, which ranged mostly from north to south along the Sierran foothills: ssp. brandegeae being northernmost, more central ssp. biloba, with ssp. australis being southernmost; their primary morphological difference being petal color and shape as well as leaf morphology. The fertility amongst the hybrids was high, except that the northern ssp. brandegeae was the least fertile with the other two, probably caused by a chromosomal rearrangement; it was observed that ssp. brandegeae was also morphologically similar to C. dudleyana. The authors concluded that subspeciation in C. biloba did not follow patterns seen in other plants, but was more disjunct involving \"barriers to gene exchange due to spacing of the colonies, supplemented in the northern subspecies by a factor which reduces fertility in heterozygotes.\"[22] This work was then followed by the now famous publication on Clarkia lingulata in 1956[23] with M. Roberts. C. lingulata is a \"sister species\" of Clarkia biloba ssp. australis, morphologically almost identical to each other except that C. lingulata does not have notch in its petals, has a low interspecific fertility, and they differ from each other by a translocation, a paracentric inversion, and one additional chromosome; C. lingulata grows at the southernmost extent of ssp. australis range. They concluded that C. lingulata evolved rapidly and recently from C. biloba:/nIn any event, the transition from one species to the other seems to have been a rapid process which depended only upon the fixation of one or perhaps two chromosomal alterations, which also led to a morphological and perhaps ecological difference. We are inclined to believe in the present case that the stage was set for subsequent differentiation and speciation by the single step of adding a chromosome to the genome of australis. The close relationship of the genomes of C. lingulata and australis, the geographical juxtaposition the two taxa, and the restricted distribution of the former, suggests to us not only a rapid but also a relatively recent origin of C. lingulata from C. biloba australis.[23]/nIn 1950 Peter H. Raven, at the age of 14, had collected a plant called C. rubicunda.[24] In the course of Harlan and his wife Margaret revising the genus Clarkia they discovered the herbarium specimen collected by Raven.[24] They visited him in 1952 when he was 16, and wanted to know where the collection was made.[24] In 1958 Lewis and Raven[25] published a botanical description of this plant, called C. franciscana, which was morphologically very closely related to C. rubicunda and C. amoena./nAlso in 1958 Lewis and Raven published a major paper on the evolution of C. franciscana, and generalized to what was by then a general a pattern of speciation in Clarkia.[1] They concluded that C. franciscana had evolved from Clarkia rubicunda; and they asserted that C. franciscana's origin mirrored a recurring theme in Clarkia of a derived species showing a close morphological similarity to a parental species, the derived species being geographically proximal, but differing from the parent by chromosomal differences and showing interspecific sterility. Further, they hypothesized that such speciation in Clarkia was rapid, and perhaps occurred within the last 12,000 years./nAdditionally, they hypothesized that this rapid mode of speciation seen in Clarkia was analogous to a mode of speciation known as quantum evolution:/nSeveral diploid species of Clarkia (Onagraceae) have very limited areas of distribution (Lewis and Lewis, 1955). Most of these grow adjacent to or are surrounded by other closely related species that resemble them so closely that they would ordinarily be regarded as conspecific. Specific status is accorded to them because of reproductive isolation coupled with at least one consistent difference in external morphology. This pattern recurs with sufficient constancy to suggest that the various examples have a common explanation, with similar factors operating in each instance. This pattern suggests to us a rapid shift of the adaptive mode, such as Simpson (1944) termed quantum evolution, at the diploid specific level. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate this process by a consideration of the mode of origin of a narrow serpentine endemic, Clarkia franciscana Lewis and Raven (1958)...The repeated occurrence of the same pattern of differentiation in Clarkia suggests that a rapid reorganization of chromosomes has been an important mode of evolution in the genus. This rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is comparable to the systemic mutations proposed by Goldschmidt as a mechanism of macroevolution. In Clarkia, we have not observed marked changes in physiology and pattern of development that could be described as macroevolution. Reorganization of the genomes may, however, set the stage for subsequent evolution along a very different course from that of the ancestral populations./nClarkia has a number of polyploid species, and one, Clarkia tenella, is a tetraploid located in Chile and Argentina; it is the only member of Clarkia not found in Western North America. Raven and Lewis[26] reported in 1959 that C. tenella is closely related to C. davyi, which is a tetraploid found on sea bluffs of northern and north-central California. They hypothesized that Clarkia tenella and Clarkia davyi arose in from a common allotetraploid ancestor in North America and evolved into xeric habitats in the late Cenozoic; the tetraploid ancestor was then introduced into South America by long-distance dispersal. This work was extended by studies in 1965[27] and 1966.[28] Lewis and Moore reported that Clarkia tenella was divided into four subspecies: ssp. araucana, the most southerly in western Argentina; restricted ssp. tenuifolia; widespread ssp. tenella, and ssp. ambigua. Hybrids between them were highly heterozygous for many translocations and had greatly reduced pollen fertility. They concluded that ssp. araucana was most closely related to the original ancestral Clarkia located to South America. It gave rise to ssp. tenuifolia, which gave rise to the xeric adapted ssp. tenella. One race of ssp. araucana, a tetraploid missing two chromosomes, is the newest and is the \"only known example in Clarkia of a derivative occupying more mesic conditions than its progenitor.\"/nIn 1959 Lewis published a paper on the nature of what constitutes a species in flowering plants.[29] Citing examples from Salvia, Delphinium, and Clarkia, he stated:/nThe examples I have given illustrate my earlier point that reproductive isolation does not necessarily coincide with speciation. Gene exchange between species must be restricted if they are to maintain genetic integrity, but, as we have seen, such restriction does not necessarily imply genetic independence to a degree where variation for subsequent evolution is not available through gene exchange between sympatric species. On the other hand, fortuitous or adaptive differentiation for chromosomal alterations or genetic incompatibility has, in many groups of plants, let to reproductive isolation in the absence of genetic differentiation commensurate with that associated with species. It is not my intention to deny a correlation which obviously exists or to minimize the role of reproductive isolation isolation in species formation. I do, however, wish to emphasize that among plants this correlation is far from unity, except, perhaps, for certain groups. This does not mean that reproductive isolation is not taxonomically important, but that alone it does not necessarily provide the only, or the best, basis for delimiting species in all groups of organisms...This stands in marked contrast to the situation in many groups of animals in which reproductive isolation seems to have a positive selective value in areas where genetically differentiated groups overlap (see Dobzhansky, 1951, chap 7)/nLewis continued his interest in C. lingulata's adaptedness relative to C. biloba. In 1961[30] he reported that in artificially mixed populations established south of either species' range, with C. biloba being in excess, C. lingulata died out. This confirmed his hypothesis that C. lingulata must have been established separately from C. biloba. Also, he found that C. lingulata flowered two weeks earlier than C. biloba.  He believed that this would be an advantage in the xeric conditions at the species' extreme southern margin, and that C. lingulata would prevail under increasingly xeric conditions in competition with C. biloba./nIn 1962[2] Lewis published a more lengthy proposal for \"catastrophic selection\" as the primary mode of speciation in Clarkia:/n...catastrophic selection in ecologically marginal populations has had a prominent role in speciation in the genus Clarkia.The following observations compellingly suggest that speciation at the diploid level in this genus ordinarily involves a rapid reorganization of the genome associated with ecological differentiation, a reorganization that involves an intermediate stage of low fertility: Closely related pairs of species bear a relationship of parent to offspring and not one of siblings. They invariably differ by several gross structural rearrangements of the chromosomes, and sometimes by a change in basic number; as a consequence, hybrids between them are essentially sterile. Recent derivatives occur at the margin of distribution of the parental species, but the two species are unable to form stable mixed populations because sterile hybrids are formed as readily as intraspecific progenies; the derivative populations must, therefore, have arisen in isolation. In all instances, derivative species occupy ecologically different, invariably more xeric, habitats than their progenitors./nLewis reported in 1965 on the evolution of self-pollination in Clarkia xantiana.[31] In this species all populations were out-crossers, except two populations located in an area subject to periodic and exceptional drought; these same two populations were found to be self-pollinated. Further, one of the populations has pink flowers, the normal color, and the second has white flowers. Also, the pink-flowered selfer is inter-fertile with outcrossing populations, while the white flowered self-pollinated population differs from the others by a translocation and reduced fertility. He argued that the self-pollinated populations arose from catastrophic selection; the self-pollinators being able to survive extremely reduced population sizes; they concluded that the white flowered population was a derivative of the pink flowered selfing population./nIn 1966[3] Lewis expanded the concept of catastrophic selection to \"saltational speciation\" to all flowering plants:/nSaltational speciation in flowering plants is required as an explanation only for the relationships between particular populations of annuals that have been studied intensively. by reasonable extrapolation, however, it appears to be the prevalent mode of speciation in many herbaceous genera and to have had a significant role in the evolution of woody plants/nIn 1968 Wedberg and Lewis reported on the distribution of widespread translocation heterozygosity and supernumerary chromosomes in C. williamsonii.[32] They found that there was a correlation between translocation heterozygosity and supernumerary chromosomes and habitat. Populations in the yellow pine forest consistently had low frequencies of translocation heterozygosity and low frequencies of supernumerary chromosomes. Populations in foothill woodlands had high frequencies of both chromosomal types. They concluded that translocation heterozygosity had an adaptive role in woodland habitats but not at the higher elevations; it was theorized that translocation heterozygosity was helping to preserve genetic heterozygosity under conditions of enforced inbreeding that would occur at low elevations from periodic drought. The supernumerary chromosomes could have provided either more genetic variability or have been a biproduct of translocation heterozygosity, and occur as a matter of chance./nLewis summarized the ecological relationships in Clarkia between habitat and chromosomal variation in a paper published in 1969.[33] He reviewed the association with translocation heterozygosity and habitat in C. williamsonii; the correlation with basic chromosome number with mesic/xeric habitats in many species of Clarkia; and the origin of C. lingulata from C. biloba./nIn a continuing interest in Clarkia phylogeny, Lewis published a paper in 1971 on species relationships using pollen grains.[34] The pollen grains separated Clarkia into a few of the same groups (sections) as was previously determined using chromosomes and morphology. However, they cautioned against using some characters in the absence of a well-documented phylogeny./nLewis followed with a 1973 paper in which he established five expectations that would follow from his theory of saltational speciation,[35] and he reviewed them for 12 parent/\"neospecies\" pairs. He found that C. lingulata showed the best fit with his five expectations./nIn 1986 Lewis and Holsinger established the creation of a new \"Section\" and \"Subsection\" in the genus Clarkia.[36] The Section was \"Sympherica\", whose name was taken from the Greek for \"the usefulness this group has had in several evolutionary studies.\"  They went on to cite work by Leslie D. Gottlieb.[37][38][39][40][41][42]/nThroughout much of his career Lewis worked on the genus Delphinium in addition to his work on Clarkia. His PhD work in Delphinium was reported in an abstract in 1946,[12] titled \"Polyploidy in the Californian Delphiniums\"; here he showed his first interest in the effects of ploidy on adaptation in three species (D. hanseni, D. gypsophilum, and D. variegatum) that consisted of races that were diploid and tetraploid, and found that there were no morphological or ecological differences between the diploids and tetraploids. In 1947 he also published on the problems associated with using leaves for taxonomic purposes in Delphinium;[13] these and other problems with determining species differences were later reported in a 1954 taxonomic revision of the Californian genus.[43] This report also included results of an earlier study that determined chromosome numbers of all Californian species; they reported that all species were diploids except three, which had mixed races of diploids and tetraploids, as they reported earlier in 1946.[12][44]/nIn 1952 Carl Epling and Lewis reported on the ecology of the genus with respect to its adaptation to drought.[45] They reported that its perennial habit could be put into dormancy from essentially any growth stage, and \"once initiated is not broken until the following season.\"  Further, different individuals within a population could remain or become dormant while others completed a growth cycle. Consequently, \"An increase of genotypes adapted to the xeric aspects of a given site would be expected as a result of prolonged drought...\"/nIn 1959 Lewis and Epling reported on a rapid speciation event at the diploid level by hybridization.[46] They asserted that D. gypsophilum arose from the hybridization of D. recurvatum and D. hesperium in a single generation; and presented evidence that D. gypsophilum was not only intermediate in morphology, but occupied an ecological zone intermediate between the two parents. Further, all the species were interfertile. They also concluded that this mode of speciation was not unique in Delphinium./nIn 1966 argued that diploids and their autopolyploid derivatives should be considered as belonging to one species. He used examples to support this from the diploid and tetraploid races of D. hanseni, D. gypsophilum, and D. variegatum.[47]/nLewis' first publication was with Carl Epling in 1940[7] which covered the distributions of three species pairs in Californian chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities. In this paper he shows his first interest in plant distributions as they relate to speciation. His next publications with Epling followed in 1942. One was taxonomic in nature, and concerned itself with the genus Monarda in the Lamiaceae.[8] His second paper in 1942 concerned itself with the distributions of the chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities in cis-montane California, and they concluded that these two communities had their centers of distribution in San Diego County, and probably entered the Southwestern United States from the North American Pleateau.[9]/nIn 1951 Lewis and Snow published a small article on taxonomic problems in Eschscholtzia, and advocated the use of cytogenetics to solve some of its taxonomic problems.[48]  He apparently never followed up on this work./nLewis published on chromosome numbers in Mentzelia (Loasaceae),[49] as well as a taxonomic revision of the genus Trichostema (Lamiaceae) including chromosome counts.[10][50]/nIn 1958 Lewis, Raven and others published on a chromosomal analysis of several taxa in the Onagraceae \"because we have been curious to know the pattern of chromosome differentiation in the family,\" and they concluded that as a result of their analysis the suggested a taxonomic reevaluation of several taxa.[51]/nLewis and Epling published a paper in 1960 on blue and white flowered polymorphisms in Linanthus parryae (Polemoniaceae).[52]  The persistence of this polymorphism over time has been a puzzle for many years, and was studied by prominent geneticists such as Sewall Wright and Theodosius Dobzhansky, going back to 1942;[53] and as recently as 2007.[54] Epling and Lewis found that the polymorphisms were very stable over a 15-year period, despite changes in plant densities. Further, they reported that there was a large seed bank of ungerminated seeds, and these seeds had a variable release from dormancy. Consequently, the effective \"breeding group\" was very large, and that any selective advantage of the flower colors \"precluded significant changes in pattern during 15 seasons.\"/nIn an attempt to understand the structure of chromosomes that tends to favor the formation of translocation heterozygotes, Lewis and Raven[55] analayzed metaphase chromosomes from species throughout the Onagraceae, including taxa with and without translocation heterozygotes. They found that those genera that had translocation heterozygotes all had metaphase chromosomes with particular characteristics./nIn 1964 Lewis published an extensive analysis of species in the genus Gayophytum (Onagraceae) distributed in the western U.S. and Chile. Their analysis included morhology, cytogenetics, ecology, and taxonomy.[56]/nCarl Epling named a new Genus in the Labiatae after Harlan Lewis, called Harlanlewisia. He said \"I take pleasure and satisfaction in naming this genus in honor of Professor Harlan Lewis of the University of California, whose brilliant and definitive analyses of the taxonomy and evolution of Clarkia-Godetia are well known and whose first contribution to taxonomy was a revision of the Labiate genus Trichostemma.\"[57]", "164968": "Jan or Johannes Swammerdam (February 12, 1637\u00a0\u2013 February 17, 1680) was a Dutch biologist and microscopist. His work on insects demonstrated that the various phases during the life of an insect\u2014egg, larva, pupa, and adult\u2014are different forms of the same animal. As part of his anatomical research, he carried out experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells.  He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years./nJohannes Swammerdam was baptized on 15 February 1637 in the Oude Kerk Amsterdam. His father Jan (or Johannes) Jacobsz (-1678) was an apothecary and an amateur collector of minerals, coins, fossils, and insects from around the world. In 1632 he married Baartje Jans (-1660) in Weesp.[1] The couple lived across the Montelbaanstoren, near the harbour, the headquarter and the warehouses of the Dutch West India Company where an uncle worked. Some of their children were buried in the Walloon church, likewise Jan himself (who never married) and his father.[2]/nAs a youngster, Swammerdam had helped his father to take care of his curiosity collection. Despite his father's wish that he should study theology Swammerdam started to study medicine in 1661 at the University of Leiden. He studied under the guidance of Johannes van Horne and Franciscus Sylvius. Among his fellow students were Frederik Ruysch, Reinier de Graaf, Ole Borch, Theodor Kerckring, Steven Blankaart, Burchard de Volder, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus and Niels Stensen.  While studying medicine Swammerdam started his own collection of insects.[3]/nIn 1663 Swammerdam moved to France to continue his studies. It seems together with Steno.[4] He studied for one year at the Protestant University of Saumur, under the guidance of Tanaquil Faber. Subsequently, he studied in Paris at the scientific academy of Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot. 1665 he returned to the Dutch Republic and joined a group of physicians who performed dissections and published their findings. Between 1666 and 1667 Swammerdam concluded his study of medicine at the University of Leiden; he received his doctorate in medicine in 1667 under van Horne for his dissertation on the mechanism of respiration, published under the title De respiratione usuque pulmonum.[3]/nTogether with van Horne, he researched the anatomy of the uterus. The result of this research was published under the title Miraculum naturae sive uteri muliebris fabrica in 1672. Swammerdam accused Reinier de Graaf of taking credit of discoveries he and Van Horne had made earlier regarding the importance of the ovary and its eggs.\nHe used waxen injection techniques and a single-lens microscope made by Johannes Hudde./nWhile studying medicine Swammerdam had started to dissect insects and after qualifying as a doctor, he focused on them. His father pressured him to earn a living, but Swammerdam persevered and in late 1669 published Historia insectorum generalis ofte Algemeene verhandeling van de bloedeloose dierkens (The General History of Insects, or General Treatise on little Bloodless Animals). The treatise summarised his study of insects he had collected in France and around Amsterdam. He countered the prevailing Aristotelian notion that insects were imperfect animals that lacked internal anatomy.[3] Following the publication his father withdrew all financial support.[5] As a result, Swammerdam was forced, at least occasionally, to practice medicine in order to finance his own research. He obtained leave at Amsterdam to dissect the bodies of those who died in the hospital.[6]/nAt university Swammerdam engaged deeply in the religious and philosophical ideas of his time. He categorically opposed the ideas behind spontaneous generation, which held that God had created some creatures, but not insects. Swammerdam argued that this would blasphemously imply that parts of the universe were excluded from God's will. In his scientific study, Swammerdam tried to prove that God's creation happened time after time, and that it was uniform and stable. Swammerdam was much influenced by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, whose natural philosophy had been widely adopted by Dutch intellectuals. In Discours de la Methode Descartes had argued that nature was orderly and obeyed fixed laws, thus nature could be explained rationally.[7]/nSwammerdam was convinced that the creation, or generation, of all creatures obeyed the same laws. Having studied the reproductive organs of men and women at university he set out to study the generation of insects. He had devoted himself to studying insects after discovering that the king bee was indeed a queen bee. Swammerdam knew this because he had found eggs inside the creature. But he did not publish this finding. Swammerdam corresponded with Matthew Slade and Paolo Boccone and was visited by Willem Piso, Nicolaas Tulp and Nicolaas Witsen.[8] He showed Cosimo III de' Medici, accompanied by Th\u00e9venot, another revolutionary discovery. Inside a caterpillar the limbs and wings of the butterfly could be seen (now called the imaginal discs)./nWhen Swammerdam published The General History of Insects, or General Treatise on little Bloodless Animals later that year he not only did away with the idea that insects lacked internal anatomy but also attacked the Christian notion that insects originated from spontaneous generation and that their life cycle was a metamorphosis.[9] Swammerdam maintained that all insects originated from eggs and their limbs grew and developed slowly. Thus there was no distinction between insects and so-called higher animals. Swammerdam declared war on \"vulgar errors\" and the symbolic interpretation of insects was, in his mind, incompatible with the power of God, the almighty architect.[10]\nSwammerdam, therefore, dispelled the seventeenth-century notion of metamorphosis \u2014the idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) represent different individuals[11] or a sudden change from one type of animal to another.[12]/nSwammerdam suffered a crisis of conscience; his father repudiated the study of insects. Having believed that his scientific research was a tribute to the Creator, he started to fear that he may be worshipping the idol of curiosities. In 1673 Swammerdam briefly fell under the influence of the Flemish mystic Antoinette Bourignon. His 1675 treatise on the mayfly, entitled Ephemeri vita, included devout poetry and documented his religious experiences.[5] Swammerdam found comfort in the arms of Bourignon's sect in Nordstrand, Germany. Swammerdam traveled to Copenhagen to visit the mother of Nicolaus Steno, but was back in Amsterdam in early 1676. In a letter to Henry Oldenburg, he explained \"I was never at any time busier than in these days, and the chief of all architects has blessed my endeavors\".[13]/nHis religious crisis only interrupted his scientific research briefly and until his premature death aged 43, he worked on what was to become his main work. It remained unpublished when he died in 1680 and was published as Bybel der natuure posthumously in 1737 by the Leiden University professor Herman Boerhaave.[14][15] Convinced that all insects were worth studying, Swammerdam had compiled an epic treatise on as many insects as he could, using the microscope and dissection. Inspired by Marcello Malpighi, in  De Bombyce Swammerdam described the anatomy of silkworms, mayflies, ants, stag beetles, cheese mites, bees and many other insects. His scientific observations were infused by the presence of God, the almighty creator.[16] Swammerdam's praise of the louse went on to become a classic:/nHerewith I offer you the Omnipotent Finger of God in the anatomy of a louse: wherein you will find miracle heaped on miracle and see the wisdom of God clearly manifested in a minute point.[7]/nIn Biblia naturae the first visual proof was published that his contemporaries had mistakenly identified the queen bee as male.[17] Swammerdam also provided evidence that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony.[18] Swammerdam had engaged in five intense years of beekeeping. He had found that drones were masculine, and had no stinger. Swammerdam identified the worker bees as \"natural eunuchs\" because he was unable to detect ovaries in them, but described them as nearer to the nature of the female. Swammerdam had produced a drawing of the queen bee's reproductive organs, as observed through the microscope.[19] Since ancient times it had been asserted that the queen bee was male, and ruled the hive. In 1586 Luis Mendez de Torres had first published the finding that the hive was ruled by a female, but Torres had maintained that she produced all other bees in the colony through a \"seed\". In 1609 Charles Butler had recorded the sex of drones as male, but he wrongly believed that they mated with worker bees. The drawing Swammerdam produced of the internal anatomy of the queen bee was only published in 1737.[18] His drawing of the honeycomb geometry was first published in Biblia naturae, but had been referenced by Giacomo Filippo Maraldi in his 1712 book.[20] Details of Swammerdam's research on bees had already been published elsewhere because he had shared his findings with other scientists in correspondence. Among others, Swammerdam's research had been referenced by Nicolas Malebranche in 1688.[13]/nIn Biblia naturae Swammerdam's research on muscles was published. Swammerdam played a key role in the debunking of the balloonist theory, the idea that 'moving spirits' are responsible for muscle contractions.  The idea, supported by the Greek physician Galen, held that nerves were hollow and the movement of spirits through them propelled muscle motion.[21] Ren\u00e9 Descartes furthered the idea by basing it on a model of hydraulics, suggesting that the spirits were analogous to fluids or gasses and calling them 'animal spirits'.[21] In the model, which Descartes used to explain reflexes, the spirits would flow from the ventricles of the brain, through the nerves, and to the muscles to animate the latter.[21] According to this hypothesis, muscles would grow larger when they contract because of the animal spirits flowing into them.  To test this idea, Swammerdam placed severed frog thigh muscle in an airtight syringe with a small amount of water in the tip.[21] He could thus determine whether there was a change in the volume of the muscle when it contracted by observing a change in the level of the water (image at right).[21] When Swammerdam caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve, the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount; this showed that no air or fluid could be flowing into the muscle.[21] The idea that nerve stimulation led to the movement had important implications for neuroscience by putting forward the idea that behavior is based on stimuli.[21]/nSwammerdam's research had been referenced before its publication by Nicolas Steno, who had visited Swammerdam in Amsterdam. Swammerdam's research concluded after Steno had published the second edition of Elements of Myology in 1669, which is referenced in Biblia naturae.[22] A letter from Steno to Malpighi from 1675 suggests that Swammerdam's findings on muscle contraction had caused his crisis of consciousness. Steno sent Malpighi the drawings Swammerdam had done of the experiments, saying \"when he had written a treatise on this matter he destroyed it and he has only preserved these figures. He is seeking God, but not yet in the Church of God.\"[23]/nTogether with his father he collected 6,000 objects in 27 drawer cabinets. Swammerdam's Historia insectorum generalis was widely known and applauded before he died. Two years after his death in 1680 it was translated into French and in 1685 it was translated into Latin. John Ray, author of the 1705 Historia insectorum, praised  Swammerdam' methods, they were \"the best of all\".[13] Though Swammerdam's work on insects and anatomy was significant, many current histories remember him as much for his methods and skill with microscopes as for his discoveries. He developed new techniques for examining, preserving, and dissecting specimens, including wax injection to make viewing blood vessels easier. A method he invented for the preparation of hollow human organs was later much employed in anatomy.[6] He had corresponded with contemporaries across Europe and his friends Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Nicolas Malebranche used his microscopic research to substantiate their own natural and moral philosophy.[13] But Swammerdam has also been credited with heralding the natural theology of the 18th century, were God's grand design was detected in the mechanics of the Solar System, the seasons, snowflakes and the anatomy of the human eye.[13] An English translation of his entomological works by T. Floyd was published in 1758.[6]/nNo authentic portrait of Jan Swammerdam is extant nowadays.[24] The portrait shown in the header is derived from the painting The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Tulp by Rembrandt and represents the leading Amsterdam physician Hartman Hartmanzoon (1591\u20131659).", "59475065": "Ivan Abramovich Zalkind (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0417\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0434; 1 May[1] 1885 in Saint Petersburg,[2] Russia \u2013 27 November[1] 1928 in Leningrad,[3] Soviet Union), also known as Ivan Artamonov (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432),[3] was a Jewish[4] Soviet diplomat.

His parents ran a general store and Charles left school at 13 to help them run the business. He trained as a butcher and opened a shop in Wyke in 1864, the same year he married Mary Ann Cragg. The couple had four children, two dying in infancy, and Mary Ann herself died in 1869. Charles remarried in 1871 and had two children by his second wife, Clementina Foster. In 1873, the couple returned to Halifax, where they opened a butcher's shop which they continued to run till Charles largely retired from the trade (leaving the shop mostly in the hands of a managing partner) in 1890. He was treasurer of the Halifax Butchers' Association from 1881 to 1908 and often referred to himself as a \"Knight of the Cleaver\".[1][2]/nHe spoke and was interested in the local Halifax dialect, publishing a number of papers on local place-names and surnames in the Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society, of which he was a member, eventually becoming the society's president. In later years, he also compiled a bibliography of Halifax, parts of which were published in the Transactions of the Halifax Antiquarian Society, as well as a local guide book, Pleasant walks around Halifax (1910).[3]/nHe died in Halifax on 9 December 1916.[4]/nCrossland initially became interested in botany in 1880, whilst helping one of his daughters with a Sunday school wild flower project. He joined the Halifax Scientific Society to pursue his new-found enthusiasm, and subsequently the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union. In 1888, at a YNU fungus foray, Crossland met George Edward Massee who encouraged him to take an interest in fungi.[5] As a result, he developed an expertise in mycology, with a particular interest in the discomycetes, making extensive local collections, often in the company of Henry Thomas Soppitt and fellow mycologist and bryologist James Needham.[3] Crossland produced many papers on Yorkshire fungi, including several describing species new to science. His two major works were the cryptogamic section of the Flora of the parish of Halifax, jointly authored with botanist W.B. Crump in 1904, and The Fungus Flora of Yorkshire, a substantial volume co-authored with Massee, in 1905.[1][3][5] His collections of fungi, drawings, and notes are now in the mycological herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.[6][7]/nCharles Crossland became the first secretary of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union Mycological Committee in 1892,  becoming president of the union itself in 1907. He was a founder member of the British Mycological Society, becoming its first treasurer in 1896. He was made a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1899.[3]/nCrossland described several new species of fungi from Yorkshire, either individually or with Soppitt or Massee. These included several agarics, notably Lactarius glaucescens Crossl., but were mostly discomycetes, including Ascophanus globosopulvinatus (Crossl.) Boud. ex Ramsb., Niptera pilosa (Crossl.) Boud., Melastiza contorta (Massee & Crossl.) Spooner & Y.J. Yao, and Scutellinia citrina (Massee & Crossl.) Spooner & Y.J. Yao. A number of species were named in Crossland's honour, including Clavaria crosslandii Cotton, Ascobolus crosslandii Boud., and Octospora crosslandii (Dennis & Itzerott) Benkert.[8]/nMedia related to Charles Crossland at Wikimedia Commons", "33952": "Emil Hans Willi Hennig (20 April 1913 \u2013 5 November 1976) was a German biologist and zoologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, otherwise known as cladistics.[1][2][3] In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in German in 1950, with a substantially revised English translation published in 1966. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings.[4][5] As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (true flies)./nHennig coined the key terms synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy, and paraphyly. He also asserted, in his \"auxiliary principle\", that \"the presence of apomorphous characters in different species 'is always reason for suspecting kinship [i.e., that species belong to a monophyletic group], and that their origin by convergence should not be presumed a priori' (Hennig, 1953). This was based on the conviction that 'phylogenetic systematics would lose all ground on which it stands' if the presence of apomorphous characters in different species were considered first of all as convergences (or parallelisms), with proof to the contrary required in each case.\"[6]  This has been viewed as an application of the parsimony principle to the interpretation of characters, an important component of phylogenetic inference.[7]/nHe is also remembered for Hennig's progression rule in cladistics, which argues controversially[8] that the most primitive species are found in the earliest, central part of a group's area./nHennig was born in D\u00fcrrhennersdorf, Upper Lusatia. His mother Marie Emma, n\u00e9e Gro\u00df, worked as a maid and, later, factory worker. His father Karl Ernst Emil Hennig was a rail worker. Willi had two brothers, Fritz Rudolf Hennig, who became a minister, and Karl Herbert, who went missing at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943./nIn the spring of 1919, Willi Hennig started school in D\u00fcrrhennersdorf, and subsequently was at school in Taubenheim an der Spree and Oppach. Rudolf Hennig described the family as calm; his father possessed an even temperament./nAs of 1927, Willi Hennig continued his education at the Realgymnasium and boarding school in Klotzsche near Dresden. Here he met his first mentor M. Rost, a science teacher, whom he lived with in a house known as the \"Abteilung\".[9] Rost had an interest in insects and introduced Hennig to Wilhelm Meise, who worked as a scientist at the Dresdener Museum f\u00fcr Tierkunde (State Museum of Zoology, Dresden). In 1930, Hennig skipped a year, and graduated on 26 February 1932. As early as 1931, Willi Hennig composed an essay entitled Die Stellung der Systematik in der Zoologie (\"The state of systematics in zoology\") as part of his school work, published posthumously in 1978. It showed his interest as well as his deliberate treatment of systematic problems. Besides school, Hennig worked as a volunteer at the museum and, in collaboration with Meise, saw to the systematic and biogeographical investigation of the \"flying\" snakes of the genus Dendrophis that became his first published work./nFrom the summer semester of 1932 onwards, Hennig read zoology, botany and geology at the University of Leipzig. He would continue to visit the Museum in Dresden. There, he met the curator of the entomological collection, the Dipteran expert Fritz Isidor van Emden. Hennig saw him regularly until van Emden was expelled from National Socialist Germany for having a Jewish mother and wife.[10]/nHennig developed a deep friendship with Emden's successor, Klaus G\u00fcnther. Hennig concluded his studies with a dissertation entitled, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntnis des Kopulationsapparates der cyclorrhaphen Dipteren. By this time, Hennig had published eight scientific papers. Besides his 300-page revision of the Tylidae (now classed as Micropezidae), there were further papers on Diptera and the agamid genus Draco of gliding lizards. After his studies, Hennig was Volont\u00e4r at the State Museum for Zoology in Dresden. On 1 January 1937, he obtained a scholarship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to work at the German Entomological Institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft in Berlin-Dahlem. On 13 May 1939, Hennig married his former fellow student Irma Wehnert. By 1945, they had three sons, Wolfgang (born 1941), Bernd (born 1943) and Gerd (born 1945)./nWilli Hennig was drafted in 1938 to train for the infantry and concluded this course in 1939. As of the start of World War II, he was deployed in the  infantry in Poland, France, Denmark and Russia. He was injured by grenade shrapnel in 1942 and was subsequently used as entomologist at the Institute for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Berlin, carrying the rank of a Sonderf\u00fchrer (Z). Just before the war ended, he was sent to Italy to the 10th Army, Heeresgruppe C, to fight malaria and other epidemic diseases. At the end of the war in May 1945, he was captured by the British while he was with the Malaria training corps at the Gulf of Trieste, and was only released in the autumn./nThrough his active participation in war as soldier and scientist Hennig was later subjected to accusations that he had been a member of the National Socialist party, especially by the Italian biologist and founder of panbiogeography, Leon Croizat. No evidence has been officially presented to support the claim. There is no report of Hennig supporting the National Socialist party views publicly on any occasion.[11]  Hennig did believe that Nazi Germany would win World War II.[12]/nDuring his time as prisoner of war, Hennig began to draft his most important contribution to systematics, not published until 1950. The rough draft was composed with pencil and ballpoint pen into an A4 exercise book, spanning 170 pages. During the war, he also published a further 25 scientific papers. Most of the correspondence and literature research was conducted by his wife, Irma./nFrom 1 December 1945, to 31 March 1947, Willi Hennig stood in for his thesis supervisor Paul Buchner as assistant to Professor Friedrich Hempelmann at the University of Leipzig, giving lectures in general biology, zoology and special zoology of insects. He returned to the German Entomological Institute in Berlin on 1 April 1947, and gave up his position in Leipzig. From 1 November 1949, he led the section for systematic entomology and was second director of the institute. On 1 August 1950, he habilitated in zoology at the Brandenburgische Landeshochschule in Potsdam. On 10 October that year he was offered a professorship with teaching responsibilities, which he fulfilled lecturing on special zoology of invertebrates, systematic zoology and taxonomic practicals. In the same year, he published his Basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics, and further works on the methodology of phylogenetic systematics followed in the ensuing years, accompanied by numerous taxonomic works about Diptera. His two-volume Pocket book of zoology, in which he applied phylogenetic systematics to invertebrates for the first time, was particularly successful./nHe continued working at the German Entomological Institute in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, Berlin-Friedrichshagen, all the while living in the American sector in Berlin-Steglitz. On a trip to France with his son on 13 August 1961, he heard of the impending Berlin Wall and returned to Berlin immediately to quit his appointment. Moving to East Berlin was out of the question, as Hennig held anti-communist views and already had a troubled relationship with the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED) that was the ruling political party of East Germany, as Hennig had repeatedly helped employees of the institute gain employment in the West./nIn West Berlin, Hennig was given an interim post at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin as Distinguished Professor. He rejected offers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., and an offer made by his friend Elmo Hardy, to become a Research Fellow at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, citing as reasons that the education of his sons took priority for him, and that he needed to have the \"cultural witnesses of the antique Greek-Roman Europe within ready access\". He instead decided on a post at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart,[13] where he was given a department for phylogenetic research. In April 1963, he moved to Ludwigsburg-Pflugfelden for this position. The scientific collections of the museum had been provisorily kept in Ludwigsburg and remained here until their re-housing at the new site of the museum at Stuttgart's L\u00f6wentor, in 1985./nHennig's works in Stuttgart dealt almost exclusively with taxonomic revisions of Dipterans. For the Stuttgarter Beitr\u00e4ge zur Naturkunde, where he published the majority of his works, he completed 29 issues by the end of his life. Significant are the review articles published in Erwin Lindner's Flies of the Palaearctic Regions and the Handbuch der Zoologie. The cladistic methodology was also represented in several published works, foremost among them the article, Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? A reply to Ernst Mayr (1974), intended as an internationally accessible reply to the criticism Ernst Mayr had made of Hennig's phylogenetic systematics./nWilli Hennig only visited international institutions abroad twice, in spite of receiving many invitations for guest lectures. From 1 September to 30 November 1967, he worked at the Entomology Research Institute at Canada's Department of Agriculture in Ottawa and participated in the International Congress of Entomology in Canberra from 22 to 30 August 1972. With his wife, he also visited Bangkok, New Guinea (where much of Mayr's understanding of bird taxonomy originated) and Singapore on this latter trip. His stay in Canada was also used for visits to various entomological collections in museums of the US, including Cambridge, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, always in the hope of finding further amber inclusions of Dipterans, that featured prominently in his research of the late 1960s and early 1970s. On the initiative of Klaus G\u00fcnther, who by then held a chair at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Hennig was given an honorary doctorate on 4 December 1968; for health reasons, he could not accept this honour in person, and it was presented to him by G\u00fcnther on 21 March 1969, in Stuttgart. On the initiative of students whom he had lectured on several animal taxa, Hennig was made an honorary professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen on 27 February 1970./nOn the night of 5 November 1976, Hennig died of a heart attack at Ludwigsburg. He had previously repeatedly cancelled lectures with reference to his fading health, and had already had an attack on his journey to Ottawa. He was interred on 10 November at the Bergfriedhof in T\u00fcbingen./nThe dipteran genus Hennigiola is named after him, as is the Evaniid wasp Hyptia hennigi.[14]/nThe Willi Hennig Society, an organization devoted to the advancement of cladistic principles in systematic biology, was founded in 1981.

This works suggests chance events, such as mutation and drift, play an important role in adaptive evolution, as do the complex genetic interactions that underlie the structure of organisms.[2]/nHis research mainly focus on experimental evolution, ecology and origins of life using microorganisms as models. The techniques of experimental evolution exploit the short-generation times of microbes to observe evolution in action, and to test explicit hypotheses about the effects of environmental manipulations on these processes. One main topic within experimental evolution research is the origin of multicellularity and its traits./nAlthough his primary appointment is in EEB he is also: 1) a member of the Biotechnology Institute; 2) the graduate program in microbial engineering; 3) the graduate program in plant and microbial biology; and 4) a resident fellow in the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of Science./nThe evolution of multicellularity is arguably the most significant innovation in the history of life after the origin of life itself.[3] The Travisano group showed that settling in a static test tube provided a simple selection scheme that favored the formation of multicellular clonal clusters in yeast--dubbed \u2018snowflakes\u2019 . Early multicellular clusters were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death, as is seen in the protective boundary of skin cells. In snowflake yeast, programmed cell death is an adaptation that increased cluster production.[3]/nGenes compete with one another for representation in the next generation, and the competitive nature of this process would seem to disfavor cooperation and niceness. Cells of brewer\u2019s yeast release an enzyme that breaks indigestibly large sugar molecules into smaller, more easily digestible subunits. These digestible subunits are available to any yeast cell in the neighborhood, and the enzyme is costly, so surely selection should favor cheaters who chow down on the sugar subunits but don\u2019t secrete the costly enzyme. Greig & Travisano, showed that selection for and against these cheaters depended on population size. Cheaters persist when populations are large, and when many \u2018nice enzyme-secreting\u2019 enzyme-secreting\u2019 cells are around, but selection acts against cheaters when populations are low.[4]/nThe mechanisms through which this separation is achieved are clearly fundamental to our understanding of the diversity of living things, since species are the raw material of organic diversity. Working with his postdoctoral associate, Duncan Greig, Travisano experimentally demonstrated speciation in the laboratory via a previously unknown mechanism. Publishing in Science, they reported that when a hybrid strain of yeast self-fertilizes its offspring are incompatible with either parent species but they produce fertile offspring when mated to each other: generating what is effectively an instant reproductively isolated species.[5]/nThe Travisano-Rainey studies showed that in a matter of days, a single bacterium of Pseudomonas fluorescens will reproduce and evolve into three distinct lineages: one colonizes the air-water interface by forming a mat, one colonizes the bulk medium and one colonizes the anoxic environment at the bottom of the test tube. This happens if the test tube is unshaken, but not in a shaken test tube: demonstrating that environmental heterogeneity (like the different habitats of different islands) is key to the process of adaptive radiation[6]", "34014389": "Raymond Alan Dixon FRS (born 1 December 1947) is a British microbiologist at the John Innes Centre,[1] Norwich, specialising on the molecular understanding of biological nitrogen fixation in bacteria.

In 1914 he was mobilized into World War I but demobilized in 1915 to return to studies. He received his master's degree and became a privatdozent. In 1920 he was dismissed from the Polytechnic Institute on charges of being a Ukrainian nationalist. He then worked on sugar beet at the Sugar Trust where he continued studies on genetics for plant breeding. He travelled briefly and met Nikolai Vavilov who helped him with the latest literature from Leningrad in 1922. He returned to Kyiv and began to work on a book, The Material Basis of Heredity, which was published in 1924. Vavilov invited Levitsky to establish a cytology laboratory at the All-Union Institute of Plant Industry that he directed from 1925. Levitsky considered evolution by polyploidy, examined mutation induction and hybridization and became known as the leading plant cytogeneticist. In 1933 Levitsky was arrested by Stalin's agents and asked to confess that he was a terrorist. After he refused, he was sent into exile but in 1934 Vavilov, H. J. Muller and others influenced a pardon and he was allowed to return to Detskoe Selo. He joined the department of plant genetics at Leningrad University as a professor. The next year, Levitsky clashed with I.I. Prezent, a follower of T.D. Lysenko. In 1938, Lysenko rose to power and on 28 June 1941 Levitsky was arrested and vanished. Following World War II, his name was included as a winner of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. His wife assumed that this meant he was alive and went to make enquiries. The authorities arrested her along with her daughter. The daughter survived but his wife died. The award was apparently a bureaucratic error. In 1956 the daughter petitioned the government and all charges against her father were dropped and he was formally rehabilitated. It is thought that he died in prison in Zlatousk on 20 May 1942.[1][2]", "54133954": "Iwo Robert Waclaw Lominski FRSE (1905\u20131968) was a Polish-born microbiologist working in Britain in the 20th century.

E. Hinton. His thesis investigated the evolution of the migratory habit in butterflies and applied principles of behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology to the insect migration.[6] This work was subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[citation needed]/nBaker moved to the University of Newcastle in 1970 and from there to the University of Manchester in 1974 where he was first a lecturer, and in 1981 a Reader in Zoology in the School of Biological Sciences. In 1996 he left academic life to concentrate on his career in writing and broadcasting./nAlthough his early work was on evolutionary aspects of insect migration and territoriality, his interests broadened. With G.A. Parker and V.G.F. Smith in 1972, he proposed a theory for the evolution of anisogamy and two sexes[7]\n[8] and in 1979, with G.A. Parker he proposed the Unprofitable Prey Theory of the evolution of bird coloration.[8] In 1978 in his book The Evolutionary Ecology of Animal Migration[9] he wrote for the first time on the theme that permeated his work for the rest of his academic life: the application of the principles of evolutionary biology to the behaviour of humans. This led in the 1980s to controversial work on the role of magnetoreception in the navigation of humans,[10] and in the 1990s (with Mark Bellis) to a study of sperm competition in humans[4] and rats, including proposal of the kamikaze sperm hypothesis. Baker and Bellis' research into the evolutionary biology of infidelity, masturbation, sperm polymorphism, and sperm number in humans, as well as into the design and function of the human penis and cervix led to a number of scientific papers and an academic book: Human Sperm Competition: copulation, masturbation and infidelity.[11]/nNoticing that sperm in a mixed sample tends to clump together\u2014making it less mobile\u2014and to have a high mortality rate, reproductive biologist Robin Baker, formerly of the University of Manchester, proposed about a decade ago that some mammals, including humans, manufacture \"killer\" sperm whose only function is to attack foreign spermatozoa, destroying themselves in the process./nTo test this idea, reproductive biologist Harry Moore and evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead of the University of Sheffield mixed sperm samples from 15 men in various combinations and checked for how the cells moved, clumped together, or developed abnormal shapes. \"These are very simple experiments, but we tried to mimic what goes on in the reproductive tract,\" Moore says. The team found no excess casualties from any particular donor or other evidence of warring sperm, they report in 7 December Proceedings of the Royal Society.[citation needed] \"The kamikaze sperm hypothesis is probably not a mechanism in human sperm competition,\" says Birkhead./nThe findings are \"the nail in the coffin for the kamikaze hypothesis,\" says Michael Bedford, a reproductive biologist at Cornell University's Weill Medical Center in New York City. He says he had never given the idea much credence. \u00a0[12]/nAs well as being the author of around one hundred[citation needed] scientific papers and six academic books, Robin Baker is the author of four popular science books: Sperm Wars;[11] Baby Wars;[11] Sex in the Future;[11] and Fragile Science.[11] He has also written three novels: Primal;[11] Caballito;[13] and  The Hitchhiker\u2019s Child[11] which under the guise of being sexual whodunits continue the theme of the evolution of human sexual behaviour.[14] His first novel, Primal,[11] was likened[15] to both the TV series Lost and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. It describes a group of university students and staff stranded on a remote desert island occupied by feral chimpanzees. Bit by bit the people find themselves stripped of all the trappings of civilization until like the apes around them they have only their instincts to guide them./nIn Sperm Wars, Baker asserted the human cuckolding rate to be at 10% and that women frequently cheat to secure better genes for their offspring. This figure was later debunked, because studies which rely on a data set consisting of men who have requested paternity tests are strongly sample biased toward those who have a reason to have suspicions.[16] Men who have low paternity confidence and have chosen to challenge their paternity through laboratory testing are much less likely than men with high paternity confidence to be the fathers of their putative children.[16] A survey of 67 studies reporting nonpaternity suggests that for men with high paternity confidence rates of nonpaternity are (excluding studies of unknown methodology) typically 1.9%, substantially less than the typical rates of 10% or higher cited by many researchers.[17]  \"Media and popular scientific literature often claim that many alleged fathers are being cuckolded into raising children that biologically are not their own,\" said Maarten Larmuseau of KU Leuven in Belgium. \"Surprisingly, the estimated rates within human populations are quite low--around 1 or 2 percent.\" \"But reliable data on contemporary populations that have become available over the last decade, mainly as supplementary results of medical studies, don't support the notion that one in 10 people don't know who their \"real\" fathers are. The findings suggest that any potential advantage of cheating in order to have children that are perhaps better endowed is offset for the majority of women by the potential costs, the researchers say. Those costs likely include spousal aggression, divorce, or reduced paternal investment by the social partner or his relatives. The observed low cuckoldry rates in contemporary and past human populations challenge clearly the well-known idea that women routinely 'shop around' for good genes by engaging in extra-pair copulations to obtain genetic benefits for their children,\" Larmuseau said.[18]", "26576091": "Wafik El-Deiry (born, 1961) is an American physician and cancer researcher who is the Associate Dean for Oncologic Sciences at the Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Director of the Cancer Center at Brown University, and the Director of the Joint Program in Cancer Biology at Brown University and its affiliated hospitals.[1][2][3][4] He was previously deputy director of Translational Research at Fox Chase Cancer Center, where he was also co-Leader of the Molecular Therapeutics Program.[5]/nEl-Deiry was formerly a professor of Medicine and Chief of Hematology/Oncology at the Penn State Milton S.

His paper, \"WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression\",[15] which has been cited over 9,000 times according to Google Scholar,[16] is among the top 10 most-cited papers of the 1990s. El-Deiry discovered the genomic DNA binding site for the tumor suppressor p53.[17] Nikola Pavletich later crystallized the DNA-binding domain of p53 with the DNA binding site and showed that p53 amino acid residues involved in mutations in human cancer normally touch the DNA binding site recognized by the p53 protein.[18] El-Deiry made the discoveries of the consensus binding site for p53 and the discovery of WAF1 while working with Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University. p21(WAF1) was the first mammalian cell cycle inhibitor to be discovered, and was found independently by Wade Harper and Steve Elledge as a CDK2-interacting protein p21(CIP1),[19] Yue Xiong and David Beach as a cyclin-CDK-PCNA interacting protein (p21),[20] and as a senescence derived inhibitor by Noda.[21] Multiple CDK inhibitors have become approved as cancer therapeutics, including palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib.

His group was first to combine gene silencing with bioluminescence imaging in vivo[28][29] and to use molecular imaging for drug screening.[30] His group created a knockout mouse of death receptor 5 (DR5) that shows reduced apoptosis in vivo after exposure to gamma-radiation,[31] and increased tumor susceptibility in tumor-prone genetic backgrounds.[32] The mechanism by which cell death occurs in vivo after radiation or other DNA damage has remained an important question that has been studied by Michael B. Kastan, Scott W. Lowe, Karen Vousden, and others. El-Deiry's contribution was to define the role of the extrinsic cell death pathway through p53 regulation of death receptor 5./nEl-Deiry worked on drug synergies and discovered a potent cancer therapeutic interaction between TRAIL and sorafenib.[33][34] In 2013, his group reported a TRAIL-inducing compound TIC10 as a novel cancer therapeutic and dual inhibitor of ERK and Akt.[35] TIC10 (also known as ONC201) could cross the blood-brain barrier and treat glioblastoma brain cancer in mice.[36] Glioblastoma is a difficult to treat cancer with a high mortality rate. ONC201 is being tested in the clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital and New York University with some evidence of response in patients with glioblastoma.[37][38] By 2016, TIC10 was found to trigger an integrated stress response leading to anti-tumor effects.[39] ONC201/TIC10 is active against cancer stem cells[40] and blocks cancer stem cell gene signatures.[41][42] ONC201 can bind a subtype of dopamine receptors.[43] Unlike TRAIL which is active against a subset of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), ONC201 has preclinical anti-tumor efficacy against ER/PR+. Her2+ and TNBC.[44] El-Deiry reported that ONC201 synergizes with TRAIL, and described the discovery in a video interview.[45] Analogues of ONC201, including ONC206 and ONC212 have been described and demonstrate some differential activities as compared to ONC201.[46][47] ONC212 has preclinical activity in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer and melanoma.[46][47] In 2021, Dr. El-Deiry was invited to speak about the impact of his research and the development of the Cancer Center at Brown University.[48]/nAs an American Cancer Society Research Professor,[49] El-Deiry was introduced and spoke at a Relay for Life event in Pennsylvania in 2017.[50][51]/nIn 2001, El-Deiry became the Founding Editor-in-Chief of the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Biology and Therapy.[52]/nEl-Deiry is a member of the F1000 faculty.[53] He serves as a Member of the editorial board of the oncology newspaper HemOnc Today.[54]/nIn 2005, El-Deiry became a member of the Interurban Clinical Club,[55] and served as its president in 2013\u20132014.

His clinical research demonstrated variability in 5-fluorouracil plasma levels in patients with colorectal cancer.[65] El-Deiry showed that pharmacokinetically guided dosing of 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy is associated with lower levels of toxicity among patients with stage II/III as well as stage IV colorectal cancer.[66][67] Toxicity from chemotherapy is associated with worse quality of life in patients with cancer. In 2017, his group showed that the tumor suppressor protein p53 represses the DPYD gene in 5-fluorouracil-treated cells and that tumor cells with mutated p53 have higher levels of DPYD thereby becoming resistant to 5-fluorouracil.[68] DPYD is involved in the metabolism of 5-fluorouracil and patients with DPD-deficiency have predictable toxicity from 5-fluorouracil. El-Deiry advises adopting a healthy diet including cutting back on pro-inflammatory foods to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.[69] He discusses in detail and endorses findings that tree nut consumption reduces the risk of recurrence and promotes improved survival in patients with stage III colon cancer.[70] El-Deiry spoke about the benefits of tree nut consumption with a Philadelphia CBS local news station that shared the news.[71] He further argues for the use of CEA as an inexpensive and useful blood-based marker to follow when possible to monitor colorectal cancer disease burden and progress after surgery or chemotherapy.[72] He provides his perspective on the use of maintenance chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.[73]/nEl-Deiry is the scientific Founder of Oncoceutics.[74]/nEl-Deiry is a husband to wife Evelyn, and father to four kids James, John, Jennifer and Julie.[citation needed]", "24511708": "Mathukumalli Vidyasagar FRS[1] (born 29 September 1947) is a leading control theorist and a Fellow of Royal Society.

Campbell's research was focused on a specific bacterial virus, phage lambda, and its host bacterium E. coli,[11] but the model provided insights into how extrachromosomal DNA can be inserted and excised in other organisms.[7][12][13]/nThis model was proposed in the book Episomes published in 1968, the first comprehensive treatment of plasmid biology.  It was described as \"a wide-ranging and critical evaluation of the experimental foundation of the episome concept\".[14]/nWhile study of the regulation of integration and excision of phage lambda in E coli has been  a primary focus of his research, Campbell and research associates also studied regulation and expression of E coli genes linked to the lambda insertion location, including the biotin (bio) and galactose (gal) genes.[11]/nEarly studies on bacterial viruses began after the discovery by Twort and d\u2019Herelle of \u2018filterable agents\u2019 which were able to destroy bacteria.  These were demonstrated by creating a lawn of bacteria on appropriate media, mixing with these \u2018filterable agents\u2019 and then observing areas of destroyed cells seen as cleared circular areas (plaques) on the lawn.  These plaques were interpreted as the result of a single agent infecting a bacterial cell, reproducing in the cell and then bursting open to infect surrounding cells, repeating the process until a clear circular area of destroyed cells becomes visible to the unaided eye.  These filterable agents were named bacteriophages (eaters of bacteria) or phage for short.[15]/nThe 1940s produced the first pictures of bacterial viruses using electron microscopy produced the first photos of bacterial viruses, and research on the mechanism of infection and reproduction dramatically increased.  One of the focal points of this research was Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, where a \u2018phage group\u2019 led by Salvador Luria, Max Delbr\u00fcck, Alfred Hershey and others met in the summers for research and training of new investigators.[16]/nIn 1951 Esther Lederberg discovered lambda phage, which had an unusual characteristic.[17]  While lambda could infect and reproduce in some strains of its host bacterium E. coli, other strains seemed immune to infection.  However, when the immune strains were mixed with non-immune strains, occasionally lambda phage could be observed infecting the non-immune strains.  Further research suggested that the immune strains contained a dormant copy of the lambda genome which protected it from infection, but that dormant copy could be activated into the active viral state to begin a new round of infection.  This dormant phase was called the \u2018lysogenic\u2019 state and the actively infectious state was called the \u2018lytic\u2019 state.  The dormant form of the lambda genome was called the \u2018prophage\u2019.[7]/nStudy of phage lambda over the next 50 years provided valuable insights into virus life cycles, [18] the regulation and expression of genetic material,[19] and the mechanism of integration and excision of genetic material into chromosomal locations.[7]/nAllan Campbell's contribution to the field with the \u2018Campbell model\u2019 of integration and excision marked a major step forward in the understanding of this process.[20]/nCampbell was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences (1971),[21] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1971),[22] the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1983)[23] and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology.[24]/nCampbell received the 2004 Abbott-ASM Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society for Microbiology at the society's 104th general meeting in New Orleans on Monday, May 24, 2004.

He further demonstrated that the confinement of these dense polymer chains plus hydrodynamic interactions were the dominant contributor to diffusive processes in cells. Moreover, that the hydrodynamic interactions introduced large scale temporal and spatial correlations that may have important functional consequences.[2][3][5][6]/nHe also pioneered the field of ligand homology modeling with his threading based, FINDSITE approach for protein function inference, binding site prediction and virtual ligand screening. The research showed that remotely related proteins identified by threading often share a common ligand binding site occupied by chemically similar ligands that contain strongly conserved anchor functional groups as well as a variable region that accounts for their binding specificity. These insights enable low-resolution predicted structures to be used for ligand screening/binding pose prediction, with comparable accuracy as with high-resolution experimental structures. In virtual ligand screening, the latest version, FINDSITEcomb, was shown to work far better than more traditional virtual screening approaches on both predicted and high resolution experimental structures.[7][8]/nHe also developed the TASSER protein structure prediction approach, whose variants were among the top performers in CASP in the 2000s and the basis for the I-TASSER service.

Her father, Ralph, came from a farming family and was an agricultural economist and accountant. Her mother, Marline, was an elementary and high school teacher and kept the family active in the community with nonprofit work.[3]/nMarker's family moved to Southern California when she was four years-old. She spent her childhood surrounded by animals, learning how to care for horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, donkeys and goats. Marker's family resettled in Palos Verdes, and later in San Jose, both in Northern California (USA), in time for her to finish high school at age 16. There she solidified her love for animals, starting with her dogs, and her horse on which she competed locally.[1] She started college early at San Francisco State University, intending to become a veterinarian, but the emerging wine industry in the Napa Valley caught her eye./nShe enrolled in the agriculture, enology and viticulture programs at Napa Valley College. While there she re-opened the Pope Valley Winery, in Angwin, which had been closed since prohibition.[3] She also began operating a dairy goat farm.[1]/nMarker soon moved her wine and goat operations to Oregon, where she founded Jonicole Vineyards. In 1974, to make ends meet, she began working at the newly opened local exotic animal park, Wildlife Safari, in Winston Oregon, where her tenure spanned 16 years. She was fascinated by the cheetahs she met there, and was struck by how little was collectively known about them in the scientific community. Marker decided to extensively study the ten cheetahs at Wildlife Safari and began developing what eventually became the most successful captive breeding program in the country.[1][2]/nShe had inadvertently become one of the world's foremost experts on cheetahs, and began teaching zoo keepers and other captive breeders her techniques, and slowly expanded her research.[1]/nIn 1977, Marker took a trip to South West Africa (now Namibia), which contained the largest living population of wild cheetahs. She brought with her a captive-born cheetah named Khayam, in order to test her theory that captive-raised cheetahs could be taught to hunt in a wild setting, and could potentially survive if released.[2] While there, she learned that cheetahs were being killed by farmers at an unsustainable rate of around 900 per year, mostly due to the cats being misunderstood and wrongly accused of killing their livestock.[1]/nWhen Marker returned with Khayam to the U.S. several months later following their successful research project, they traveled regionally and nationally making public appearances to generate awareness for the cheetah's plight. Khayam served as the first ambassador animal for her species.[3] International Cheetah Day is now celebrated every year on December 4, Khayam's birthday, in her honor.[3]/nFor the next ten years, Marker continued traveling to Africa to learn more about the wild cheetah's problems and what could be done to assist endangered populations.[2]/nFrom 1988 to 1991, Marker served as executive director at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences (NOAHS), in Washington DC.[3]/nIn 1990, Marker founded the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which began as a research outpost in a small farmhouse on some land in Otjiwarongo, Namibia.[1][3] She got the funding to purchase and start the initial facility by selling all of her possessions.[4] Marker saw the problem of saving cheetahs as a holistic issue, in which local communities, farmers and governments needed to participate together for mutual goals. She created programs to aid farmers by providing free training in predator identification and livestock husbandry techniques to increase understanding and decrease losses.

Au was honored as a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 1990 and awarded the ASA's first Silver Medal in Animal Bioacoustics in 1998. He was graduate advisor to MacArthur Fellow Kelly Benoit-Bird, who credits Au for discovering how sophisticated dolphin sonar is, developing dolphin-inspired machine sonars to separate different species of fish with the goal of protecting sensitive species, and for making numerous contributions to the description of Humpback whale song, which helped protect these whales from ship noise and ship traffic.[2]/nHe acted as the Chief Scientist of the Marine Mammal Research Program of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawai\u02bbi until his death in February 2020.[3]/nWhitlow Au was born in Honolulu.

Following that graduation he left the Islands to study electrical engineering in the doctoral program at Washington State University on the drier side of the state of Washington in Pullman, completing his M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1964 and his Ph.D. in Electrical Science in 1970. While a student he became a member of both Sigma Tau and Sigma Xi honor societies. Au joined the United States Air Force space program and was the project officer on a research program studying the propagation of radar signals through the plasma sheath of reentry vehicles at the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in New Mexico. He died on February 12, 2020, after two months of heart problems at age 79.[4]/nUpon completion of his Air Force service, Whit was recruited and hired as a new professional at the Naval Undersea Center in San Diego, California. Part of the new professional program was to expose newly hired professionals to the various types of programs going on at the San Diego Laboratory and also at its \"skunk works\" facility on the Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay in Hawai\u02bbi. Being Hawaii-raised, Whit took the opportunity to step down out of the ionosphere and to take a quick look toward the ocean at the biosonar or echolocation performance of the Navy's \"secret\" dolphins. It can't be said for certain how much Whit's fascination for understanding the dolphin's echolocation, or his love of the Islands, influenced his decision, but he decided to join the biosonar research group at the Hawaii Laboratory of the Naval Undersea Center. He then was quickly advanced to the head of its Biosonar Branch./nAu's first paper on the echolocation of dolphins surprised a few people. He, along with physicist Bob Floyd and biologists Earl Murchison and Ralph Penner [\"Measurement of echolocation signals of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus Montague, in open waters,\" J. Acoust. Soc Am. 56, 1280-1290 (1974)][5] found that typical dolphin echolocation signals in the open water had average durations near 40 microseconds with peak energies between 120 and 130\u00a0kHz, much higher than the previously reported energy peaks centered at 35 to 60\u00a0kHz. That report did much to explain why Scott Johnson had earlier found that bottlenosed dolphins heard sounds up to 150\u00a0kHz, but only later did Au report that the previously reported lower peak energy clicks were typical of animals in pools while higher peak energy signals were typically found in the open waters when the animals were looking for small targets a good distance away. That paper also began a precise and methodical examination of the echolocation of dolphins and other small whales carried out by Au that has served to establish, describe, and quantify the echolocation performance and signal characteristics of animals that echolocate under water./nThe Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1974 to the present day contains dozens of articles with Au's name in the authorship line, a remarkably productive development of the fundamental knowledge of dolphin and whale biosonar. Based on this work and his service, Au became a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 1990. His 20-plus years of investigation were summarized and expanded in his book The Sonar of Dolphins. An analysis and appreciation of this work might best be described by quoting some of the reviewers that did the initial book reviews. David Pye wrote that \"... Whitlow Au has written a splendid book, which is likely to become a classic in its field, and of considerable interest well outside it.\" (Nature 366, 376 (1993)) while Bertel M\u00f8hl wrote that \"This book is an authoritative, precise and comprehensive treatise in 277 pages of what is known about sonar (or echolocation) in dolphins, written by the leading scientist in the field\" [Aquatic Mammals 19 (3), 125-126 (1993)]. James Fullard (Science 260, 1672 (1993)) noted that \"Au's book is an excellent synthesis of the mountain of work on dolphin sonar...\"/nThis book seemed to come at the peak of Au's productivity.  Dolphin and whale echolocation had been systematically studied at the Hawaii Laboratory since 1970 by combining the skills of electrical engineers, psychologists, biologists, physiologists, physicists, mechanical engineers, veterinarians, astute animal trainers, and, to quote the preface to Au's book, \"a political scientist.\" That combination of professional skills allowed the \"mountain of work\" on dolphin sonar to be completed and very well presented in The Sonar of Dolphins./nThe name of the Naval Undersea Center's Hawaii Laboratory changed many times and in 1993 the then-named Naval Ocean Systems Center's Hawaii Laboratory was closed by Congress. While the entire group had the opportunity to move to San Diego and join the Space Warfare Systems Center's program, Au had an offer to move over to the University of Hawaii's Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology on Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay to join the marine mammal research program. Au did not hesitate; he immediately took the opportunity to become a faculty member and continue echolocation and hearing research with dolphins and small whales in Hawaii. His research effort did not decline; in fact, his productivity, as evidenced in the number and breadth of publications, has accelerated. He has taken on several students and expanded work to include the acoustics of wild spotted and bottlenose dolphins echolocating through sediments in the Bahamas, the acoustics of wild spinner dolphins off of the Eastern Coast of Oahu, and singing humpback whales off of Maui.

These neurons allow 3D vision, the localization of sounds in space, the coordination of muscle contraction during movement, especially during walking.[8] Their abnormal development is at the origin of neurological diseases such as mirror movements or HGPPS, a rare disease (mutation of the ROBO3 gene) that combines severe scoliosis and strabismus[9] In a series of articles published over the past 20 years,[10][11][12] Alain Ch\u00e9dotal has identified some of the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling axon guidance and neuron migration in several brain regions.[13]/nHis team is also studying the evolution of axonal guidance mechanisms.[14] His recent work has called into question the existence of a chemotropism of commissural axons, one of the dogmas in the field.[15] He has recently demonstrated that certain guidance molecules are key regulators of normal and pathological angiogenesis, and that blocking these signals could potentially be used to treat neovascular eye diseases.[16] His team also develops projects on the regeneration and repair of the optic nerve and cornea./nAlain Ch\u00e9dotal's laboratory has developed an innovative technique for three-dimensional imaging by optical cutting of thick, whole samples (mouse embryos, postnatal brain) made transparent using organic solvents and imaged with a light-sheet microscope. This method revolutionizes and facilitates the way in which the neuroanatomical organization of the brain,[17] but also of all tissues, can be studied. He applied this method to the study of human embryonic and foetal development and began to build the first 3D cellular atlas of human embryonic development.[18]/nAlain Ch\u00e9dotal has been a member of EMBO since 2019,[19] of the Academia Europaea since 2016 and of the French Academy of sciences since 2017[20] and was President of the Scientific Council of the Foundation for Medical Research (2020-2022).[21]", "427378": "Martyn David Jones (born 1 March 1947) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Clwyd South from 1987 until his retirement at the 2010 general election./nBorn in Wrexham, he attended Grove Park Grammar School (now Rhosnesni High School) on Penymaes Avenue in Wrexham.

She showed that precursor cells within the neural crest were multipotent. Her technique has also permitted her to shed light on the development of the blood and immune systems. Her work on antero-posterior patterning of the vertebrate digestive tract laid the grounds for future work, leading to a better understanding of antero-posterior patterning in the digestive tract.[3]/nLe Douarin was born on 20 August 1930[4] in Lorient, France.[5] She was an only child, raised by both parents in the town of Lorient, where her mother worked as a schoolteacher and her father as a businessman. In 1944 she fled her hometown temporarilyand  attended a boarding school in Nantes to escape the invading German forces, before moving back after the end of World War II to her high school in Lorient. She  graduated in 1949. In high school and in her first year at university she was oriented towards literature but the influence of a talented science teacher in her last year at school turned her interests to natural sciences.[6] She met her future husband while in high school and they both moved to Paris where they attended the same university and married in 1951. She received her B.S. in natural sciences from the Sorbonne in 1954. She did not immediately continue to graduate work, choosing instead to teach high school science and raise her two daughters. In 1958, she returned to the university to continue her education at the Institut d\u2019Embryologie Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), working with renowned embryologist Etienne Wolf. This research led to her doctoral work and Ph.D. in 1964.[7]/nShe was appointed to the faculty at the University of Nantes in 1966. The dean, however, almost disallowed her appointment because he disapproved of married women on the same faculty with their husbands. Le Douarin's mentor Wolf intervened, and the dean relented. However, she was not given laboratory space or a research budget, as her husband was, and she was given a heavy teaching load. Le Douarin continued her research on avian embryos, focusing on the interactions between the endoderm and mesoderm layers.[7]/nLe Douarin was most interested in researching embryonic inductive signaling mechanisms. Through years of experimentation, she invented an embryo manipulation technology to produce chimeric embryos from chicken and quails. When grafting quail mesoderm and chicken endoderm together, Le Douarin noticed that the quail cell nucleoli were significantly larger and denser than the chicken cell nucleoli. The size disparity was caused by the tendency of quail embryos to carry increased amount of heterochromatin in the nucleolus. Le Douarin was able to utilize Feulgen stain to stain the heterochromatin and distinguish between groups of quail-derived and chicken-derived cells in her chimeric embryos based on the amount of visible dye. The use of Feulgen stain was an important turning point in Le Douarin's research, as she was now able to track specific quail cell fates in the developing embryo. When creating embryos of combined quail and chick cells, she could trace the differentiation of separate cell lines throughout the developing organism./nLe Douarin's work on chimeric embryos became increasingly notable, and she was able to gain international funding for her research after being appointed as Director of the C.N.R.S. Institute of Embryology. Building on her past experimentation, she began to research the developmental mechanism of the neural crest of avian embryos. In a 1980 publication, Le Douarin detailed her process of inserting totipotent quail nerve cells into the neural primordium of a chick. Her Feulgen stain technique allowed for the creation of a fate map detailing the migration of the quail-derived neural crest cells. This research spurred Le Douarin to publish her first book, The Neural Crest, in 1982. In the following years, she would gain membership to the French Academy of Science, and receive the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology for her work with avian chimeras. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Le Douarin would be admitted to multiple highly regarded scientific societies and received many additional awards in her field, including the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, and the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize./nLe Douarin was Director of the Institute of Embryology at the C.N.R.S., replacing her mentor Etienne Wolf.

During his first four years of graduate school, Nusinow attempted to create a quadruple knock-in (KI) mouse that would purify the protein RNA complex of X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), which plays a key role in dosage compensation in female mammals. The method was unsuccessful, so Nusinow shifted his focus on the mammalian histone variant macroH2A. He discovered that the inhibition of PARP1 by macro-H2A1 contributed to X chromosome inactivation.[3] While in graduate school, he attended a seminar by Roger Hangarter who showed circadian regulated movements in sunflowers.[4] This seminar inspired Nusinow to switch and study circadian rhythms in plants. In 2007, he became a researcher at the Scripps Institute with Steve Kay, and continued with the lab when it moved to University of California San Diego (UCSD) for five additional years.[5] While in Kay's lab, he was influenced by fellow researcher Takato Imaizumi to study ELF3 in plants. Nusinow then became a principal investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and an adjunct professor at Washington University in St. Louis in 2012.[6] He now studies to understand how the circadian clock is integrated with environmental signals to control growth, development, and physiology in order to improve the productivity in plants./nIn 2007, Sawa, Nusinow, Kay, and Imaizumi identified how Arabidopsis proteins FKF1 (Flavin-binding, Kelch repeat, F-box 1) and GI (Gigantea) helped regulate flowering photoperiods in Arabidopsis.[7] Their interest in these proteins arose when they saw FKF1 and GI had displayed similar peak times of expression during the long days.[7] Subsequently, they isolated Arabidopsis proteins FKF1 and GI in a test tube and showed that blue light induced in vitro formation of FKF1 and GI complex.[7] The blue light was absorbed by the LOV (Light, Oxygen, or Voltage) domain on the FKF1 protein, and the N terminus of the GI protein was sufficient to interact with FKF1.[7] To test whether the proteins interacted in vivo, they did a series of transgenic experiments on Arabidopsis. A two-hybrid screening\u00a0method with HA (haemagglutinin)-tagged FKF1 and tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged GI system was used to show that GI and FKF1 formed a complex in vivo.[7] Additionally, they saw that this complex positively regulated daytime transcription of constans (CO), a gene promoting flowering in plants.[7] Their results led to a model of how FKF1 and GI complex regulated flowering in response to photoperiods in Arabidopsis./nNusinow continued working with Arabidopsis and in 2011 as part of a team, he published a paper in the journal Nature where he identified proteins Early Flowering 4 (ELF4), Early Flowering 3 (ELF3), and gene lux arrhythmo (LUX) form a multi-protein clock complex that directly regulated growth in Arabidopsis.[8][9]  Proteins ELF3 and ELF4 contain basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) structural motif that binds the proteins to DNA.[8] Nusinow named the ELF4, ELF3, and LUX complex \u201cevening complex (EC)\u201d after identifying the complex peaked at dusk.[8] Through a series of transgenic experiments, he showed that ELF4, ELF3, and LUX were required for proper expression of Phytochrome interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) and phytochrome interacting factor 5 (PIF5), two transcription factors critical for regulating hypocotyl  growth Arabidopsis seedlings.[8]/nIn 2015 through 2016, Nusinow and his colleagues identified a protein that was repeatedly associated with the evening complex in AP-MS analysis of the plant circadian clock. Nusinow found that the protein, which he named PCH1 (Photoperiodic Control of Hypocotyl), was an important regulator for the growth of the hypocotyl (the stem of a seedling) during germination. PCH1 reduces hypocotyl growth during long nights by preferentially binding and stabilizing the active form of phytochrome B (phyB), prolonging its activity.[10] PhyB in turn forms photobodies in the nucleus, where it interacts with molecules of the evening complex (EC) to cause downstream inhibition of hypocotyl growth./nThe discovery and characterization of PCH1 is especially notable because phyB is normally active only during the day. By stabilizing phyB and maintaining its signaling well into the night, PCH1 allows plant cells to \u201cremember\u201d past illumination and adjust growth programs accordingly.[citation needed]/nNusinow currently resides in St. Louis with his wife and two children.", "40764856": "Stylianos E.

He is best known for creating the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants for Nickelodeon in 1999\u00a0\u2013 serving as the showrunner for its first three seasons, and again from season nine until his death\u00a0\u2013 which has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series. He also performed the original voice of Patchy's pet parrot Potty the Parrot from the show./nBorn in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote and illustrated The Intertidal Zone, an informative picture book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. In 1989, two years after leaving teaching, he enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (1993\u20131996) after his success with The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), short films that he made while studying animation./nIn 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants, which has aired continuously since 1999. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. He then resigned as showrunner, but continued to receive executive producer credit in subsequent seasons even after his death. He later resumed making short films with Hollywood Blvd., USA (2013). He co-wrote the story for the second film adaptation of the series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015), and received posthumous executive producer credit for the third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020)./nBesides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg also received other recognition, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts in elevating marine life awareness and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Hillenburg announced he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017 but stated he would continue working on SpongeBob for as long as possible. He died from the disease on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57./nStephen McDannell Hillenburg[1] was born on August\u00a021, 1961 at Fort Sill,[2][3][4][5] a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly N. Hillenburg Jr. (1936\u20132006),[6] worked for the U.S. military.[7] His mother, Nancy (n\u00e9e Dufour),[6] taught visually impaired students.[2][3][4] When he was a year old,[7] the family moved to Orange County, California,[2][4] where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry.[7] His younger brother, Bryan,[6] eventually became a draftsman/designer as well.[4]/nWhen an interviewer asked Hillenburg to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was \"probably well-meaning and naive like all kids.\"[8][9] His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by Jacques Cousteau, a French oceanographer, made a strong impression on him.[4][7][10] Hillenburg said that Cousteau \"provided a view into that world\", which he had not known existed.[7] He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that \"should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad.\"[9]/nHillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age.[7][11] His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting \"a bunch of army men\u00a0... kissing and hugging instead of fighting\", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it.[7] \"Of course, this is 1970\u00a0... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...\u00a0I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that'\", Hillenburg elaborated.[7] It was then when he knew he \"had some [creative] skill\".[7] He asserted that his artistry came from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was \"really, really gifted\" and a \"great painter\".[7] In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tourn\u00e9e of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was \"knocked out\" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). \"That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,\" he recounted.[12]/n\"I've always been interested in art and making things, but I chose not to go to art school because I thought I needed to do something else. Art was a tough way to make a living. I've always done both. I just kind of figured that the marine biology would be a career and the art would be something I did for my own self-expression.\"/n\u2014\u00a0Stephen Hillenburg[8]/nHe attended Savanna High School in Anaheim,[4][8][13] describing himself as a \"band geek\" who played the trumpet.[7] At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time;[3][4][8] Hillenburg took part in a \"dive program\"[7] at Woods Coves[8] in Laguna Beach,[3][4] as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna.[7] This experience, as well as subsequent dives,[7] reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college:[3][4][7][8][13] \"The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist.\"[11] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise,[7] saying: \"You should just draw fish.\"[7][14] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by \"making weird, little paintings\".[7] During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler[15] at a fast-food seafood restaurant[4] in Maine.[15] (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.[15])/nHillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major.[7] He minored in art,[7] and claimed that \"[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.\"[16] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources.[3][4][13][17] He intended to take a master's degree, but said it would be in art:[7] \"Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.\"[4]/nAfter graduating from college, Hillenburg held various jobs in 1984, including as a park service attendant in Utah and an art director in San Francisco, before landing the job he wanted: teaching children.[7] He hoped to work in a national park on the coast,[11] and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now the Ocean Institute),[11] an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history.[18] Hillenburg was a marine biology teacher there for three years:[3][4][19] \"We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures.\"[8][20] He stayed at the Dana Point Marina[13] and was also a staff artist.[7][15][21] Although \"[i]t was a great experience\" for him,[11] he realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.[19]/nWhile working there, one of the educational directors asked him if he would be interested in creating an educational comic book about the animal life of tidal pools.[7][11][22] He created a comic called The Intertidal Zone, which he used to teach his students.[22] It featured anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters[23]\u00a0\u2013 including \"Bob the Sponge\", the comic's co-host, who resembled a realistic sea sponge, as opposed to his later SpongeBob SquarePants character, a sea sponge whose stylized square shape resembles a kitchen sponge.[24] He tried to get the comic published, but the publishers he approached turned him down.[7][11]/nDuring this time, Hillenburg also started attending animation festivals such as the International Tourn\u00e9e of Animation and Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation, where student films from the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts) were shown.[7][12] He determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field.[7][12] He had planned to take a master's degree in art, but instead of \"going back to school for painting\",[7] he left his job in 1987 to become an animator.[23][24]/nHillenburg enrolled in CalArts' Experimental Animation Program[4][23][24] in 1989.[11] About this decision, he said: \"Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle.\"[25] He studied under Jules Engel,[26][27] the founding director of the program,[27][28] whom he considered his \"Art Dad\" and mentor.[27][29][30] Impressed by The Intertidal Zone, Engel accepted him into the program.[7][24] Hillenburg said, \"[Engel] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [prior experience in] animation really.\"[7] Hillenburg graduated in 1992,[4][8] earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.[4] During his time at CalArts, he briefly drew comics for the surfing magazine KEMA in 1990.[31]/nHillenburg made his first animated works, short films The Green Beret (1991) and Wormholes (1992),[32] while at CalArts.[3][4][5][25] The Green Beret was about a physically challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies.[3][4][5] Wormholes was his seven-minute thesis film,[24][33] about the theory of relativity.[3][4][33] He described the latter as \"a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena\" in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation,[34] which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film.[35] The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship.[34][36] \"It meant a lot,\" he said in 2003. \"They funded one of the projects I'm most proud of, even with SpongeBob. It provided me the opportunity just to make a film that was personal, and what I would call independent, and free of some of the commercial needs.\"[34] Wormholes was shown at several international animation festivals,[25][34] including the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration, the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen,[37] and the Ottawa International Animation Festival,[38] where it won Best Concept.[39] LA Weekly called the film \"road-trippy\" and \"Zap-comical\",[40] while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it \"inventive\".[28]/nHillenburg explained that \"anything goes\" in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ \"an industry style\"; he preferred to traditionally animate his films (where each frame is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons \"by filming piles of sand changing\".[7] He made at least one other short film as an animation student, but its title is unspecified.[12][21]/nHillenburg's first professional job in the animation business was as a director[21][24] on Rocko's Modern Life (1993\u20131996),[3][21][23] Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production.[41] He \"ended up finding work in the industry and got a job\" at the television network after he met the show's creator, Joe Murray,[34] at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival,[12][21] where Wormholes and Murray's My Dog Zero were both in competition.[38] Murray, who was looking for people to direct Rocko's Modern Life at the time,[21] saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series.[7][21][24] He \"[had] friends that [gave him] a hard time about [the offer]. ... but doors opened when [he] stepped into the animation world,\" so he accepted it.[21] He \"was planning on being a starving artist\": \"[I spent] several thousand dollars to make a film and [realized] I may not make it back\u2014I had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film\u00a0... and he took a huge chance,\" Hillenburg related.[12]/nHillenburg worked closely with Murray[42] on Rocko's Modern Life for its whole run on the air.[4] Aside from directing, he also produced, wrote and storyboarded for some episodes, and served as the executive story editor.[3][4] In particular, the third season episode \"Fish-N-Chumps\" was co-written and directed by Hillenburg, and involved Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt going on a fishing trip, oblivious to the fact that a pair of anthropomorphic sea creatures are attempting to catch them from underwater; this would foreshadow his later work with SpongeBob.[24] In 1995,[4][42] during the fourth and final season of Rocko,[43] Hillenburg was promoted to creative director, where he helped oversee pre- and post-production.[3][4][42] Working on the series enabled him to repay his loans.[11] He later related that he \"learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV\" from his stint on Rocko's Modern Life.[44]/nSome evidence shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute.[45] He indicated that children's television series such as The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse (1987\u20131988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986\u20131991) \"sparked something in [him].\" He continued, \"I don't know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [SpongeBob SquarePants] together.\"[21]/nDuring the production of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, he had not even considered creating his own series:[7] \"After watching Joe [Murray] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I would never want to produce a show of my own.\"[42] However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach:[7][24][46] \"For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [my two interests] all came together in [a show]. I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding,\" Hillenburg said in 2002.[4] He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.[42]/n\"It finally dawned on me that if I was going to do my own show, all those things I lectured about and obsessed about would make for an interesting world.\"/n\u2014\u00a0Stephen Hillenburg[43]/nAs he was developing the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges.[3][4][42] It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: \"I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays.\"[42] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, \"something that was fantastic but believable.\"[42] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (1991\u20131995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge:[7] \"I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one.\"[43] In 1994,[15] Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone,[7][15] including Bob the Sponge.[7]/nBob the Sponge is the comic's \"announcer\".[7] He resembles a realistic sea sponge, and at first Hillenburg continued this design[7][21][24][47] because it \"was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher.\"[42] In determining the new character's personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, Pee-wee Herman, Abbott and Costello, and The Three Stooges.[7][21][45][48] While Hillenburg \"retained the idea of a living sea sponge,\"[15] he soon considered giving the character a square shape (like a kitchen sponge), and realized that this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly:[7][21][24] \"[I]t looked so funny. I think as far as cartoon language goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking for\u2014a somewhat nerdy, squeaky clean oddball.\"[42][49] To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had begun with his on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character.[50][51]/nWhile pitching the cartoon to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an \"underwater terrarium with models of the characters\", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman described the setup as \"pretty amazing\".[24] Although Derek Drymon, creative director of SpongeBob SquarePants, described the pitch as stressful, he said it went \"very well\".[24] Nickelodeon approved and gave Hillenburg money to produce the show.[52]/nSpongeBob SquarePants was Nickelodeon's first original Saturday-morning cartoon.[14][53] It first aired as a preview on May 1, 1999,[10][54] and officially premiered on July 17 of the same year.[10][14] Hillenburg noted that the show's premise \"is that innocence prevails\u2014which I don't think it always does in real life.\"[52] It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups.[4][43][52] James Poniewozik of Time magazine described the titular character as \"the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to match\u2014conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him.\"[55] On the other hand, The New York Times critic Joyce Millman said that the show \"is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. ...\u00a0Like Pee-wee's Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet.\"[56]/nSpongeBob SquarePants was an immediate hit.[52] Within its first month on air, it overtook Pok\u00e9mon (1997\u2013) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series.[53] By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television.[13][57][58] Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change increased the number of older viewers significantly.[59] By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49.[59] Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: \"I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience.\"[60] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on to become the longest-running series on Nickelodeon.[61] \"Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...\u00a0I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it,\" Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary.[12] Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks.[62] As of 2015[update], it has generated $25 billion in merchandising revenue.[63]/nIn 2002, Hillenburg halted production of the show after the third season was completed to focus on the making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie which was released in 2004:[64] \"I don't want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [Nickelodeon] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie,\" he noted.[32] He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill.[65] The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface.[66] In 2003, during the production of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel died at the age of 94.[67] Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory.[68] He said that Engel \"truly was the most influential artistic person in [his] life.\"[29][30] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide,[69] and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, \"Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents.\"[70]/n\"It reached to a point where I felt I'd contributed a lot and said what I wanted to say. At that point, the show needed new blood and so I selected Paul [Tibbitt] to produce. I totally trusted him. I always enjoyed the way he captured the SpongeBob character's sense of humor. And as a writer, you have to move on\u2014I'm developing new projects.\"/n\u2014\u00a0Stephen Hillenburg on leaving SpongeBob SquarePants as the showrunner[12]/nAfter completing the film, Hillenburg wanted to end the series \"so [it] wouldn't jump the shark.\"[12][71] \"We're working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [The Ren & Stimpy Show] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now was a good time to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it's good not to go to the point where people don't want to see your show anymore,\" Hillenburg said in 2002.[4] However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: \"The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn't afford not to,\" storyboard director Sam Henderson observed.[71] Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: \"I think [Nickelodeon executives] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality.\"[4] Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner[72] and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role.[12][73][74] Although he no longer had a direct involvement producing SpongeBob SquarePants, he retained his position as an executive producer[45] and maintained an advisory role, reviewing each episode.[72][75] Tibbitt started out as a supervising producer but rose up to executive producer when Hillenburg went into semi-retirement in 2004.[76] While he was on the show, he voiced Potty the Parrot[77] and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording.[78] During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty,[79] while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.[78]/nIn 2014, Tibbitt announced on his Twitter account that Hillenburg would return to the show. However, he did not specify what position the former showrunner would hold.[80] As early as 2012, Hillenburg had already been contributing to another film based on the series,[7] which was first reported in 2011[81] and officially announced the following year,[82] with Tibbitt as director. Tibbitt also wrote the story with Hillenburg,[83][84] who \"[had] been in the studio everyday working with [the crew].\"[84] Besides writing, Hillenburg also executive-produced.[85] He said in 2014: \"Actually when [the film] wraps, I want to get back to the show. ...\u00a0it is getting harder and harder to come up with stories. So Paul [Tibbitt] and I are really going to brainstorm and come up with fresh material.\"[11] Called The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, the second film adaptation was released in 2015[86] to positive critical reception, currently holding a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 80 percent and an average rating of 6.5/10.[87] It earned $323.4 million worldwide,[88] becoming the second highest-grossing film based on an animated television show, behind The Simpsons Movie (2007).[89]/n/nIn 1998,[90] Hillenburg formed United Plankton Pictures Inc., a television and film production company, which produces SpongeBob SquarePants and related media. From 2011 to 2018, the company published SpongeBob Comics, a comic-book series based on the cartoon.[91][92] Hillenburg announced the venture in a 2011 press release, where he said, \"I'm hoping that fans will enjoy finally having a SpongeBob comic book from me.\"[91][92] Various cartoonists, including James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabot, have contributed to issues of the comic.[91][92]/nAccording to Jeff Lenburg, in his book Who's Who in Animated Cartoons, Hillenburg was co-writing and co-directing a second animated feature film based on Rob Zombie's comic-book series, The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, which was slated for a 2006 release.[93] He helped to write Diggs Tailwagger, a 2007 pilot by Derek Drymon.[94][95] Hillenburg stated in 2009 that he was developing two other television projects that he did not want to discuss.[12][96]/nIn 2010,[7] he began working on Hollywood Blvd., USA,[16] a new short film for animation festivals.[7] In making the two-minute film,[11] he videotaped people walking and animated them in walk cycles.[7][11] Hillenburg said in 2012, \"I hope to get [the film] done. It takes forever.\" He was aiming to finish it that fall.[7] In 2013,[97] three years after production began, Hollywood Blvd., USA was released to festivals.[11] Hillenburg characterized it as a \"personal film\" and said that \"it's not a narrative. It's just really about people in our town.\"[7]/nIn 1998, Hillenburg married Karen Jean Umland,[98][99] a Southern Californian chef[100] who teaches at the New School of Cooking in Culver City.[5][32][101][102] He deemed her the funniest person he knew,[32] and the character of Karen Plankton was named after her.[103] Also in 1998, their son was born.[5][32] Hillenburg formerly resided in Hollywood[32][60] and Pasadena,[6][19] and lived with his family in San Marino, California[104][105] until his death.[106] His hobbies included surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming, and performing \"noisy rock music\" on his guitar.[4][5][32] He jammed with his son, who is a drummer, which Hillenburg called \"a great way to bond with each other.\"[107] He also enjoyed birdwatching at home,[107] but said that he was always \"an ocean freak\".[9]/nHe was known informally as \"Steve\" among his family, friends, and fans.[101] According to his colleagues, he was \"a perfectionist workaholic\",[19] and was also known for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg was \"very shy\". She said: \"He doesn't want people to know about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our corporate integrity.\"[19] Hillenburg said about himself: \"I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It's not that I don't like people, but I like having my privacy.\"[64]/nHillenburg's graphic influences were George Herriman, E. C. Segar, Bill Watterson, Dr. Seuss, Max Fleischer, Chuck Jones, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Jay Ward, Jules Engel, Matt Groening, Joe Murray and John Kricfalusi;[108] the latter was inspired to have many close-up shots in several SpongeBob episodes to have grotesque and extremely detailed drawings. He had also cited Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, W.C. Fields, Jerry Lewis, Jacques Cousteau, Jim Henson's The Muppets and Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman./nHillenburg, with his wife Karen endowed numerous projects and organizations through the United Plankton Charitable Trust,[105][109] which they established in 2005,[110] naming after Hillenburg's United Plankton Pictures. It supports areas of their personal interest,[109] giving under $500,000 annually as of 2017[update].[105][109] Grantees include large, established arts-related organizations such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound,[105] in which Karen is co-chair.[100] Health accounts for most of their grantmaking;[105] they had gifted Planned Parenthood (where Karen has been on the board of directors as of 2014[update][111]) and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, among other national health organizations.[105]/nIn education, they have donated to schools, including the Polytechnic School in Pasadena (which their son attended), CalArts, and Humboldt State University.[109] Donations to the latter helped fund the HSU Marine Lab[16] and the Stephen Hillenburg Marine Science Research Award Endowment, which the couple created in 2018 to support the university's marine-science research students.[112] The previous year, the Princess Grace Foundation introduced the Stephen Hillenburg Animation Scholarship, an annual grant from the Hillenburgs to emerging animators.[113]/nHillenburg disclosed to Variety magazine in March 2017 that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), though he continued to work on SpongeBob SquarePants for as long as he was able. He added: \"My family and I are grateful for the outpouring of love and support. We ask that our sincere request for privacy be honored during this time.\" Hillenburg was in the early stages of the disease at the time, according to a source close to him.[114] During his last days as executive producer, he had difficulty speaking, and it ultimately got to the point where he stopped going to his office due to the progression of the illness.[115]/nHillenburg died on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57.[101] According to his death certificate, he died at his home in San Marino, California. It also states that his body was cremated, and that his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California the next day.[116]/nDuring the halftime show for Super Bowl LIII, the performing band Maroon 5 arranged to use a clip from the SpongeBob episode \"Band Geeks\" (which uses the song \"Sweet Victory\" as part of a spoof of a football halftime show) during their show as a means to pay tribute to Hillenburg.[117] A full clip of the \"Sweet Victory\" song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium, but not during the game, which angered many fans.[118] The song was later included in a promo for ViacomCBS's Paramount+ streaming service during Super Bowl LV.[119]/nThe TV special SpongeBob's Big Birthday Blowout and the theatrical film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run which he worked on, are dedicated to his memory./nIn 2019, a spin-off of SpongeBob SquarePants, Kamp Koral, began production, featuring younger versions of the characters attending summer camp. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt stated that Hillenburg would have disliked the idea; he commented, \"Steve [Hillenburg] would always say to me, 'You know, one of these days, they're going to want to make SpongeBob Babies. That's when I'm out of here.'\"[115] Tibbitt also released a statement stating, \"I do not mean any disrespect to my colleagues who are working on this show ... [but] they all know full well Steve would have hated this.\"[120] The concept of Kamp Koral came from a season 12 meeting in October 2018, a month before Hillenburg died.[121] Hillenburg is credited as the creator of Kamp Koral, and is credited on other spin-offs as the characters' creator.[122][123]/nIn 1992, one of Hillenburg's early works, Wormholes, won for Best Concept at the Ottawa International Animation Festival.[39] For SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards, winning in the categories of Outstanding Special Class Animated Program and Outstanding Sound Editing \u2013 Animation in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The show has also received several other awards and nominations, including 17 Annie Award nominations, winning six times, as well as winning two British Academy Children's Awards, out of four nominations. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants won its first TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming nomination./nIn 2001, Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit organization, honored Hillenburg with its Walk the Talk award.[4][124] He was recognized for raising public awareness of marine life[4] through SpongeBob SquarePants.[124] The following year, Hillenburg was given the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society,[4][125] and the Princess Grace Statue Award from the Princess Grace Foundation.[4][36] In 2018, Hillenburg received the Winsor McCay Award at the 45th Annie Awards,[126] and a special recognition at the 45th Daytime Emmy Awards \"for his contribution and impact made in the animation field and within the broadcast industry.\"[127]/nThe marine demosponge species Clathria hillenburgi, known from mangrove habitats off the coast of Para\u00edba, Brazil, was named in honor of Stephen Hillenburg.[128][129]/nOn November 18, 2021, Hillenburg was honored with a bench and historical plaque at his alma mater Savannah High School in Anaheim, California. The project was a collaboration between the Hillenburg family, Anaheim Historical Society, and YouTube personality Griffin Hansen.[130] Karen Hillenburg specifically chose a bright yellow bench that \"she thought perfectly captured her husband's warmth and goofiness\".[131] The memorial was dedicated one day before Savanna High School's 60th anniversary at a school-wide assembly hosted by Hansen and principal Michael Pooley. The event was attended by Karen and Clay Hillenburg, as well as members of SpongeBob SquarePants' cast and crew including Tom Kenny, Jill Talley, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Marc Ceccarelli, and Derek Drymon.", "26183101": "Maria Ragland Davis (June 1, 1959 \u2013 February 12, 2010) was an American biologist and educator.

Recent activities include mathematical finance[17] and climate change.[18]/nDeLisi was born in the Bronx, graduated from City College of New York (CCNY) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history (1963), and received his Ph.D. in physics (1965 -1969) from New York University (NYU).[19]/nIn 1969, he joined Donald Crothers\u2019 laboratory as a National Institutes of Health (NIH) postdoctoral research fellow in the department of chemistry at Yale University. In 1972, he was appointed a theoretical division staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with George Bell, a theoretical physicist who a few years earlier had begun pioneering research in mathematical immunology. DeLisi was subsequently appointed senior scientist (1975\u20131982) at the National Cancer Institute, NIH, and founding head of the Section on Theoretical Immunology (1982\u20131985), where he and his collaborators established one of the earliest protein and DNA sequence databases fully integrated with machine learning programs for functional inference[13] and developed a number of analytical methods that proved useful in cell biology.[11][20][14]/nIn 1986, as director of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Health and Environmental Research Programs, DeLisi and his advisors proposed the Human Genome Project to the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Congress. The proposal created much controversy but received strong endorsement from Alvin Trivelpiece, who was chief of DOE's Office of Science, and William Flynn Martin, the Deputy Secretary of Energy. It was included in President Ronald Reagan's fiscal year 1987 budget submission to the Congress and was approved subsequently by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the latter with the essential endorsement of Senator Pete Domenici (R, NM). \nDuring the spring of 1987, shortly before leaving the DOE, DeLisi established an ethical studies component of the Project.[21] The goal was to reserve 3-5% of the funding for scholars of the humanities and social sciences to develop a system of ethics that would inform decisions about the development and deployment of the radically new technologies destined to emerge from the completion of the Project./nIn addition to the medical and scientific advances engendered by the Human Genome Project, it and its progeny have had a profound effect on research of cell biology. Computer scientists, in particular, transformed the topic and created a record of discovery destined to provide much material for studying the sociology of late 20th and early 21st century science. Computational and mathematical methods are now considered as important to progress in cell biology, a change that is forcing even the most conservative universities to develop new methods of biological education.[22] The Human Genome Project enabled a rapid transformation of DOE's health, environmental and energy programs, increasing considerably the importance of the Office of Health and Environmental Research./nCommemorating the significance of the Human Genome Project, the DOE installed a bronze plaque outside room F-202 at its Germantown, Maryland facility.

She taught women's studies courses and had a particular interest in research aimed at recovering the history of nineteenth-century women scientists. Born in the Philippines to a Northern Irish nurse and an American civil servant, she grew up in Carroll, Ohio. After earning bachelor's, master's, and PhD degrees from Ohio State University, she became a teacher with an interest in genetics. In the 1940s, she worked with her husband on plant genetics at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. After he was killed in action during World War II, she returned to Ohio and conducted studies on penicillin at the Ohio State Research Foundation./nAfter a second marriage to Sheldon C. Reed, the couple became research partners, first at Harvard University and from 1947 at the Dight Institute for Human Genetics at the University of Minnesota. As her husband directed the institute which had rules against nepotism, although she had a work station at the institute, Reed was not listed as staff until the 1970s. She was one of the few women who performed pioneering work in genetics. Her studies first focused on species evolution, for which she undertook statistical analysis and comparison of minute differences in the Drosophila genus of flies. Later, as the couple's interest shifted to human genetics, the Reeds published works on congenital disorders and diseases. They were in favor of genetic counseling based on an understanding of how such disorders occurred, especially in connection with family planning./nIn addition to her genetic work, Reed wrote about sexism toward women scientists.  An active women's rights advocate, she not only strove to mentor other women in the profession, but to recover the histories of women scientists. Her book American Women in Science before the Civil War (1992), reclaimed the contributions and biographies of twenty-two women who published in science before the American Civil War. Among them were Eunice Newton Foote and Mary Amelia Swift. Reed's own legacy was obscured by her husband's prominence, until her contributions were recovered by Marta Velasco Mart\u00edn in 2020./nElizabeth Cleland Wagner was born on August 27, 1912, in Baguio, on the island of Luzon, in the Philippines to Catherine (n\u00e9e Cleland) and John O. Wagner.[1][2][3] Her mother was from Killyleagh, Northern Ireland, but was working as a nurse and nurse trainer in the Philippines when she met her husband.[1][4] Her father served in the Spanish-American War and afterwards worked in various civil service positions during the period when the Philippines was an unincorporated territory of the United States, including as a court interpreter and secretary to the Governor of the Mountain Province on Luzon.[1][5] Her only sibling died in infancy.[5] In 1917, the family returned to Wagner's home state of Ohio and settled in Fairfield County, where her father operated a fruit orchard.[1]/nWagner grew up near Carroll, Ohio, and graduated from Canal Winchester High School.[6] From 1930, she furthered her studies at Ohio State University, majoring in botany.[5][6] She excelled in her studies and in her second year had the highest marks in her class.[7] She graduated with honors and was elected to the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa, in 1933.[8] With support from the Ohio State Graduate School, Wagner earned her master's degree in 1934 and a PhD in 1936.[5][9][10] After graduation, she did further studies in 1937 in plant research, with funding provided by the Sherwin-Williams Paint Company.[3][5] Because of biases against women, Wagner was told she should publish her research using only her initials. Thus, her thesis, Effects of Certain Insecticides and Inert Materials upon the Transpiration Rate of Bean Plants, published in 1939, appeared in the name of E. C. Wagner.[5]/nAfter completing her studies, Wagner was hired as a biology and chemistry instructor at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, North Carolina.[3][11] In 1938, she was promoted to head the school's biology department and worked there until her marriage in 1940.[12][11] Wagner married James O. Beasley, a pioneering plant geneticist, on September 17, 1940. After their marriage, the couple moved to College Station, Texas, where both were employed at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station.[3][13] Beasley was drafted to fight in World War II in 1942 shortly after Wagner published her second paper and just prior to the birth of their son John in April.[14] Soon after, Beasley went missing in action and Wagner contacted his friend, Sheldon C. Reed, to see if he had any information.[15] She returned to Ohio with their son and lived with her parents during this time, while working on penicillin studies at the Ohio State Research Foundation.[15][16] Wagner was notified in November 1943, that Beasley had been in killed in action, in September 1943 in Italy.[16] He was subsequently awarded a Purple Heart.[17]/nIn 1944, Wagner took a post at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, as an assistant professor in plant sciences. In 1945, she relocated to Delaware, Ohio, and taught botany at  Ohio Wesleyan University.[15] On August 20, 1946, she and Sheldon Reed, who had remained in touch, married. He was at the time an assistant professor at Harvard University, teaching biology.[18] After their marriage, the couple lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and both worked at Harvard.[15][18] They began collaborating on research at that time and thereafter jointly published works. Their first project concerned the speciation of flies, which was published as Morphological Differences and Problems of Speciation in Drosophila in March 1948. Reed gave birth to their daughter, Catherine, that same month.[15]  By the time the paper was published, the family had moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Sheldon had become the director of the Dight Institute for Human Genetics at the University of Minnesota in 1947.[15][19]/nAlthough Reed had a desk at the Dight Institute from 1947 to 1966, she never held an academic position with the institute because of nepotism rules. Her nominal tie was to the University of Minnesota.[20] She nevertheless continued to work with Sheldon and publish works on genetics. Their next two papers, Natural Selection in Laboratory Populations of Drosophila (1948) and Natural Selection in Laboratory Populations of Drosophila II: Competition between a White Eye Gene and Its Wild Type Allele (1950), focused on Drosophila melanogaster and natural selection.[21] These studies were important in the development of new theoretical and methodological approaches, using statistical analysis and comparison of minute differences, to studying the process of speciation. As a pioneer in the work on Drosophila genetics, Reed was one of the women who contributed to establishing and standardizing processes to study species evolution.[22]/nFrom 1950, the Reeds changed from studying flies to human genetics and published works together on intellectual disability. In June 1951, their son William was born.[20] Many of their works, like a 1958 follow-up study of former residents from the turn-of-the-century at the Minnesota Experimental School for the Feeble Minded in Faribault, and a 1962 study on intelligence, focused on families and attempted to determine whether certain traits were genetic.[23][24] They became proponents of genetic counseling, studying parental genes to determine the probable source of children's congenital disorders or diseases, in an effort to mitigate and understand how they occurred.[25][26] Their best known joint book, which gave Reed lead author position, was Mental Retardation: A Family Study, published in 1965.[20]/nFrom 1950, Reed was interested in writing about women and studying sexism in science. Having been a member of Sigma Delta Epsilon, an organization dedicated to fostering women in their scientific endeavors, she recognized that issues of self-esteem, family obligations, and sexual discrimination they faced were largely responsible for women leaving the profession. That year, she published Productivity and Attitudes of Seventy Scientific Women,[27][Notes 1] which analyzed the impact of marriage and childbirth on scientific careers. She noted that of the women in her sample four-fifths regardless of marital status indicated working was a necessity for financial reasons. She concluded that in her study group marriage and children were the primary reason women abandoned scientific careers. Aware of the difficulties, Reed tried to encourage members of Sigma Delta Epsilon to continue working and to know their rights.[27] She was a committed women's rights activist, supporter of the National Abortion Rights Action League, and served on the board of Planned Parenthood.[2][28]/nThe push of activists in the Women's Liberation Movement in the 1970s brought about the advent of women's studies courses. A central role of the new field was to recover the histories of women's participation and contributions to society. In 1992, Reed published American Women in Science before the Civil War, which recovered the histories of twenty-two American women scientists who had published prior to the American Civil War.[29][30][Notes 2] The book, along with Ladies in the Laboratory by Mary R. S. Creese, was acknowledged by Tina Gianquitto, a professor at the Colorado School of Mines, whose work focuses in on nineteenth-century women scientists, as being one of two sources that gave extensive historical and biographical information on women scientists of that era.[32][33] Historian William P. Palmer noted in 2011 that Reed had been \"the most thorough biographer of Mary Amelia Swift\".[34] In a different chapter of the book, about Eunice Newton Foote, Reed wrote that Foote's experiments confirmed that when subjected to sunlight, carbon dioxide became warmer than air \"thereby demonstrating what we call the greenhouse effect today\".[35][Notes 3]/nIn 1966, Reed was officially hired by the University of Minnesota to develop the Minnesota Mathematics and Science Teaching project, known as Minnemast. The program was funded by the National Science Foundation and aimed to focus on better science and math education for kindergarten and primary school children. Reed worked on the project through 1970.[42] The project developed twenty-nine teaching plans, six of which were created by Reed.[30] She was still working at the Dight Institute and was part of the staff in the 1970s, as well as serving as co-director of research for the Minnesota Genetics League.[25][43] She taught courses at the University of Minnesota and gave courses on women's contributions throughout history at the university's Continuing Education and Extension Department.[44][45]/nReed died on July 14, 1996, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[2] Her legacy in genetics was obscured and according to scholar Marta Velasco Mart\u00edn, the academic record omitted the involvement of Reed and other women scientists from the historic record of early genetic research. Reed's work was hidden behind that of her more prominent husband, although he acknowledged their partnership.[46][47] This same fate befell women scientists like Foote, whose biography was \"recovered\" by Reed.[29][48] Foote had told Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1868 that women's work was often claimed by men for self-serving reasons.[49] Reed's legacy, along with that of Natasha Sivertzeva-Dobzhansk and  Mar\u00eda Moncl\u00fas, was recovered in the paper Women and Partnership Genealogies in Drosophila Population Genetics, written by Velasco Mart\u00edn in 2020, to confirm that women were pioneers in genetics, although leading historians tended to ignore their contributions.[50] On 22 April 2023, The New York Times feature \"Overlooked No More\" honored Reed.[51]", "18974154": "Bruce Edwards Ivins (/\u02c8a\u026av\u026anz/; April 22, 1946\u00a0\u2013 July 29, 2008)[1] was an American microbiologist, vaccinologist,[1] senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, Maryland, and the person suspected by the FBI of the 2001 anthrax attacks.[2] Ivins died on July 29, 2008, of an overdose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) in a suicide after learning that criminal charges were likely to be filed against him by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for an alleged criminal connection to the attacks.[3][4][5]/nAt a news conference at the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) on August 6, 2008 (eight days after Ivins' self-inflicted death), FBI and DOJ officials formally announced that the Government had concluded that Ivins was likely solely responsible for the deaths of five persons, and for the injury of dozens of others, resulting from the September\u2013October 2001 mailings to members of Congress and to members of the media, of several anonymous letters which contained Bacillus anthracis, commonly referred to as anthrax.[6][7] On February 19, 2010, the FBI released a 92-page summary of evidence against Ivins and announced that it had concluded its investigation.[8][9] The FBI conclusions have been contested by many, including senior microbiologists, the widow of one of the victims,[10] and several prominent American politicians. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who was among the targets in the attack, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ), and Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY)[11][12][13] all argued that Ivins was not solely responsible for the attacks. No formal charges were ever filed against Ivins for the crime, and no direct evidence of his involvement has been uncovered.[11]/nThe FBI subsequently requested a panel from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review its scientific work on the case.[14] On May 15, 2011, the panel released its findings, which \"conclude[d] that the bureau overstated the strength of genetic analysis linking the mailed anthrax to a supply kept by Bruce E. Ivins.\"[11][15] The NAS committee stated that its primary finding was that \"it is not possible to reach a definitive conclusion about the origins of the B. anthracis in the mailings based on the available scientific evidence alone.\"[12][13][16]/nBruce Ivins was born and spent his youth in Lebanon, Ohio, about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northeast of Cincinnati.[17] His parents were Thomas Randall Ivins and Mary Johnson (n\u00e9e Knight) Ivins, and he was the youngest of three brothers.[1] Ivins' father, a pharmacist, owned a drugstore and was active in the local Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce. The family went regularly to Lebanon Presbyterian Church, although Ivins was later a Catholic parishioner.[18] According to C.W. Ivins, one of Ivins' older brothers, their mother Mary was violent and physically abusive to all three children. When she discovered she was pregnant with Bruce, a pregnancy that was unplanned and unwanted, she repeatedly tried to abort the child by throwing herself down a set of stairs. Ivins would eventually hear the story of his mother's attempt to abort him.[17]/nAvidly interested in science, Ivins was an active participant in extracurricular activities in high school, including the National Honor Society, science fairs, the current events club, and the scholarship team all four years. He ran on the track and cross-country teams, worked on the yearbook and school newspaper, and was in the school choir and junior and senior class plays.[18]/nIn December 1975, Ivins married nursing student Mary Diane Betsch (known as Diane), to whom he remained married until his death.[1][19] The couple had two children.[1][18][20] Diane Ivins was a homemaker and full time parent who also ran a daycare center out of the family's home.[21] His wife, children, and brothers were all still alive at the time of his death; his parents were deceased.[1]/nIvins graduated with honors from the University of Cincinnati (UC) with a B.S. degree in 1968, an M.S. degree in 1971, and a Ph.D. degree in 1976, all in microbiology.[2] Ivins conducted his Ph.D. research under the supervision of Dr. Peter\u00a0F. Bonventre. His dissertation focused on different aspects of toxicity in disease-causing bacteria.[18]/nIvins was a scientist for 36 years[1] and senior biodefense researcher at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland for 18 years.[2] After conducting research on Legionella and cholera, in 1979, Ivins turned his attention to anthrax after the anthrax outbreak in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk (now known as Yekaterinburg), which killed at least 105 after an accidental release at a military facility.[20]/nIvins had published at least 44 scientific papers dating back to May 18, 1969.[22][23] His earliest known published work pertained to the response of peritoneal macrophages, a type of white blood cell, to infection by Chlamydia psittaci, an infectious bacterium that can be transmitted from animals to humans.[24][25] Ivins often cited the 2001 anthrax attacks in his papers to bolster the significance of his research in years subsequent to the attacks.[26] In a 2006 paper published in the prestigious journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he wrote with his co-authors/nShortening the duration of antibiotic postexposure prophylaxis in a bioterrorism event involving B. anthracis by adding postexposure vaccination could greatly alleviate problems of noncompliance and side effects associated with prolonged antibiotic therapy. The value of adding vaccination to postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered in planning the public health response to bioterrorism events involving inhalational anthrax.[26]/nIvins was a co-inventor on two United States patents for anthrax vaccine technology, U.S. Patent 6,316,006 and U.S. Patent 6,387,665. Both of these patents are owned by his employer at the time, the United States Army. On March 14, 2003, Ivins and two of his colleagues at USAMRIID received the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service\u00a0\u2014 the highest award given to Defense Department civilian employees \u2014 for helping solve technical problems in the manufacture of anthrax vaccines.[27]/nThe 2001 anthrax attacks involved the mailing of several letters proclaiming, \"Death to America\u00a0... Death to Israel\u00a0... Allah is Great\",[28] and contaminated with anthrax, to the offices of U.S. Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, as well as to the offices of ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, the New York Post, and the National Enquirer.[29][30]/nIvins became involved in the investigation of the anthrax attacks because he was regarded as a skilled microbiologist.[2] Starting in mid-October, he and his colleagues worked long hours testing samples to distinguish real anthrax letters from the numerous hoaxes that were sent out at this time.[31] Ivins also helped the FBI analyze the powdery material recovered from one of the anthrax-tainted envelopes sent to a U.S. senator's office in Washington, D.C.[2]/nResults of the investigation were initially distributed to the public via ABC News, claiming \"four well placed sources\" had confirmed that \"trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite\" were found in the anthrax samples, and that this was the chemical signature of Iraqi-made anthrax.[28] However, it was later confirmed that no bentonite was ever found in the anthrax samples.[28] While it is presumed that Ivins was one of ABC News' four sources, ABC refused to reveal their identities, which has contributed to a mystery surrounding Ivins' role in the initial investigation and its widely reported findings.[28]/nIn 2002, an investigation was carried out as a result of an incident at Fort Detrick where anthrax spores had escaped carefully guarded rooms into the building's unprotected areas.[32] The incident called into question the ability of USAMRIID to keep its deadly agents within laboratory walls seven months after the anthrax mailings./nA coworker reportedly told Ivins that she was concerned she was exposed to anthrax spores when handling an anthrax-contaminated letter. Ivins tested the technician's desk area that December and found growth that had the hallmarks of anthrax. He decontaminated her desk, computer, keypad and monitor, but did not notify his superiors.[32]/nFor six years, the FBI focused its investigation on Steven Hatfill, considering him to be the chief suspect in the attacks. In March 2008, however, authorities exonerated Hatfill and settled a lawsuit he initiated for $5.8 million.[33] According to ABC News, some in the FBI considered Ivins a suspect as early as 2002.[34] FBI Director Robert Mueller changed leadership of the investigation in late 2006, and at that time Ivins became the main focus of the investigation.[2]/nAfter Hatfill was no longer considered a suspect, Ivins began \"showing signs of serious strain\".[35] As a result of his changed behavior, he lost access to sensitive areas at his job. Ivins began being treated for depression and expressed some suicidal thoughts.[2] On March 19, 2008, police found Ivins unconscious at his home in Frederick and sent him to the hospital.[18]/nIn June 2008, Ivins was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. The FBI said that during a June 5 group therapy session there, he had a conversation with a witness, during which he made a series of statements about the anthrax mailings that the FBI said could best be characterized as \"non-denial denials\".[36] When asked about the anthrax attacks and whether he could have had anything to do with them, the FBI said that Ivins admitted he suffered from loss of memory, stating that he would wake up dressed and wonder if he had gone out during the night. His responses allegedly included the following:/nLate in July 2008, investigators informed Ivins of his impending prosecution for alleged involvement in the 2001 anthrax attacks that Ivins himself had previously assisted authorities in investigating. It was reported that the death penalty would have been sought in the case.[37] Ivins maintained his security clearance until July 10; he had been publicly critical of the laboratory's security procedures for several years.[38]/nW. Russell Byrne, a colleague who worked in the bacteriology division of the Fort Detrick research facility, said FBI agents \"hounded\" Ivins by twice raiding his home and that Ivins had been hospitalized for depression earlier in the month.[39] According to Byrne and local police, Ivins had been removed from his workplace out of fears that he might harm himself or others. \"I think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process\", Byrne said.[40] \"There are people who you just know are ticking bombs\", Byrne said. \"He was not one of them.\"[41] However, Tom Ivins, who last spoke to his brother in 1985, said, \"It makes sense\u00a0... he considered himself like a god.\"[40]/nThe Los Angeles Times said that Ivins stood to profit from the attacks because he was a co-inventor on two patents for a genetically-engineered anthrax vaccine. San Francisco-area biotechnology company VaxGen licensed the vaccine and won a federal contract valued at $877.5 million to provide the vaccine under the Project Bioshield Act.[42] However,anti-vaccine activist Meryl Nass expressed skepticism about this purported motive: \"Historically, government employees do not receive these royalties: the government does.\"[43]/nOn August 6, 2008, eight days after Ivins' self-inflicted death, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Taylor officially made a statement that Ivins was the \"sole culprit\" in the 2001 anthrax attacks.[44] Taylor stated that Ivins had submitted false anthrax evidence to throw investigators off his trail, was unable to adequately explain his late laboratory working hours around the time of the attacks, tried to frame his co-workers, had immunized himself against anthrax in early September 2001, was one of more than 100 people with access to the same strain of anthrax used in the killings, and had used similar language in an email to that in one of the anthrax mailings.[45] Ivins was also reportedly upset that the anthrax vaccine that he had spent years helping develop was being pulled from the market.[46]/nOn the morning of July 27, 2008, Ivins was again found unconscious at his home. He was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital and died on July 29 from what was then called an overdose of Tylenol with codeine,[47] an apparent suicide. No autopsy was ordered following his death because, according to an officer in the local police department, the state medical examiner \"determined that an autopsy wouldn't be necessary\" based on laboratory test results of blood taken from the body.[48] A summary of the police report of his death, released in 2009, lists the cause of death as liver and kidney failure, citing his purchase of two bottles of Tylenol PM (containing diphenhydramine), contradicting earlier reports of Tylenol with codeine.[49] His family declined to put him on the liver transplant list, and he was removed from life support.[49]/nThe FBI declined to comment on the situation.[50] Ivins' attorney released a statement saying that Ivins had co-operated with the FBI's six-year investigation and was innocent.[51]/nPaul Kemp, Ivins' attorney, stated that the government's case against Ivins was \"not convincing.\" Justice Department official Dean Boyd stated that Ivins mailed anthrax to NBC in retaliation for an investigation of Ivins' laboratory's work on anthrax conducted by Gary Matsumoto, a former NBC News journalist. At the time, however, Matsumoto was working for ABC, not NBC. Also, Ivins passed a lie detector test in which he was questioned about his possible participation in the anthrax attacks. Boyd responded by saying that the FBI now believes that Ivins used countermeasures to deceive the polygraph examiners. \"There are clearly a lot of unanswered questions,\" said Senator Chuck Grassley, who called for a congressional investigation into the allegations that Ivins was the anthrax killer.[52]/nThose who argue for Ivins' innocence say that the anthrax used in the attacks was too sophisticated to be produced by a lone researcher without relevant training. Richard O. Spertzel, a microbiologist who led the United Nations' biological weapons inspections of Iraq, wrote that the anthrax used could not have come from the lab where Ivins worked.[53] \"In my opinion, there are maybe four or five people in the whole country who might be able to make this stuff, and I'm one of them,\" said Spertzel, who was also the former deputy commander of USAMRIID.[54] \"And even with a good lab and staff to help run it, it might take me a year to come up with a product as good.\"[54] The spores in the Daschle letter were 1.5 to 3 micrometres across, many times smaller than the finest known grade of anthrax produced by either the U.S. or Soviet bioweapons programs.[54] An electron microscope, which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be needed to verify that the target spore size had been consistently achieved.[54] The presence of the anti-clumping additive silicon dioxide in the anthrax samples also suggests a high degree of sophistication as specialists working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were unable to duplicate this property despite 56 attempts.[55]/nWhile not outright rejecting the theory of Ivins' involvement, Senator Leahy said that \"if he is the one who sent the letter, I do not believe in any way, shape or manner that he is the only person involved in this attack on Congress and the American people. I do not believe that at all.\"[56]/nOn August 6, 2008, the FBI released a collection of emails written by Ivins.[57] In some, Ivins describes episodes of depression, anxiety, and paranoia for which he was medicated;[58] these are referenced in the summary of the case against Ivins. A psychiatrist engaged by The New York Times to analyze the released documents found evidence of psychoses, but could not rule out the possibility that Ivins was feigning or exaggerating mental illness for purposes of attention or sympathy.[59]/nA United States government investigative panel, called the Expert Behavioral Analysis Panel, issued a report in March 2011 which detailed more of Ivins' mental health issues. According to the panel's report, the Army did not examine Ivins' background adequately before clearing him to work with anthrax, and such clearance should not have been given. The report endorses the government's implication of Ivins: circumstantial evidence from Ivins' psychiatric history supported the conclusion that Ivins was the anthrax killer.[60][61][62]/nSocial worker Jean C. Duley applied for a protective order, writing that Ivins had stalked and threatened to kill her and had a long history of homicidal threats.[18] Duley stated that she had treated Ivins for six months, after which she said he threatened to \"go out in a blaze of glory\".  When she forwarded this information to the FBI, she said he left rants on her voicemail that blamed her for his legal issues.[63]/nDuley had been set to give testimony against Ivins on August 1, 2008.[40] Ivins, however, had no criminal record, whereas Duley had a history of convictions for driving under the influence and charges of battery of her ex-husband.[64] The charges forced her to quit her job, and attorney costs used up her savings, according to her fianc\u00e9.[64] In a 1999 newspaper interview, Duley described herself as a former motorcycle gang member and drug user: \"Heroin. Cocaine. PCP. You name it, I did it.\"[65] According to an article originally appearing in the Frederick News-Post on August 12, 2009, Duley was under house arrest when she recorded Ivins' allegedly threatening messages.[66] The News-Post also made available a recording of the allegedly threatening calls.[67] The newspaper characterized the messages as not being threatening but instead \"the sad ramblings of a broken man who felt betrayed\".[66]/nIn her July 2008 restraining order, Duley alleged that Ivins had a history of threats. She further alleged a \"detailed homicidal plan\" to kill his co-workers after learning he was going to be indicted on capital murder charges and stated that, upon hearing of his possible indictment, Ivins had purchased a gun and a bulletproof vest.[68] Ivins was subsequently committed for psychiatric evaluation and his home was raided by federal agents who confiscated ammunition and a bulletproof vest.[69] He was released from his committal on July 24, five days before his death./nHenry S. Heine, a microbiologist who was Ivins' fellow researcher at the USAMRIID, told a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel on April 22, 2010, that he considered it impossible that Ivins could have produced the anthrax used in the attacks without detection.[14] Heine told the 16-member panel that producing the quantity of spores in the letters would have taken at least a year of intensive work using the equipment at the USAMRIID laboratory. Such an effort would not have escaped colleagues' notice, and laboratory technicians who worked closely with Ivins have told him they saw no such work.[14] Heine also stated that if biological containment measures where Ivins worked were inadequate to prevent the spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices, saying \"You'd have had dead animals or dead people\".[14]/nHeine said he did not dispute that there was a genetic link between the spores in the letters and the anthrax in Ivins' flask, which led the FBI to conclude that Ivins had grown the spores from a sample taken from the flask. Heine pointed out that samples from the flask were widely shared. Accusing Ivins of the attacks, he said, was like tracing a murder to the clerk at the sporting goods shop who sold the bullets.[14] Asked by reporters after his testimony whether he believed there was any chance that Ivins had carried out the attacks, Heine replied, \"Absolutely not.\" At the USAMRIID, he said, \"among the senior scientists, no one believes it.\"[14]/nThe FBI asked the NAS to review the Bureau's scientific work on the case. A panel was created, chaired by Alice P. Gast, president of Lehigh University.[14] On May 15, 2011, the panel released its findings, which \"conclude[d] that the bureau overstated the strength of genetic analysis linking the mailed anthrax to a supply kept by Bruce E. Ivins.\"[11]/nFollowing the release of an NAS report in February 2011, Congressman Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ), a physicist from whose district the anthrax letters were mailed, re-introduced legislation \"to create a 9/11-style Commission, complete with subpoena power, with a mandate to review the entire matter.\"[11] Senator Chuck Grassley told The Washington Post: \"There are no more excuses for avoiding an independent review.\"[11] Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was vocal in his criticism of the anthrax investigation,[64][70][71][72][73] argued that \"[o]ther than a desire to avoid finding out who the culprit was (or to avoid having the FBI's case against Ivins subjected to scrutiny), there's no rational reason to oppose an independent investigation into this matter.\"[11]/nIvins was a Roman Catholic. The News-Post made public several letters to the editor written by Ivins dealing with his religious views.[74] These were cited in the Department of Justice summary of the case against Ivins as suggesting that he may have harbored a grudge against pro-choice Catholic senators Daschle and Leahy, recipients of anthrax mailings.[58] In a letter, Ivins stated, \"By blood and faith, Jews are God's chosen, and have no need for 'dialogue' with any gentile.\"[75] Ivins praised a rabbi for refusing a dialogue with a Muslim cleric.[75]/nIvins' pastimes included playing keyboard at his local church, Saint John the Evangelist;[1] he was a member of the American Red Cross;[1] he was an avid juggler and founder of the Frederick Jugglers.[18] Ivins played keyboards in a Celtic band and would often compose and play songs for coworkers who were moving to new jobs.[18][20]/nAccording to multiple former colleagues and acquaintances, as well as FBI investigators, Ivins maintained a decades-long obsession with college sororities, particularly Kappa Kappa Gamma (KKG), and with particular women.[76] Ivins' attorney, Paul Kemp, described this fixation as dating back to Ivins' time as a college student at the University of Cincinnati, when he was rebuffed by a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma.[77] But according to Dr. Rick Sams, a pharmacologist and former school friend, Ivins had described feelings of resentment toward women stemming from his high school years.[76]/nDuring the 2001 anthrax investigations, FBI investigators learned (in part from information provided by Ivins himself) that after college, Ivins had made uninvited visits to Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority houses at multiple universities, including the University of North Carolina, the University of Maryland, and West Virginia University, and had once stolen a sorority chapter\u2019s ritual book and cipher device. In more recent years, he made extensive online posts about Kappa Kappa Gamma using various pseudonymous handles, including edits to Wikipedia on the topic.[76]/nDr. Nancy Haigwood, the director of the Oregon National Primate Research Center and a Kappa Kappa Gamma member who was a colleague of Ivins at the University of North Carolina when he was a post-doctoral fellow, later recounted to the New York Times a series of intrusive and unsettling interactions with Ivins in the late 1970s and 80s, claiming that \"he damaged my property, he impersonated me and he stalked me\".[76] A United States government investigative panel, called the Expert Behavioral Analysis Panel, issued a report in March 2011 which described in more detail Ivins' obsession with the sorority and his alleged violations of Haigwood, which including stealing a notebook documenting her doctoral research and vandalizing her residence.[60] Such behavior does not appear to have been anomalous for Ivins, who himself admitted to FBI investigators that he once drove through the night to Ithaca, New York, to leave gifts for a young woman who had left her job in his laboratory to attend Cornell University.[76]/nAuthorities investigating the anthrax attacks found anthrax spores in a postal drop box located at 10 Nassau Street in Princeton, New Jersey, 300 feet (91\u00a0m) from a storage facility where the Princeton University chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma kept rush paraphernalia, initiation robes, and other property as of 2001.[77][78] However, no evidence was found to place Ivins in Princeton on the day the letters were mailed.[76] Katherine Breckinridge Graham, an advisor to KKG's Princeton chapter, stated that there was nothing to indicate that any of the sorority members had anything to do with Ivins.[77]/nIn 2011, journalist David Willman's book on Ivins, The Mirage Man: Bruce Ivins, the Anthrax Attacks, and America's Rush to War, was published. The book details Ivins' troubled history and mental problems.[79]/nThe 2001 anthrax attack was featured in the TV series The Hot Zone.

Lawrence Smith Medal[9] from the National Academy of Sciences, the Leonard Medal from the Meteoritical Society, and the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in 2007. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995[10] and in 1999 a fellow of the American Geophysical Union.[11]", "1494": "Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS (8 January 1823 \u2013 7 November 1913) was an English[1] naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, biologist and illustrator.[2] He independently conceived the theory of evolution through natural selection; his 1858 paper on the subject was published that year alongside extracts from Charles Darwin's earlier writings on the topic.[3][4] It spurred Darwin to set aside the \"big species book\" he was drafting and quickly write an abstract of it, which was published in 1859 as On the Origin of Species./nWallace did extensive fieldwork, starting in the Amazon River basin. He then did fieldwork in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species, and is sometimes called the \"father of biogeography\", or more specifically of zoogeography.[5]/nWallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century, working on warning coloration in animals and reinforcement (sometimes known as the Wallace effect), a way that natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He was one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of whether there was life on Mars.[6]/nAside from scientific work, he was a social activist, critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system in 19th-century Britain. His advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non-material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with other scientists. He was one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He wrote prolifically on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Southeast Asia, The Malay Archipelago, was first published in 1869. It continues to be both popular and highly regarded./nAlfred Russel Wallace was born on 8 January 1823 in Llanbadoc, Monmouthshire.[a][7] He was the eighth of nine children born to Mary Anne Wallace (n\u00e9e\u00a0Greenell) and Thomas Vere Wallace. His mother was English, while his father was of Scottish ancestry. His family claimed a connection to William Wallace, a leader of Scottish forces during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 13th century.[8]/nWallace's father graduated in law but never practised it. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. Wallace's mother was from a middle-class family of Hertford,[8] to which place his family moved when Wallace was five years old. He attended Hertford Grammar School until 1837, when he reached the age of 14, the normal leaving age for a pupil not going on to university.[9][10]/nWallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the London Mechanics Institute. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen and of the English-born political theorist Thomas Paine. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years. They moved repeatedly to different places in Mid-Wales. Then at the end of 1839, they moved to Kington, Herefordshire, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at Neath in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace worked as a land surveyor in the countryside of the west of England and Wales.[11][12] The natural history of his surroundings aroused his interest; from 1841 he collected flowers and plants as an amateur botanist.[9]/nOne result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since he was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered him to be Welsh.[13] Other historians have questioned this because neither of his parents were Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because he consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh. One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.[2]/nIn 1843 Wallace's father died, and a decline in demand for surveying meant William's business no longer had work available.[9] For a short time Wallace was unemployed, then early in 1844 he was engaged by the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying.[14][15] He had already read George Combe's The Constitution of Man, and after Spencer Hall lectured on mesmerism, Wallace as well as some of the older pupils tried it out. Wallace spent many hours at the town library in Leicester; he read An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative, Darwin's Journal (The Voyage of the Beagle), and Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology.[9][16] One evening Wallace met the entomologist Henry Bates, who was 19 years old, and had published an 1843 paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects.[14][15]/nWhen Wallace's brother William died in March 1845, Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, he found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of Neath. Wallace's work on the survey was largely outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm. It carried out projects including the design of a building for the Neath Mechanics' Institute, founded in 1843.[17] William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny.[18][19] During this period, he exchanged letters with Bates about books. He had re-read Darwin's Journal, and said \"As the Journal of a scientific traveller, it is second only to Humboldt's 'Personal Narrative'\u2014as a work of general interest, perhaps superior to it.\"[This quote needs a citation] In 1845, Wallace had been convinced by Robert Chambers's anonymously published treatise on progressive development, Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, and found Bates to be more critical.[20][21]/nInspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists, Wallace decided to travel abroad.[22] He later wrote that Darwin's Journal and Humboldt's Personal Narrative were \"the two works to whose inspiration I owe my determination to visit the tropics as a collector.\"[23] After reading A voyage up the river Amazon, by William Henry Edwards, Wallace and Bates estimated that by collecting and selling natural history specimens such as birds and insects they could meet their costs, with the prospect of good profits.[9] They therefore engaged as their agent Samuel Stevens who would advertise and arrange sales to institutions and private collectors, for a commission of 20% on sales plus 5% on despatching freight and remittances of money.[24]/nIn 1848, Wallace and Bates left for Brazil aboard the Mischief. They intended to collect insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon Rainforest for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain to fund the trip. Wallace hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species. Bates and he spent most of their first year collecting near Bel\u00e9m, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, the botanist Richard Spruce, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert soon left (dying two years later from yellow fever), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.[25][26] Wallace spent four years charting the Rio Negro, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna.[27]/nOn 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig Helen. After 25 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire, and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last, and most interesting, two years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches, but little else. Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig Jordeson, which was sailing from Cuba to London. The Jordeson's provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on short rations, the ship reached its destination on 1 October 1852.[28][29]/nThe lost collection had been insured for \u00a3200 by Stevens.[30] After his return to Britain, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment, and selling a few specimens that had been shipped home. During this period, despite having lost almost all the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (including \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\") and two books, Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses and Travels on the Amazon.[31] At the same time, he made connections with several other British naturalists.[29][32][33]/nBates and others were collecting in the Amazon area, Wallace was more interested in new opportunities in the Malay Archipelago as demonstrated by the travel writings of Ida Laura Pfeiffer, and valuable insect specimens she collected which Stevens sold as her agent. In March 1853 Wallace wrote to Sir James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, who was then in London, and who arranged assistance in Sarawak for Wallace.[34][35] In June Wallace wrote to Murchison at the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) for support, proposing to again fund his exploring entirely from sale of duplicate collections.[36] He later recalled that, while researching in the insect-room of the British Museum, he was introduced to Darwin and they \"had a few minutes' conversation.\" After presenting a paper and a large map of the Rio Negro to the RGS, Wallace was elected a Fellow of the society on 27 February 1854.[37][38] Free passage arranged on Royal Navy ships was stalled by the Crimean War, but eventually the RGS funded first class travel by P&O steamships. Wallace and a young assistant, Charles Allen, embarked at Southampton on 4 March 1854. After the overland journey to Suez and another change of ship at Ceylon they disembarked at Singapore on 19 April 1854.[39]/nFrom 1854 to 1862, Wallace travelled around the islands of the Malay Archipelago or East Indies (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia).[40] His main objective \"was to obtain specimens of natural history, both for my private collection and to supply duplicates to museums and amateurs\". In addition to Allen, he \"generally employed one or two, and sometimes three Malay servants\" as assistants, and paid large numbers of local people at various places to bring specimens. His total was 125,660 specimens, most of which were insects including more than 83,000 beetles,[41][42] Several thousand of the specimens represented species new to science,[43] Overall, more than thirty men worked for him at some stage as full-time paid collectors. He also hired guides, porters, cooks and boat crews, so well over 100 individuals worked for him.[44]/nAfter collecting expeditions to Bukit Timah Hill in Singapore, and to Malacca, Wallace and Allen reached Sarawak in October 1854, and were welcomed at Kuching by Sir James Brooke's (then) heir Captain John Brooke. Wallace hired a Malay named Ali as a general servant and cook, and spent the early 1855 wet season in a small Dyak house at the foot of Mount Santubong, overlooking a branch outlet of the Sarawak River. He read about species distribution, and wrote his \"Sarawak Paper\".[45] In March he moved to the Simunjon coal-works, operated by the Borneo Company under Ludvig Verner Helms, and supplemented collecting by paying workers a cent for each insect. A specimen of the previously unknown gliding tree frog Rhacophorus nigropalmatus (now called Wallace's flying frog) came from a Chinese workman who told Wallace that it glided down. Local people also assisted with shooting orangutans.[46][42] They spent time with Sir James, then in February 1856 Allen chose to stay on with the missionaries at Kuching.[47][48]/nOn reaching Singapore in May 1856, Wallace hired a bird-skinner. With Ali as cook, they collected for two days on Bali, then from 17 June to 30 August on Lombok.[49] In December 1856, Darwin had written to contacts worldwide to get specimens for his continuing research into variation under domestication.[50][51] At Lombok's port city, Ampanam, Wallace wrote telling his agent, Stevens, about specimens shipped, including a domestic duck variety \"for Mr. Darwin & he would perhaps also like the jungle cock, which is often domesticated here & is doubtless one of the originals of the domestic breed of poultry.\"[52]\nIn the same letter, Wallace said birds from Bali and Lombok, divided by a narrow strait, \"belong to two quite distinct zoological provinces, of which they form the extreme limits\", Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Malacca, and Australia and the Moluccas. Stevens arranged publication of relevant paragraphs in the January 1857 issue of The Zoologist. After further investigation, the zoogeographical boundary eventually became known as the Wallace Line.[53][54]/nAli became Wallace's most trusted assistant, a skilled collector and researcher. Wallace collected and preserved the delicate insect specimens, while most of the birds were collected and prepared by his assistants; of those, Ali collected and prepared around 5000.[44]\nWhile exploring the archipelago, Wallace refined his thoughts about evolution, and had his famous insight on natural selection. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's theory, that same year.[55]/nAccounts of Wallace's studies and adventures were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago. This became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), by Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist Joseph Conrad. Conrad called the book his \"favorite bedside companion\" and used information from it for several of his novels, especially Lord Jim.[56]\nA set of 80 bird skeletons Wallace collected in Indonesia are held in the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, and described as of exceptional historical significance.[57]/nIn 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the Zoological Society of London. Later that year, he visited Darwin at Down House, and became friendly with both Lyell and the philosopher Herbert Spencer.[58] During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He corresponded with Darwin about topics including sexual selection, warning coloration, and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species.[59] In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.[60]/nAfter a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace,[61] but to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement.[62] In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was a friend of Annie Mitten's father, William Mitten, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867\u20131874), Violet (1869\u20131945), and William (1871\u20131951).[63]/nIn the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. On his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.[64]/nDespite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their works.[65]/nIn 1876, Wallace needed a \u00a3500 advance from the publisher of The Geographical Distribution of Animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.[66] Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the \u00a3200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.[67]/nIn 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims,[68] on the subject. He criticised the UK's free trade policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people.[33][69] In 1889, Wallace read Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor.[70] After reading Progress and Poverty, the bestselling book by the progressive land reformist Henry George, Wallace described it as \"Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century.\"[71]/nWallace opposed eugenics, an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit.[72] In his 1890 article \"Human Selection\" he wrote, \"Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent\u00a0...\"[73]   He said, \"The world does not want the eugenicist to set it straight,\" \"Give the people good conditions, improve their environment, and all will tend towards the highest type. Eugenics is simply the meddlesome interference of an arrogant, scientific priestcraft.\"[74]/nIn 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold, which impressed the economist Irving Fisher so much that he dedicated his 1920 book Stabilizing the Dollar to Wallace.[75]/nWallace wrote on other social and political topics, including in support of women's suffrage and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism.[76][77] In an 1899 essay, he called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people \"that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens (burdens)\".[78] In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea \"that this new horror is 'inevitable', and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins\u2014for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships.\"[79]/nIn 1898, Wallace published The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures, about developments in the 19th century. The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism.[80][81] Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.[82]/nIn 1880, he published Island Life as a sequel to The Geographic Distribution of Animals. In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on biogeography, spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist Alice Eastwood as his guide, exploring the flora of the Rocky Mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper \"English and American Flowers\". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book Darwinism used information he collected on his American trip and information he had compiled for the lectures.[83][84]/nOn 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home, aged 90, in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier.[85] His death was widely reported in the press. The New York Times called him \"the last of the giants [belonging] to that wonderful group of intellectuals composed of Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, Owen, and other scientists, whose daring investigations revolutionized and evolutionized the thought of the century\".[86] Another commentator in the same edition said: \"No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'.\"[87]/nSome of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in Westminster Abbey, but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone, Dorset.[85] Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.[88]/nWallace began his career as a travelling naturalist who already believed in the transmutation of species. The concept had been advocated by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Erasmus Darwin, and Robert Grant, among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have radical, even revolutionary connotations.[89][90] Prominent anatomists and geologists such as Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, Adam Sedgwick, and Lyell attacked transmutation vigorously.[91][92] It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science,[89] and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.[93]/nWallace was profoundly influenced by Robert Chambers's Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844. It advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things.[94] Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845 describing it as \"an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by ... more research\".[93] In 1847, he wrote to Bates that he would \"like to take some one family [of beetles] to study thoroughly, ... with a view to the theory of the origin of species.\"[95]/nWallace planned fieldwork to test the evolutionary hypothesis that closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories.[89] During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers\u2014such as the Amazon and its major tributaries\u2014often separated the ranges of closely allied species. He included these observations in his 1853 paper \"On the Monkeys of the Amazon\". Near the end of the paper he asked the question, \"Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?\"[96]/nIn February 1855, while working in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, Wallace wrote \"On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species\". The paper was published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History in September 1855.[97] In this paper, he discussed observations of the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, a field that became biogeography. His conclusion that \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species\" has come to be known as the \"Sarawak Law\", answering his own question in his paper on the monkeys of the Amazon basin. Although it does not mention possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.[98]/nThe paper challenged Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did Edward Blyth who thought it \"Good! Upon the whole!\u00a0... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species.\" Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time, writing that it was \"nothing very new\u00a0... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him.\" Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend Joseph Hooker and now, for the first time spelt out the full details of natural selection to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, but began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in May 1856.[99][100]/nBy February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago that evolution was real. He later wrote in his autobiography that the problem was of how species change from one well-marked form to another.[101] He stated that it was while he was in bed with a fever that he thought about Malthus's idea of positive checks on human population, and had the idea of natural selection. His autobiography says that he was on the island of Ternate at the time; but the evidence of his journal suggests that he was in fact on the island of Gilolo.[102] From 1858 to 1861, he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode, which he used as a base for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.[103]/nWallace describes how he discovered natural selection as follows:/nIt then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live\u00a0... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about\u00a0... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained.[104]/nWallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received.[106] In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper \"On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species\" of 1855, showed that they thought alike, with similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time.[107] The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that \"without speculation there is no good and original observation\" but commented that \"I believe I go much further than you\".[108] Wallace believed this and sent Darwin his February 1858 essay, \"On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type\", asking Darwin to review it and pass it to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile.[3] Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. Darwin received the essay on 18 June 1858. Although the essay did not use Darwin's term \"natural selection\", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for 20 years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \"he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters\u00a0... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal.\"[109][110] Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857.[111]/nCommunication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago involved months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed bitterness in public or in private. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. All the same, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community.[112] The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries;[113] but, with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.[114]/nOver the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined and found unconvincing by a number of scholars.[115][116][117] Shipping schedules show that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.[118][119]/nAfter Wallace returned to England in 1862, he became one of the staunchest defenders of Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In an incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper \"Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species\". This rebutted a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the Origin on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.[120]\nAn even longer defence was a 1867 article in the Quarterly Journal of Science called \"Creation by Law\". It reviewed George Campbell, the 8th Duke of Argyll's book, The Reign of Law, which aimed to refute natural selection.[121]\nAfter an 1870 meeting of the British Science Association, Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were \"no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have\".[122]/nHistorians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.[123] Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge.[124][125] The historian of science Peter J. Bowler has suggested that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace might have been discussing group selection.[126] Against this, Malcolm Kottler showed that Wallace was indeed discussing individual variation and selection.[127]/nOthers have noted that Wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism that kept species and varieties adapted to their environment (now called 'stabilizing\", as opposed to 'directional' selection).[128] They point to a largely overlooked passage of Wallace's famous 1858 paper, in which he likened \"this principle ... [to] the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities\".[3] The cybernetician and anthropologist Gregory Bateson observed in the 1970s that, although writing it only as an example, Wallace had \"probably said the most powerful thing that'd been said in the 19th Century\".[129] Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity, and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory.[128]/nWarning coloration was one of Wallace's contributions to the evolutionary biology of animal coloration.[130] In 1867, Darwin wrote to Wallace about a problem in explaining how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes. Darwin had come to believe that many conspicuous animal colour schemes were due to sexual selection, but he saw that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and Bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by John Jenner Weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. Since the moth was as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in daylight, it seemed likely that the conspicuous colours served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a later meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic.[131] In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea.[132] Wallace attributed less importance than Darwin to sexual selection. In his 1878 book Tropical Nature and Other Essays, he wrote extensively about the coloration of animals and plants, and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection.[133] He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book Darwinism. In 1890, he wrote a critical review in Nature of his friend Edward Bagnall Poulton's The Colours of Animals which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the \"aesthetic preferences of the insect world\".[134][135]/nIn 1889, Wallace wrote the book Darwinism, which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario: When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less adapted than either parent form and so natural selection would tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect,[136][137] later called reinforcement.[138] Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail.[139] It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.[140]/nIn 1864, Wallace published a paper, \"The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'\", applying the theory to humankind. Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although Thomas Huxley had in Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Wallace explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not \"regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape\".[141] He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture that freed the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the \"recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life\".[141] Wallace seems to have been the first evolutionist to see that the human brain effectively made further specialisation of the body unnecessary.[141] Wallace wrote the paper for the Anthropological Society of London to address the debate between the supporters of monogenism, the belief that all human races shared a common ancestor and were one species, and the supporters of polygenism, who held that different races had separate origins and were different species. Wallace's anthropological observations of Native Americans in the Amazon, and especially his time living among the Dayak people of Borneo, had convinced him that human beings were a single species with a common ancestor. He still felt that natural selection might have continued to act on mental faculties after the development of the different races; and he did not dispute the nearly universal view among European anthropologists of the time that Europeans were intellectually superior to other races.[142][143] According to political scientist Adam Jones, \"Wallace found little difficulty in reconciling the extermination of native peoples with his progressive political views\".[144] In 1864, in the aforementioned paper, he stated \"It is the same great law of the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life, which leads to the inevitable extinction of all those low and mentally undeveloped populations with which Europeans come in contact.\"[145] He argued that the natives die out due to an unequal struggle.[146]/nShortly afterwards, Wallace became a spiritualist. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection could not account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, metaphysical musings, or wit and humour. He stated that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history: the creation of life from inorganic matter; the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals; and the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He believed that the raison d'\u00eatre of the universe was the development of the human spirit.[147]/nWhile some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the higher functions of the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.[148][149] Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's.[150][151] Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[152] All the same, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace's views.[153]/nAs the historian of science and sceptic Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy. These were that evolution was not teleological (purpose-driven), and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred).[154] Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. He set out his ideas in a 1909 magazine article entitled The World of Life, later expanded into a book of the same name.[155] Shermer commented that this anticipated ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from religious traditions throughout the 20th century.[152]/nIn many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory.[156] In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period.[157] Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.[158] Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose (\"teleology\") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying additional mechanisms and triggers such as mutations triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals.[159] Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles, but natural selection less so. Wallace's 1889 Darwinism was a response to the scientific critics of natural selection.[160] Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.[161]/nIn 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, Philip Sclater, and Alfred Newton, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. Initial progress was slow, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux.[162] He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification.[163] Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds\u2014which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution\u2014to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions in use today. He discussed the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region.[164]/nThese factors included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently connecting North America and South America) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps showing factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, The Geographical Distribution of Animals, was published in 1876 and served as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next 80 years.[165]/nThe book included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the Northern Hemisphere, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia.[166] Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the mass extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene. In The Geographical Distribution of Animals (1876) he wrote, \"We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared\".[167] He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions was glaciation, but by the time he wrote World of Life (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were \"due to man's agency\".[168]/nIn 1880, Wallace published the book Island Life as a sequel to The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into oceanic and two types of continental islands. Oceanic islands, in his view, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then called Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (except migratory birds and species introduced by humans) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. Continental islands, in his scheme, were divided into those that were recently separated from a continent (like Britain) and those much less recently (like Madagascar). Wallace discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna. He discussed how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.[169]/nWallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In Tropical Nature and Other Essays (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their impoverishment due to soil erosion.[170] In Island Life, Wallace again mentioned deforestation and invasive species. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of Saint Helena, he wrote that the island was \"now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile\".[171]  He explained that the soil was protected by the island's vegetation; once that was destroyed, the soil was washed off the steep slopes by heavy tropical rain, leaving \"bare rock or sterile clay\".[171] He attributed the \"irreparable destruction\"[171]  to feral goats, introduced in 1513. The island's forests were further damaged by the \"reckless waste\"[171]  of the East India Company from 1651, which used the bark of valuable redwood and ebony trees for tanning, leaving the wood to rot unused.[171] Wallace's comments on environment grew more urgent later in his career. In The World of Life (1911) he wrote that people should view nature \"as invested with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced.\"[172]/nWallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the Solar System that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase.[173] His treatment of Mars in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with the book Is Mars Habitable? to criticise the claims made by the American astronomer Percival Lowell that there were Martian canals built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions.[174] He pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the Martian atmosphere, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible.[175] Richard Milner comments that Wallace \"effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals.\"[176] Wallace became interested in the topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would be unique in the universe.[177]/nWallace was an enthusiast of phrenology.[178] Early in his career, he experimented with hypnosis, then known as mesmerism, managing to hypnotise some of his students in Leicester.[179] When he began these experiments, the topic was very controversial: early experimenters, such as John Elliotson, had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment.[180] Wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and spiritualism, arguing that one should not deny observations on \"a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility\".[181]/nWallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims.[182] After reviewing the literature and attempting to test what he witnessed at s\u00e9ances, he came to believe in it. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some s\u00e9ance phenomena were genuine, despite accusations of fraud and evidence of trickery. One biographer suggested that the emotional shock when his first fianc\u00e9e broke their engagement contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism.[183] Other scholars have emphasised his desire to find scientific explanations for all phenomena.[180][184] In 1874, Wallace visited the spirit photographer Frederick Hudson. He declared that a photograph of him with his deceased mother was genuine.[185] Others reached a different conclusion: Hudson's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872.[186]/nWallace's public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation. In 1875 he published the evidence he believed proved his position in On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism.[187] His attitude permanently strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as Henry Bates, Thomas Huxley, and even Darwin.[188][189] Others, such as the physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter and zoologist E. Ray Lankester became publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace was heavily criticised by the press; The Lancet was particularly harsh.[189] When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, Joseph Hooker responded that \"Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings\u00a0... This he is said to have done in an underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.\"[190][191] Hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request.[192]/nIn 1870, a flat-Earth proponent named John Hampden offered a \u00a3500 wager (roughly equivalent to \u00a351,000 in 2021[193]) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10\u00a0km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the Earth. The judge for the wager, the editor of Field magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager, and the controversy frustrated him for years.[194]/nIn the early 1880s, Wallace joined the debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination.[195] Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. Wallace discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely false, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.[196]/nAnother factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, served a useful purpose.[197] Wallace pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often unsanitary, could be dangerous.[197]/nIn 1890, Wallace gave evidence to a Royal Commission investigating the controversy. It found errors in his testimony, including some questionable statistics. The Lancet averred that Wallace and other activists were being selective in their choice of statistics. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they recommended some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime, attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by The Lancet, which stated that it repeated many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.[196]/nAs a result of his writing, Wallace became a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist, and was often sought out for his views.[198] He became president of the anthropology section of the British Association in 1866,[199] and of the Entomological Society of London in 1870.[200] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1873.[201] The British Association elected him as head of its biology section in 1876.[202] He was elected to the Royal Society in 1893.[202] He was asked to chair the International Congress of Spiritualists meeting in London in 1898.[203] He received honorary doctorates and professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1868 and its Darwin Medal in 1890,[200] and the Order of Merit in 1908.[204]/nWallace's fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science.[156] Reasons for this lack of attention may have included his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.[205] The reason that the theory of evolution is popularly credited to Darwin is likely the impact of Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[205]/nRecently, Wallace has become better known, with the publication of at least five book-length biographies and two anthologies of his writings published since 2000.[206] A web page dedicated to Wallace scholarship is maintained at Western Kentucky University.[207]\nIn a 2010 book, the environmentalist Tim Flannery argued that Wallace was \"the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival\", and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere should be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.[208] A collection of his medals, including the Order of Merit, were sold at auction for \u00a3273,000 in 2022.[209]/nThe Natural History Museum, London, co-ordinated commemorative events for the Wallace centenary worldwide in the 'Wallace100' project in 2013.[210][211] On 24 January, his portrait was unveiled in the Main Hall of the museum by Bill Bailey, a fervent admirer.[212] Bailey further championed Wallace in his 2013 BBC Two series \"Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero\".[213] On 7 November 2013, the 100th anniversary of Wallace's death, Sir David Attenborough unveiled a statue of Wallace at the museum.[214] The statue, sculpted by Anthony Smith, was donated by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund.[215] It depicts Wallace as a young man, collecting in the jungle. November 2013 marked the debut of The Animated Life of A. R. Wallace, a paper-puppet animation film dedicated to Wallace's centennial.[216] In addition, Bailey unveiled a bust of Wallace, sculpted by Felicity Crawley, in Twyn Square in Usk, Monmouthshire in November 2021.[217]/nCommemorations of the 200th anniversary of Wallace's birth celebrated during the course of 2023 range from naturalist walk events[218] to scientific congresses and presentations.[219] A Harvard Museum of Natural History event in April of 2023 will also include a mixologist-designed special cocktail to honor Wallace's legacy.[220]/nMount Wallace in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range was named in his honour in 1895.[221] In 1928, a house at Richard Hale School (then called Hertford Grammar School, where he had been a pupil) was named after Wallace.[222][223] The Alfred Russel Wallace building is a prominent feature of the Glyntaff campus at the University of South Wales, by Pontypridd, with several teaching spaces and laboratories for science courses. The Natural Sciences Building at Swansea University and lecture theatre at Cardiff University are named after him,[223] as are impact craters on Mars and the Moon.[222] In 1986, the Royal Entomological Society mounted a year-long expedition to the Dumoga-Bone National Park in North Sulawesi named Project Wallace.[223] A group of Indonesian islands is known as the Wallacea biogeographical region in his honour, and Operation Wallacea, named after the region, awards \"Alfred Russel Wallace Grants\" to undergraduate ecology students.[224] Several hundred species of plants and animals, both living and fossil, have been named after Wallace,[225] such as the gecko Cyrtodactylus wallacei,[226] and the freshwater stingray Potamotrygon wallacei.[227] More recently, several new species have been named during the bicentenary year of Wallace's birth, including a large spider from Peru, Linothele wallacei Sherwood et al., 2023 [228] and a South African weevil, Nama wallacei Meregalli & Borovec, 2023.[229]/nWallace was a prolific author. In 2002, historian of science Michael Shermer published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in Nature). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects: 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.[230] An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.[33]/nThe standard author abbreviation Wallace is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.[231]/nThere is an extensive literature on Wallace.

After being held in solitary confinement for more than a decade at the administrative maximum security United States Penitentiary ADX Florence, Colorado, the district court in 2020 ordered his conditional release into home confinement pending appeal after concluding that his case raised substantial legal issues.[5]/nAl-Timimi was born in 1963 and grew up in the Palisades neighborhood of Washington, DC, where he attended Georgetown Day School until age fifteen.[6][2][7] His father (d. 2010), an attorney, was the cultural attach\u00e9 at the embassy of the then Kingdom of Iraq. His mother, a mental health specialist with a doctorate in special education, initially taught at St. John's Child Development Center for intellectually disabled children. Later in the mid-1970s, she was a dean at Mt. Vernon College for Women.[6]/nOne of Al-Timimi's teenage friends was the son of journalist Milton Viorst, who later wrote in The Atlantic that the family was \"not particularly ethnic or religious,\" and that Al-Timimi celebrated holidays such as Halloween and Christmas with his brother and other friends at school.[6] Viorst writes that Al-Timimi's parents were both practicing Muslims, but spoke English rather than Arabic at home and \"did not push religious observance on the children.\"[6]/nAt age fifteen, in 1978, Al-Timimi's parents moved the family to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for two years to expose them to their Islamic heritage. Al-Timimi attended Manarat Riyadh High School, where he learned Arabic and studied Islam under the Imam Bilal Phillips.[7] Al-Timimi became influenced by Salafism, a reform branch of Sunni Islam that advocates strict adherence to the Quran and Sunna (the teachings of the Prophet).[7][6]/nIn 1981, Al-Timimi returned to the United States and enrolled in a premed program at The George Washington University, while spending much of his time networking with different groups in the local Muslim community. Al-Timimi was quoted as saying that he \"flirted with each group, only quickly to become disinterested in their rhetoric and what I perceived as their being out of touch with the questions being raised in America\u2014about Islam and the Muslims.\"[6] Stating that he was \"hungry for answers to the larger philosophical questions,\" Al-Timimi returned to Saudi Arabia in 1987, where he studied Salafiya for a year at the Islamic University of Madinah and became a student of Abdul-Aziz bin Baz.[6][7][8] He also became influenced by Islamist thinkers like Sayyid Qutb, Safar Al-Hawali and Muhammad Surur.[9][10]/nAt his parents' urging, Al-Timimi returned to the United States after a year and earned a second undergraduate degree in computer science from the University of Maryland. He later earned a Ph.D. in computational biology from George Mason University in 2004, after defending his doctoral thesis titled \"Chaos and Complexity in Cancer.\"[7] His doctoral thesis reflected, in large part, the influence of the ideas of Harold Morowitz, one of his professors, on his thinking./nDomeniconi, C, Barbar\u00e1, D, Chaudhary, H, Al-Timimi, A., and Jamison, D.C \u201cData Mining Techniques for Microarray Data Analysis,\u201d in New Generation of Data Mining Applications, eds.

This was a man who could take the knowledge of the Salaf and make it applicable to your everyday life and could speak in a language we all understood.\"[7]/nIn the early 1990s, Al-Timimi led a five-person delegation from the Islamic Assembly of North America to the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China.[6] Al-Timimi also translated into English a book about women in Islam that was written by Shaikh Abdel Rahaman Abdel Khaliq.[14]/nAs an IT specialist, Al-Timimi worked at an IT company named Xpedior, Inc.

The other prosecutions for terrorism are B.S. They would never have investigated the Virginia jihad group before 9/11\".[22]/nAfter the conclusion of the Virginia Jihad Network trials, prosecutors tried Al-Timimi for helping to inspire their travel to Lashkar-e-Taiba.[20][2]  The case was tried before U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema in the Eastern District of Virginia, and charged Al-Timimi with 10 criminal counts, including solicitation of treason[1] and attempting to aid the Taliban.[1][2]  Al-Timimi's defense lawyers argued his case was an attack on the freedom of speech and religious freedom, arguing that their client only told young Muslims that it might be better to emigrate from the United States to better practice their faith.[23]/nAfter a week of deliberation, the jury found Al-Timimi guilty of all 10 counts in April 2005.[2]  At a sentencing hearing on July 14, 2005, he received a mandatory lifetime prison sentence.[2] Judge Brinkema described the sentence as \"very draconian,\"[1] but said \"I don't think any well-read person can doubt the truth that terrorist camps are a crucial part of the new terrorism that is perpetrated in the world today. People of good will need to do whatever they can to stop that.\"[2]/nAt sentencing, Al-Timimi \"made an eloquent statement to the court, quoting from the Constitution and Socrates. [He] pointed out that he had 'never owned or used a gun, never traveled to a military camp, never set foot in a country in which a war was taking place, never raised money for any violent organization.' For his conviction to stand, he said: '[T]wo hundred and thirty years of America's tradition of protecting the individual from the tyrannies and whims of the sovereign will have come to an end. And that which is exploited today to persecute a single member of a minority will most assuredly come back to haunt the majority tomorrow.'\"[24]/nRoyer was released from prison in December 2016, and now works for a nonprofit group that seeks to undermine religious extremism.[25] Since his release, Royer has maintained that \"Timimi did not specifically say join the Taliban or help al-Qaeda though he seemed to imply it.\"[26] However, Royer has also said that Al-Timimi's statement that Muslim men should \"go be with the mujahideen\" was \"colossally bad advice.\"[27]/nAlthough Al-Timimi was convicted in 2005, his direct appeal is still ongoing./nIn late 2005, Al-Timimi's appellate attorneys sought discovery on whether Al-Timimi had been subjected to illegal wiretaps in light of the then-recently disclosed NSA warrantless surveillance program.[28][29] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit responded by remanding the case back to the district court, giving broad latitude to the trial judge. The Justice Department did not confirm or deny the use of NSA wiretaps against Al-Timimi.[30]/nIn 2006, Al-Timimi's attorneys also challenged his treatment by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, claiming that it had repeatedly moved him to new facilities to block him from meeting with his legal counsel. Attorney Jonathan Turley told NPR that Al-Timimi \"was transferred to at least six different prisons in four states in less than six months. It became a version of Where's Waldo. We could not find him.\"[31] After an internal investigation, BOP found that a prison official had \"verbally harassed\" Al-Timimi, but concluded that it had insufficient evidence to substantiate Al-Timimi's other claims.[31]/nIn September 2015, the Fourth Circuit again remanded the case, this time on the grounds that \"the FBI withheld evidence of its 2002 investigation into the first American on the CIA's kill or capture list, Anwar al-Awlaki\".[32]/nBetween 2016 and 2019, Al-Timimi's attorneys further argued that several of his convictions have been rendered invalid by the Supreme Court's intervening decisions in Johnson v. United States and United States v. Davis.[33][34]/nOn April 27, 2020, Al-Timimi's attorneys filed a motion for his conditional release from prison pending the remainder of his appeal, arguing that intervening Supreme Court authority had cast doubt on the charges that continued to subject him to imprisonment, and that the COVID-19 pandemic additionally presented an exceptional reason justifying his release.[5] On August 18, 2020, Judge Brinkema granted the motion and ordered Al-Timimi's conditional release from ADX and into home confinement while he pursues his appeal.[35] On September 1, 2020, Al-Timimi was released from ADX Florence and placed into home confinement./nThe Al-Timimi case has generated some legal commentary, including:/nDavis, T.

He took postgraduate courses at the universities of Strasburg and Berlin, and in 1886 became assistant at the physiological institute of the University of W\u00fcrzburg, remaining there until 1888. In a similar capacity, he then went to Strasburg University. During his vacations he pursued biological research, at Kiel in 1888, and at Naples in 1889 and 1890./nJacques Loeb first arrived in the United States in 1891 when he accepted a position at Bryn Mawr College, however, they provided insufficient facilities for his work which would later influence his resignation.[2] In 1892, he was called to the University of Chicago as assistant professor of physiology and experimental biology, while later becoming associate professor in 1895, and professor of physiology in 1899. John B. Watson (the \"father of Behaviorism\") attended Loeb's neurology classes at the University of Chicago.[3] He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1899.[4] In 1902, he was called to fill a similar chair at the University of California.

He remained at Rockefeller (now Rockefeller University) until his death. Throughout his career, Loeb spent some summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, performing experiments on various marine invertebrates. While there, Jacques Loeb performed his most famous experiment, on artificial parthenogenesis. With this experiment, Loeb was able to cause the sea urchins' eggs to begin embryonic development without sperm. The slight chemical modifications of the water in which the eggs were kept, served as the stimulus for the development to begin.[7][8] Later in 1918, Loeb established and became the first Editor of the Journal of General Physiology./nJacques Loeb became one of the most famous scientists in America, widely covered in newspapers and magazines, influencing other important individuals in the scientific world such as B.F.

Hoffmann, for \"their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\".[15] However, the committee was not aware that he had died three days earlier, on September 30, from pancreatic cancer. This created a complication, since the statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that the prize is not to be awarded posthumously.[16][17] After deliberation, the committee decided that as the decision to award the prize \"was made in good faith\", it would remain unchanged, and the prize would be awarded.[18][19]/nSteinman's daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about staying alive until the prize announcement.

Infections are first resisted by innate immunity, followed by adaptive immunity, which has memory, so can prevent reinfection. Two questions that immunologists ask: 1) By what mechanisms do innate and adaptive resistance come about? 2) How do these mechanisms contribute to other fields of medicine such as cancer, allergy, autoimmunity, etc.?\nIn the 20th century,  two theories arose: 1) Macrophages contribute to innate resistance through phagocytosis and intracellular killing 2) Antibodies mediate adaptive resistance by neutralizing microbial toxins. \nSteinman discovered that dendritic cells link innate to adaptive immunity, including adaptive T cell-mediated immunity./nHe studied the initiation of antibody responses in tissue culture in the laboratory. As shown, he found out that antigens, lymphocytes, and \"accessory cells\" together create immune responses. Accessory cells contain a new cell type with probing cell process or \"dendrites\". These cells proved to be the missing link between innate and adaptive immunity./nSeveral features were used to identify and purify dendritic cells from mouse spleen. Because dendritic cells were discovered among \"adherent\" accessory cells (i.e. those that attach to tissue culture surfaces), they had to be distinguished from macrophages, whose hallmarks were persistent phagocytosis and adherence to tissue culture surfaces. However, Steinman found that dendritic cells had a different morphology and expressed different molecules from macrophages. For example, they did not express FcR- receptors, but did express major components of the major histocompatibility complex II and did not adhere to surfaces or exploit phagocytosis. Macrophages, though, showed the opposite characteristics. The study was carried out in collaboration with Zanvil A.

At age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army to fight in the American Civil War, reaching the rank of first lieutenant. After the war, he resumed his studies, obtaining a law degree from Albany Law School in 1867.[1] After graduation, George worked at the law office of James T. Brown of Milwaukee.[1]  Not caring for the law, however, he became a student in the medical college of the University of Michigan, earning his M.D. in 1872.[1] Rather than practice medicine, however, he chose to teach biology at East Division High School of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1880, he organized the first American biological laboratory program in any high school, and in same year he married his colleague, Elizabeth Maria Gifford, one of the first science graduates from Vassar. In 1888, Peckham became principal of East Division, and in 1891, an inspector for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. He also served during this period as president of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters.[2] In 1897, he became the director of the Milwaukee Public Library, in which position he served until retirement in 1910. He died on January 10, 1914, at the age of 68.[3][4]/nElizabeth Maria Gifford (later Peckham) was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1854, later using the abbreviated forename 'Bessie' amongst friends as attested to by her classmate Sara Fleming Sharpe.[5] She graduated from Vassar College in 1876 and earned her master's degree in Biology from Vassar in 1888 or 1889. Although her obituary records that her later interests took her elsewhere, she retained making notifications to Vassar alumnae.[6][7] She was active in the women's suffrage movement both at the state and national level as recognised for \"distinguished service\" by the National American Womans' Suffrage Association, plus testified before legislative committees on several occasions. She served as one of the first librarians in the city of Milwaukee. After the death of her husband in 1914, she continued her scientific work and received a PhD from Cornell University in 1916.[8] Elizabeth Peckham died of pneumonia on February 11, 1940, at the age of 85.[4]/nGeorge W. Peckham and Elizabeth Maria Gifford were married in 1880. In an obituary (in 1940), their daughter Mary Peckham Gross writes of her parents marriage that \"it was one of those perfect marriages of minds as well as hearts\".[5]  Long before that, in 1914, a notification to Vassar alumnae (for class of 1876) records the birth of their grandson as \"Born, August, 1914, a grandson George Peckham Gross, to Bessie Gifford Peckham\",[7] unfortunately several months after the death of his grandfather and apparent namesake George W. Peckham. In later years, Elizabeth M. Gifford-Peckham is recorded as living with her daughter Mary Peckham Gross, whose children were \"a comfort and joy to her\".[5]/nTogether, they introduced Darwinian concepts into secondary education and began their studies on the taxonomy and behavior of jumping spiders (Salticidae), a large group of visually oriented spiders. They were among the earliest taxonomists to emphasize the value of behavior in classification. In 1889-1890, they published Observations on Sexual Selection in Spiders of the Family Attidae, and Additional Observations on Sexual Selection in Spiders of the Family Attid\u00e6, with Some Remarks on Mr. Wallace's Theory of Sexual Ornamentation, among the first studies on sexual selection, supporting Darwin's concept against Wallace's alternative explanation of courtship behavior. In 1898, they produced On the Instincts and Habits of the Solitary Wasps, a work considered a scientific classic for its style, as well as its scholarship.[8] Unlike the later work of Fabre, which praised the supposed \"perfection\" of insect behavior, the Peckhams identified series of behaviors that were subject to natural selection. In 1905 they published a revised and enlarged edition entitled Wasps, Solitary and Social.[9][10]/nThe Peckhams were lifetime collaborators, as researchers and educators. From 1883 to 1909, they described 63 genera and 366 species. The North American Peckham Society is named after them. It is dedicated to salticid research; its irregular publication is titled Peckhamia.[11]/nPrior to later 1885, the Peckhams appear to have spent time in eastern Guatemala, as attested to in a series of papers on jumping spiders of the zone, culminating in a statement given in Peckham & Peckham 1896 (Attidae from Central America and Mexico) as \"a large part of our collection we made ourselves in Guatemala and Honduras\". They may also have collected some specimens themselves in Mexico, such as a few specimens in MCZ are labelled as \"Frontera\". In November 1912, the Alumnae Bulletin of Vassar reports that \"Elizabeth Gifford Peckham and her husband spent last winter in Mexico\".[12]/nThe salticid genus Peckhamia is named in their honor, along with at least 20 species and one subspecies:/nIn addition to the various taxa named after them, in 1929, Milwaukee Public Schools built a new junior high school, which was named Peckham Junior High School.

These studies were instrumental in mobilizing the interest of anti-TNF industry and foreshadowed the success of the first clinical trials performed in RA in 1994. Further work in his lab provided insights into the function of TNF in host defense and the structure and function of secondary lymphoid organs, a work that more recently evolved into the establishment of TNFRI and NFkB signals specifically in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) being of pivotal significance in the regulation of humoral B cell responses and autoimmunity. Moreover, George Kollias' group demonstrated TNF's causal effect in the development of combined Crohn's disease and polyarthritis, and the contribution of transmembrane versus soluble TNF in the pathogenic processes. These studies offered a better understanding of the physiological function of TNF in health and disease and rationalized potential complications or optimizations of anti-TNF therapies in other diseases such as in MS. More recently, George Kollias introduced a novel pathogenic principle to explain the cellular basis of TNF function in gut/joint axis diseases, including spondyloarthropathies, by showing that mesenchymal cells, namely synovial fibroblasts and intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts, are common pathogenic targets of TNF sufficient to drive the chronic inflammatory and destructive disease process.[5] Animal models developed in his lab have been distributed to numerous academic and industrial laboratories around the world (over 200 MTAs in the last ten years).

Synthetic guide RNA is a chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA; therefore, this discovery demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be used to edit the genome with relative ease.[22] Researchers worldwide have employed this method successfully to edit the DNA sequences of plants, animals, and laboratory cell lines.

From 2003 to 2016, she was the director of the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute in Glasgow, UK, moving back to London in 2016 to take up the role of Chief Scientist at CRUK and Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute./nAfter attending Gravesend Grammar School for Girls,[citation needed] Vousden gained a Bachelor of Science degree in genetics and microbiology (1978) and a PhD from Queen Mary College, University of London on the use of suppressor gene mutations to study transfer RNA redundancy in the fungus Coprinus.[8][9][10][11]/nVousden's early postdoctoral research positions were with Chris Marshall[12] at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK (1981\u201385) and Douglas Lowy[13] at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, United States (1985\u201387).[8][14]/nFrom 1987 to 1995, she led the Human Papillomavirus Group at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.[8][14] In 1995, she joined the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, USA,[14] serving successively as head of the Molecular Carcinogenesis section of the ABL-Basic Research Program (1995\u201397), director of the Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis Laboratory (1997\u201398), interim director of the ABL-Basic Research Program (1998\u201399) and chief of the Regulation of Cell Growth Laboratory, Division of Basic Sciences (1999\u20132002).[8][10]/nFrom 2003 to 2016, she was the director of the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute in Glasgow, UK, where she oversaw a \u00a315\u00a0million expansion.[14][15][16] She also led the institute's Tumour Suppression research group.[17] She also served on the Life Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize in 2014./nSince 2016, she has moved back to London to take up the role of CRUK Chief Scientist and Group Leader at the Francis Crick Institute.[18] In 2018, she was elected a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences./nVousden's early work focused on the molecular biology of human papillomaviruses (HPVs), which are associated with cervical cancer. With Douglas Lowy and others, she pinpointed the specific viral oncoproteins required by HPV-16 to immortalise epithelial cells.[19] She was also part of a group which showed that E6, one of the HPV-16 oncoproteins, binds to the human tumour suppressor protein p53 in vivo, resulting in its degradation.[20]/nVousden's recent research has centred on p53,[21] a gene which plays a critical role in preventing the development of tumours by inducing cells subject to stress, such as DNA damage, to commit suicide via the apoptosis mechanism. Her work has been important in delineating the mechanism of this process. With Katsunori Nakano, she discovered a key component in the apoptosis pathway triggered by p53, the protein PUMA (P53 Upregulated Modulator of Apoptosis).[22][23]/nTo prevent it being activated inappropriately, p53 is strictly controlled in the normal cell. Vousden discovered that a key element in this regulation is the protein Mdm2. With Allan Weissman and others, she showed that Mdm2 is a ubiquitin ligase which targets p53 for degradation by the proteasome, thus ensuring levels of the protein remain low when the cell is not under stress.[7][24][25]/nReactivating p53 can inhibit the growth of some tumours, making Mdm2 an attractive target for cancer therapeutics. As Mdm2 targets only a small number of proteins for destruction, an inhibitor might have few side effects.[24] A major focus of Vousden's recent work has been investigating the structure of Mdm2 and seeking molecules that inhibit it; a group of low-molecular-weight compounds (discovered in collaboration with the Department of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow) have recently shown promise in cell-culture studies.[24][26] Mdm2 inhibitors have also been discovered by researchers at Hoffmann\u2013La Roche and the Karolinska Institute.[24]/np53 can also help to prevent or repair minor damage to the genome under conditions of low stress. Vousden's group have recently discovered a novel p53-regulated protein, TIGAR (T-p53 Inducible Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator), which can reduce oxidative stress in cells and might mediate part of this effect of p53.[27]/nVousden is a fellow of the Royal Society (2003),[21] Royal Society of Edinburgh (2004)[1] and the Academy of Medical Sciences (2006);[28] she was also elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization in 2004.[29] The Institute of Cancer Research awarded her an Honorary Doctorate in Science (Medicine) in 2006.[30] She gave the Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins Memorial Lecture of the Biochemical Society in 2008.[31] She was awarded the Royal Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2009.

In 2002 Tarkowski with Anne McLaren won the Japan Prize for their discoveries concerning the early development of mammalian embryos.[5]/nIn 1950 Tarkowski was admitted to study at the Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences (currently the Faculty of Biology) University of Warsaw. He graduated in 1955 with M.Sc. degree. His Ph.D. was received in 1959, and in 1963 he reached a D.Sc. degree at the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw. In 1972 he was appointed professor.

Tarkowski initiated in 1950s formed the basis not only for modern mammalian developmental biology and progress in animal breeding, but also in such techniques as assisted reproduction (in vitro fertilisation) or preimplantational diagnostics. In 1959 Tarkowski showed that a single blastomere isolated from a 2-cell stage mouse embryo is fully able to develop and the result is healthy and fertile mouse (Tarkowski, 1959, Nature). His next achievement was, reported in 1961, birth of first chimaeric mice produced experimentally by injecting blastomeres from one embryo to genetically different embryo (Tarkowski, 1961;Nature). Since then the chimaera has become a useful tool, used in producing genetically modified animals (in this technique genetically engineered stem cells are aggregated with developing embryo. Chimaera obtained this way is phenotypically changed and passes it to the next generation). In 1966 Tarkowski developed a technique which enabled observing chromosome in oocytes, which has been widely used in early studies of embryo (Tarkowski, 1967; Cytogenetics). This publication is often cited, although has been publicised over 50 years ago. In later years professor Tarkowski with his collaborators showed for the first time in history that parthenogenetically activated mouse oocytes are able of developing until mid-gestation (Tarkowski, et al.,1970;Nature). It was a serious argument for the hypothesis of genomic imprinting.

It provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection.[citation needed]/nOver the following four years, Fisher showed that the transactivator gene tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame (ORF) disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaboration from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants.[citation needed]/nFisher moved from the US to the UK in 1987 to study human T cell development. She established the first human thymus organ cultures in 1990, based on studies pioneered by Owen and Jenkinson in the mouse.[citation needed] This refinement allowed cell-fate to be mapped in vitro and provided a system in which potential factors that shape the human T cell repertoire could be experimentally tested.[citation needed] She spent a further 3 years training in mouse genetics, transgenic and knockout technologies at the Institut de g\u00e9n\u00e9tique et de biologie mol\u00e9culaire et cellulaire (IGBMC) Strasbourg, before being invited by the Medical Research Council to establish a research team with her partner Matthias Merkenschlager at what was then the Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC).[citation needed] Fisher joined the CSC in 1993, and subsequently became its director in 2008.[citation needed] At the CSC her work has focused on understanding gene regulation during cell commitment. In January 2017, the CSC was renamed the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (MRC LMS).[citation needed]/nIn 1997, Fisher's group published an important paper[11] on the DNA-binding factor Ikaros, that at the time was presumed to be a transcriptional activator.[citation needed]  Fisher's group showed that Ikaros proteins unexpectedly localised to percentric heterochromatin in cycling lymphocytes in association with transcriptionally silent genes.[citation needed] This provided some of the first evidence that where a gene is located inside the nucleus may be relevant for its expression. The development of three dimensional (3D) immuno-FISH techniques by Fisher's team, in which the protein structure and the nuclear architecture of a sample remains preserved, was critical for revealing the spatial distribution of chromosomes and the genes within the nucleus.[citation needed] In the last 15 years, analogous approaches have been widely used to interrogate the relationship between gene function and nuclear organisation. For example, studies showed that Ikaros- target genes in T and B cells were recruited to pericentric heterochromatin domains only when gene silencing was inherited by daughter cells.[citation needed] This study, together with others, established that the nuclear location, physical compaction and local chromatin environment of many genes was important for maintaining heritable silencing. Subsequent studies to characterise the differences between transient and heritable/permanent silencing revealed that several silent genes that were assumed to replicate late during synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle (based on Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) detection of doublet signals), actually replicated much earlier (based on quantitative increases in DNA content). This discovery in 2003, led Fisher and Merkenschlager to hypothesis that \u2013 rather than altering the time of DNA replication \u2013 heritable gene silencing could retard chromatid separation and resolution. From this viewpoint they began a series of studies that have subsequently shown the involvement of cohesin complexes in gene regulation and in 2002, Fisher was awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in recognition of her early work on HIV, and the role of nuclear organisation in gene regulation./nSince 2003, Fisher has been studying gene regulation in embryonic stem cells (ES), as a model for understanding pluripotency, lineage commitment and lineage restriction.[citation needed] In 2006, she showed that the promoters of many lineage-specifying genes in ES cells were simultaneously enriched for modified histones thought to mark either active genes (such as acetylation of H3K9, di- and tri-methylation of H3K4), or repressed domains ( such as tri-methylation of H3K27).[citation needed] This discovery ran contrary to the prevailing dogma of the time: that chromatin markers of actively transcribed and inactive domains were mutually exclusive.[citation needed] The study was published in 2006, contemporaneously with similar reports from several US-based groups. suggesting that important developmental regulator genes might be poised for transcription in ES cells, yet repressed by the activity of Polycomb Repressor Complexes (PRCs).[citation needed]/nFisher was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2001 and awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in 2002 in recognition of her work on nuclear organisation and gene expression, as well as for her research on the molecular characterisation of the HIV/AIDS.[19]/nIn 2014, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Her nomination reads:/nAmanda Fisher is distinguished for her pioneering work on HIV pathogenesis, T lymphocyte development, embryonic stem cells and epigenetic gene regulation. She described the first active clones of HIV and discovered the functions of several HIV genes including tat, nef and vif. In T lymphocytes she showed that a gene's position within the nucleus is important for maintaining heritable gene silencing. In embryonic stem cells she showed that important developmental regulator genes can be \"poised\" for expression whilst being repressed by polycomb repressor complexes.[7]/nIn 2003 she was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) for excellence in her contributions to medicine and society.[8] Fisher organises and participates in a range of public engagement projects and events, and in recognition of this work she received an 'Outstanding Women in Science Award for communication in Science, Engineering Technology (SET) award in March 2010.

He has made seminal contributions to multiple aspects of bacterial pathogenesis, cell biology, innate immunity, and cell mediated immunity using L. monocytogenes as a model system and has helped to push forward the use of attenuated L. monocytogenes as an immunotherapeutic tool in the treatment of cancer./nDr. Portnoy got his start in microbiology in the lab of Dr. Sydney Rittenberg working on Bdellovibrio as an undergraduate at UCLA where he earned a B.A. in Bacteriology in 1978.  He next earned his Ph.D. in 1983 under the tutelage of Stanley Falkow first at the University of Washington finishing at Stanford University.  In the Falkow Lab, he worked on the conserved virulence plasmids in Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pestis,[2] and discovered what turned out to be the first effectors of type III secretion.[3] To further his appreciation of host cells, he did his postdoctoral fellowship in the Zanvil Cohn Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York, working with Jay Unkeless and Jeff Ravetch.  At Rockefeller University he worked on macrophage Fc receptors and lysosomal proteases./nIn 1986 Dr. Portnoy started his  independent lab at Washington University in St. Louis where he began his studies on Listeria monocytogenes.   In 1988, he joined the Department of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he collaborated with Dr. Lewis Tilney in the Biology Department and made the observation that L. monocytogenes spreads from one cell to another by exploiting a host cell system of actin polymerization.[4] His lab also defined the role of the listerial hemolysin in mediating dissolution of phagosomes.[5] In collaboration with Dr. Philip Youngman, he showed that expression of the L. monocytogenes hemolysin by Bacillus subtilis led to its growth inside of host cells.[6] Dr. Portnoy collaborated with Dr. Yvonne Paterson, who also arrived at Penn in 1988, on the use of L. monocytogenes as a recombinant vector-based vaccine for the induction of cell-mediated immunity.[7][8] Both Drs.

She remained at Yale for her PhD before completing her postdoctoral research fellowship at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[3]/nBesansky continued to work with the CDC as a scientist following her fellowship while simultaneously maintaining an adjunct assistant professor position at the University of Notre Dame. She was then promoted to the rank of associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences until 2002.[3] While in this role, Besansky collaborated with her husband Frank H. Collins to genetically engineer Anopheles gambiae as a response to Malaria. She focused on comparing the DNA from various gambiae populations in West Africa to determine whether they were interbreeding.[5] Besansky was then encouraged by Harvard University professor William Gelbart to write a report proposing the sequencing of a cluster of eight Anopheles malaria vectors, including multiple An. gambiae complex members. This resulted in funding for a pilot genome-sequencing project focusing on An. gambiae Mopti (M) and Savanna (S).[2] In 2005, Besansky was recognized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science for making \"significant contributions to understanding the molecular, population and evolutionary biology of Anopheline mosquitoes, major vectors of malaria in Africa.\"[6]/nOnce the results of her genome-sequencing project were published in 2010, Besansky was approved to start a cluster project that was upgraded to include 16 Anopheles species.[2] Her original pilot project's genomic analysis revealed that M and S varieties of the Anopholes gambiae species were evolving into two distinct species.[7] At the same time, she was appointed the Rev. John Cardinal O\u2019Hara, C.S.C. Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame.[8] In 2014, Besansky's second cluster project published the results of their investigation into the genetic differences between 16 Anopheles species. Their findings revealed a closer gene connection between the species and how it contributed to their flexibility to adapt to new environments and to seek out human blood.[9] In the same year, she was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.[10]/nBesansky continued to focus on gene sequencing which resulted in the sequencing of the genetic code of the Y chromosome in An. gambiae and closely related species in 2016 using long single-molecule sequencing technology and physical mapping of DNA directly to the Y chromosome.[2][11] Following this, Besansky was elected a Fellow of the Entomological Society of America and Royal Entomological Society.[1] In 2020, Besansky was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences for being an expert in the genomics of malaria vectors.[12]/nBesansky and her husband, tropical disease researcher Frank H.

Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He named oxygen (1778), recognizing it as an element, and also recognized hydrogen as an element (1783), opposing the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon (1787)[6] and discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same. His wife and laboratory assistant, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, became a renowned chemist in her own right./nLavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils, and an administrator of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale was one of the most hated components of the Ancien R\u00e9gime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents.[7] All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the French Revolution, he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco, and was guillotined./nAntoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parlement of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother.[8] Lavoisier began his schooling at the Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris (also known as the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760\u20131761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of Abb\u00e9 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time./nLavoisier's education was filled with the ideals of the French Enlightenment of the time, and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquer's dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by \u00c9tienne Condillac, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the French Academy of Sciences, France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban street lighting.[9] In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences.[10] In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France./nWhile Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public.[11][12][13][14] Lavoisier was a humanitarian\u2014he cared deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences.[12] The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.[12][13][14]/nThree years later in 1768, he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water. But, since the construction never commenced, he instead turned his focus to purifying the water from the Seine. This was the project that interested Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.[14]/nAdditionally, he was interested in air quality and spent some time studying the health risks associated with gunpowder's effect on the air.[13] In 1772, he performed a study on how to reconstruct the H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital, after it had been damaged by fire, in a way that would allow proper ventilation and clean air throughout.[14]/nAt the time, the prisons in Paris were known to be largely unlivable and the prisoners' treatment inhumane.[11] Lavoisier took part in investigations in 1780 (and again in 1791) on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions, suggestions which were largely ignored.[11][14]/nOnce a part of the Academy, Lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work.[13]/nLavoisier had a vision of public education having roots in \"scientific sociability\" and philanthropy.[13]/nLavoisier gained a vast majority of his income through buying stock in the General Farm, which allowed him to work on science full-time, live comfortably, and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community.[14] (It would also contribute to his demise during the Reign of Terror many years later.[15])/nIt was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time, and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist, so Lavoisier used his wealth to open a very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in France so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research.[11][14]/nHe also pushed for public education in the sciences. He founded two organizations, Lyc\u00e9e\u00a0[fr] and Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, which were created to serve as educational tools for the public. Funded by the wealthy and noble, the Lyc\u00e9e regularly taught courses to the public beginning in 1793.[13]/nAt the age of 26, around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a tax farming financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a wall around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city.[16] His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the Reign of Terror began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution./nLavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.[4] She was to play an important part in Lavoisier's scientific career\u2014notably, she translated English documents for him, including Richard Kirwan's Essay on Phlogiston and Joseph Priestley's research. In addition, she assisted him in the laboratory and created many sketches and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works. Madame Lavoisier edited and published Antoine's memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.[17]/nA portrait of Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier was painted by the famed artist Jacques-Louis David. Completed in 1788 on the eve of the Revolution, the painting was denied a customary public display at the Paris Salon for fear that it might inflame anti-aristocratic passions.[18]/nFor three years following his entry into the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Lavoisier's scientific activity diminished somewhat, for much of his time was taken up with official Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale business. He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment, Lavoisier showed that the \"earthy\" sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French monetary and taxation system to help the peasants./nThe Farmers General held a monopoly of the production, import and sale of tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. This revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: \"When a spirit of vitriol, aqua fortis or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise.\" Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco.  Of one vendor selling adulterated goods, he wrote \"His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated.\" Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed.[19] To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen.[20] To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.[21]/nLavoisier urged the establishment of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.[22]/nLavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French gunpowder greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792./nLavoisier was a formative influence in the formation of the Du Pont gunpowder business because he trained \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont, its founder, on gunpowder-making in France; the latter said that the Du Pont gunpowder mills \"would never have been started but for his kindness to me.\"[23]:\u200a40/nIn June 1791, Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish a newspaper, La Correspondance Patriotique. The plan was for this to include both reports of debates in the National Constituent Assembly as well as papers from the Academy of Sciences.[24] The revolution quickly disrupted the elder du Pont's first newspaper, but his son E.I. du Pont soon launched Le Republicain and published Lavoisier's latest chemistry texts.[23]:\u200a15/nLavoisier also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures[25][26] which in March 1791 recommended the adoption of the metric system.[27] The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the Convention on 1 August 1793.[28] Lavoisier was one of the 27 Farmers General who, by order of the Convention, were all to be detained. Although temporarily going into hiding, on 30 November 1793 he handed himself into the Port Royal convent for questioning. He claimed he had not operated on this commission for many years, having instead devoted himself to science.[29]/nLavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793, together with mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and several other members, for political reasons.[26]/nOne of his last major works was a proposal to the National Convention for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, helping to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.[30]/nAs the French Revolution gained momentum, attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and it was eventually abolished in March 1791.[31] In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed at the request of Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire.[28]/nOn 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defense, refuting the financial accusations, reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court, however, was inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing the goods of the Farmers General, it would recover huge sums for the state.[20] Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris, at the age of 50, along with his 27 co-defendants.[32]/nAccording to popular legend, the appeal to spare his life, in order that he could continue his experiments, was cut short by the judge, Coffinhal: \"La R\u00e9publique n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut \u00eatre suspendu.\" (\"The Republic needs neither scholars nor chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.\")[33] The judge Coffinhal himself would be executed less than three months later, in the wake of the Thermidorian reaction./nLavoisier's importance to science was expressed by Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying: \"Il ne leur a fallu qu'un moment pour faire tomber cette t\u00eate, et cent ann\u00e9es peut-\u00eatre ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable.\" (\"It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like.\")[34][35]/nA year and a half after his execution, Lavoisier was completely exonerated by the French government. During the White Terror, his belongings were delivered to his widow. A brief note was included, reading \"To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted\".[36]/nContrary to prevailing thought at the time, Lavoisier theorized that common air, or one of its components, combines with substances when they are burned.[37] He demonstrated this through experiment.[37]/nDuring late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of combustion, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when phosphorus burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that \"what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause.\"[citation needed]/nDuring 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly \"fixed air,\" and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled Opuscules physiques et chimiques (Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review, he made his first full study of the work of Joseph Black, the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, chalk (CaCO3), and the caustic form, for example, quicklime (CaO), lay in the fact that the former contained \"fixed air,\" not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be carbon dioxide (CO2), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO2.[citation needed]/nIn the spring of 1774, Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels, the results of which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was in combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist Joseph Priestley visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the red calx of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own research on this peculiar substance. The result was his memoir On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight, read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir, Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with charcoal, giving off Black's fixed air in the process.[38] When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air and that it was the air itself \"undivided, without alteration, without decomposition\" which combined with metals on calcination.[citation needed]/nAfter returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was \"five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air\". He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.[citation needed]/nLavoisier's researches included some of the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry.[39] In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of conservation of mass. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie: \"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\" Mikhail Lomonosov (1711\u20131765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey (1583\u20131645), Joseph Black (1728\u20131799), and Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810).[40]/nLavoisier, together with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy, submitted a new program for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled M\u00e9thode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry.[41]/nThe classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 33 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements.[42][43] The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown \"radicals\" of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and \"fluoric\" acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, baria, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the \"radicals\" of 19 organic acids./nThe acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the \"ic\" termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the \"ous\" ending./nSimilarly, salts of the \"ic\" acids were given the terminal letters \"ate,\" as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the \"ous\" acids terminated with the suffix \"ite,\" as in copper sulfite./nThe total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name \"copper sulfate\" with the old term \"vitriol of Venus.\" Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.[citation needed]/nLavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the widespread acceptance of the law of conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of Linnaeus, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley, Richard Kirwan, James Keir, and William Nicholson, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass.[44] Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, Jean Baptiste Biot, wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, \"one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning.\"[44] His opposition argued that precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasoning. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated:/nIf it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the exactitude scrupuleuse of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs de l'ordre demonstratif.[45]/nThe \"official\" version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period, Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but \"nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air\" or the \"eminently respirable part of the air\". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning \"acid former\".[38][46] He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle./nLavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his paper entitled R\u00e9flexions sur le phlogistique (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, now known as hydrogen, with \"dephlogisticated air\" (air in the process of combustion, now known to be oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted Cavendish's production of pure water by burning hydrogen in oxygen, but they interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of phlogiston theory. Lavoisier learned of Cavendish's experiment in June 1783 via Charles Blagden (before the results were published in 1784), and immediately recognized water as the oxide of a hydroelectric gas.[47]/nIn cooperation with Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (a combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).[44]/nDespite these experiments, Lavoisier's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water, attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with Jean-Baptiste Meusnier, Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel, allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in April 1784, reporting his figures to eight decimal places.[44] Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which used a pneumatic trough, a set of balances, a thermometer, and a barometer, all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus, convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier's theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment, however, proved subpar, as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was \"more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition\" of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries.[48]/nLavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie (Elementary Treatise on Chemistry), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of conservation of mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.[49] In any event, the Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation./nThe relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of respiration physiology. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782\u20131783 in association with Laplace. The result of this work was published in a memoir, \"On Heat.\" Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice calorimeter apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of 0 \u00b0C around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of carbon dioxide and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was, in fact, a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated, \"la respiration est donc une combustion,\" that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.[50]/nThis continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789\u20131790 in cooperation with Armand Seguin. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body metabolism and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the Revolution's disruption, but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field inspired similar research on physiological processes for generations./nLavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous)./nLavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction./nLavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a crystalline form of carbon./nHe was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer, an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these, he also created smaller, cheaper, more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.[51]/nOverall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.[52]/nFollowing his death, a collection comprising most of his scientific manuscripts and instruments was established by his relatives at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Cani\u00e8re in Puy-de-D\u00f4me.[53]/nMount Lavoisier in New Zealand's Paparoa Range was named after him in 1970 by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.[54]/nDuring his lifetime, Lavoisier was awarded a gold medal by the King of France for his work on urban street lighting (1766), and was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences (1768).[10] He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1775.[55]/nLavoisier's work was recognized as an International Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society, Acad\u00e9mie des sciences de L'institut de France and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chimique de France in 1999.[56] Antoine Laurent Lavoisier's Louis 1788 publication entitled M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique, published with colleagues Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy,[57] was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.[58][59]/nA number of Lavoisier Medals have been named and given in Lavoisier's honour, by organizations including the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 chimique de France, the International Society for Biological Calorimetry, and the DuPont company[60][61][62] He is also commemorated by the Franklin-Lavoisier Prize, marking the friendship of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin.

He was raised in Gainesville, Florida, by his father Thieo E. Hogen-Esch and his mother Cheryl H. St. George.[1] His parents both work at the University of Southern California. His father is a polymer chemist,[2] and his mother is a clinical instructor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences.[3][4] His brother, Tom Hogen-Esch is a Political Science and Urban Studies professor at Cal State Northridge.[5][6]/nHogenesch originally received a B.A. in History from the University of Southern California in 1989 followed by a B.S. in Biology in 1991. He was inspired to study chronobiology by Joseph Takahashi in the fall of 1992 after learning about the Drosophila clock in a lecture.[6] In 1999 Hogenesch completed a Ph.D. in Neuroscience at Northwestern University's Chicago campus, studying transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) and PAS protein domains.[7] Hogenesh was mentored by Chris Bradfield, now a professor of oncology and the Director of the Molecular and Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.[8] He continued his research on functional genomics as a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Steve A. Kay at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation.[6]/nIn March, 1997, Hogenesch was a neuroscience graduate student at Northwestern University in the laboratory of Christopher Bradfield, when he discovered five transcription factors in the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) domain superfamily during his thesis work.[9] These transcription factors were initially named MOP1-5.[10] Hogenesch\u2019s later characterization of MOP3, better known as BMAL1 or ARNTL, revealed in 1998 that its role as a partner of the bHLH-PAS transcription factor CLOCK was essential to the function of the mammalian circadian clock. BMAL1 and CLOCK are now the two most well recognized bHLH-PAS domain transcription factors.[11] Later work revealed that Bmal1 is the only clock gene without which the circadian clock fails to function in humans.[12]/nBMAL1 functions as a positive element in the circadian clock. It forms a heterodimer with CLOCK to initiate transcription of target genes that contain E-box sequences, such as Period and Cryptochrome in mice. The BMAL1:CLOCK complex is suppressed by the buildup of the PER:CRY heterodimers.[11]/nAfter receiving his Ph.D. in 1999, Hogenesch followed his Ph.D. mentor Christopher Bradfield to the University of Wisconsin-Madison and continued in his lab as a postdoctoral associate. During this time, Hogenesch focused on following up on his Ph.D. work.[13]/nLater in 1999, he became a postdoctoral associate with Steve A. Kay and Peter G. Schultz. Kay was employed by the University of California at San Diego and the Scripps Research Institute, while Schultz was employed at the Scripps Research Institute and was founder and director of The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) in La Jolla, CA.[14][15] Hogenesch started work on the human transcriptome and the mRNA characterization of the transcriptomes of humans, mice, and rats, which he would later continue as Director of Genomics at GNF.[16]/nHogenesch became the Program Manager of Genomics at GNF in 2000, and remained there until 2004.[16] During his time there, he accomplished the compilation of the complete human transcriptome, and also the mRNA characterization of the human, mouse, and rat transcriptomes.[9][17] These highly cited works, together cited over 3700 times, have been influential in the field of genome biology.[9][18] Hogenesch then brought together his work on the human and mouse transcriptomes into a gene atlas, which he made available as a tool for other genome biologists.[19]/nIn addition to characterizing transciptomes present in various organisms, Hogenesch has also spent time throughout his career determining which genes were regulated on a circadian schedule. Working with his colleagues he has determined that mRNA in plants,[20] flies,[21] mice,[22] and humans[23] all shows extensive circadian regulation. In mammals up to 43% of all genes are regulated according to a circadian clock.[24] Transcription for circadianly regulated mRNA shows regular peaks in morning and evening,[25] which then has implications for the regulation of drug targets.[26]/nIn 2004 Hogenesch left California to become a professor and the Director of Genome Technology at The Scripps Research Institute's other location in West Palm Beach, FL, where he continued his work on transcriptomes.[10] Hogenesch contributed to a study published in 2005 which used new RNAi genetic screening techniques to discover a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) known as NRON. NRON, a repressor of the protein NFAT, is one of the first well characterized examples of a ncRNAs involved in transcription regulation.[27][28][29]/nIn 2006, Hogenesch moved to the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania where he continues to study mammalian circadian clocks and genome function. One of his current research directions includes incorporating research on noncoding RNA, such as siRNA or hairpin RNA isolated by combining forward genetics and genomic screens.[18] He has used this technique on miRNA to examine signalling and cell survival.[30]/nOver the course of his career, Hogenesch has made numerous contributions to the understanding of the core clock mechanisms. He discovered the key proteins Bmal1 (Arntl), and Bmal2 early in his career. He was also on the team that discovered Rora to be an important regulator of Bmal1.[31] Rora is currently under investigation for a possible connection to autism, which may relate to its function as a circadian regulator.[32] Hogenesch has also contributed to the identification of hundreds more genes that modulate circadian rhythms in humans by using genome wide RNAi scanning.[33] More recently, he discovered new clock gene CHRONO using novel computer based machine learning techniques to prioritize clock gene candidates.[34][35]/nHogenesch has also contributed to the field by mentored scientists like Satchin Panda[36] and has collaborated with over 25 other scientists on a variety of papers that cover a range of topics including CREB signaling, NF-\u03baB signaling, TRP channels, melanopsin signaling, cell type specific splicing, noncoding RNA function, and RNA-seq methods and mapping algorithms.[37]/nHogenesh has pushed for the chronobiology community to create Wikipedia pages about genes through a project called Gene Wiki. The result has been the creation of pages about genes involved in the circadian clock such as ARNTL, as well as pages about chronobiologists like Ingeborg Beling.[6]/nHe has also been instrumental in creating the Gene Atlas. This project uses a database run by Hogenesch called the Circa database that lists time of activity of genes in different tissues.[24] As an open source database, it allows biologists and pharmaceutical researchers to determine the peak time of different genes and mRNA which can then be used to target drug treatments./nIn October 2014, Hogenesch's discovery that many proteins targeted by drugs experience circadian fluctuations made strides towards chronotherapy treatment.[38]  Further research has focused on the timing of drug administration with the goal of optimizing drug efficacy by allowing physicians to prescribe medicine to be taken when it is most effective and least likely to cause side effects.[39][19][40]", "26183559": "Gopi K.

This research has contributed to a paradigmatic shift in the field of protein evolution.[17][18] Balazs Papp, Csaba Pal, and Laurence Hurst studied molecular mechanisms underlying dosage sensitivity.[19] They specifically tested what is now known as the dosage balance hypothesis.[20] The hypothesis offers a synthesis on seemingly unrelated problems such as the evolution of dominance, gene duplicability and co-evolution of protein complexsubunits.  In 2007, Pal and colleagues demonstrated that antagonistic co-evolution with parasites has a large impact on the evolution of bacterial mutation rate.[21] This paper showed how biotic interactions shape mutation rate evolution./nMore recently, the Pal lab explored the consequences of compensatory adaptation on gene content evolution.[22] It is well known that while core cellular processes are generally conserved during evolution, the underlying genes differ somewhat between related species. They demonstrated that gene loss initiates adaptive genomic changes that rapidly restores fitness, but this process has substantial pleiotropic effects on cellular physiology and evolvability upon environmental change.[22]/nThe Pal lab has also contributed to the nascent field of evolutionary systems biology.[23] Their research focused on understanding the extent to which evolution is predictable at the molecular level. Using genome-scale metabolic network modelling combined with experimental tools they studied key issues in evolution, such as mutational robustness,[24] horizontal gene transfer,[25] genome reduction,[26] epistasis,[27][28] promiscuous enzyme reactions,[29] and complex adaptations.[30]/nCsaba Pal's laboratory currently studies the problem of antibiotic resistance. By combining laboratory evolution, genome sequencing, and functional analysis, they charted the map of evolutionary trade-offs between antibiotics. They found that multidrug resistance mutations in bacteria simultaneously enhance sensitivity to many other unrelated drugs (collateral sensitivity), and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms.[31]/nFinally, the Pal lab is an advocate of the emerging field of evolutionary genome engineering.[32][33] Genome engineering enables the modification of specific genomic locations in a directed and combinatorial manner, and allow studying central evolutionary issues in which natural genetic variation is limited or biased. However, current tools have been optimized for a few laboratory model strains, lead to the accumulation of numerous undesired, off-target modifications, and demand extensive modification of the host genome prior to large-scale editing.

Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage. He was 59 at the time of his second marriage to Grace, and died when Alexander was seven.[9]/nFleming went to Loudoun Moor School and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to Kilmarnock Academy before moving to London, where he attended the Royal Polytechnic Institution.[10] After working in a shipping office for four years, the twenty-year-old Alexander Fleming inherited some money from an uncle, John Fleming. His elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to him that he should follow the same career, and so in 1903, the younger Alexander enrolled at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in Paddington (now part of Imperial College London); he qualified with an MBBS degree from the school with distinction in 1906.[9]/nFleming, who was a private in the London Scottish Regiment of the Volunteer Force from 1900[5] to 1914,[11] had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school. The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team, suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir Almroth Wright, a pioneer in vaccine therapy and immunology. In 1908, he gained a BSc degree with gold medal in Bacteriology, and became a lecturer at St Mary's until 1914./nCommissioned lieutenant in 1914 and promoted captain in 1917,[11] Fleming served throughout World War I in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and was Mentioned in Dispatches. He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the Western Front in France. In 1918 he returned to St Mary's Hospital, where he was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the University of London in 1928. In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the University of Edinburgh for a term of three years.[9]/nDuring World War I, Fleming with Leonard Colebrook and Sir Almroth Wright joined the war efforts and practically moved the entire Inoculation Department of St Mary's to the British military hospital at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Serving as a temporary lieutenant of the Royal Army Medical Corps, he witnessed the death of many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds. Antiseptics, which were used at the time to treat infected wounds, he observed, often worsened the injuries.[12] In an article published in the medical journal The Lancet in 1917, he described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glassblowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during the war. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach.[13] Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.[9]/nAt St Mary's Hospital, Fleming continued his investigations into bacteria culture and antibacterial substances. As his research scholar at the time V. D. Allison recalled, Fleming was not a tidy researcher and usually expected unusual bacterial growths in his culture plates. Fleming had teased Allison of his \"excessive tidiness in the laboratory\", and Allison rightly attributed such untidiness as the success of Fleming's experiments, and said, \"[If] he had been as tidy as he thought I was, he would not have made his two great discoveries.\"[14]/nIn late 1921, while he was maintaining agar plates for bacteria, he found that one of the plates was contaminated with bacteria from the air. When he added nasal mucus, he found that the mucus inhibited the bacterial growth.[15] Surrounding the mucus area was a clear transparent circle (1\u00a0cm from the mucus), indicating the killing zone of bacteria, followed by a glassy and translucent ring beyond which was an opaque area indicating normal bacterial growth. In the next test, he used bacteria maintained in saline that formed a yellow suspension. Within two minutes of adding fresh mucus, the yellow saline turned completely clear. He extended his tests using tears, which were contributed by his co-workers. As Allison reminisced, saying, \"For the next five or six weeks, our tears were the source of supply for this extraordinary phenomenon. Many were the lemons we used (after the failure of onions) to produce a flow of tears... The demand by us for tears was so great, that laboratory attendants were pressed into service, receiving threepence for each contribution.\"[14]/nHis further tests with sputum, cartilage, blood, semen, ovarian cyst fluid, pus, and egg white showed that the bactericidal agent was present in all of these.[16] He reported his discovery before the Medical Research Club in December and before the Royal Society the next year but failed to stir any interest, as Allison recollected:/nI was present at this [Medical Research Club] meeting as Fleming's guest. His paper describing his discovery was received with no questions asked and no discussion, which was most unusual and an indication that it was considered to be of no importance. The following year he read a paper on the subject before the Royal Society, Burlington House, Piccadilly and he and I gave a demonstration of our work. Again with one exception little comment or attention was paid to it.[14]/nReporting in the 1 May 1922 issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences under the title \"On a remarkable bacteriolytic element found in tissues and secretions\", Fleming wrote:/nIn this communication I wish to draw attention to a substance present in the tissues and secretions of the body, which is capable of rapidly dissolving certain bacteria. As this substance has properties akin to those of ferments I have called it a \"Lysozyme\", and shall refer to it by this name throughout the communication. The lysozyme was first noticed during some investigations made on a patient suffering from acute coryza.[15]/nThis was the first recorded discovery of lysozyme. With Allison, he published further studies on lysozyme in October issue of the British Journal of Experimental Pathology the same year.[17] Although he was able to obtain larger amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, the enzyme was only effective against small counts of harmless bacteria, and therefore had little therapeutic potential. This indicates one of the major differences between pathogenic and harmless bacteria.[12]\nDescribed in the original publication, \"a patient suffering from acute coryza\"[15] was later identified as Fleming himself. His research notebook dated 21 November 1921 showed a sketch of the culture plate with a small note: \u201cStaphyloid coccus from A.F.'s nose.\"[16] He also identified the bacterium present in the nasal mucus as Micrococcus Lysodeikticus, giving the species name (meaning \"lysis indicator\" for its susceptibility to lysozymal activity).[18] The species was reassigned as Micrococcus luteus in 1972.[19] The \"Fleming strain\" (NCTC2665) of this bacterium has become a model in different biological studies.[20][21] The importance of lysozyme was not recognised, and Fleming was well aware of this, in his presidential address at the Royal Society of Medicine meeting on 18 October 1932, he said:/nI choose lysozyme as the subject for this address for two reasons, firstly because I have a fatherly interest in the name, and, secondly, because its importance in connection with natural immunity does not seem to be generally appreciated.[22]/nIn his Nobel lecture on 11 December 1945, he briefly mentioned lysozyme, saying, \"Penicillin was not the first antibiotic I happened to discover.\"[23] It was only towards the end of the 20th century that the true importance of Fleming's discovery in immunology was realised as lysozyme became the first antimicrobial protein discovered that constitute part of our innate immunity.[24][25]/nOne sometimes finds what one is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world's first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I suppose that was exactly what I did./nBy 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of staphylococci. He was already well known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher. In 1928, he studied the variation of Staphylococcus aureus grown under natural condition, after the work of Joseph Warwick Bigger, who discovered that the bacterium could grow into a variety of types (strains).[27] On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent a holiday with his family at Suffolk. Before leaving for his holiday, he inoculated staphylococci on culture plates and left them on a bench in a corner of his laboratory.[16] On his return, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\".[28] Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Pryce, who reminded him, \"That's how you discovered lysozyme.\"[29] He identified the mould as being from the genus Penicillium. He suspected it to be P. chrysogenum, but a colleague Charles J. La Touche identified it as P. rubrum. (It was later corrected as P. notatum and then officially accepted as P. chrysogenum; in 2011, it was resolved as P. rubens.)[30][31]/nThe laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington. The source of the fungal contaminant was established in 1966 as coming from La Touche's room, which was directly below Fleming's.[32][33]/nFleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that the culture broth contained an antibacterial substance. He investigated its anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other Gram-positive pathogens that cause scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis and diphtheria, but not typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, which are caused by Gram-negative bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, although this bacterium is Gram-negative. After some months of calling it \"mould juice\" or \"the inhibitor\", he gave the name penicillin on 7 March 1929 for the antibacterial substance present in the mould.[34]/nFleming presented his discovery on 13 February 1929 before the Medical Research Club. His talk on \"A medium for the isolation of Pfeiffer's bacillus\" did not receive any particular attention or comment. Henry Dale, the then Director of National Institute for Medical Research and chair of the meeting, much later reminisced that he did not even sense any striking point of importance in Fleming's speech.[16] Fleming published his discovery in 1929 in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology,[35] but little attention was paid to the article. His problem was the difficulty of producing penicillin in large amounts, and moreover, isolation of the main compound. Even with the help of Harold Raistrick and his team of biochemists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, chemical purification was futile. \"As a result, penicillin languished largely forgotten in the 1930s\", as Milton Wainwright described.[36]/nAs late as in 1936, there was no appreciation for penicillin. When Fleming talked of its medical importance at the Second International Congress of Microbiology held in London,[37][38] no one believed him. As Allison, his companion in both the Medical Research Club and international congress meeting, remarked the two occasions:/n[Fleming at the Medical Research Club meeting] suggested the possible value of penicillin for the treatment of infection in man. Again there was a total lack of interest and no discussion. Fleming was keenly disappointed, but worse was to follow. He read a paper on his work on penicillin at a meeting of the International Congress of Microbiology, attended by the foremost bacteriologists from all over the world. There was no support for his views on its possible future value for the prevention and treatment of human infections and discussion was minimal. Fleming bore these disappointments stoically, but they did not alter his views or deter him from continuing his investigation of penicillin.[14]/nIn 1941, the British Medical Journal reported that \"[Penicillin] does not appear to have been considered as possibly useful from any other point of view.\"[39][40][32]/nIn Oxford, Ernst Boris Chain and Edward Abraham were studying the molecular structure of the antibiotic. Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin.[41][42] Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned Howard Florey, Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked \"Good God! I thought he was dead.\"[43]/nNorman Heatley suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Sir William Dunn School of Pathology was involved in its production. After the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.[44][45]/nFleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the \"Fleming Myth\" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. Sir Henry Harris summed up the process in 1998 as: \"Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.\"[46] The discovery of penicillin and its subsequent development as a prescription drug mark the start of modern antibiotics.[47]/nIn his first clinical trial, Fleming treated his research scholar Stuart Craddock who had developed severe infection of the nasal antrum (sinusitis). The treatment started on 9 January 1929 but without any effect. It probably was due to the fact that the infection was with influenza bacillus (Haemophilus influenzae), the bacterium which he had found unsusceptible to penicillin.[32] Fleming gave some of his original penicillin samples to his colleague-surgeon Arthur Dickson Wright for clinical test in 1928.[48][49] Although Wright reportedly said that it \"seemed to work satisfactorily\",[50] there are no records of its specific use. Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at the Royal Infirmary in Sheffield and former student of Fleming, was the first to use penicillin successfully for medical treatment.[36] He cured eye infections (conjunctivitis) of one adult and three infants (neonatal conjunctivitis) on 25 November 1930.[51]/nFleming also successfully treated severe conjunctivitis in 1932.[3][52][53] Keith Bernard Rogers, who had joined St Mary's as medical student in 1929,[54] was captain of the London University rifle team and was about to participate in an inter-hospital rifle shooting competition when he developed conjunctivitis.[55][56][57] Fleming applied his penicillin and cured Rogers before the competition.[3][52][58] It is said that the \"penicillin worked and the match was won.\" However, the report that \"Keith was probably the first patient to be treated clinically with penicillin ointment\"[56] is no longer true as Paine's medical records showed up.[34]/nThere is a popular assertion both in popular and scientific literature that Fleming largely abandoned penicillin work in the early 1930s.[59][60][61][62] In his review of Andr\u00e9 Maurois's The Life of Sir Alexander Fleming, Discoverer of Penicillin, William L. Kissick went so far as to say that \"Fleming had abandoned penicillin in 1932... Although the recipient of many honors and the author of much scientific work, Sir Alexander Fleming does not appear to be an ideal subject for a biography.\"[63] This is false, as Fleming continued to pursue penicillin research.[49][64] As late as in 1939, Fleming's notebook shows attempts to make better penicillin production using different media.[34] In 1941, he published a method for assessment of penicillin effectiveness.[65] As to the chemical isolation and purification, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford took up the research to mass-produce it, which they achieved with support from World War II military projects under the British and US governments.[66]/nBy mid-1942, the Oxford team produced the pure penicillin compound as yellow powder.[67] In August 1942, Harry Lambert (an associate of Fleming's brother Robert) was admitted to St Mary's Hospital due to a life-threatening infection of the nervous system (streptococcal meningitis).[68] Fleming treated him with sulphonamides, but Lambert's condition deteriorated. He tested the antibiotic susceptibility and found that his penicillin could kill the bacteria. He requested Florey for the isolated sample. Florey sent the incompletely purified sample, which Fleming immediately administered into Lambert's spinal canal. Lambert showed signs of improvement the very next day,[14] and completely recovered within a week.[3][69] Fleming published the clinical case in The Lancet in 1943.[70]/nUpon this medical breakthrough, Allison informed the British Ministry of Health of the importance of penicillin and the need for mass production. The War Cabinet was convinced of the usefulness upon which Sir Cecil Weir, Director General of Equipment, called for a meeting on the mode of action on 28 September 1942.[71][72] The Penicillin Committee was created on 5 April 1943. The committee consisted of Weir as chairman, Fleming, Florey, Sir Percival Hartley, Allison and representatives from pharmaceutical companies as members. The main goals were to produce penicillin rapidly in large quantities with collaboration of American companies, and to supply the drug exclusively for Allied armed forces.[14] By D-Day in 1944, enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded of the Allied troops.[73]/nFleming also discovered very early that bacteria developed antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. Almroth Wright had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out\u00a0... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted.\"[74] He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.[75]/nIt had been experimentally shown in 1942 that S. aureus could develop penicillin resistance under prolonged exposure.[76] Elaborating the possibility of penicillin resistance in clinical conditions in his Nobel Lecture, Fleming said:/nThe time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant.[23]/nIt was around that time that the first clinical case of penicillin resistance was reported.[77]/nOn 24 December 1915, Fleming married a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of Killala, County Mayo, Ireland. Their only child, Robert Fleming (1924\u20132015), became a general medical practitioner. After his first wife's death in 1949, Fleming married Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas, a Greek colleague at St. Mary's, on 9 April 1953; she died in 1986.[78]/nFleming came from a Presbyterian background, while his first wife Sarah was a (lapsed) Roman Catholic. It is said that he was not particularly religious, and their son Robert was later received into the Anglican church, while still reportedly inheriting his two parents' fairly irreligious disposition.[79]/nWhen Fleming learned of Robert D. Coghill and Andrew J. Moyer patenting the method of penicillin production in the United States in 1944,[80] he was furious, and commented:/nI found penicillin and have given it free for the benefit of humanity. Why should it become a profit-making monopoly of manufacturers in another country?[14]/nFrom 1921 until his death in 1955, Fleming owned a country home named \"The Dhoon\" in Barton Mills, Suffolk.[4][81]/nOn 11 March 1955, Fleming died at his home in London of a heart attack. His ashes are buried in St Paul's Cathedral.[2]/nFleming's discovery of penicillin changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of useful antibiotics; penicillin has saved, and is still saving, millions of people around the world.[82]/nThe laboratory at St Mary's Hospital where Fleming discovered penicillin is home to the Fleming Museum, a popular London attraction. His alma mater, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, merged with Imperial College London in 1988. The Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington campus was opened in 1998, where his son Robert and his great-granddaughter Claire were presented to the Queen; it is now one of the main preclinical teaching sites of the Imperial College School of Medicine./nHis other alma mater, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the University of Westminster) has named one of its student halls of residence Alexander Fleming House, which is near to Old Street./nIt was a discovery that would change the course of history. The active ingredient in that mould, which Fleming named penicillin, turned out to be an infection-fighting agent of enormous potency. When it was finally recognized for what it was, the most efficacious life-saving drug in the world, penicillin would alter forever the treatment of bacterial infections. By the middle of the century, Fleming's discovery had spawned a huge pharmaceutical industry, churning out synthetic penicillins that would conquer some of mankind's most ancient scourges, including syphilis, gangrene and tuberculosis.[87]/nBy 1942, penicillin, produced as pure compound, was still in short supply and not available for clinical use. When Fleming used the first few samples prepared by the Oxford team to treat Harry Lambert who had streptococcal meningitis,[3] the successful treatment was a major news, particularly popularised in The Times. Wright was surprised to discover that Fleming and the Oxford team were not mentioned, though Oxford was attributed as the source of the drug. Wright wrote to the editor of The Times, which eagerly interviewed Fleming, but Florey prohibited the Oxford team from seeking media coverage. As a consequence, only Fleming was widely publicised in the media,[94] which led to the misconception that he was entirely responsible for the discovery and development of the drug.[95] Fleming himself referred to this incident as \"the Fleming myth.\"[96][97]/nThe popular story[98] of Winston Churchill's father paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young Winston from death is false.[95] According to the biography, Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution by Kevin Brown, Alexander Fleming, in a letter[99] to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,[100] described this as \"A wondrous fable.\" Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during World War II. Churchill was saved by Lord Moran, using sulphonamides, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in Carthage in Tunisia in 1943. The Daily Telegraph and The Morning Post on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug sulphapyridine, known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by May & Baker Ltd, Dagenham, Essex \u2013 a subsidiary of the French group Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as \"This admirable M&B\".[101] It is highly probable that the correct information about the sulphonamide did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, Prontosil, had been a discovery by the German laboratory Bayer, and as Britain was at war with Germany at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.[citation needed]", "34178962": "Bryan Thomas Grenfell OBE FRS[3] (born 1954)[2] is a British population biologist and the Kathryn Briger and Sarah Fenton Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Public Affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.[1][4]/nGrenfell earned a Bachelor of Science degree with honours from Imperial College London, and DPhil in biology from the University of York in 1981.[5]/nAfter his DPhil, Grenfell spent a post-doctoral period at Imperial College London, with Roy Anderson, before joining the faculty at the University of Sheffield.

He developed an early interest in philosophy. While attending the City College of New York for his bachelor's degree (Chemistry, 1922), he became interested in chemical physics research. After receiving his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Columbia University (both in Chemistry) in 1925, Murray Shear took a position as a research chemist in the pediatric research laboratory at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, where he studied the chemistry of rickets. By 1926, Shear had become an administrative officer at the hospital, and in 1931, he held the concurrent position of instructor in pediatrics at the Long Island Medical School. He was also a member of the Columbia faculty from 1923 to 1925.[1]/nIn 1930, the Public Health Service (PHS) Special Laboratory of Cancer Investigations opened a facility at Harvard Medical School to conduct research on the biology, chemistry, and physics of cancer. The head of the laboratory, Joseph Schereschewsky, recruited Shear to be a biochemist. Shear's early research involved the effect of calcium on tumor growth, but, seeking agents to halt the growth of cancer cells, he turned to studies on bacterial toxins. In 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt signed an act establishing the National Cancer Institute (NCI). There followed the consolidation of the PHS facilities and the Harvard laboratory. They moved to the newly built NCI building in Bethesda, Maryland.[2]/nShear's research interests included the effect of chemicals on cancer. He investigated how the molecular structure of chemicals relates to cancer growth. In 1938, he discovered that some chemicals may not cause cancer themselves but can promote cancer growth when found in conjunction with other chemicals. He called such cancer-enabling substances \"co-carcinogens.\" During the 1940s, Shear was instrumental in setting up a program to screen chemicals for their effects on cancer cells growing in culture dishes. This program was a precursor of the NCI's large screening programs to identify potential anti-cancer drugs.[3]/nHe described the earliest accounts of cancer chemotherapy in a series of articles in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1944. With his collaborators at the institute, Shear was able to isolate and purify a bacteria (Bacillus prodigious or Serratia marcescens) effective in causing a hemorrhagic destruction of tumors in mice without fatal effects for the animals.[4]/nIn 1947, Shear became chief biochemist and chairman of the Chemotherapy Section. He was appointed chief of the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology in 1951, serving until 1964. From 1964 to 1969, he served as a special adviser to the institute's director until his retirement in 1969. During his career, Shear also served as president of the American Association for Cancer Research and secretary-general of the International Union Against Cancer. He has been widely regarded as the \"Father of Chemotherapy.\"\n[1][2][3]/nHe was also among the first scientists who detected the relationship of air pollution to cancer.

Since 1999, he is also external professor at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, USA.[1]/nWagner's work revolves around the robustness of biological systems, and about their ability to innovate, that is, to create novel organisms and traits that help them survive and reproduce. Robustness is the ability of a biological system to withstand perturbations, such as DNA mutations and environmental change. Early in his career Wagner developed a widely used mathematical model for gene regulatory circuits,[2] (Wagner's gene network model) and used this model to demonstrate that natural selection can increase the robustness of such circuits to DNA mutations.[3] Experimental work in Wagner's Z\u00fcrich laboratory showed that proteins can evolve robustness to perturbations.[4] One source of robustness to mutations are redundant duplicate genes. Natural selection can maintain their redundancy and the ensuing robustness.[5][6] However, more important than redundancy, Wagner has argued, is the \u201cdistributed robustness\u201d of complex biological systems, which arises from the cooperation of multiple different parts, such as proteins in a regulatory network.[7]/nWagner showed that robustness can accelerate innovation in biological evolution, because it helps organisms tolerate otherwise deleterious mutations that can help create new and useful traits.[8] In this way, robust transcription factor binding sites, for example, can facilitate the evolution of new gene expression.[9] An additional consequence of robustness is that evolving populations of organisms can accumulate cryptic genetic variation, inconsequential variation that may provide benefits in some environments.  Wagner's laboratory showed experimentally that such cryptic variation can indeed accelerate the evolution of an RNA enzyme to react with a new substrate molecule.[10] Wagner has argued that robustness can also help resolve the long-standing neutralism-selectionism controversy, which revolves around the question whether frequent neutral mutations \u2013 a consequence of robustness \u2013 are important for Darwinian evolution.[11] The reason is that neutral mutations are important stepping stones to later evolutionary adaptations and innovations.[11] Robust systems can also bring forth useful traits \u2013 potential exaptations \u2013 that arise as mere by-products of other, adaptive traits, which can help explain the great abundance of exaptations in life's evolution.[12]/nIn 2011 Wagner proposed a theory of innovation in which \u201cinnovability\u201d \u2013 the ability of living systems to create innovations \u2013 is a consequence of their robustness, which in turn results from their exposure to ever-changing environments.[13] One central element of the theory are large networks of genotypes with the same phenotypes, which populations of organisms can explore through DNA mutations, and which facilitate the origin of innovations.[13]/nWagner's work has also contributed to long-standing philosophical problems in biology, such as the role of causality and randomness in biological evolution,[14][15] and to our understanding of the relationship between innovation in  human technological and biological evolution, such as the importance of technology standards for innovation.[16]/nWagner has published more than 170 articles, a series of book chapters and four books./nScientific articles/nBooks", "43157460": "Gabriel Waksman FMedSci, FRS, is Courtauld professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at University College London (UCL), and professor of structural and molecular biology at Birkbeck College, University of London.

The Waksman laboratory primarily uses X-ray Crystallography and Electron Microscopy to determine 3D structures as well as biochemical and biophysical techniques to uncover the mechanisms used by these nanomachines.[citation needed]/nThese systems are present in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. They form multi-megadalton machines embedded in membranes and are responsible for the secretion of both proteins and nucleic acid substrates. They play major roles in pathogenicity of, for example, Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of ulcers. They also mediate transfer of plasmid DNAs during conjugation, a process that leads to the spread of antibiotics resistance genes. T4S systems are composed of 12 proteins named VirB1-11 and VirD4 that assemble into a formidable nanomachine of more than 3 megadalton in size and spanning the 2 membranes of Gram-negative bacteria.[1][2][3][4]/nBacterial pili are hair-like surface-exposed organelles. They are responsible for recognition of and attachment to the host and thus, are also crucial virulence factors. Pili are polymer of protein subunits, the assembly of which requires accessory proteins. The Waksman lab engages in research on pili assembled by the Chaperone-Usher (CU) pathway. (CU) pili have clear relevance in the pathogenicity of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, where CU pili mediate bacterial tropism to the bladder to cause cystitis or to the kidney to cause pyolenephritis. CU pili require two accessory proteins for biogenesis: a chaperone that stabilises pilus subunits and ferries them to an assembly platform, the usher, the second accessory protein required in this system. The usher is an extraordinary molecular nanomachine embedded in the outer membrane. It drives subunit recruitment, polymerisation and secretion.[5][6][7][8][9][10]/nWaksman obtained his PhD in Fundamental Biochemistry at the University of Paris in 1982 and after military service in Ivory Coast, worked for Rhone Poulenc Agrochimie as staff scientist.

Exploring the utility of using the squid-vibrio symbiosis model as a means to investigate the influence of microgravity on bacterial-induced animal development, her study suggested that this model is adaptable to experimental manipulation in a space environment and can offer significant insights into the role played by symbiotic bacteria in the natural development of animal tissues.[6] While investigating the function of Hfq in an animal-microbe symbiosis during simulated microgravity conditions, she determined that simulated microgravity can impede the expression of Hfq, which plays an important role in the mutualistic association amongst V. fischeri and its animal host.[7] In her assessment of host-microbe interactions in microgravity, it was revealed that microgravity conditions can disrupt these interactions, leading to a shift in the association towards pathogenicity and stressed the importance of comprehending microbial fitness under microgravity environments to uphold harmonious homeostasis between plants, humans, and their respective microbiomes during spaceflight.[8]/nFoster has designed and completed several spaceflight experiments that examine the effects of spaceflight on beneficial interactions between animals and microbes. She has had experiments aboard the last two space shuttle missions STS-134 and STS-135 and most recently completed an experiment aboard SpaceX CRS-22./nFoster's research on microbialites has focused on the formation, structure, and ecological significance of these unique sedimentary deposits, shedding light on the diverse microbial communities that shape their development and the environmental conditions that support their growth. Her early research has uncovered the mechanisms underlying thrombolytic microbialite formation, while also identifying a unique microbial community composition predominantly dominated by bacteria from the Alphaproteobacteria taxa and Cyanobacteria, with a comparatively low diversity of eukaryotic microorganisms.[9] In related research, her work investigated the mechanisms responsible for the formation of microbialites and the potential adaptations and modifications of their surrounding environment by these dynamic ecosystems while also identifying several general processes linked to mineral precipitation in various habitats.[10] While examining the microbial diversity and Mineralogy in the Hypersaline Storr's Lake, her molecular analysis led to the identification of 12 dominant bacterial phyla and also established the presence of both aragonite and Mg-calcite in certain microbialite morphotypes using X-ray diffraction studies.[11]/nFoster has conducted research on stromatolites, with a particular focus on their characterization and astrobiological implications. While examining the diversity of cyanobacteria composing stromatolites located in Highbourne Cay, The Bahamas, her work has provided insights into the microbial diversity and ecology of stromatolites and revealed that the genetic diversity of the cyanobacterial populations within the stromatolites exceeds prior estimates, thereby indicating that the mechanisms underlying stromatolite formation and accretion may be more intricate than previously assumed.[12] Further, her study of present-day marine stromatolites in the Exuma Cays, in The Bahamas revealed a diverse and intricate array of microorganisms, whose spatial distribution appeared linked to the physical structure of the formations. It was suggested that distinct microorganisms performed distinct functions, contributing to the precipitation of calcium carbonate and facilitating the binding of sediment particles.[13] Her research on the microbial diversity in modern stromatolites highlighted the crucial role of metagenomic sequencing approaches in comprehending the molecular-level microbial diversity and functional complexity of these dynamic ecosystems, emphasizing that these approaches have facilitated a higher resolution characterization of stromatolite diversity and function.[14]", "68749327": "Inna Sekirov is a medical microbiologist and a physician scientist.[1] Sekirov is the Program Head for TB/Mycobacteriology at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of British Columbia[2] in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

He graduated in 2007 with a PhD on embryonic stem cell differentiation and transgenesis,[3] and in 2008, he received his Doctor of Medicine (MD) also from the University of Geneva./nIn 2008, he joined the Laboratory of Ueli Schibler at the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva for a postdoctoral training. Here, he developed a new technology allowing ultra-sensitive monitoring of transcriptional kinetics in single living cells by luminescence microscopy. It allowed to demonstrate that mammalian genes are transcribed during short time windows, called transcriptional bursts, which have widely different kinetics properties for different genes. The key finding was that most mammalian genes have to transit through a refractory period when they are inactive before they can be activated again.[4] Suter and colleges employed this approach to disentangle the effect of physiological stimuli on different bursting parameters.[5] They also demonstrated the dynamic interactions of circadian transcription factors and their regulation by the proteasome.[6]/nIn 2011, he became a post-doctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Xiaoliang Sunney Xie at Harvard University. Together with Christof Gebhardt, Suter developed a new technology allowing to visualize and measure the residence time of single molecules of transcription factors binding to DNA.[7] Using this technology, they were able to determine the residence time of various transcription factors on DNA and allowed for the measurement of the fraction of DNA-bound molecules in the transcription factor population. Thereby they were able to distinguish three different modes of DNA binding (dimeric, monomeric, and indirect), and to simultaneously record DNA binding events of two heterodimeric partners. By extending the technology to determine the localization of single molecules of RNA polymerase II in mammalian nuclei, they showed that polymerases are mostly homogenously distributed throughout the nucleus, hence, arguing against a static model of clustering in transcription factories.[8]/nSince 2013 he has been an professor at EPFL, where he heads the Suter Lab at the Institute of Bioengineering of the School of Life Sciences.[1][2]/nThe Suter laboratory is developing quantitative approaches to study gene expression in single living cells, and applying those to understand the molecular bases of cell fate decisions./nUsing luminescence microscopy for ultrasensitive monitoring of transcription in single embryonic stem (ES) cells, they studied the transmission of transcriptional activity through cell division. They discovered that the time scales of transcriptional memory varied over a range of two to ten cell cycles for different mammalian genes.[9] They developed a novel approach based on a fluorescent timer to simultaneously monitor protein synthesis and degradation rates in live cells. In combination with pulse-chase protein labeling, they were able to determine how changes in synthesis and degradation rates shape fluctuations of proteins levels during the cell cycle. They also found that protein degradation rates varied broadly between individual cells, but were correlated to synthesis rates at the single cell level. This discovery suggests that cells are able to coordinate protein synthesis and degradation to buffer protein level variability and thereby to ensure robust control of protein homeostasis.[10][11]/nThe Suter Lab is also interested in the impact of transcription factor fluctuations on cell fate decisions. They investigated whether fluctuations in the expression levels of OCT4 and SOX2, two master regulators of pluripotency, impact the differentiation potential of ES cells. They found that small endogenous fluctuations of OCT4 and to a lesser extent SOX2 significantly impact the potential of ES cells to commit to different germ layers.[13] They also dissected the dynamic regulation of chromatin accessibility by the pioneer transcription factor OCT4 and demonstrated its activity on a time scale of minutes to maintain nucleosome-depleted regions in DNA regions regulating the identity of ES cells.[14]/nSuter is a member of several institutions such as Board Member of the Swiss Stem Cell Network,[15] International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) and European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT).

Balskus is an American chemical biologist, enzymologist, microbiologist, and biochemist born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1980. She has been on the faculty of the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department of Harvard University since 2011 and is currently the Morris Kahn Professor. She has published more than 80 peer-reviewed papers and three book chapters. Since 2012 she has been invited to give over 170 lectures, has held positions on various editorial boards, and served as a reviewer for ACS and Nature journals among others. Balskus also currently serves as a consultant for Novartis, Kintai Therapeutics, and Merck & Co./nBalskus was already interested in a potential career in science in elementary school where she conducted a science fair experiment on dilution and conservation of matter.[1] Later in high school she was introduced to chemistry and was \"captivated by the excitement of manipulating molecules in lab.\" Later in her scientific career this evolved into her fascination of how molecules are made in living organisms. In an interview for the Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists, Balskus reflects that she was likely inspired to go into science because all of her science teachers were women.[2]/nBalskus received a B.A. with highest honor in chemistry, summa cum laude, in 2002 from Williams College,[3][4] where she published her first paper on the synthesis of (-)-hennoxazole A in the lab of  professor Thomas E. Smith.[5] She then went on to the University of Cambridge as a Churchill Scholar where she earned a M.Phil. in chemistry in the lab of Steven V. Ley.[3][4] \nBalskus received her Ph.D. with organic chemist, Eric Jacobsen, at Harvard in 2008. There she proposed the novel idea of using an asymmetric catalyst to control chemical bond formation across large, cyclic molecules to form the favored stereoisomer.[6] She then made the switch from organic chemistry to chemical biology as she pursued a postdoctoral fellowship from 2008 through 2011 at Harvard Medical School with natural products researcher Christopher Walsh. Together they collaborated on the biosynthesis of scytonemin, a \"microbial sunscreen\" used to protect microorganisms from harmful UV light.[4] In 2009 she became a member of the Microbial Diversity Summer Course at the Marine Biology Lab at Woods Hole and received training in microbial ecology and environmental microbiology.[7]/nThe Balskus lab's research is centered around the human microbiome, which is the trillions of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that live in and on us. These microorganisms include bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Because of the abundance of genes in the human microbiome (200 times the amount in the human genome) many enzymes and/or their mechanisms have not been characterized.[8] Two of Balskus' aims is therefore to elucidate the mechanisms by which these microbial enzymes perform chemistry and to identify the specific microbes, genes, and enzymes responsible for key metabolic activities. A third aim is to develop biocompatible methods to control, manipulate, and study microbial chemistry in situ.[9]/nBioinformatics is heavily applied in the Balskus lab in order to study the extensive amount of genes of the human microbiome. Bioinformatics is the \"science of storing, retrieving and analysing large amounts of biological information.\"[10] Examples of bioinformatic analyses utilized in the Balskus lab are; phylogenetics, sequence alignments, homology modeling, and DNA annotation. A key accomplishment of the Balskus lab was the elucidation of the enzyme responsible for the already known conversion of choline to trimethylamine, choline trimethylamine-lyase. They identified the gene cluster required for the cleavage of the C-N bond of choline and hypothesized that it coded for a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE), a class of enzymes not previously reported to perform that type of chemistry. Sequence alignments of the gene cluster and previously functionally characterized glycyl radical enzymes as well as homology models of the suspected enzyme revealed the presence of conserved key glycine and cysteine residues in the active site, supporting the hypothesis that the enzyme is a member of the GRE family of enzymes. This research is important because choline metabolism has possible links to fish malodor syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease.[11]/nAnother key publication, A prominent glycyl radical enzyme in human gut microbiomes metabolizes trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline[12] outlines an important research approach utilized by Balskus and her team; chemically-guided functional profiling. First an enzyme family of interest is identified (in this case, the GRE family) and the amino acid sequences of all the members are compared. With the knowledge of the structures and functions of already characterized members of the enzyme family and the amino acid residues responsible, a sequence similarity network (SSN) is constructed to group together sequences of enzymes in clusters that share biological function. The SSN is used to interpret data generated by Short-BRED, a quantitative metagenomic analysis tool which uses the amino acid sequences of the enzyme family as input. Short-BRED identifies the unique sequence markers of each group of similar members and sequentially determines their abundance in the human microbiome. This tool can be used to identify uncharacterized members and prioritize their study based on their abundance./nBiocompatible chemistry is another integral strategy in the Balskus lab. These transformations are defined as \"non-enzymatic chemical reactions that interact with the metabolism of living organisms in a way that alters biological function.\"[13] They have been able to develop biocompatible cyclopropanation and hydrogenation reactions to alter the reactivity of microbes by using non-enzymatic catalysts, iron(III) phthalocyanine and palladium, respectively.[14][15] Another application of this approach used by Balskus is to rescue the activity of auxotrophic microbes with the use of transition metal-catalyzed reactions. This approach produces the essential nutrients that are needed for the growth and survival of the microbes by a non-native route.[13] They were able to rescue an auxotroph lacking the ability to produce p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a precursor to folic acid by using a ruthenium catalyst.[16] The success of these aforementioned approaches suggests that microbial growth and activity can be controlled and utilized for various chemical production applications.[13]/nA recent achievement (2019) of the Balskus lab was elucidating the mechanism by which the genotoxin, colibactin, damages DNA. They found that a cyclopropane \"warhead\" breaks the DNA strands through an alkylation reaction.[17] Other areas of research investigated by the Balkus lab is microbe drug metabolism. In an interview with The Scientist magazine, Balskus pointed out that many drugs such as digoxin[6] and byproducts of human metabolism can be degraded by gut bacteria, leading to lowered effects of these molecules than would be expected. Overall, the work done by the Balskus lab presents the foundational strategies needed to investigate the human microbiome and to understand how it affects our health. Their hope is to influence the development of therapeutic strategies that work not on the human host, but on their microbiome instead.[18]/nBalskus was a co-organizer of the 2019 Keystone Symposia[19] on chemical and biological considerations of the gut microbiota. The major charge of this conference was to \"...adopt other disciplines\" such as xenobiology, ecology, and interspecies communication[20] to improve the field of microbiome research.", "17369239": "Yoshio Masui (\u5897\u4e95 \u798e\u592b, Masui Yoshio, born January 1, 1931) is a Japanese-Canadian cell biologist.[1] Masui retired  in 1997 and has since held the position of Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto.[2][3]/nMasui studied biology at Kyoto University, graduating with his Bachelor of Science degree in zoology in 1953, his Master of Science in 1955 and his Ph.D. in 1961.[citation needed]/nWhile still studying at Kyoto University, he taught biology, first as a teacher's assistant and then as a teacher, at Konan University, where he was promoted to assistant professor after his earning his Ph.D. In 1966, he moved to Yale University to join Clement L.

He has been researching orcas (or killer whales) in British Columbia since 1967, and is credited with increasing public awareness of whaling, through his involvement with Greenpeace./nSpong was born in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1939. He spent his early life in Whakat\u0101ne on the northeast coast of New Zealand. He studied law and psychology at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. In 1963, Spong became a graduate student in Donald Lindsley's Lab in the Psychology Department at UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles]. He also worked in Ross Adey's Space Biology Lab in UCLA's Brain Research Institute (BRI). His work included computer analyses of human brain wave patterns and tracking information pathways. Spong's doctoral thesis was on sensory stimulation, perception, and human consciousness./nIn 1967, Murray Newman of the Vancouver Aquarium, asked Patrick McGeer, head of the Neurological Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), to find a \"whale scientist\" to assist him at the aquarium. Spong was selected as the candidate to work at the Vancouver Aquarium with orca whales (Orcinus orca) after a successful interview and a recommendation from the head of the lab at UCLA./nSpong arrived in Vancouver with his wife Linda, in April 1967. This was a few months after Skana, the orca that Paul would be working with, had been bought by the Vancouver Aquarium from the Pacific Northwest Boat Show./nSpong started his research by testing the vision of a dolphin named Diana. He determined that she could see underwater about as well as a cat can see in air.\u00a0 Good but not great vision. He then started testing Skana's eyesight, rewarding her with half a herring every time she correctly distinguished between one and two vertical lines displayed on cards dropped into slots on an apparatus.\u00a0 Skana's task was to press a lever beside the card with two lines. The gap between the lines was varied to determine when Skana could no longer discriminate it. She took many hundreds of trials to learn the initial discrimination and became a willing performer.\u00a0 Then, at a point when Skana was performing at 100% correct, she suddenly switched her behaviour and started pressing only the \"wrong\" lever.\u00a0 Her performance fell to 0% and stayed there for many days. After some thought, and finding no comparable report in behavioural literature, Spong concluded that he whale was giving wrong answers on purpose and trying to communicate something to him. It was one word: NO! This was the first breakthrough Paul had in understanding orcas./nIn April 1968, a second orca, Hyak was captured and brought to the Aquarium. Hyak was kept in a separate pool from Skana. After many months in isolation, Hyak had become sedentary, floating in one corner of his pool day and night. Spong decided to run an experiment to find out if an acoustic reward could be used to modify Hyak's behaviour[1].\u00a0 He placed an underwater speaker in one corner of the pool and connected it to audio equipment in his lab next door.\u00a0 A 3 kHz tone started a trial. If Hyak moved out of his corner, Spong turned on a reward\u00a0sound. Soon, Hyak was swimming sedately around the pool.\u00a0 Spong then modified the reward criteria, essentially saying that anything except staying on one corner of the pool would be rewarded with sound. Soon, Hyak was an enthusiastic performer.\u00a0 Spong learned\u00a0the importance of acoustics for orcas through these experiments. His experiments with music and sound helped Hyak\u2019s recovery from lethargy. When the Hyak and Skana were placed in the same pool, he observed that they vocalised together./nAmong Spong\u2019s frequent interactions with the whales was an event involving Skana. Spong had developed a habit of going to the Aquarium in the early morning, before the public arrived and sitting on a little training platform dangling his bare feet in the water.\u00a0 Skana would come over to him and Spong would rub his feet over Skana\u2019s\u00a0head and body.\u00a0 She seemed to enjoy that.\u00a0 One morning, Skana swam slowly towards him as usual; then when just a couple of inches away from Spong's feet suddenly opened her jaws and slashed them across Spong's feet, so close he could feel her teeth on the tops and bottoms of his feet.\u00a0 Naturally, Spong jerked his feet out of the water and sat trembling on the platform.\u00a0 After quite some time he calmed down enough to put his feet back into the water.\u00a0 Skana did it again and Spong reacted the same way.\u00a0 By now Spong was curious.\u00a0 What was Skana doing?\u00a0 They went through this circle 10 or 11 times, until finally Spong was able to leave his feet in the water while Skana slashed her teeth across them without reacting. And then, Skana stopped.\u00a0 In that moment, Spong realised with sudden insight that he was no longer afraid of Skana . She had quickly and efficiently de-conditioned Spong's fear of her immensely powerful jaws and teeth.\u00a0 Not only that, she had demonstrated that she was in total control of her body, and that she would not harm him.\u00a0 Spong came to regard this as a great gift from Skana to him, as he has not since experienced fear in the presence of an orca./nIn 1968, Spong delivered a lecture at the University of British Columbia, describing his experience with the two whales at the Vancouver Aquarium. He described the whales as \"highly intelligent, social animals\" and advised that they should not be kept in captivity. He proposed transferring the whales to a semi-wild environment (such as Pender Harbour) in order to study them in their natural habitat. Spong also mentioned that humans could someday communicate with whales./nHis comments from this lecture were published in local newspapers and interviews with radio stations were scheduled. However, Dr Newman from the Aquarium did not appreciate Spong's recommendation about freeing the whales. This pushed Newman to suspend the research project Spong was working on. Shortly afterwards, Spong's contract with the Aquarium came up for renewal. It was not renewed./nIn June 1969, Spong gave an uninvited address to the Western Psychological Association in which he discussed his belief that taking psychedelic drugs helped him tune in to the whales' space and that this could help with orca\u2013human communications/nKiller Whale (Orcinus Orca) Foundation, or KWOOF was the foundation that Spong created after leaving the Aquarium. One purpose of the foundation was to stop whale captures in British Columbia, Canada. In December 1969, Spong travelled to Pender Harbour, where fishermen had captured 12 whales. Of the 12 whales, only one whale, Corky, has survived in captivity for more than 50 years. Spong has spent over three decades trying to free her./nIn 1972, Spong was living in a hippie commune in North Vancouver, called the \"Maplewood Mudflats\". The District of North Vancouver wanted to turn the mudflats into a shopping centre. Spong led the opposition to the proposal. He was interviewed about the community in a film made for the NFB (National Film Board of Canada), by Robert Fresco and Kris Paterson, called Mudflats Living.https://www.nfb.ca/film/mudflats_living/\u00a0 Another film was made by Seattle film maker Sean Malone called Living on the Mud.\u00a0 While the squatters were evicted and their homes burned, the mudflats ultimately became a conservation area and wildlife preserve./nIn the summer of 1970, Spong established the OrcaLab on Hanson Island. The Lab is located about 200 miles northwest of Vancouver on Blackney Pass.  Orca families travel through the pass towards Johnstone Strait where they feast on migrating salmon, socialise with others of their community, and visit special \"rubbing beaches\".  Hanson Island was an ideal place to study orcas in their natural habitat./nAt the laboratory, Spong started to monitor and record  the modulations and songs sung by the whales with a hydrophone hung over a convenient rocky shelf in the bay and connected to a tape recorder.  Eventually OrcaLab created a network of hydrophones that covered 50 square kilometres (19\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of ocean that became recognised as Critical Habitat for the Northern Resident orca community. At first the hydrophone signals were transmitted to the Lab by VHF radio, then by wireless microwave network. The operational philosophy of OrcaLab as a land based research station is \"learning without interference\"./nIn 2000, Spong with Japanese colleagues set up an online portal for listening to the whales called \"www.orca-live.net\" which broadcast live sounds from OrcaLab's hydrophones via the Internet, making it possible for people around the world with internet access to hear the sounds of orcas.  The project also included a link to live video cameras.   Viewers could log in and chat to fellow orca enthusiasts.  A sister site was set up in Japan to watch turtles under the Nature Network banner.  The turtle aspect of the project eventually ended, but the orca webcast continues. and has expanded in partnership with explore.org./nIn the 1980s, the forest of Hanson Island was threatened by clearcut logging. Spong with his wife Helena Symonds and many allies including the 'Namgis First Nation mounted a campaign that opposed the logging.  Hundreds of letters from people around the world, including many from Europe and Japan were written to the British Columbia government.  The logging company ownership changed.  At one point, Spong travelled to New Zealand to appeal to the chairman of the new owner, Fletcher Challenge.  Eventually, the forest of Hanson Island was protected under negotiations between the BC government, First Nations, environmental groups and logging companies that established the Great Bear Rainforest.  Today it is managed by the Yukusam Heritage Society which includes representatives from three First Nations whose territory includes Hanson Island.  OrcaLab's work continues under license from the Society.  Yulusam is the traditional name of Hanson Island./nIn 1972, Spong met the Canada author Farley Mowat who was on a national tour promoting his book A whale for the killing.\u00a0Farley convinced Spong about the desperate plight faced by many species of great whales.\u00a0 Spong with his wife Linda began a campaign as the Canadian branch of Project Jonah aimed at convincing Canada to stop whaling.\u00a0 Within a year, Canada did so.\u00a0 Spong set his sights higher and convinced Greenpeace, at the time an anti-nuclear testing organisation, to take up the whales' cause.\u00a0 Vancouver Sun columnist Bob Hunter and other Greenpeacers formed the\u00a0 Stop Ahab committee\u00a0of Greenpeace and set about planning to confront whalers on the high seas.\u00a0 In 1973, Spong and Hunter put on the Christmas Whale Show at Vancouver's Queen Elizabeth Theatre to raise funds for a trip to Japan aimed at convincing that country to stop whaling.\u00a0 Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot called during the show and pledged $5,00 to support the effort.\u00a0 In 1974, Spong and his family travelled to Japan and made presentations at 21 venues that included theatres in shopping malls and schools.\u00a0 Spong also met with whaling industry and government officials.\u00a0 These efforts unsuccessful, Spong returned to Canada convinced about the need to confront the whalers directly.\u00a0 In 1975, Spong and his family took the now named Greenpeace Whale Show across Canada, then to Iceland and Norway.\u00a0 In Norway, they visited the Bureau of International Whaling statistics where Spong, presenting himself as a whale scientist interested in sperm whales, obtained access to whalers' log books showing the locations of whaling operations off the coast of California. \u00a0When Hunter received this information he knew where to head but kept the information to himself until close to the time the Russian whaling fleet would be off the coast of California. The Phyllis Cormack headed there in July, confronting the whalers off Mendocino.\u00a0 A dramatic scene\u00a0 showing a harpoon flying over the heads of Hunter and Paul Watson in a tiny zodiac was aired on Walter Cronkite's CBS evening news show just before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) met in London.\u00a0 The result was a dramatic uplift in public awareness of the whaling issue and pressure on the Commission which was essentially a whalers' club at that point. Spong by happenstance managed to attend the Commission\u2019s meeting, and subsequently was able to attend meetings of the IWC Scientific Committee and plenary meetings of the Commission as an NGO observer, one of many whose aim was to end commercial whaling./nIn 1982, the International Whaling Commission voted by 3/4 majority to impose a moratorium on commercial whaling.\u00a0 The moratorium came into effect in 1986 and still stands today./nIn 1990, Switzerland\u2019s Bellerive Foundation hosted a conference to discuss cetaceans in captivity.\u00a0 Spong presented information about the Northern Resident A5 pod member named Corky (A16) and suggested her as a candidate for release back into the wild, where her family was well known.\u00a0 Corky had been captured in Pender Harbour, British Columbia, in 1969 and taken to Marineland of the Pacific, then to SeaWorld San Diego.\u00a0 An international campaign followed highlighted by appeals to Sea World from children from 21 countries who contributed painted patches that were turned into a huge banner nearly 2 km long.\u00a0 Corky\u2019s FREEDOM BANNER was the inspiration of Austria's Niki Entrup. It was displayed around Sea World, in European capitals, and in western US states and British Columbia.\u00a0 Sea World remained obstinate in refusing to consider releasing Corky.\u00a0In 2000 Corky's mother Stripe (A23) died, ending the opportunity for them to meet again.\u00a0The campaign to Free Corky continued and presently involves creation of the Double Bay Sanctuary on Hanson Island as Corky's retirement home where ideally she would be cared for by the Sea World staff she knows well. \u00a0Owner of the old Double Bay lodge Michael Reppy, who is building the Sanctuary, has the support of the \u2018Namgis First Nation as well as Spong.\u00a0 Corky is still alive (as of July 2022) so she still has a chance to meet her family again./nWeyler, R (2004).

She experimented with a wide array of systems, including yeast, plant, nematode, mouse, and human.[3] Levine discovered the first mammalian autophagy gene, Beclin 1, and later went on to directly associate this gene with the protein Bcl-2.[3] This association provided significant implications in the realm of cell survival./nIn a 1999 paper in Nature, she proposed that autophagy was linked to tumor suppression. In 2003, she confirmed the link between Beclin 1 and tumor suppression. Additionally, Levine demonstrated links between autophagy and breast cancer. She also proved a link between autophagy and viral infections, showing how the herpes simplex virus type-1 expressed a protein that blocked Beclin 1 activity. She was also able to show a link between autophagy and lifespan.[1]/nLevine and her team also made significant contributions in several selective fields of autophagy, including virophagy, xenophagy, and mitophagy, and she is credited for coining the term xenophagy.[3] These contributions provided a greater understanding of the role of autophagy pathways in diseases like neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, and cancers.

Also, the Kishino-Hasegawa tests[5] they performed revealed no statistical difference between the hypothesis that birds were a clade nested within the Maniraptora and the hypothesis that core clades of Maniraptora (oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and dromaeosaurs) were actually flying and flightless radiations within the clade bracketed by Archaeopteryx and modern birds (Aves).  James and Pourtless concluded that because Aves might not belong within it, Theropoda as presently constituted might not be monophyletic.

Father of Alice Mia V\u00f8rs Patterson, Daniel Kieran Patterson, and William Zhao Patterson. He was educated at Belmont Primary, Strandtown and Grosvenor High schools in Belfast. He obtained his Bachelor of Science with first-class honours at Queen's University Belfast in 1971./nDavid Patterson obtained a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Bristol in 1976, where he was later employed (1977\u20131993). He obtained his Doctor of Science in 1990 from Queen's University, Belfast. In 1993 he moved to the University of Sydney in Australia where he became Head of the School of Biological Sciences. In 2004, he moved to the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole (Mass., USA) where he helped to establish the Encyclopedia of Life project with responsibility for the informatics component,[1] basing EOL on the model developed with the micro*scope project.[2][3]  From 2012-2014 he was a Research Professor at Arizona State University; and also was Professor (MBL) at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and an Emeritus Professor of the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. As a taxonomist, his primary interests were in the diversity of protozoa and the evolution of protists. He and his co-workers described about 250 new taxa.  David Patterson was awarded the Thomas Henry Huxley prize and the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society of London; has been Secretary of the British Section of the Society of Protozoologists; President of the International Society for Evolutionary Protistology; and Vice-President of the (International) Society of Protozoology. He served as a member of the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature, of the Editorial Committee for Algae of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy, of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Biological Sciences, and of the Scientific Committee of the World Data System./nHe has published approximately 200 peer-reviewed papers including several books throughout his career. Initial interests in ion physiology, volume regulation, and contractile vacuoles shifted to ultrastructural studies, a technique that reshaped the understanding of protist diversity, in turn being further enriched through comparative molecular studies. With Guy Brugerolle, he introduced his concept that clades of protists could usefully be identified by the complement and arrangement of organelles - that is their ultrastructural identity.[4] He later used this concept along with the rationale of transformed cladistics to redefine the diversity of clades among eukaryotes.[5]  This simplified the challenge of establishing a complete phylogeny for eukaryotes by providing a list of the clades among which relatedness was to be established./nIn the mid-1980's, Patterson focussed his efforts on free-living heterotrophic flagellates because they were poorly known and were not being actively investigated.  Two areas of research were impeded because of the lack of awareness of flagellate diversity. The first was with the emerging concept of Microbial Food Webs that was transforming appreciation of the dynamics of ocean ecosystems - itself critical to the international Joint Global Ocean Flux Study targeting a better understanding of carbon fluxes and global warming. Secondly, as the most primitive eukaryotes bore flagella,  an understanding of the variety of flagellate diversity was expected to create better insights into eukaryotic origins and evolution. With co-workers, this led to recognition of new domains of protistan diversity - such as stramenopiles, alveolates, and the excavates (excavata) - robustly defined by reference to amorphies, then a rarity in protistology./nPatterson explored the emerging and largely theoretical concept that most microbes should have a universal distribution, initially articulated by Lourens Baas Becking, and refreshed by Tom Fenchel and Bland Finlay.

Voskuhl has published numerous scientific articles in academic journals and has served in the role of principal investigator for several treatment trials investigating potential treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS).[1]/nVoskuhl has described her research as \"bedside to bench to bedside\", meaning observations made in clinical settings are used as a basis for the investigation of the relevant biological mechanisms of action. The information discovered is then applied in a clinical setting, typically through a drug therapy.[2]/nDue to well-documented differences in prevalence of MS in males and females,[3][4][5] significant research on the autoimmune condition has turned to the neuropreservative effects of sex hormones. Evidence of suppression of MS symptoms in pregnant women in the third trimester[6] ultimately led to a focus on the female sex hormone estriol./nIn 2001, Voskuhl published an article outlining discrepancies in EAE between male and female mice; she noted that females were more susceptible to EAE, mirroring the sex-based difference in MS in humans. It was found that the neuroprotective effects of testosterone contributed most to this discrepancy in mice. However, this sex difference is reduced during late pregnancy in females, when estriol levels are significantly higher than other periods of life. Her article established high levels of estriol as a possible explanation for the reduction in EAE symptoms observed during late pregnancy.[7]/nIn 2002, Voskuhl was part of the investigative team that found that treating non-pregnant women with 8\u00a0mg/day estriol helped to relieve symptoms, including lesion number and volume. Upon cessation of treatment, lesion number and volume returned to pre-treatment levels. After reinstituting treatment, lesion number and volume again decreased significantly. Cognitive ability, evaluated by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), also improved in those treated with estriol. In the authors' abstract, they indicated that this result warranted further experimentation through a placebo-controlled clinical trial.[8] This experiment was small, with only six women with relapse remitting MS (RRMS) and four women with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) finishing the trial. The authors noted that estriol generally improved symptoms in women with RRMS, but not in those with SPMS.[9]/nIn a 2011 research article, Voskuhl published data revealing that the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) on astrocytes, not neurons, was responsible for the reduction of clinical EAE symptoms in mice. Using a gene knockout system Cre-Lox, the research team was able to remove ER\u03b1 from neurons and in separate mice, remove ER\u03b1 from astrocytes. It was found that the mice with ER\u03b1 knocked out in astrocytes experienced an increase in clinical disease symptoms, macrophage and T-cell inflammation in the central nervous system, and axonal loss. These symptoms were not observed in those mice who had ER\u03b1 removed from neurons.[10]/nIn 2016, the results of a Phase II Trial, in which Voskuhl participated, were released, detailing an experiment in which women with RRMS were treated daily with 8\u00a0mg estriol or placebo, combined with 20\u00a0mg injectable glatiramer acetate - an immunomodulator currently used to treat MS. It was found that women with the estriol treatment had significantly less relapses than the placebo group (0.25 relapses/year and 0.37 relapses/year, respectively), with similar amounts of serious adverse health events. The success of this trial convinced the authors to report that a Phase III Trial was warranted.[11]/nIn 2008, Voskuhl, together with Dr. Stefan Gold et al., published a study that revealed the effects of treating men with MS with a 10g gel containing 100\u00a0mg testosterone. Based upon the shift in cellular and chemical composition, particularly a decrease in IL-2 cell production, an increase in production growth factor TGF\u03b21, a decrease in CD4+ T cells, and an increase in NK (natural killer) cells, it was found that testosterone may play an important role in immunomodulation and neuroprotection.[12]/nIn a 2009 review article discussing the effects of sex hormones on MS, Voskuhl and Gold noted that one small trial conducted by a research team headed by Dr. Nancy Sicotte[13] suggested testosterone could be effective in preserving cognitive performance and reducing brain atrophy.[14] However, this trial yielded no significant effect on the formation of brain lesions./nIn 2014, Voskuhl participated in an interview discussing estriol as a potential treatment for women with MS. The article discussed how estriol was identified as a potential candidate for drug treatment, including an anecdote about Melissa Glasser, a woman who experienced a reduction in her MS symptoms during each of her four pregnancies.[15]/nIn 2016, Voskuhl was quoted in an article addressing gender bias in scientific study; she noted that male and female mice had different disease progression in the animal MS model.[16]", "62720244": "Richard Charles Thompson OBE FRS is a marine biologist who researches marine litter.

Major tools for this research are mathematical modeling (principally game theory and genetic algorithms).\nHe is also interested in how the process of sexual differentiation produces individual differences in social behaviour./nHurd conducted a study on digit ratios suggesting a positive correlation in males between aggressive tendency and the ratio of the lengths of the ring finger to his index finger. These gathered significant media attention, being reported on the BBC,[1] in The New York Times,[2] Discover Magazine,[3] Scientific American Mind,[4] National Geographic[5] and on Jay Leno.[6]/nSome of Hurd's most cited papers deal with the evolution of mating displays, specifically the idea that sexually selected traits have evolved to exploit previously existing biases in the sensory, or recognition, systems of their receivers, rather than being handicapped displays[7][8]  Hurd has argued against the handicap principle view of animal communication, demonstrating the evolutionary stability of conventional (non-handicap) threat displays using game theoretical models.[9][10][11]  Adding empirical support to this theoretical work, Hurd has also argued that threat displays in birds,[12] and headbob displays in the lizard Anolis carolinensis[13] are conventional signals, rather than handicaps.  Hurd attributes the preponderance of handicap models in biology to the use of simple signalling games which are incapable of modelling conventional signalling.[14]/nHurd has classified models of fighting behaviour into those driven by: 1) fighting ability (aka resource holding potential), 2) perceived value of winning, and 3) aggressiveness and argues that if variation in the last trait -aggressiveness- exists in a biologically meaningful way, it ought to be fixed for life at an early stage of development.[15]  Many studies on both human, and non-human, animals suggest that inter-individual variation in adult aggressiveness is largely organised by prenatal exposure to androgens.  Digit ratio (2D:4D, the ratio of index to ring finger length) is a widely used as a proxy measure for prenatal testosterone exposure.  Hurd demonstrated that men with more feminine typical-digit ratios showed lower aggressive tendency than males with more masculine-typical digit ratios.[16]/nAmong his other research into digit ratio, Hurd has demonstrated that, while there is no difference in digit ratio between the sexes in most laboratory mice, that pups which gested[spelling?] next to brothers have higher digit ratios than those whose uterine neighbours were sisters,[17][18] and that the large differences in digit ratios between populations may be explained by Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule.[19]/nStrongly influenced as a youth by the anarcho-punk movement and such influences as Jonathan Kozol and A.

The meaning of these three names is disputed: according to Guo Xiang, the \"Inner Chapters\" were written by Zhuangzi, the \"Outer Chapters\" written by his disciples, and the \"Mixed Chapters\" by other hands; the other interpretation is that the names refer to the origin of the titles of the chapters\u2014the \"Inner Chapters\" take their titles from phrases inside the chapter, the \"Outer Chapters\" from the opening words of the chapters, and the \"Mixed Chapters\" from a mixture of these two sources.[9]/nFurther study of the text does not provide a clear choice between these alternatives.

Ranadive was a bright student. She had her schooling at the Huzurpaga: the H. H. C. P. High School.[2] Her father wanted her to study medicine and also marry a doctor, but she decided otherwise. She started her college education at Fergusson College with Botany and Zoology as her main subjects. She earned her Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree with distinction in 1934.[5] She then moved to the Agriculture College at Pune where she did her master's degree (M.Sc.) in 1943 with cytogenetics of annonaceae as the special subject. She then married J. T. Ranadive, a mathematician, on 13 May 1939 and moved to Bombay. They had a son, named Anil Jaysingh.[1]/nIn Bombay (now known as Mumbai), she worked at the Tata Memorial Hospital.

She was also responsible for establishing new research units in Carcinogenesis, Cell biology and Immunology. Her career achievements include research on the pathophysiology of cancer through the medium of animals which led to a further appreciation of causes of diseases such as leukaemia, breast cancer and  Esophageal cancer. Another notable achievement was in establishing a link to the susceptibility of cancer and hormones and tumour virus relationship. Evolution of the leprosy vaccine was a result of her basic research on the bacteria related to leprosy.[2] She was a great inspiration to Indian women scientists to work on cancer research, in particular on the subject cancer among women and children.

Morgan & Co. in 1934. That same year, he published a book[6] on the Hall Carbine Affair, in which he attempted to exonerate John Pierpont Morgan from guilt with respect to the incident, which had been viewed as an example of wartime profiteering. As early as 1937, Wasson had been attempting to influence historians Allan Nevins and Charles McLean Andrews regarding Morgan's role in the affair; he used Nevins' report[7] as a reference for his own book on the topic. The matter of Morgan's responsibility for the Hall Carbine Incident remains controversial.[8][9]/nOn July 16, 1941, the directors of Morgan & Co. appointed Wasson to the position of assistant secretary, and by 1943 he was vice president for public relations.[10][11]/nWasson's studies in ethnomycology began during his 1927 honeymoon trip to the Catskill Mountains when his wife, Valentina Pavlovna Guercken, a pediatrician, chanced upon some edible wild mushrooms. Fascinated by the marked difference in cultural attitudes towards fungi in Russia compared to the United States, the couple began field research that led to the publication of Mushrooms, Russia and History in 1957./nIn the course of their investigations they mounted expeditions to Mexico to study the religious use of mushrooms by the native population, and claimed to have been the first Westerners to participate in a Mazatec mushroom ritual./nIt was the curandera Mar\u00eda Sabina who both allowed the Wassons to participate in the ritual and who taught them about the uses and effects of the mushroom, after Wasson lied to her about being worried about the whereabouts and wellbeing of his son, as the ritual was traditionally used to locate missing people and important items.[12] Sabina let him take her picture on the condition that he keep it private, but Wasson nonetheless published the photo along with Sabina's name and the name of the community where she lived.[13] Though he faced no consequences for his deceptions, and indeed, profited greatly from the knowledge he gained from her, Sabina was subsequently ostracised from her community as a result of his actions, and her house was burned down after she was briefly jailed, her son murdered, and she eventually died in poverty.[12]/nAt the 1951 annual meeting of the American Council of Learned Societies, held in Rye, New York, on January 24-26, Wasson was appointed a member of the Executive Committee for a period of one year.[14]/nSome of Wasson's colleagues, such as Ethel Dunn, disagreed with Wasson's conclusions regarding Amanita muscaria.[15]/nWasson's 1956 expedition was funded[8] by the CIA's MK-Ultra subproject 58, as was revealed by documents[5] obtained by John Marks[16] under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents state that Wasson was an \"unwitting\" participant in the project.[5]/nThe funding was provided under the cover name of the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research (credited by Wasson at the end of his subsequent Life piece about the expedition)./nIn May 1957, Life magazine published an article titled \"Seeking the Magic Mushroom,\" which introduced psychoactive mushrooms to a wide audience for the first time. Six days later, his wife Valentina's first-person account of their research expedition in Mexico was published on the cover of This Week, a Sunday magazine inserted in 37 newspapers that reach almost 12 million total readers.[17][18][19]/nIn his memoir, author Tom Robbins talks about the impact of this article on \"turning on\" Americans himself included.[20] The article sparked immense interest in the Mazatec ritual practice among beatniks and hippies, an interest that proved disastrous for the Mazatec community and for Mar\u00eda Sabina in particular.[citation needed] As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations[citation needed], Sabina attracted attention by the Mexican police who thought that she sold drugs to the foreigners.[citation needed] The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom.[citation needed] The community blamed Sabina, and she was ostracized in the community and had her house burned down. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.[13][21][22]/nTogether, Wasson and botanist Roger Heim collected and identified various species of family Strophariaceae and genus Psilocybe, while Albert Hofmann,[23] using material grown by Heim from specimens collected by the Wassons, identified the chemical structure of the active compounds, psilocybin and psilocin. Hofmann and Wasson were also among the first Westerners to collect specimens of the Mazatec hallucinogen Salvia divinorum, though these specimens were later deemed not suitable for rigorous scientific study or taxonomic classification.[24] Two species of mushroom, Psilocybe wassonii R.Heim and Psilocybe wassoniorum Guzman & S.H.Pollock, were named in honor of Wasson by Heim and Gast\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n, the latter of whom Wasson met during an expedition to Huautla de Jim\u00e9nez in 1957./nWasson's next major contribution was a study of the ancient Vedic intoxicant soma, which he hypothesized was based on the psychoactive fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) mushroom. This hypothesis was published in 1967 under the title Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality. His attention then turned to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony of the ancient Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone. In The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries (1978), co-authored with Albert Hofmann and Carl A. P.

His career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a productive genetics research lab both at Purdue University and as the James G. Boswell Professor of Neuroscience, emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology.[1][2][3]/nBenzer was born in the South Bronx to Meir Benzer and Eva Naidorf, both Jews from Poland.[4][5] He had two older sisters, and his parents favored him as the only boy.[6] One of Benzer's earliest scientific experiences was dissecting frogs he had caught as a boy. In an interview at Caltech, Benzer also remembered receiving a microscope for his 13th birthday, \u201cand that opened up the whole world.\u201d[7] The book Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis heavily influenced the young Benzer, and he even imitated the handwriting of Max Gottlieb, a scientist character in the novel. Benzer graduated from New Utrecht High School at 15 years old.[8]/nIn 1938 he enrolled at Brooklyn College where he majored in physics.[3] Benzer then moved on to Purdue University to earn his Ph.D. in solid state physics. While there he was recruited for a secret military project to develop improved radar. He performed research that led to the development of stable germanium rectifiers and discovered a germanium crystal able to be used at high voltages, among the scientific work that led to the first transistor.[2][3][9]/nAt Brooklyn College, as a sixteen-year-old freshman, Benzer met Dorothy Vlosky (nicknamed Dotty), a twenty-one-year-old nurse. He later married her in New York City in 1942.[8] They had two daughters, Barbie (Barbara) and Martha Jane./nBenzer died of a stroke at the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California.[9]/nUpon receiving his Ph.D. in 1947, he was immediately hired as an assistant professor in physics at Purdue. However, Benzer was inspired by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's book What Is Life?, in which the physicist pondered the physical nature of the gene and a \u201ccode\u201d of life. This catalyzed Benzer's shift in interest to biology, and he moved into the area of bacteriophage genetics.,[10] spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow in Max Delbr\u00fcck's laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and then returning to Purdue. At Purdue University, Benzer developed the T4 rII system, a new genetic technique involving recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants.[11] After observing that a particular rII mutant, a mutation that caused the bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria more rapidly than usual, was not exhibiting the expected phenotype, it occurred to Benzer that this strain might have come from a cross between two different rII mutants (each having part of the rII gene intact) wherein a recombination event resulted in a normal rII sequence.  Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, one could create a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes.[8] Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear.[12][11]   Benzer also proved that mutations were distributed in many different parts of a single gene, and the resolving power of his system allowed him to discern mutants that differ at the level of a single nucleotide.  Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.[13]/nBenzer's work influenced many other scientists of his time (see Phage group). In his molecular biology period, Benzer dissected the fine structure of a single gene, laying down the ground work for decades of mutation analysis and genetic engineering, and setting up a paradigm using the rII phage that would later be used by Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner to establish the triplet code of DNA. In addition, Benzer's mapping technique was taken up by Richard Feynman.[8]/nIn 1967, Benzer left the field of phage genetics and returned to the California Institute of Technology to work in behavioral genetics./nBenzer was one of the first scientists to rise to prominence in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch. While Hirsch believed that behaviors were complex phenomena irreducible to the level of single genes, Benzer advocated that animal behaviors were not too complex to be directed by a single gene. This translated to methodological differences in the two researchers' experiments with Drosophila that profoundly influenced the field of behavioral genetics. Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer primarily used forward genetic mutagenesis screens to isolate mutants for a particular behavior.[14] Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies served to provide necessary scientific tension in order to accelerate and enhance developments in behavioral genetics, helping it gain traction as a legitimate area of study in the scientific community./nBenzer used forward genetics to investigate the genetic basis of various behaviors such as phototaxis, circadian rhythms, and learning by inducing mutations in a Drosophila population and then screening individuals for altered phenotypes of interest.[10] To better identify mutants, Benzer developed novel apparatuses such as the countercurrent device, which was designed to separate flies according to the magnitude and direction of their phototactic response.[15] Benzer identified mutants for a wide variety of characteristics: vision (nonphototactic, negative phototactic, and eyes absent[16]), locomotion (sluggish, uncoordinated), stress sensitivity (freaked-out), sexual function (savoir-faire, fruitless), nerve and muscle function (photoreceptor degeneration, drop-dead), and learning and memory (rutabaga, dunce[17]).[18]/nBenzer and student Ron Konopka discovered the first circadian rhythm mutants. Three distinct mutant types\u2014arrhythmic, shortened period, and lengthened period\u2014were identified. These mutations all involved the same functional gene on the X chromosome and influenced the eclosion rhythm of the population as well as rhythms in individual flies' locomotor activity.[19] To monitor Drosophila locomotor activity, Benzer and postdoctoral researcher, Yoshiki Hotta, designed a system using infrared light and solar cells.[19] All three mutations were mapped to the X chromosome, zero centimorgans away from each other, indicating that the mutant phenotypes corresponded to alleles of the same gene, which Konopka named period.[19] This was the first of several seminal studies of single genes affecting behavior, studies that have been replicated in other animal models and are now the basis for the growing field of molecular biology of behavior. In 1992 Benzer, working with Michael Rosbash, furthered this work by showing that the PER protein, which period codes for, is predominantly located in the nucleus.[20] The work with Period mutants was catalytic in the study of circadian rhythms and served to propel the field forward./nOn 2 October 2017, Dr. Rosbash, along with Drs. Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their cloning of circadian rhythm genes, and the elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms by which the circadian rhythm protein products regulated behavior./nBenzer was at the forefront of the study of neurodegeneration in fruit flies, modeling human diseases and attempting to suppress them. He also contributed to the field of aging biology, looking for mutants with altered longevity and trying to dissect the mechanisms by which an organism can escape the inevitable functional downfall and its associated diseases.[21] In 1998, Benzer and his colleagues Yi-Jyun Lin and Laurent Seroude published findings of a long-life mutant in Drosophila, then named Methuselah. The mutant gene coded for a previously unknown member of the GPCR family. By testing against temperature stress, it is thought that these mutants have an increased ability to respond to stress and thus to live longer.[22] One of Benzer's final research projects was on dietary restriction and longevity research. A paper was published, in ''Cell'', on the longevity effect of 4E-BP, a translational repressor, following dietary restriction. Although the research was done before his death, the paper was published afterwards and dedicated to his memory.[23]/nIn 1978, Dotty was in the hospital with breast cancer, and Seymour's friend, colleague, and mentor Max Delbr\u00fcck was diagnosed with cancer. Consequently, Seymour Benzer took interest in cancer biology and attended several conferences on breast cancer.[8]\nBenzer later remarried with Carol Miller, a neuropathologist. Together, in the early 1980s, they used antibody staining techniques to find nearly identical genes between flies and humans.[8]/nHe was a member of the French Academy of Sciences, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the Royal Society./nBenzer is the subject of the 1999 book Time, Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of Behavior by Pulitzer laureate Jonathan Weiner,[8] and Reconceiving the Gene: Seymour Benzer's Adventures in Phage Genetics by Lawrence Holmes.[6]", "66586944": "Bob B.M.

When an advisor told her that \"women do not belong in chemistry\" she switched majors, settling on biology. In 1967, she transferred to Goucher College in Maryland, when her boyfriend moved to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to work at the National Institutes of Health.

When Cambridge banned such experiments in 1976, citing worries about public safety and the chance of unintentionally creating a new disease, Villa-Komaroff moved to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[2]  While at Cold Spring Harbor, she experienced repeated failures of her experiments; however, these disappointments taught her that \u201cmost experiments fail, and that scientists must accept failure as a part of the process[3]\u201d./nVilla-Komaroff felt that these failures aided in her biggest victory: six months after she was able to return to Harvard (once the ban on recombinant DNA experiments was lifted in 1977), she became a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Walter Gilbert.

Other scientists had discovered that the development of normal vision in cats is delayed when cats are raised in total darkness and that the development of vision can be triggered by brief exposure to light. Villa-Komaroff's laboratory showed that exposing dark-reared cats to one hour of light caused a 2 to 3 fold transient induction of three specific proteins.  This finding directly linked the expression of these genes with an environmental trigger (light) in the development of vision.[11]/nThe laboratory also discovered direct evidence that the Gap-43 protein was important in the growth of the axons of nerve cells.[12]/nFinally, Villa-Komaroff contributed to the discovery that a molecule known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (amyloid beta) causes degeneration of brain cells (neurons), work done in conjunction with a postdoctoral fellow in her laboratory, Bruce Yankner.[13] Before this publication, it was unclear whether amyloid beta was a byproduct of neuronal degeneration or a contributor to that degeneration.

She was awarded the Spinoza Prize in 2002.[2]/nGoulmy did groundbreaking research on the role of antigens in organ and stem cell transplantation. She is the pioneer of the so-called Minor Transplantation Antigens in men. Minor antigens can induce strong immune reactions. She discovered the H-Y minor antigen encoded by the Y-chromosome (1976) and the autosomally encoded HA-1 antigen (1983). She then described the polymorphism and the population frequencies of several autosomal minor antigens. Crucial was her work on the differential expression of minor antigens showing either overall expression on all body cells, such as the male specific H-Y antigens, or restricted expression on solely blood and blood cancer cells, such as HA-1. Goulmy was the first to describe the chemical structure of the human minor antigens (1995). In 1996 she demonstrated the crucial role of minor antigens in the outcome of organ and stem cell transplantation. In 1997 she launched new concepts for immunotherapy of blood cancer applying the blood and cancer cell specific minor antigens, such as HA-1, for tumor specific treatment. The basis for the translation \u2018from the lab to the clinic\u2019 of these cancer and patient specific treatment was laid in her laboratory.

His account of the development of facts at the intersection of active elements of the thought collective and the passive resistances of nature provides a way of considering the particular culture of modern science as evolutionary and evidence-oriented.[7]/nFleck was born in Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w in Polish, now L'viv, Ukraine) and grew up in the cultural autonomy of the Austrian province of Galicia. He graduated from a Polish lyceum (secondary school) in 1914 and enrolled at Lw\u00f3w's Jan Kazimierz University, where he received his medical degree./nIn 1920 he became an assistant to the famous typhus specialist Rudolf Weigl at Jan Kazimierz University. From 1923 to 1935 Fleck worked in the department of internal medicine at Lw\u00f3w General Hospital, then became director of the bacteriological laboratory at the local social security authority. From 1935 he worked at the private bacteriological laboratory which he had earlier founded./nWith Nazi Germany's occupation of L'viv, Fleck was deported with his wife, Ernestina Waldmann, and son Ryszard to the city's Jewish ghetto. He continued his research in the hospital and developed a new procedure in which he procured a vaccine from the urine of typhus patients. Fleck's work was known to the German occupiers and his family were arrested in December 1942 and deported to the Laokoon pharmaceutical factory to produce a typhus serum. He and his family were arrested again and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp on 7 February 1943. His task was to diagnose syphilis, typhus and other illnesses using serological tests. From December 1943 until the liberation of Poland on 11 April 1945, Fleck was detained in Buchenwald concentration camp; there, he worked with Marian Ciepielowski to produce a working typhus vaccine for camp inmates, while producing a fake vaccine for the SS.[8][9]/nBetween 1945 and 1952, he served as the head of the Institute of Microbiology of the School of Medicine of Maria Sklodowska-Curie University of Lublin. In 1952, he moved to Warsaw to become the Director of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Mother and Child State Institute. In 1954 he was elected a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Fleck's research during these years focused on the question of the behavior of leucocytes in infectious and stress situations. Between 1946 and 1957 he published 87 medical and scientific articles in Polish, French, English and Swiss journals. In 1951 Fleck was awarded the National Prize for Scientific Achievements and in 1955 the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta./nIn 1956, after a heart attack and the discovery that he was suffering from lymphosarcoma, Fleck emigrated to Israel where a position was created for him at the Israel Institute for Biological Research. He died in 1961 at the age of 64 of a second heart attack./nThe Ludwik Fleck Prize is awarded annually for the best book in the area of science and technology studies. It was created by the 4S Council (Society for the Social Studies of Science) in 1992./nFleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style\".[10] Thought style throughout Fleck's work is closely associated with representational style. A \"fact\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. He argued, however, that within the active cultural style of a thought collective, knowledge claims or facts were constrained by passive elements arising from the observations and experience of the natural world. This passive resistance of natural experience represented within the stylized means of the thought collective could be verified by anyone adhering to the culture of the thought collective, and thus facts could be agreed upon within any particular thought style.[11] Thus while a fact may be verifiable within its own collective, it may be unverifiable in others. He felt that the development of scientific facts and concepts was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but at times required changing older concepts, methods of observations, and forms of representation. This changing of prior knowledge is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. He also notes some features of the culture of modern natural sciences that recognize provisionality and evolution of knowledge along the value of pursuit of passive resistances.[7] This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.", "60164478": "Thea D.

She also has a long-distance sweetheart named Bobby Santiago, the big brother of Ronnie Anne Santiago who is Lincoln's best friend; however, Lori enjoys seeing the two together, thinking that the two are a couple, much to their dismay. Lori wears a light blue tank top, brown cargo shorts, blue slip-on shoes, and white pearl earrings, she is tall, blonde, and stands out for being attractive. As she is the only Loud child with a driver's license,[t] Lori usually forces her siblings to do errands for her in exchange for being transported somewhere. Lori also occasionally has intense flatulence, which she denies, claiming that the sound was made by her shoes or another object like loose floorboards or a car seat. Lori is highly skilled at playing golf and is the first student in her school to join the golf varsity team as a freshman. For the first four seasons, she is a senior at Royal Woods High School and attends school with her younger sisters Leni, Luna and Luan.

She often goes shopping at the Royal Woods Mall. She has a fear of spiders that is referenced in multiple episodes, most notably \"Along Came a Sister\". Along with Luna, Leni has the best older sister relationship with Lincoln. Leni occasionally fights with Lori over things such as clothes. Leni was hired to fold clothes at Reininger's Department Store at the Royal Woods Mall. She frequently tends to be absent-minded, which requires her siblings to correct her on things she misunderstands. She didn't have a driver's license or know how to drive Vanzilla in \"Driving Miss Hazy\", but Lana's Listen Out Loud podcast reveals that she is now able to drive, although she hasn't in any actual episodes due to a lack of confidence during the actual exam.

Luna is a wild and upbeat musician who owns and plays various instruments; her signature instrument is a purple Dean ML electric guitar. Her passion for music has some negative effects, as in the episode \"For Bros About to Rock\" it is revealed that she unintentionally \"ruined\" her siblings' first concerts. The episodes \"Study Muffin\" and \"L is for Love\" revealed that Luna is bisexual,[16][17] because she is attracted both to Lincoln's male tutor Hugh and a female classmate named Sam Sharp.[v] Luna's siblings are aware that Sam is female, and are supportive of Luna's crush on her. Showrunner Michael Rubiner said that \"with 10 girls in the family\", the crew felt natural \"to explore one of them being LGBTQ\".[18] As of the episode \"Racing Hearts\", Luna and Sam are officially dating. Both of them formed the band Moon Goats with their friends, who made up most of the music club. In the episode \"Dad Reputation\", Luna joins her father's band, The Doo-Dads, as its guitar player.

Luan wears braces, a white sleeveless shirt, a yellow skirt, yellow socks, brown shoes, and 3 pink flowers. Every April Fools' Day, Luan becomes a sadistic prank-obsessed maniac, which causes her family and Clyde to fear the holiday. While the pranks she pulls are mostly successful, the tables are occasionally turned against her as seen in the episodes \"Fool's Paradise\" and \"Fool Me Twice\". In the latter, Luan has stopped pulling pranks; however, in the episode \"Silence of the Luans\", Lily pulls pranks on their family, convincing Luan to resume pranking. Luan also has other talents, including performing as an expert birthday clown, juggler, magician, mime artist, and ventriloquist. Luan owns a dummy named Mr. Coconuts that she uses as part of her ventriloquy acts.

She is highly superstitious because she does not want to lose her winning streak. Lynn wears a red and white jersey, track shorts, white high-knee socks, and black cleats. Unlike Lori, Lynn is not insecure when she passes gas. She does not hesitate to burp out loud or to do things such as a Dutch oven on Lincoln. Lynn is also an expert at ninjutsu and can even run on all fours while carrying someone on her back. In the episode \"Middle Men\", it is revealed that Lynn developed a brash personality when she started middle school because she was bullied throughout her first year.

The episode \"Ties That Bind\" reveals that Lola was born two minutes after Lana, making her the younger twin. She is named after a pet Dachshund of Savino's.[8] Lola is depicted as a princess who plots and schemes to get her way and becomes maniacal if her siblings or anyone else angers her in any way. She is usually seen wearing a long pink gown, sash, a white pearl necklace and earrings, long pink gloves, pink high heels, and a tiara. Lola constantly enters child beauty pageants. When her siblings confess to each other things they did, Lola often rats on them, especially Lincoln. Underneath her mean-spirited exterior, Lola is shown to be forgiving and affectionate and admits to herself that she is a \"crazy pants\" sometimes. There is a running gag that comedically exaggerates Lola's strength when she gets angry, as when she single-handedly subdues her oldest sister Lori. Both she and Lana use a pink jeep as their mode of transportation around Royal Woods. Lola is in 1st grade at Royal Woods Elementary School for the first four seasons and attends school with Lincoln, Lucy, Lana, and Lisa. In \"Schooled!\", Lola attends 2nd grade with her sisters Lucy, Lana, and Lisa.

She wears glasses, an olive green turtleneck sweater, dark pink pants, and brown loafers. Her brown hair was revealed to be a wig in \"Potty Mouth\", having burnt it due to a botched nuclear experiment. Lisa often uses formal and detailed terms to refer to basic things before saying them in layman's terms. She often tends to be quite reckless and unethical with her experiments but is ultimately a good-hearted girl. A running gag is that Lisa's beakers filled with compound mixtures tend to explode, which occasionally mutate her body; as such, she has to wear dentures and a wig and has an extra toe. She is also a fan of west coast rap music and is very good at breakdancing. Despite her intellect, Lisa struggles greatly with simple things such as arts and crafts because of her stubby fingers and also struggles to form friendships with her peers. Some of Lisa's inventions include an assortment of robots, projects that she collaborated with Lincoln on, Gloweos (cookies infused with the bioluminescent DNA of the Aequorea victoria that make the consumer glow in the dark for a short time), a Urine Detector liquid that removes urine from bodies of water, Gravity Shoes that enable her to walk on the ceiling, a chocolate fountain that started out as a nuclear fusion device until she dropped her chocolate bar in it, a compatibility machine used to match up two people, robotic kangaroo legs to go with Lisa and Lily's shared kangaroo costume, overly-effective lie-detecting products, a chemical analysis machine, and a reanimator.

From the fifth season on, Lily is seen wearing a white shirt, lavender shorts, and white booties. Lily is babysat by Lincoln on several occasions, with whom she has the best younger sister relationship along with Lucy and Lana. She has a habit of losing her diaper, which her older siblings put back on. Her siblings and her parents always change Lily's diaper in her and Lisa's room. Prior to season five, the only phrase aside from gibberish Lily says is \"poo-poo\", usually as her diaper flies across the screen or she needs a diaper change. Lily shares a room with her older sister Lisa and her gibberish can sometimes be translated by her older siblings. Around the end of \"Washed Up\", Lily is the only one who sees Lake Eddy's residential cryptid Plessy which Lincoln and Lucy wanted to find. In \"Any Given Sundae\", Lily tries her first ice cream and enjoys it. As of \"Schooled!\", Lily is able to speak more words and is now potty-trained.

The latter episode revealed that Lynn Sr. was on bad terms with his brother ever since he accidentally broke his exercise ball. Lincoln tried to mend the relationship between his father and Lance, only for further attempts to backfire after Lynn Sr. mistook Lance's attempt to kill a spider as deliberately breaking his new spatula. After Lincoln, Lori, and Lance's daughter Shelby got stuck on a sheet of cracking ice on Lake Mastodon, the two brothers decided to put aside their rivalry to help their children./nRita Loud (voiced by Jill Talley,[26] portrayed by Muretta Moss in A Loud House Christmas,[3] Jolie Jenkins in The Really Loud House and A Really Haunted Loud House) is the mother of the Loud children.

Leonard was originally a traveling fisherman as seen in \"Camped!\" until he got word from his son when Camp Mastodon was closing. When the treasure was found and he used his boat to save his family, Leonard offered to use the treasure to keep Camp Mastodon open as its new proprietor so that he can be closer to his family.

Starting in \"The Old and the Restless\", Albert moved into Sunset Canyon Retirement Home where his old friends live. In \"Pop Pop the Question\", he proposes to Myrtle, and they are currently engaged./nMyrtle (voiced by Jennifer Coolidge) is the girlfriend of Albert. Because she traveled extensively in her youth prior to meeting Albert, Myrtle never married or had children of her own. When she became Albert's girlfriend, she started to treat the Loud children as her own grandchildren. Upon accepting her, the children started to call her \"Gran-Gran\" as she had wanted them to call her.

This is proposed to have been driven by new physical morphogenetic and patterning effects set into motion when the products of the ancient developmental toolkit genes first came to operate on the multicellular scale in the late Precambrian-early Cambrian. The resulting forms were then \"locked in\" by stabilizing selection.[6][7][8]/nNewman has proposed a theory for the evolution of cell differentiation in animals. Based on a detailed consideration of gene regulatory components and processes that distinguish this group from all other forms of life, including their nearest holozoan relatives, he has suggested that the topologically associating domains found in the nuclei of metazoan cells had a unique propensity to amplify and exaggerate inherent physiological and structural functionalities of unicellular ancestors.[9]/nWith the evolutionary biologist Gerd B. M\u00fcller, Newman edited Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press, 2003). This book on evolutionary developmental biology is a collection of papers by various researchers on generative mechanisms that were plausibly involved in the origination of disparate body forms during the Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods. Particular attention is given to epigenetic factors, such as physical determinants and environmental parameters, that may have led to the rapid emergence of body plans and organ forms during a period when multicellular organisms had relatively plastic morphologies.[10]/nNewman has advanced a novel scenario for the origin of birds, the Thermogenic Muscle Hypothesis. Characteristic anatomical specializations of birds, e.g., bipedality, the capacity for flight, are proposed to be secondary to the hyperplasia of thigh and breast skeletal muscles that arose in compensation for the loss of several genes in saurian ancestors.[11][12]/nNewman has been an outspoken critic of proposed uses of developmental biology to modify human species identity, including cloning and germline genetic manipulation.[13] In 1997, in order to encourage public discussion of these emerging technologies, he applied for a U.S. patent on a human-nonhuman chimera, a composite organism (like the \"geep\") arising from a mixture of embryonic cells of two or more species.[14][15] Although the patent was ultimately denied,[16] it raised Constitutional and moral questions and was the subject of numerous articles in the legal and philosophical literature.

She was educated in medicine at the universities of Bonn, Munich and Freiburg, and became research assistant to the pharmacologist Ulrich Friedemann. When he and other Jewish colleagues were dismissed by the Nazis, she was initially overlooked, because she was only partly Jewish (her mother was Jewish),[1] but eventually she was dismissed too./nTogether with her older sisters Luci and Maud, she travelled to England in 1933, where she joined the laboratory of Joshua Harold Burn at the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, University of London. When Burn was offered the post of professor of pharmacology at Oxford in 1938, she went with him. She remained as Burn's assistant until 1946, when she was appointed university demonstrator and lecturer, and began to conduct her own research independently. From 1950 until she retired in 1971 she led a flourishing research group exploring the physiology of smooth muscle, an area that had hitherto been neglected./nShe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1958./nEdith B\u00fclbring was born in Bonn on 27 December 1903 to Hortense Leonore B\u00fclbring (n\u00e9e Kann; 1868\u20131938), the Dutch daughter of a Jewish banker from The Hague, and Dr. Karl B\u00fclbring, a German Professor of English at the University of Bonn (1863\u20131917). Although her mother came from a Jewish background and her father was Protestant, Edith was atheist. She was the youngest of four children (Hans, Luci, Maud and Edith). At the age of six, Edith began to learn the piano and she appeared to be very talented. During World War I (WWI; 1914\u20131918) Edith and her two older sisters moved to The Hague, the Netherlands to stay with their uncle, the prominent Royal banker Jacobus Henricus Kann.  Hans, her brother, was a soldier in World War I and was killed in 1918.[2] Although she became a proficient piano player, she decided to study medicine instead of music, a fact that surprised her teacher as Edith had shown real talent.[2]/nIn 1923 B\u00fclbring entered the University of Bonn to study physiology hoping to eventually read medicine. Her enthusiasm for histology led her to work in the laboratory of Boeke, a renowned anatomist. The techniques she acquired during this working period became the basis for her work of her first publication and doctorate in medicine.[2]/nB\u00fclbring spent a year in Munich focusing on internal medicine, paediatrics and surgery attracted by the reputation of Friedrich von M\u00fcller, a Professor of Internal Medicine. The following year she moved to Freiburg for a semester, where she attended the lectures of Paul Trendelenburg. She then returned to Bonn for her final year.[2]/nIn Bonn she was supervised by Professor Ceelen, a pathological anatomist. For her dissertation, she applied a technique she had learned from Boeke on how to stain nerve fibres to the cells of phaeochromocytoma, showing they also pushed out nerve fibres. It was submitted on 3 May 1928 and published as volume 268 of Virchows Archiv.[2]/nFollowing the completion of her studies she moved to Berlin to work as a house physician. A year later, she was persuaded by Paul Trendelenburg to work at his laboratory in Berlin. While in his laboratory she was required to demonstrate the perfused frog heart in which inflow and outflow resistance could be controlled. She used this preparation later on in her studies of drug action (published in 1930).[2]/nAfter the death of her mentor, Paul Trendelenburg, she left Berlin for a year and worked as a paediatrician in Jena. She returned to Berlin a year later (in 1932) to work at the infectious disease unit in the Virchow Krankenhaus. While living in Berlin, the rise of the Nazi party began was a concern of B\u00fclbring due to her Jewish ancestry. She was dismissed from the hospital, as it was made illegal for people of Jewish background to hold university or other professional posts. Soon after her dismissal she left for England with her sisters, Luci and Maud.[2]/nB\u00fclbring's interest in smooth muscle was borne from frustration with their unpredictable responses. She has been quoted saying: \"Using them [smooth muscles] for assays and always finding them totally incomprehensible; I just could not understand their behavior: why they would contract one time and relax the next hour to the same dose, at the same temperature, in the same conditions, and so forth. All these things upset me to such a degree that I did not want to work with them in this way anymore unless I understood them.\"[2]/nIn 1953 Gustav Born joined B\u00fclbring in her work initiating a collaboration that became the origin of her smooth muscle group. Early on with the group, she researched the metabolism and passive electrical properties of smooth muscle. She also studied the role that serotonin plays in peristalsis in the small intestine. She innovated a double sucrose gap apparatus that she used in her experiments. B\u00fclbring was concerned with the effect that neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine and adrenaline, have on smooth muscle tension.[2] She published three papers on taeniae in 1969 which concluded that the hyperpolarisation of the membrane that can be observed following the application of adrenaline is a result of the membrane's increased permeability to chloride and potassium.[2]/nB\u00fclbring was known to have a strong respect for her colleagues and their work. She encouraged people to develop their techniques, skills and be independent scientists. She always showed great ability to obtaining funds for her work, creating relationships with charities, councils and industry partners. These capacities combined allowed for the group to build a large research group.[2]/nB\u00fclbring's influence and work throughout a 40-year span allowed the fledgling field of smooth muscle to burgeon. The techniques developed in her laboratory led to increasing knowledge of the physiology of smooth muscle, and the activities of the many scientists who spent time working with her spread her interest and enthusiasm for the in-depth study of this type of tissues all over the world.[2]/nB\u00fclbring's work on catecholamines and on smooth muscle led to her election to the Royal Society in 1958.[2] Her multiple successes were recognised widely for which she received a number of awards, including The Schmiedeberg-Plakette of the Deutsche Pharmakologische Gesellschaft, The Wellcome Gold Medal in Pharmacology, and honorary degrees in Groningen, Leuven and Homburg (Saar).[3][4]/nAfter retiring in 1971, B\u00fclbring worked in a laboratory at the Physiology Laboratory in Oxford. Atherosclerosis and an old ankle injury that caused her to have poor circulation to her foot led to the amputation of her leg below the knee. A septuagenarian, she had a Swiss prosthesis made and had modifications made to her car, returning to her work. When her atherosclerosis progressed and the circulation in her other leg began failing, she tried all manner of treatments. Following a risky operation, Bulbring died on 5 July 1990.[2]/nB\u00fclbring has been acknowledged by physiologists and pharmacologists as the most influential smooth muscle physiologist in the world.

In 1860, he accompanied his father, Jarvis William Hartt, to Saint John, New Brunswick, where they established a high school for young women in which Charles Frederick taught for a year. Hartt also studied the geology of New Brunswick, and devoted special attention to the Devonian shales, in which he discovered an abundance of land plants and insects.[1][2]/nIn 1861, Hartt started to work as a student assistant for Louis Agassiz at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University.  This work lasted until 1864, when he received an appointment on the geological survey of New Brunswick.[1][2] In 1865 he accompanied Agassiz to Brazil in the Thayer Expedition.[3][4]/nAgassiz was mainly concerned with collecting fish on the expedition through the Amazonian basin.[3] He also hypothesized that Brazil had also been affected by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), so supported field work to find evidence supporting glaciation, such as gravel beds. His close assistant Hartt instead found evidence that other factors such as organic decay caused specific features in the Brazilian landscape. In the 20th century, extensive field work by other scientists mapped a vast ancient savannah that had separated the Amazonian rainforest into two separate ecosystems during the glaciation of other regions. The separation of ecosystems could theoretically support increased speciation. But in the 21st century, additional research was funded to answer hypothetical concerns about the potential extinction of the entire Amazonian ecosystem during predicted global warming. This field work indicated there were areas in the western lowlands near Lake Pata that retained lush tropical rainforest,[5] so the complete natural history of the Amazonian basin during the LGM is developing a more complex narrative in which Hartt's field work can be expounded./nAgassiz and Hartt were also searching in 1865 for evidence that could prove or disprove the 1859 Darwinian evolutionary theory, in contrast to the multiple creation theory it proposed to replace. From a scientific point of view, Darwinism could potentially resolve inconsistencies in the multiple creation narrative, just as multiple creation theory was an attempt to resolve inconsistencies in the single creation theory. The inconsistencies were facts that could not be compellingly explained by each theory./nEvolutionary theory was not immediately accepted because of a lack of fossil evidence (an issue resolved by discovery of more and more fossil \"missing links\") and its inability to explain the distribution of species better than multiple creation theory (an issue resolved in the 1960s by plate tectonics). There were a few inconsistencies such as the Lamarckian idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics that Darwin had accepted and later expanded upon in his writings on heredity.[6]:\u200a108\u200a[7][8]/nHartt fell in love with Brazil, and spent 15 months exploring the coastal regions from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. The large zoological collections he made were later used to prepare his Geology and Physical Geography of Brazil (Boston, 1870).[1] In 1868 he was elected professor of natural history at Vassar College, but later in the same year he accepted a post at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, and planned to return to Brazil. Charles married Lucy Cornelia Lynde of Buffalo, New York, in 1869.  They had two children, Mary and Rollin.  Both children became writers./nIn all, Hartt participated in four expeditions to Brazil (the Morgan Expeditions) from 1870 to 1878. He collected a great deal of data about the land and the people, contributing to new knowledge about the flora, the fauna, minerals, geography, linguistics and ethnography. He was an accomplished draftsman and illustrator and musician. In his last voyage he collected more than 500,000 specimens, which were donated to the National Museum of Rio de Janeiro, where he worked as the founder and director of the section of geology from 1866 to 1867./nIn 1875, following a suggestion by Hartt, the Emperor Dom Pedro II (1825\u20131891) established the Imperial Geological Commission. The Commission was closed down after two years of work after losing the Emperor's support. Hartt was joined by his wife and children in Brazil in 1875, but they returned to the United States without him when his wife got pregnant.[9]/nHartt died in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 1878, after contracting yellow fever, at the age of 38. Agassiz died earlier, in 1873, before major discoveries could provide substantial fossil evidence and before the neo-Darwinists improved Darwinism by asserting the Weismann barrier in 1893. Hartt had gathered useful specimens in Brazil that could be explained by the 20th century Darwinian narrative of accelerated evolution, which hypothesized that Amazonian butterflies survived in isolated refuges during ice ages. But in the 21st century the refuge mechanism has been diminished as a possible explanation by research that determined sufficient rainfall maintained a more complete ecosystem,[10] which increases the likelihood of a more complex mosaic mechanism to explain the variations in Hartt's specimens.[11] The ancient pollen data in the Bolivian rainforest of the Amazonian basin indicates that it was savannah during the LGM.[12]/nOne of Hartt's students, the American geologist Orville Adalbert Derby (1851\u20131915), succeeded him at the National Museum, after having accompanied him in two of the Morgan Expeditions (1870 and 1871) and having worked with him at the Imperial Commission./nThe Armoured Catfish genus Harttia is named after him.[13]", "59902484": "Katja Fennel is an oceanographer studying the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.

He published three papers from his dissertation:  \"Teleology and the Logical Structure of Function Statements\",[7] \"Complexity and Organization\",[8]  and  \"Reductionism, levels of organization, and the mind-body problem\".[9]   From July 1969 to December 1970, he was a postdoctoral fellow in population biology with Richard Lewontin at the University of Chicago, and was subsequently hired as an assistant professor of Philosophy in 1971 and promoted to full professor in 1981.[5]/nIn 2007, he was named the Peter H.

For Wimsatt, robustness (e.g., believing that a particular apple exists because we can see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and hear it crunch when we eat it) is fundamental for accessing what exists in the world. The more we can detect things in multiple ways, the more we are inclined to believe they exist. Closely connected to robustness are the heuristics, which we use to think about the world and are foundational to his epistemology. They are rules of thumb, which can be wrong or biased but tend to work when applied to what is robust in the world.[14]   For Wimsatt, questions of realism (i.e., what exists) are not separable from questions of epistemology (i.e., what we can know) and the discovery of what exists.[15] This may appear circular, but it is by evolution that we have evolved multiple ways of detecting things in the world.[14]/nRichard Lewontin, Richard Levins, Herbert A.

Among the famous discoveries were the J/psi and tau particles. A byproduct of the ring's operation was an intense beam of synchrotron radiation.  Rubenstein and his colleagues E. Barrie Hughes and Robert Hofstadter posited that there may be numerous applications of this intensely powerful, tuneable, and linearly polarized radiation to biomedical imaging, including intravenous coronary arteriography.  They devised a synchrotron radiation based imaging system which has been used worldwide.[4][5]/nRubenstein proposed that the polarized synchrotron light which is emitted by relativistic electrons orbiting neutron stars (linear in the plane of rotation, with opposite helicity above and below the plane) would selectively photolyze chiral molecules floating on grains in nearby space.

He presented this theory in 1910, in his work, The Theory of Two Plasms as the Basis of Symbiogenesis, a New Study of the Origins of Organisms, although the fundamentals of the idea had already appeared in his earlier 1905 work, The nature and origins of chromatophores in the plant kingdom./nKonstantin was born in Saint Petersburg, one of six sons and three daughters in the Mereschkowski family. His father Sergey Ivanovich  served as a senior official in several Russian local governors' cabinets (including that of I.D. Talyzin in Orenburg) before entering Alexander II's court office as a privy councillor. His mother Varvara Vasilyevna (n\u00e9e Tcherkasova) was a daughter of a senior Saint Petersburg security official, and was fond of arts and literature. The writer Dmitry Merezhkovsky (1866\u20131941) was one of his younger brothers.[1][2]/nFrom 1875 to 1880 he worked for his degree at the University of Saint Petersburg, travelling north to the White Sea to examine marine invertebrates and discovering a genus of Hydrozoa. On graduating he travelled to France and Germany, meeting famous scientists; he published on anthropology and animal pigments while in Paris.[3]/nIn 1883 he married Olga Petrovna Sultanova, and became a lecturer at the University of Saint Petersburg. In 1886 they emigrated from Russia for unexplained reasons, possibly connected to the acts of paedophilia for which he was later prosecuted. The family set up home in Crimea, where he found work as a botanist looking at varieties of grape; he also created a substantial collection of diatoms from the Black Sea. In 1898, he left his wife and young son in Crimea and emigrated to America, where he took the name \"William Adler\". He worked in California as a botanist at Los Angeles and University of California, Berkeley, devising a new system of classification of the diatoms based on the internal structures of the specimens in his Black Sea collection. In 1902, he returned to Russia to become curator of zoology at Kazan University; he became a lecturer there in 1904, and started to develop his ideas on the symbiotic origins of complex cells. In 1914 he was prosecuted for raping more than two dozen girls. He had earlier escaped Saint Petersburg in 1886 and the Crimea in 1898 for fear of being prosecuted for similar crimes. He was dismissed from Kazan University, and escaped to France.[4] In 1918 he moved to the Conservatoire Botanique in Geneva, where he worked on Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert's lichen collection.[3][5][6]/nIn Geneva, he became seriously depressed, ran out of money, and on 9 January 1921 he was found dead in his hotel room, having tied himself up in his bed with a mask which was supplied with an asphyxiating gas from a metal container. It appears that his suicide was directly connected to his pedophilic utopian beliefs (reflected in his 1903 book of stories, Earthly Paradise, or a Winter Night's Dream. Tales from the 27th century) as well as his view that he was becoming too old and frail to continue his history of child abuse. As an atheist, his dreamed-of utopia was to be scientifically based, involving the evolution of a perfect human race of pedophiles held aloft by the enslavement of Africans, Asians, and others. The Earthly Paradise describes specially-bred castes of human including one of neotenised, sexualizing children prolonged into adult age - still displaying child-like features and behaviour - who were put to death at the age of 35, as they could not be happy in old age. Further, he held extreme ideological beliefs on eugenics and antisemitism. He actively assisted the far-right Black Hundredist organisation the Kazan Department of the Union of Russian People, and provided secret assistance to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in hunting down Jews and supposed traitors.[6][7][8]/nMereschkowski argued that the cell organelles, the nucleus and the chloroplast, are the descendants of bacteria that evolved into an intracellular symbiosis with amoebae.[10][11][9][12] His work was influenced by the French botanist Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper who had noted that chloroplasts resembled cyanobacteria.[13] Mereschkowski's ideas are according to K. V. Kowallik \"strikingly\"[9] reflected in the modern symbiogenesis theory developed and popularised by Ivan Wallin[13] and Lynn Margulis, and now widely accepted. The modern view is that two endosymbiotic events did take place, one by incorporating bacteria that became the mitochondria of all eukaryotes, and another soon afterwards in the line that became the plants to form chloroplasts.[9][14]/nAround the turn of the century, Mereschkowski formed a sizeable lichen herbarium, containing over 2000 specimens collected from Russia, Austria and around the Mediterranean. The collection remains at Kazan University. It had recently been shown that each lichen species consisted of a mutualistic symbiosis between a fungus and one or more algae. This may have inspired his theory of symbiogenesis. Mereschkowski rejected Darwinian evolution, believing that natural selection could not explain biological novelty. He argued instead that the acquisition and inheritance of microbes was central. He was criticised and even ridiculed by other biologists,[3] such as the Polish lichenologist Alexandr Alexandrovich Elenkin.[15]/nSpecies named after Mereschkowski include Plowrightia mereschkowskyi Vouaux (1912),[16] Physcia mereschkowskii Tomin (1926),[17] and Caloplaca mereschkowskiana S.Y.Kondr. & K\u00e4rnefelt (2011).\n[18]", "46271123": "Ann C.

Tkachuk and his coauthors are also credited research priority on determining the mechanisms of inhibition and activation of adenylate-cyclase by adenylyl nucleotides and nucleosides./nIn the 80s, as the head of molecular endocrinology lab of the All-Union cardiological research center, V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues researched the role of various G-proteins in adenylate-cyclase activity regulation and Ca2+- dependent channels in myocardium, vessel, endothelial, smooth muscle cells and platelets. This research determined the molecular mechanisms of G-proteins\u2019 influence on the development of both cell hypersensitivity and cell tolerance to catecholamine and medication. It was revealed that cell hormone sensitivity deviation developed alongside hypertension, ischemia or myocardial infarction./nIn the same period, more research under V. A. Tkachuk's direction determined the mechanism of hypoxia's influence on cell's hormone sensitivity. It was revealed that during hypoxia phosphoinositide signaling is activated in endothelial cells, which leads to the activation of protein kinase C triggering the endocytosis of b-adrenergic receptors, which in turn leads to the cells developing insensitivity to catecholamines. During deep hypoxia and anoxia ATF- and ADF- hydrolyzing ferments disappear from the surface of endothelial cells, which leads to enhanced aggregation of platelets and endothelium hormone secretion./nIn the 90s, a group directed by V. A. Tkachuk published a number of papers on stretching receptors\u2019 involvement in specific regulation of gene expression in vessel cells. It was demonstrated that when a single smooth muscle cell is rhythmically stretched, it shows increased expression of a number of genes (caldesmon, calponin, \u03b1-actine, smooth muscle myosin), along with increased proliferation ability./nDiscovery and research of T-Cadherin functions/nIn the early of the 90s, while studying blood cells, V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues discovered that calcium ions get mobilized in platelets under the influence of lipoproteins, which leads to their aggregation. This effect is more pronounced under the influence of adrenaline. Around the same time it was discovered that Ca2+ is mobilized in smooth muscle cells (SMC) under the influence of angiotensin and endothelin. Using a SMC culture more fitting for experiments, the researchers managed to demonstrate that low density lipoproteins are capable of stimulating Ca2+ to exit endoplasmic reticulum. This effect occurs without involving the classic ApoB/E receptor (Goldstein and Brown received a Nobel prize in 1986 for discovering the ApoB/E receptor). To identify this new lipoprotein-binding receptor, it was purified and segregated. After that it was classified as T-Cadherin \u2013 a protein from the group of cadherins responsible for hemophilic intracellular interaction. During further research V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues found out that unlike the other classical cadherins (N-, E-, VE- cadherin), T-cadherin does not bypass intracellular adhesion, but instead causes the cells to repel each other and is involved in the cell migration and cytoskeleton restructuring./nFurther research revealed that T-cadherin is a navigational receptor what helps migrating cells and growing blood vessels avoid certain tissues and that linking lipoproteins with T-cadherin can disrupt angiogenesis and affect heart and vessel remodeling. It was later determined that T-cadherin expressed in endothelial cells is able to regulate endothelium permeability and is part of tumor angiogenesis and growth, as well as melanoma metastasis./nResearch of the biological functions of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/nSince early 90s V. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues (E. V. Parfyonova, R. Sh. Bibilashvili, S. P. Domogatskiy, A. Bobik and others) have been studying the molecular mechanisms of blood vessel growth. In particular, a lot of research was focused on the role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Urokinase, uPA) in angiogenesis and vessel remodeling./nIt was revealed that an increased expression of uPA and its receptor (uPAR) occurred in damaged vessel cells. This process was accompanied by increased taxis of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, as well as narrowing of the lumen of the vessel, but if the uPA was suppressed by counteractive antibodies, the intensity of this process was reduced. It turned out that enhanced expression of uPA caused proliferation of vessel cells and stimulated the synthesis of oxidative stress and inflammation proteins./nV. A. Tkachuk and his colleagues have also for the first time showed urokinase's ability to transport itself into the core and interact with transcriptional factors that regulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and their transformation into myofibroblasts. The latest research showed that the urokinase system in the vessels was necessary for determining the growth and branching trajectory of the capillaries, i.e. it performs a navigational function./nV. A. Tkachuk's research has revealed some interesting results regarding the role of uPA in directional cell migration. It was determined that uPA connects with uPAR and this complex concentrates on the leading edge of the cell - on the surface that is closest to the chemoattractant. Later research on uPA's significance in migration processes revealed that its concentration on the leading edge of the cell allows for local destruction of matrix proteins and facilitates migration. This process is realized through activation of plasminogen and starting fibrinolysis, as well as through the stimulating effect uPA has on MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity./nThese results formed the basis of the development of a drug for therapeutic angiogenesis via uPA gene delivery to the tissues affected by ischemia, as well the creation of the \u201cUpicor\u201d \u2013 a drug used to treat chronic ischemia of lower limbs./nResearch of the role of mesenchyme stem cells in tissue regeneration/nV. A. Tkachuk directs active research on the mechanisms of physiological renewal, tissue and organ regeneration and reparation, as well as the role of mesenchyme stem cells (MSC) of various tissues in this process. It was discovered that MSC is able to induce blood vessel and nerve growth during damaged tissues recovery. It was also revealed that the stimulating effect these cells have is caused not only by their secretion of soluble proteins (growth factors, cytokines and chemokines), but also by their secretion of extracellular vesicles. During the ascertainment of the mechanisms of MSC's effects on tissue regeneration and reparation, active study was being conducted on the effects hypoxia and inflammation occurring alongside many diseases have on biological activity of this kind of cells. It was discovered that angiogenic factor production in MSC is activated under the effects of hypoxia, and that cells produce immunomodulating cytokines (including immunosuppressant cytokines) under the conditions of inflammation. The results of this research opens up new approaches for treatments of infection and systemic disease, as well as organ and tissue transplantation./nA line of gene therapy drugs was developed on the basis of fundamental research conducted under V. A. Tkachuk's direction. These drugs are designed to stimulate blood vessel growth and peripheral nerves recovery after trauma./nV. A. Tkachuk is the author and coauthor of 330 articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, 32 patents and over 20 monographs.

I am lucky in not having been torn between the two; I have managed to combine them.[3]/nHe was selected for camouflage work by the artist Solomon J. Solomon, who apparently mistook him for a different Hardy who was a professional artist.[4] Hardy however did have sufficient artistic skill to serve his military and scientific work. He illustrated his New Naturalist books with his own line drawings, maps, diagrams, photographs, and paintings.[5] For example, plate 2 of Fish and Fisheries illustrates the depicted \"Rare and Unusual Fish in British Waters\" both accurately and vividly. Hardy described the camoufleurs as including artists and \"scientists with artistic inclinations\", himself perhaps among them.[4]/nIn later life, Hardy travelled in India, Sri Lanka, Burma, Cambodia, China and Japan, recording his visits to temples in all those countries in watercolour paintings. Many of these are in the University of Wales Trinity Saint David collection.[6]/nHardy was the zoologist on the RRS Discovery voyage to explore the Antarctic between 1925 and 1927, as part of the Discovery Investigations. Through his studies of zooplankton and its relationship with predators, he became expert in marine mammals such as whales. Whilst on board the Discovery he designed and later built a mechanism called the Continuous Plankton Recorder or CPR.  The CPR collects plankton samples and stores them on a moving band of silk, preserving them in formalin.  His pioneering research into plankton distribution and abundance is continued by the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey (CPR Survey)./nHardy was the first Professor of Zoology at the University of Hull from 1928 \u2013 1942.  In 1942, he was then appointed Professor of Natural History at the University of Aberdeen, where he remained until 1946, when he became Linacre Professor of Zoology in the University of Oxford and Fellow of Merton College, a position he held until 1963.[7] In 1940, Hardy was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.[1] He was knighted in 1957./nHardy identified as a Darwinian, he denied the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. He was a proponent of organic selection (also known as the Baldwin effect). He held the view that behavioral changes can be important for evolution.[8][9]/nIn 1930, while reading Wood Jones' Man's Place among the Mammals, which included the question of why humans, unlike all other land mammals, had fat attached to their skin, Hardy realized that this trait sounded like the blubber of marine mammals, and began to suspect that humans had ancestors that were more aquatic than previously imagined.  Fearing a backlash against such a radical idea, he kept this hypothesis secret until 1960, when he spoke and later wrote on the subject, which subsequently became known as the aquatic ape hypothesis in academic circles,[10] and has been promoted in particular by Elaine Morgan, who acknowledged her debt to Hardy in her book The Scars of Evolution,[11] and elsewhere.[12]/nDating from his boyhood at Oundle School, Hardy had a lifelong interest in spiritual phenomena, but aware that his interests were likely to be considered unorthodox in the scientific community, apart from occasional lectures he kept his opinions to himself until his retirement from his Oxford Chair. During the academic sessions of 1963\u20134 and 1964\u20135, he gave the Gifford Lectures at Aberdeen University on 'Evolution and the spirit of Man', later published as The Living Stream and The Divine Flame. These lectures signalled his wholehearted return to his religious interests. In 1969 he founded the Religious Experience Research Unit in Manchester College, Oxford. The Unit began its work by compiling a database of religious experiences and continues to investigate the nature and function of spiritual and religious experience at the University of Wales, Lampeter. In 1973 he met with A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and other devotees of the Hare Krishna movement and discussed Vedic literature, the divine flame and Rabindranath Tagore.[13]/nHardy's biological approach to the roots of religion is non-reductionist, seeing religious awareness as having evolved in response to a genuine dimension of reality.[14] For his work in founding the Religious Experience Research Centre, Hardy received the Templeton Prize shortly before his death in 1985.[15]/nHe was married to Sylvia Garstang in 1927.[16]/nHardy wrote numerous scientific papers on plankton, fish and whales. He wrote two popular books in the New Naturalist series, and in later life he also wrote on religion./nHardy's \"pioneering work\" was recognised by South Georgia & South Sandwich Islands in 2011 with a set of four commemorative stamps bearing his image.[17]/nThe University of Hull has named a building on its Hull Campus after Hardy.", "25037528": "Bernhard Hassenstein (31 May 1922 \u2013 16 April 2016)[1] was a German biologist and psychobiologist./nBernhard Hassenstein was a student of behavioral physiologist Erich von Holst and one of the leading researchers in the fields of behavioral biology and bio-cybernetics.

She obtained her PhD from University of California, Berkeley where she pioneered the approach to distinguish plant taxonomy using genetics. She continued this work at Berkeley as a research associate. While there, she would be the first person to count the chromosomes in algae, earn her a Guggenheim fellowship in 1952. In addition to her research, she was success at obtaining National Science Foundation funding to create a service that would annually inform how many chromosomes each plant species had to help the field of plant cytology flourish. For her contributions, Volume 33 of Madro\u00f1o, a genus (Marionella) of Delesseriaceae, and a subgenus (Mscavea) of Echeandia were all dedicated to her./nCave was born to Anna (n\u00e9e Thompson) and Joseph Stilwell in 1904 in Rochester New York.[1] Shortly thereafter they moved to Colorado where her sister Dorothy Margaret was born in 1907.[2] For undergraduate, she studied at the University of Colorado Boulder. While there, she joined the Chi Omega sorority, was the head of sports on the athletic board, joined the honor society Phi Beta Kappa, and reviewed multiple chapters of \"Colorado Plant Life\" for Francis Ramaley.[3][4][5][6][7] In 1925 she graduated cum laude and received her A.B. in biology.[8] Then in 1926 Cave received her A.M. also from University of Colorado Boulder.[9] She then moved to California to attend University of California, Berkeley and pursue her PhD.[9] While there, she joined the biological science honor society Phi sigma and later would become an officer and vice president of the honor society.[10][11] During her time there, she would be influenced by Priscilla Avery.[12] Under the direction of Ernest Brown Babcock, Cave earned her PhD in genetics in 1936 due to her efforts to apply genetics to distinguish plant taxonomy in Crepis foetida.[13]/nCave continued to work at the University of California from 1936 to 1943 as a research associate in the botany department.[5][6] During this time she continued her embryological studies by examining the female gametophyte in Erythronium helenae and Erythronium tuolumnense and she started her 20-year collaboration with Lincoln Constance studying the chromosome numbers of Hydrophyllaceae (waterleaf family).[14][15]  Besides her research endeavors, she served as an instructor of botany at the University of California College of Pharmacy in San Francisco.[16]/nFrom 1944 to 1945 Cave moved to Washington D.C. to work for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.[5][6] While there she translated studies on forest legislation from multiple South American companies.[17][18][19]/nCave returned to working as a research associate in the botany department of the University of California, Berkeley in 1945. During this time she worked in collaboration with South African phycologist Mary Pocock to pioneer techniques to count the number of chromosomes present in algae using Volvocaceae.[20] For this work she received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1952 to assist in traveling to South African.[21][22] She collaborated with Spencer Wharton Brown to discover that pollen tubes in Lilium are attracted to a \"preferred zone\" of ovules rather than another portion of the ovule.[23][24][25] Outside these collaborations she continued to champion the use of embryology in plant taxonomy using Liliaceae as her model system.[26][27][28] Besides her research she joined Society of Woman Geographers in 1957 and in 1959 she organized the Ninth International Botanical Congress in Montreal, Canada in 1959.[22][5][6] In 1966 she took a sabbatical to visit and collaborate at the University of Concepci\u00f3n in Chile.[5][6][22]/nIn 1957 two Soviet scientists M.S. Yakovlev and M.D. Joffe published in the Indian journal Phytomorphology that the angiosperm Paeonies embryo formed large coenocyte cells during early development.[29] This was striking because closely related angiosperms were not known to form large coenocyte; however, its distantly related cousin the gymnosperms do.[30][31] This finding questioned the placement of peonies within angiosperms. While leading embryologist and founder of Phytomorphology Panchanan Maheshwari allowed the article to be published, Maheshwari had qualms regarding the veracity of the finding and in turn instructed his student Prem Murgai to replicate the work.[5][6] In 1959 Murgai concluded the Soviets were wrong.[32] Murgai concluded the large coenocyte cell did not form the embryo but rather the suspensor. Interested in this controversy, Cave recruited graduate students Howard Arnott and Stanton A. Cook to investigate this matter more thoroughly. Ultimately in 1961, this team's findings agreed with Yakovlev and Joffe's initial findings.[33] The coenocyte was the embryo, and this represented an instance of parallel evolution between gymnosperms and peonies. In 1963 while Maheshwari was visiting Berkeley, he attempted to sway Cave's opinion on this matter with his lab's slides using his large presence and big personality.[5][6] In response Cave called for a young graduate student to explain to Maheshwari his mistake in their interpretation./nUpon completing her 1970 study of Californian Liliaceae chromosomes, Cave submitted her manuscript for review.[5][6]  P. E. Brandham, a staff member from Kew Gardens in London, reviewed her manuscript and claimed the images Cave produce could not be real and that Cave must have drawn on them.[34] The attack on the integrity of her data infuriated Cave and she swiftly informed the reviewer that they were mistaken.[35]/nShe married Roy Clinton Cave in 1928 in California. They lived together briefly in St. Louis, Missouri.[53] They moved back to California in 1935.[54] They moved to Washington D.C. from 1944 to 1945 so that both could work for Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.[5][6] Afterwards, they moved back to California. Outside of work she was interested in sewing, traveling, reading, and gardening.[5][6] She was survived by her sister's daughter Joan Litten.[6]/nDespite not having more space to work than a graduate student, as a research associate Cave was invested in teaching graduate students the plant photomicrography and embryology.[5][6] Some of her students included Howard Arnott, Sherwin Carlquist, Stanton A. Cook, Florence Signaigo Wagner, and Warren H. Wagner. In addition, her opinion and experiences on cytological squash techniques were requested during the formation of a Plant Microtechnique Manual.[55] Towards the end of her time at Berkeley she became the photographer for the botany department.[56] From 1952 to 1981 she took 372 photographs./nOutside of Berkeley she provided samples to help Rosalie Wunderlich of the University of Vienna resume her research program after World War II.[5][6] To help the plant cytological community, she secured funding from the National Science Foundation to create an annual compilation of all the plant species within known chromosome numbers.[57] She was the initial editor of \"Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers\" from 1956 to 1964 and then became associate editor from 1964 to 1974.[5][6][58]", "4164330": "Mary Ingraham Bunting (July 10, 1910 \u2013 January 21, 1998) was a bacterial geneticist and an influential American college president; Time profiled her as the magazine's November 3, 1961, cover story.[1][2]   She became Radcliffe College's fifth president in 1960 and was responsible for fully integrating women into Harvard University.[3]/nBunting was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Henry A. and Mary Shotwell Ingraham; she was known as \"Polly\" to distinguish her from her mother.[2] Her father was an attorney; her mother was the head of the national YWCA and helped found the USO during World War II.[2] Bunting graduated from Vassar College in 1931, and earned master's (1932) and doctoral degrees (1934) from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in agricultural bacteriology.[3][4]/nWhile at Wisconsin, she met Henry Bunting, then a medical student, who went on to teach pathology at the Yale University School of Medicine.[2] They married in 1937, and had one daughter and three sons.[4] He died of brain cancer in 1954.[2] In 1975, Bunting married Clement A.

He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck's evolutionary theories.  Geoffroy's scientific views had a transcendental flavor (unlike Lamarck's materialistic views) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken. He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology. He is considered as a predecessor of the evo-devo evolutionary concept.[1][2]/nGeoffroy was born at \u00c9tampes (in present-day Essonne), and studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, in Paris, where he studied natural philosophy under M. J. Brisson. He then attended the lectures of Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton at the College de France and Fourcroy at the Jardin des Plantes. In March 1793 Daubenton, through the interest of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, procured him the office of sub-keeper and assistant demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, made vacant by the resignation of  Bernard Germain \u00c9tienne de la Ville, Comte de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de. By a law passed in June 1793, Geoffroy was appointed one of the twelve professors of the newly constituted Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, being assigned the chair of zoology. In the same year he busied himself with the formation of a menagerie at that institution.[3]/nIn 1794, Geoffroy entered into correspondence with Georges Cuvier. Shortly after the appointment of Cuvier as assistant at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geoffroy received him into his house. The two friends wrote together five memoirs on natural history, one of which, on the classification of mammals, puts forward the idea of the subordination of characters upon which Cuvier based his zoological system. It was in a paper entitled Histoire des Makis, ou singes de Madagascar, written in 1795, that Geoffroy first gave expression to his views on the unity of organic composition, the influence of which is perceptible in all his subsequent writings; nature, he observes, presents us with only one plan of construction, the same in principle, but varied in its accessory parts.[3]/nIn 1798, Geoffroy was chosen a member of Napoleon's great scientific expedition to Egypt as part of the natural history and physics section of the Institut d'\u00c9gypte; 151[4] scientists and artists participated in the expedition, including Dominique-Vivant Denon, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier.  On the capitulation of Alexandria in August 1801, he took part in resisting the claim made by the British general to the collections of the expedition, declaring that, were that demand persisted in, history would have to record that he also had burnt a library in Alexandria. Early in January 1802 Geoffroy returned to Paris. He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in September 1807. In March of the following year Napoleon, who had already recognized his national services by the award of the cross of the legion of honor, selected him to visit the museums of Portugal, for the purpose of procuring collections from them, and in the face of considerable opposition from the British he eventually was successful in retaining them as a permanent possession for his country.[5]/nIn 1809, the year after his return to France, Geoffroy was made professor of zoology at the faculty of sciences at Paris, and from that period he devoted himself more exclusively than before to anatomical study. In 1818 he published the first part of his celebrated Philosophie anatomique, the second volume of which, published in 1822, and subsequent memoirs account for the formation of monstrosities on the principle of arrest of development, and of the attraction of similar parts.[5]/nGeoffroy's friend Robert Edmund Grant shared his views on unity of plan and corresponded with him while working on marine invertebrates in the late 1820s in Edinburgh (assisted in 1826 and 1827 by his student Charles Darwin) when Grant successfully identified the pancreas in molluscs.[citation needed] When, in 1830, Geoffroy proceeded to apply to the invertebrata his views as to the unity of animal composition, he found a vigorous opponent in Cuvier, his former friend.[5]/nGeoffroy, a synthesiser, contended, in accordance with his theory of unity of plan in organic composition, that all animals are formed of the same elements, in the same number; and with the same connections: homologous parts, however they differ in form and size, must remain associated in the same invariable order. With Johann Wolfgang von Goethe he held that there is in nature a law of compensation or balancing of growth, so that if one organ take on an excess of development, it is at the expense of some other part; and he maintained that, since nature takes no sudden leaps, even organs which are superfluous in any given species, if they have played an important part in other species of the same family, are retained as rudiments, which testify to the permanence of the general plan of creation. It was his conviction that, owing to the conditions of life, the same forms had not been perpetuated since the origin of all things, although it was not his belief that existing species are becoming modified.[5]/nCuvier, who was an analytical observer of facts, admitted only the prevalence of laws of co-existence or harmony in animal organs, and maintained the absolute invariability of species, which he declared had been created with a regard to the circumstances in which they were placed, each organ contrived with a view to the function it had to fulfil, thus putting, in Geoffroy's considerations, the effect for the cause.[5]/nIn 1836 he coined the term phocomelia.[6] In 1838 he was named an Officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.[7]/nIn July 1840, Geoffroy became blind, and some months later he had a paralytic attack. From that time his strength gradually failed him. He resigned his chair at the museum in 1841,[5] and was succeeded by his son, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.  He died in 1844 and is buried in Division 19 of the Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re Lachaise.[8]/nGeoffroy was a deist, which is to say that he believed in a God, but also in a law-like universe, with no supernatural interference in the details of existence. This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment, and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles, and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God. These views did not conflict with his naturalistic ideas about organic change.[citation needed]/nGeoffroy's theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as 'Geoffroyism'.[9] It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in habits is what changes the animal). The direct effect of environment on heritable traits is not believed today to be a central evolutionary force; even Lawrence knew by 1816 that the climate does not directly cause the major differences between human races./nGeoffroy endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that \"monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next.\"[10] In 1831 he speculated that birds could have arisen from reptiles by an epigenetic saltation.[11] Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new species instantaneously.[12] In 1864 Albert von K\u00f6lliker revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of heterogenesis.[13]/nGeoffroy noted that the organization of dorsal and ventral structures in arthropods is opposite that of mammals.

In 1905, he was appointed as Professor of Biology at the Christian College in Madras.[1] In 1906, he became assistant master at Winchester College where he later became senior science master.[1]/nMcDowall was a Christian and was ordained in the Church of England in 1908.[1] He was the chaplain at Winchester College. He was a fellow of the Physical Society of London and the Cambridge Philosophical Society.[1] McDowall was a theistic evolutionist and wrote several works on this topic.[1][2] He held the view that evolution was non-materialistic, progressive and supported the values of Christian cosmology.[1] He was influenced by Henri Bergson. In 1923\u20131924, McDowall gave the Hulsean Lectures on Evolution, Knowledge and Revelation, which were described as \"an extreme form of metaphysical idealism\".[1][3]/nHe was an active eugenicist and was the author of Biology and Mankind (1931), which advocated sterilization of the feeble-minded.[1]/nMcDowall died in Winchester on 13 January 1935.[1]", "1903368": "Timothy Fridtjof Flannery FAA (born 28 January 1956) is an Australian mammalogist, palaeontologist, environmentalist, conservationist,[3] explorer,[4] author, science communicator, activist and public scientist. He was awarded Australian of the Year in 2007 for his work and advocacy on environmental issues. He is the Geneva Graduate Institute\u2019s Fondation Segr\u00e9 Distinguished Visiting Professor.[5]/nFlannery grew up in Sandringham, and studied English at La Trobe University in 1977. He then switched disciplines to pursue paleontology. As a researcher, Flannery had roles at several universities and museums in Australia, specialising in fossil marsupials and mammal evolution. He made notable contributions to the palaeontology of Australia and New Guinea during the 1980s, including reviewing the evolution and fossil records of Phalangeridae and Macropodidae. While mammal curator at the Australian Museum, he undertook a survey of the mammals of Melanesia, where he identified 17 previously undescribed species[6] including several tree kangaroos.[7]/nIn 1994, Flannery published his first popular science book, The Future Eaters, on the natural history of Australasia. It became a bestseller and was adapted for television. He has since written more than 27 books on natural history and environmental topics, including Throwim Way Leg and Chasing Kangaroos, and has appeared on television and in the media./nAfter becoming increasingly concerned about climate change, Flannery later became prominent for his role in communication, research and advocacy around the issue, particularly in his native Australia. He spent five years writing The Weather Makers (2005) on the topic. In 2011, he was appointed the Chief Commissioner of the Climate Commission, a federal government body providing information on climate change to the Australian public, until its abolition by the Abbott government in 2013. Flannery and other sacked commissioners later formed the independent Climate Council, which continues to communicate independent climate science to the Australian public./nAn environmentalist and conservationist, Flannery is a supporter of climate change mitigation, renewable energy transition, phasing out coal power and rewilding./nFlannery was raised in a Catholic family along with his two sisters in the Melbourne suburb of Sandringham, close to Port Phillip Bay.[8] He described himself as a \"solitary\" child, spending time looking for fossils and learning to fish and scuba dive. He said he first became aware of marine pollution and its effects on living organisms during this period.[8][9] He attended Catholic school, and later said that he did not enjoy it and became an atheist. He was expelled in year 12 for suggesting a prominent abortion activist be invited to speak to counter the anti-abortionist views at the school, but was later allowed to return after an intervention from his father.[10]/nAfter failing to achieve the required school marks to study science,[8] Flannery completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English at La Trobe University in 1977.[11] After being impressed by Flannery's knowledge of natural history, palaeontologist Tom Rich and his wife encouraged him to pursue the subject, and Flannery went on to complete a Master of Science degree in Earth Science at Monash University in 1981.[10] He then left Melbourne for Sydney, enjoying its subtropical climate and species diversity.[12] In 1984, Flannery earned a PhD at the University of New South Wales in Palaeontology for his work on the evolution and fossils of macropods under palaeontologist Mike Archer.[8][13]/nAt age 26, he was hired by the mammalogy department of the Australian Museum, and took his first trips to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and elsewhere, later becoming mammal curator at the museum.[14][10] He took 15 trips in total to New Guinea (both Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya) starting in 1981 and into the 1990s, working closely with local tribes to undertake fieldwork, which he later recounted in Throwin Way Leg (1998).[14][15] A tapeworm he sent to a parasitologist following one trip was revealed to be a new species, and was later named Burtiela flanneryi after him.[15]/nFlannery has held various academic positions throughout his career. He spent many years[quantify] in Adelaide, including a spell as professor at the University of Adelaide, and 7 years as director of the South Australian Museum. He was also principal research scientist at the Australian Museum, during which time he worked to save the bandicoot population on North Head. In 1999 he held the year-long visiting chair of Australian studies at Harvard University.[16]/nIn 2007, Flannery became professor in the Climate Risk Concentration of Research Excellence at Macquarie University. He left Macquarie University in mid-2013. Flannery is also a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, and a Governor of WWF-Australia. He was also for a time director of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.[17] He has contributed to over 143 scientific papers.[18][16]/nFlannery is a professorial fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, University of Melbourne.[19] Until mid-2013 he was a professor at Macquarie University and held the Panasonic Chair in Environmental Sustainability.[20]/nFlannery rarely discusses his personal life publicly.[10][14] He met his first wife Paula Kendall while at La Trobe in the 1970s.[14] Flannery and Kendall's house south of Sydney was destroyed in a bushfire in 1994.[14] He has two children with Kendall; the couple separated in 1996.[14][10] He owns a house with a solar hot water system at Coba Point on the Hawkesbury River, 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) north of Sydney, accessible only by boat;[21] after this living location was revealed by broadcaster Ray Hadley he received threats and was given police protection.[10] His second wife is anthropologist Alexandra Szalay.[14] He has a third child with his partner Kate Holden, an author. He moved to Victoria to be with her in 2014.[10]/nIn addition to writing non-fiction, he has also written unpublished works of fiction.[22] He has described himself as a non-political person,[10] and a humanist, rather than atheist.[8]/nIn 1980, Flannery discovered an Allosaurid dinosaur fossil on the southern coast of Victoria, the first from the family known from Australia.[23] In 1985, he had a role in the ground-breaking discovery of Cretaceous fossil monotreme Steropodon, the first Mesozoic mammal fossil discovered in Australia.[24] This find extended the Australian mammal fossil record back 80\u00a0million years.[24] During the 1980s, Flannery described most of the known Pleistocene megafaunal species in New Guinea as well as the fossil record of the phalangerids, a family of possums.[25] As part of his doctoral studies, he reviewed the evolution of Macropodidae and described 29 new fossil species, including 11 new genera and three new subfamilies.[25]/nThrough the 1990s, Flannery surveyed the mammals of Melanesia\u2014identifying more than 30 species\u2014and took a leading role in conservation efforts in the region.[25] He also identified at least 17 previously undescribed species[15] during his 15 trips,[14] includes the Dingiso,[26] Sir David's long-beaked echidna[27] and the Telefomin cuscus.[28] He also found living specimens of the Bulmer's fruit bat, which were previously thought extinct.[15] In the 1990s, Flannery published The Mammals of New Guinea (Cornell Press) and Prehistoric Mammals of Australia and New Guinea (Johns Hopkins Press), the most comprehensive reference works on the subjects.[15]/nThe specific name of the greater monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex flanneryi), described in 2005, honours Flannery.[29]/nFlannery's work prompted Sir David Attenborough to describe him as being \"in the league of the all-time great explorers like Dr David Livingstone\".[30]/nIn 2022, Flannery was a co-author on new research on the origins of monotremes.[31]/nIn the 1990s, Flannery observed a change in the elevational range of trees while doing fieldwork in New Guinea, and realised it was likely to be a climate change impact. He subsequently began working on climate change more seriously[32] and shifted to campaigning and publicly communicating about climate change from the 2000s.[14]/nFlannery's prominence in raising awareness around the subject, and efforts to oppose climate change denial, have occasionally attracted hostility from the media.[14][33] Some of Flannery's academic peers were also initially critical of Flannery for speaking outside of his primary area of expertise.[14] When discussing this in 2009, Flannery said that climate change science was a less established field earlier in his career and experts from multiple fields had shifted to respond to the issue, and said he feels publicly funded scientists are obliged to communicate their work and be vocal on important issues.[14] In 2015, the Jack P. Blaney Award for Dialogue recognised Flannery for using dialogue and authentic engagement to build global consensus for action around climate change.[34] As of 2021, he had attended six United Nations Climate Change conferences in official government roles and as an observer.[32]/nIn 2002, Flannery was appointed as chair of South Australia's Environmental Sustainability Board and was an advisor on climate change to South Australian Premier Mike Rann.[35] He was a member of the Queensland Climate Change Council established by the Queensland Minister for Sustainability, Climate Change and Innovation Andrew McNamara.[36]/nHe was chairman of the Copenhagen Climate Council, an international group of business and other leaders that coordinated a business response to climate change and assisted the Danish government in the lead up to COP15.[37][32]/nFlannery has frequently discussed the effects of climate change, particularly on Australia, and advocated for its mitigation.[38] During the devastating Black Summer bushfires of 2019\u201320, Flannery frequently appeared in the media[39][40][41] to discuss the links between climate change and the unprecedented bushfires, stating, \"I am absolutely certain that [the bushfires are] climate change caused.\"[42]/nIn February 2011, it was announced that Flannery had been appointed to head the Climate Commission established by Prime Minister Julia Gillard to explain climate change and the need for a carbon price to the public.[43] The commission was a panel of leading scientists and business experts whose mandate was to provide an \"independent and reliable\" source of information for all Australians.[44]/nFollowing the election of the Abbott government in the 2013 Australian federal election, on 19 September 2013 Flannery was sacked from his position as head of the Climate Commission in a phone call from new Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt. \"It was a short and courteous conversation,\" Flannery recalls. \"I'm pretty sure that cabinet hadn't been convened when they did it. My very strong recollection is that it was [the Abbott Government's] very first act in government... The website that we'd spent a lot of time building was taken down with absolutely no justification as far as I could see. It was giving basic information that was being used by many, many people\u2014teachers and others\u2014just to gain a better understanding of what climate science was actually about.\"[45] It was also announced that the commission would be dismantled and its remit handled by the Department of Environment.[46][47]/nBy 6 October 2013, Flannery and the other commissioners had launched a new body called the Climate Council. Flannery told ABC News that the organisation stated that it had the same goals as the former Climate Commission, to provide independent information on the science of climate change. Amanda McKenzie was appointed as CEO. Between 24 September and 6 October the new Climate Council had raised $1 million in funding from a public appeal, sufficient to keep the organisation operating for 12 months.[48] The Climate Council continues to exist based on donations from the general public./nIn 1994, Flannery published The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People, which became a bestseller.[14][26] The synopsis of the work regards three waves of human migration in these regions. These waves of people Flannery describes as \"future eaters\". The first wave was the migration to Australia and New Guinea from Southeast Asia approximately 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The second was Polynesian migration to New Zealand and surrounding islands 800 to 3,500 years ago.[49] The third and final wave Flannery describes is European colonisation at the end of the 18th century./nFlannery describes the evolution of the first wave of future-eaters:/nSixty thousand or more years ago human technology was developing at what we would consider to be an imperceptible pace. Yet it was fast enough to give the first Australasians complete mastery over the 'new lands'. Freed from the ecological constraints of their homeland and armed with weapons honed in the relentless arms race of Eurasia, the colonisers of the 'new lands' were poised to become the world\u2019s first future eaters.[50]/nIn contrast with other hypotheses that climate variability and change had shaped the evolutionary history of Australia, he instead attributed the continent's nutrient-poor soil as a driver.[26] He also proposed that Aboriginal Australians had shaped the continent's ecosystems through their fire-stick farming and unique practices.[26] It also advocates for modern societies of the Australasian region adapt to its unique ecological conditions, including managing the environment, consuming local rather than imported species, and limiting human population growth.[14][51]/nThe Future Eaters enjoyed strong sales and critical acclaim. Redmond O'Hanlon, a Times Literary Supplement correspondent said that \"Flannery tells his beautiful story in plain language, science popularising at its antipodean best\". Fellow activist David Suzuki praised Flannery's \"powerful insight into our current destructive path\". Some experts disagreed with Flannery's thesis, however, concerned that his broad-based approach, ranging across multiple disciplines, ignored counter-evidence and was overly simplistic.[52]/nThe Future Eaters was adapted into a documentary series for ABC Television.[53]/nWhile reading scientific journals more widely during his tenure at South Australian Museum, Flannery became increasingly alarmed by anthropogenic climate change.[14] He spent five years writing a book on the topic.[14] This culminated in The Weather Makers: The History & Future Impact of Climate Change published in 2005, in which he outlined the science behind climate change for a general audience.[14] \"With great scientific advances being made every month, this book is necessarily incomplete,\" Flannery writes, but \"That should not, however, be used as an excuse for inaction. We know enough to act wisely.\"/nThe book broadly discussed longer-term patterns of climatic change and its influence on evolution. It also discussed contemporary greenhouse gas emissions and effects of climate change, such as sea level rise, impacts on large storms and species extinction. Flannery also provided guidance on mitigation, such as reducing emissions and increasing solar and wind power.[54] Other points include:/nThe book won international acclaim. Bill Bryson concluded that \"It would be hard to imagine a better or more important book.\" The Weather Makers was honoured in 2006 as 'Book of the Year' at the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.[57] James Hansen reviewed the book positively.[58] Released not long before An Inconvenient Truth, the book came at a time when climate change was becoming more prominent topic in public opinion and increased Flannery's profile.[14] A review in NPR outlined how Flannery had sought to settle debate and controversy about climate change that was prominent at the time.[54]/nFlannery has published more than 27 books.[59] He recounted his scientific fieldwork and experiences with local tribal people in New Guinea in Throwim Way Leg (1999).[15] He later released an account of his work in Australia in Chasing Kangaroos (2007).[60]/nIn 2010's Here on Earth, Flannery criticises elements of Darwinism while endorsing James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis.[26] In 2015, Flannery published Atmosphere of Hope, which discussed climate change mitigation, carbon sequestration and technological solutions and acts as a follow-up to The Weather Makers.[61] He published another work about climate change in 2020, The Climate Cure, which calls for the Australian government to address the issue and argues its response to the COVID-19 pandemic could be used as a model for this.[62][63]/nFollowing The Future Eaters on Australasia, he has published popular science books recounting the natural histories of North America in The Eternal Frontier (2001)[64] and Europe in Europe: A Natural History (2018).[65]/nFlannery has appeared in several series for ABC Television, including several travel documentary collaborations with comedian John Doyle. Two Men In A Tinnie focused on the pair travelling down the Murray River, and Two in the Top End in the Kimberley.[8]/nIn August 2017 Flannery hosted an episode of ABC Catalyst investigating how carefully managed seaweed growth could contribute to combating climate change via the sequestration of atmospheric carbon to the ocean floor. This explored the details of the book he published in July 2017, Sunlight and Seaweed: An Argument for How to Feed, Power and Clean Up the World.[66] In January 2018, Flannery appeared on the ABC's Science program exploring whether humans are becoming a new 'Mass Extinction Event',[67] in addition to outlining the '5 Things You Need to Know About Climate Change'.[68] Flannery also appeared in the 2021 documentary film Burning, about the Black Summer bushfires.[69]/nI\u2019ve always attracted a lot of negative publicity. One of the things I do, I think, is challenge the status quo \u2013 whether it be climate change, or interpreting Australia\u2019s past. And the status quo is there for a good reason: a lot of people benefit from it, and in challenging it, you inevitably make enemies.[14]/nTim Flannery/nFlannery's work in raising the profile of environmental issues was key to his being named Australian of the Year in 2007.[70] Awarding the prize, former Prime Minister John Howard said that the scientist \"has encouraged Australians into new ways of thinking about our environmental history and future ecological challenges.\"[38] That said, Howard\u2014who was a climate denier at the time\u2014was unconvinced as to some of Flannery's views.[14]/nFlannery has long spoken out about the impacts of climate change in Australia and internationally.[38][71][72]/nIn May 2004, Flannery said in light of the city's water crisis that \"I think there is a fair chance Perth will be the 21st century's first ghost metropolis\",[73] a warning reiterated in 2007.[74] In 2005, he issued several warnings about water issues in Australia, saying \"water is going to be in short supply across the eastern states\".[75] In June 2005 warning that \"the ongoing drought could leave Sydney's dams dry in just two years\".[71][76]/nIn October 2006 Flannery quoted a US Navy study stating that, there may be, \"no Arctic icecap in Summer in the next five to 15 years. He also quoted NASA's Professor James Hansen, \"arguably the world authority on climate change\" who said, \"we have just a decade to avert a 25-metre rise of the sea\".[77] In February 2007, as he explained how increased soil evaporation impacts on runoff, he said \"even the [existing amount of] rain that falls isn't actually going to fill our dams and our river systems\"[78] and in June 2007, he said that, \"Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane, water supplies are so low they need desalinated water urgently, possibly in as little as 18 months\".[79]/nIn May 2008, Flannery suggested that sulphur could be dispersed into the atmosphere to help block the sun leading to global dimming, in order to counteract the effects of global warming.[80]/nIn 2019, Flannery said, \"Sadly, I've been aware of [the urgency to act] for a long time. We have to reduce emissions as hard and fast as possible... The speed and scale of impacts have been something that is really shocking.\" He continued to warn people that, \"People are shocked, but they should be angry...The consequences will grow year by year, and stuff we were warning people about 20 years ago is now coming to fruition and is impossible to deny, unless you are wilfully blind.\"[81] He also said that climate activism during the previous two decades had been a \"colossal failure\", but praised Greta Thunberg, school strikes for climate and Extinction Rebellion for their impact on the climate movement during the 2010s.[72]/nIn response to the introduction of proposed clean coal technology, Flannery has stated: \"Globally there has got to be some areas where clean coal will work out, so I think there will always be a coal export industry [for Australia] ... Locally in Australia because of particular geological issues and because of the competition from cleaner and cheaper energy alternatives, I'm not 100 per cent sure clean coal is going to work out for our domestic market.\"[82]/nFlannery has advocated for a renewable energy transition in Australia.[22] He joined calls for the cessation or reduction of conventional coal-fired power generation in Australia in the medium term, at a time when it was the source of most of the nation's electricity. Flannery's view is that conventional coal burning will lose its social license to operate, comparing it to asbestos.[83]/nIn 2006 Flannery was in support of nuclear power as a possible solution for reducing Australia's carbon emissions;[84][85] however, in 2007 changed his position against it.[86] In May 2007 he told a business gathering in Sydney that while nuclear energy does have a role elsewhere in the world, Australia's abundance of renewable resources rule out the need for nuclear power in the near term. He does, however, feel that Australia should and will have to supply its uranium to those other countries that do not have access to renewables like Australia does.[87]/nIn September 2005 Flannery said, \"There are hot rocks in South Australia that potentially have enough embedded energy in them to run Australia's economy for the best part of a century\".[88][89] For the Cooper Basin, he proposed the establishment of a fully sustainable city where, \"hundreds of thousands of people would live\", utilising these geothermal energy reserves. He named the hypothetical city \"Geothermia\".[56][90] Subsequently, in 2007, an exploration company was established. The company expected to raise at least $11.5m on the Australian Stock Exchange.[91] Flannery took up shares in the company.[92] In 2010, the Federal Government provided the company with another $90m for the development work.[93] In August 2016, the geothermal energy project closed as it was not financially viable.[94][95]/nWhen, in the concluding chapters of The Future Eaters (1994), Flannery discusses how to \"utilise our few renewable resources in the least destructive way\", he remarks that/nA far better situation for conservation in Australia would result from a policy which allows exploitation of all of our biotic heritage, provided that it all be done in a sustainable manner. ... [I]f it is possible to harvest for example, 10 mountain pygmy-possums (Burramys parvus) or 10 southern right whales (Balaena glacialis) per year, why should we not do it? ... Is it more moral to kill and consume a whale, without cost to the environment, than to live as a vegetarian in Australia, destroying seven kilograms of irreplaceable soil, ... for each kilogram of bread we consume?[96]/nIn late 2007, Flannery suggested that the Japanese whaling involving the relatively common minke whale may be sustainable:/nIn terms of sustainability, you can't be sure that the Japanese whaling is entirely unsustainable... It's hard to imagine that the whaling would lead to a new decline in population [...][97]/nThis raised concerns among some environmental groups such as Greenpeace,[98][99] fearing it could add fuel to the Japanese wish of continuing its annual cull. In contrast to his stance on the minke whale quota, Flannery has expressed relief over the dumping of the quota of the rarer humpback whale,[97] and further was worried how whales were slaughtered, wishing them to be \"killed as humanely as possible\".[100] Flannery suggested that krill and other small crustaceans, the primary food source for many large whales and an essential part of the marine food chain, were of greater concern than the Japanese whaling.[100]/nIn The Future Eaters, Flannery was critical of the European settlers introducing non-native wild animals into Australia's ecosystem. At the same time, he suggested that if one wanted to reproduce, in some parts of Australia, the ecosystems that existed there around 60,000 years ago (before the arrival of the humans on the continent), it may be necessary to introduce into Australia, in a thoughtful and careful way, some non-native species that would be the closest substitutes to the continent's lost megafauna. In particular, he proposed the Komodo dragon be brought into Australia as a replacement for its extinct relative, Megalania, \"the largest goanna of all time\". He also suggested the Tasmanian devil could be allowed to re-settle the mainland Australia from its Tasmanian refuge area.[101][non-primary source needed]/nIn The Eternal Frontier, Flannery made a proposal for what later became nicknamed \"Pleistocene rewilding\": restoring the ecosystems that existed in North America before the arrival of the Clovis people and the concomitant disappearance of the North American Pleistocene megafauna 13,000 years ago. He proposed if, in addition to the wolves that have been already re-introduced to Yellowstone National Park, ambush predators, such as jaguars and lions should be reintroduced as well, in order to bring the number of elk under control. Furthermore, the closest extant relatives of the species that became extinct around the Clovis period could be introduced to North America's nature reserves as well. In particular, the Indian and African elephants could substitute, respectively, for the mammoth and the mastodon; the Chacoan peccary, for its extinct cousin the flat-headed peccary (Platygonus compressus). Llamas and panthers, which still survive outside of the US, should too be brought back to that country.[102][non-primary source needed]/nFlannery advocated for human population planning in Australia in the 1990s.[51] He has been a patron of Sustainable Population Australia since 2000.[103] He said in 2007 that he had stopped discussing population issues, as he said he did not think curbing population growth was a solution to climate change.[22] In 2009, Flannery called for an inquiry into population growth in Australia, to better elucidate the potential environmental impacts of the country's growing population.[104]/nIn 2009, Flannery joined the project \"Soldiers of Peace\", a move against all wars and for a global peace.[105][106]/nIn July 2018 he played a role in the Kwaio Reconciliation programme in the Solomon Islands, which put an end to a 91-year-old cycle of killings that stemmed from the murders in 1927 of British Colonial officers Bell and Gillies by Kwaio leader Basiana and his followers.[107]/nTim Flannery, \"In the Soup\" (review of Michael Marshall, The Genesis Quest: The Geniuses and Eccentrics on a Journey to Uncover the Origins of Life on Earth, University of Chicago Press, 360 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol.

This method of randomly sequencing DNA from the environment transformed the study of viruses and microbes in the environment and associated with macroorganisms./nThe first shotgun metagenome, also called virome, showed that there were thousands of viral species per liter of seawater (Breitbart et al. 2002; Angly et al. 2006). Working with Anca Segall, Mya Brietbart, Rob Edwards, and the SDSU Biomath Group, Rohwer performed the first virome studies of corals, soils, sediments and humans (Breitbart et al. 2003, 2005, 2008). Based on this work, he proposed that viruses, and particularly bacteriophage, are the most diverse biological entities on Earth./nVirome studies showed that most viral diversity was extreme and almost completely unknown. Rob Edwards and Rohwer proposed that a genome-based taxonomy was need to link the metagenomic data to the existing, morphology-based taxonomy. The controversial Phage Proteomic Tree was the resulting system and was featured in Life in Our Phage World (2015)./nWorking with Nancy Knowlton at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Rohwer showed that reef-building corals harbored hundreds of thousands of unique bacterial species (Rohwer et al. 2002). They proposed that these bacteria, viruses and other microbes were important for coral health and formed an ecological unit called the holobiont. Further, they hypothesized that changing membership of the holobiont was the primary mechanism of adaption to changing environmental conditions./nIn 2005, Rohwer participated in the Northern Line Island expedition headed by Enric Sala and Stuart Sandin. The goal of this research cruise was to determine the effects of human populations on coral reefs. Rohwer performed the first shotgun metagenomes from these islands and proposed that overfishing by humans led to microbialization. Subsequent studies showed microbialization is a global phenomenon and a primary reason for the decline of coral reefs (McDole et al. 2012). This work was featured in Rohwer's book Coral Reef in the Microbial Seas./nWhile studying corals, Kristen Marhaver and Rohwer noted that bacteriophage, viruses that infect bacteria, were four to five times more abundant than the surrounding seawater. Building on this observation, Jeremy Barr and Rohwer (Barr et al. 2013; 2015) showed that bacteriophage bind to mucus through hypervariable protein domains displayed on the capsid. This effectively concentrates the bacteriophage in the mucus, where they kill bacteria and protect the underlying animal tissue. Rohwer has proposed that this Bacteriophage Attachment to Mucus (BAM) Immunity is the first example and origin of the specific immune response./nMicrobialized coral reefs have relatively high bacteria abundances and reduced bacteriophage abundances. To explain this observation, Rohwer and colleagues (Knowles et al. 2016) proposed that the temperate life cycle was the predominant bacteriophage life cycle at high host abundances. The resulting bacterial lysogens would be protected from other bacteriophage via superinfection exclusion and protists via expression of virulence factors./nHe has authored more than 180 scientific papers and book chapters, as well as two popular science book, Coral Reefs in the Microbial Seas (2010) and Life in Our Phage World (2015).

From 1928 onwards, Othenio Abel was the publisher of a journal dedicated to paleobiology, Pal\u00e4obiologica./nIn 1914, Abel proposed that fossil dwarf elephants inspired the myth of giant Cyclopes, because the center nasal opening was thought to be a cyclopic eye socket.[2] In 1920 he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.[3] He also showed great interest in cave bear remains at the so-called \"Dragon's Cave\" near Mixnitz./nAbel was an advocate of orthogenesis, he believed that there were trends in evolution that were internally programmed.[4]/nAlready as a student, Abel took part in antisemitic riots at the University of Vienna, during the Badeni-crisis of 1897. After the First World War, now a professor, he gave voice to his fear of a power takeover by \"Communists, Social Democrats and Jews and more Jews tied to both\". As the journalist Klaus Taschwer publicized in 2012, Abel was responsible for the founding of a secret group of 18 professors that sought to frustrate the research and careers of left-wing and Jewish scientists.[5][6] The rise in violence of National Socialist student groups towards Jewish students in 1934 were met with sympathy by Abel. When such attacks began to be directed at Catholic and international students as well, Abel, now the university rector, was forced into early retirement by the Austrofascist board.[7] This caused him to emigrate to Germany and accept the post in G\u00f6ttingen./nHe visited Vienna again in 1939, after the Anschluss with Nazi Germany. After seeing how the Nazi flag was shown at the university building, he pronounced this the \"Happiest moment of his life\".  The new regime honored him with the newly created post of \"Honorary Senator\" of the university - an honour that was rescinded after the Second World War, in 1945. A letter of recommendation for the Goethe Prize points out how Abel had always \"fought in the first line\" against the \"Judaification\" of the university.[6][8][9] After the war, he was once again forced into retirement along with other prominent Nazi professors and spent his last days in Mondsee, then known as something of a \"Nazi colony\".", "20155186": "Tomas Robert Lindahl FRS[2] FMedSci[4] (born 28 January 1938) is a Swedish-British scientist specialising in cancer research.[7] In 2015, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry[8] jointly with American chemist Paul L.

[15]/nSince the experiment's inception, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of genetic changes; some evolutionary adaptations have occurred in all 12 populations, while others have only appeared in one or a few populations. One particularly striking adaptation was the evolution of a strain of E. coli that was able to use citrate as a carbon source in an aerobic environment.[16] A defining characteristic of E. coli is its inability to use citrate as an energy source under oxic conditions.[17]/nRichard Lenski, Charles Ofria, et al. at Michigan State University developed an artificial life computer program with the ability to detail the evolution of complex systems. The system uses values set to determine random mutations and allows for the effect of natural selection to conserve beneficial traits. The program was dubbed Avida and starts with an artificial petri dish where organisms reproduce and perform mathematical calculations to acquire rewards of more computer time for replication. The program randomly adds mutations to copies of the artificial organisms to allow for natural selection. As the artificial life reproduced, different lines adapted and evolved depending on their set environments. The beneficial side to the program is that it parallels that of real life at rapid speeds.[18][19][20][21]/nIn August 2013, having been inspired by a presentation by Titus Brown on the role of social media in science, Lenski began blogging at Telliamed Revisited and tweeting as @RELenski.[22]/nLenski's research has received considerable attention, including lengthy discussion in Carl Zimmer's book on E. coli, Microcosm, and in Richard Dawkins' book on the evidence for evolution, The Greatest Show on Earth. Included in Dawkins' discussion was a description of the dialog Lenski had in 2008 with Andrew Schlafly, creator of Conservapedia, which Schlafly initiated as a reaction to reports of Lenski's description of the evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one of the long-term evolution experiment populations.

While at the University of Virginia, Block interacted with Randy Pausch and is mentioned in his memoir The Last Lecture./nBefore becoming chancellor of UCLA, Block had an extensive scientific career. His early work with mollusks investigated the structure and function of basal retinal neurons (BRN) in circadian photoentrainment. He was the first and onlyone to discover a cell-autonomous circadian pacemaker and concluded that BRNs are both necessary and sufficient for photoentrainment. Later in his career, Block explored the molecular basis of circadian rhythms in mammals, and found that calcium flux was necessary for circadian rhythmicity. His most recent research, which he is still working on today, is largely focused on the effect that aging has on the circadian clock./nOn 3 August 2023 Block announced his intention to step down as chancellor of UCLA, effective on July 31, 2024.[2]/nBlock was born in Monticello, New York, the grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.[3] His father and uncle owned Mountain Dairies, a retail/wholesale distributor that served many of the hotels and camps that populated Catskill region of New York. During summers, he worked at the dairy as a truck driver, starting his days at 4 am for early morning deliveries to summer camps and hotels. He also played piano in a trio that provided dance music for Saturday evening parties at several bungalow colonies within the \"Borscht Belt\". His hobbies included electronics and shortwave radio. He played varsity tennis at Monticello High School./nBlock received a BA from Stanford University in 1970, followed by his MS and PhD in 1972 and 1975, respectively, from the University of Oregon; all in psychology.[4] From 1975 to 1978, he returned to Stanford for postdoctoral work with Donald Kennedy, who later became president of Stanford, and Colin Pittendrigh, who is known as the \u201cfather of biological timing.\" During this time Block studied how voluntary movements inhibit sensory feedback in the crayfish working in the Kennedy lab while studying issues of circadian biology with Colin Pittendrigh./nIn 1978, Block became a member of the faculty in the Department of Biology of University of Virginia. Here, Block served as the vice provost for research from 1993 to 1998, vice president for research and public service from 1998 to 2001, and then in 2001 he was appointed as vice president and provost. Furthermore, during this time from 1991 to 2002, Block also served as the founding director of the National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center in Biological Timing.[5]/nAccording to Block \u201cThe center raised the national visibility of the University in biological and medical research, and gave us reputational leverage in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Japan...Most importantly, the center\u2019s scientific accomplishments have been spectacular.

This groundbreaking discovery was a result of the Clock Genome Project, which uses \"forward genetics\" to discover the genes regulating circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and plants. In addition, this work also led to the discovery of many other genes that regulate the biological clock.[7]/nIn 1997 and 1998, the reputable journal Science ranked the findings of the NSF Center in Biological Timings among the top 10 in biological research breakthroughs.[7]/nThree of the NSF Center investigators, Jeffrey C.

His selection was announced on 21 December 2006, succeeding interim office holder Norman Abrams on 1 August 2007.[9]/nIn his inaugural address at UCLA, Block shared that his top priorities are to advance academic excellence, financial stability, diversity and civic engagement.[10] He has called for UCLA to deepen its engagement with Los Angeles and to increase access for students from underrepresented populations.[11] Under Block's leadership, UCLA has seen an increase in student diversity on campus thanks to innovative efforts to recruit in diverse communities, and in 2015, UCLA reached pre-California Proposition 209 levels, enrolling 279 African American freshmen, on par with the African American share of California public high school graduates.[12] UCLA has also increased the number of low- to middle-income students enrolled.[13]/nIn 2019 UCLA was named the number one public university in the nation for the third consecutive year[14] and is consistently the most applied-to university, with more than 113,000 freshman applications for fall 2018.[15]/nBlock's push for entrepreneurship on campus has fostered innovation and resulted in UCLA as the top university for creating startups based on campus research.[16] Additionally, to foster a deeper commitment to Los Angeles among UCLA students, Block oversaw the formation of the annual Volunteer Day event, in which thousands of students volunteer in schools, parks, food banks, veterans\u2019 clinics and elsewhere at the beginning of each academic year.[17] Block also implemented UCLA's two Grand Challenges, which are aimed at understanding, treating and preventing depression worldwide,[18] and moving Los Angeles toward 100 percent renewable energy, 100 percent locally sourced water and enhanced ecosystem health by 2050.[19]/nDuring his tenure, Block has faced the challenge of steering UCLA through a severe budget crisis and tuition increases.[20] To address reductions in state funding and advance his priorities, Block is leading the largest fundraising campaign by a public university, aiming to raise $4.2 billion to support student scholarships and fellowships, research projects and new construction on campus in honor of UCLA's centennial in 2019.[21]/nBlock holds UCLA faculty appointments in psychiatry and bio-behavioral sciences in the David Geffen School of Medicine and in integrative biology and physiology in the College of Letters and Science.[22]/nOn February 24, 2014, Block published an open letter to the campus community, expressing his opposition to Proposition 209, stating that the proposed merit-based selection system would damage diversity on campus.[23]/nHe has been widely criticized for the 2022 suspension of highly-awarded professor of ecology Priyanga Amarasekare without documentation, viewed as retaliation for her calls for reform of a culture of discrimination at UCLA.[24]/nWhile at the University of Virginia, Block worked extensively with his graduate student, Dr. Douglas G. McMahon, the 1986 winner of the Society for Neuroscience's Donald B. Lindsley Prize in Behavioral Neuroscience, on the functioning of the circadian pacemaker system at the cellular level in Bulla gouldiana. In 1984, Block's students conducted a continuous 74-hour intracellular recording in constant darkness that demonstrated that basal retinal neurons (BRN) in the Bulla eye exhibit clear circadian rhythms. These rhythms were also shown to be correlated one-for-one with compound action potentials produced by the optic nerve.[25] The change in membrane potential of the BRNs, which are electrically coupled, were shown to precede or occur simultaneously with the increased compound action potential frequency. An increase in firing frequency, and depolarization of the BRNs, was seen during the day, and the reverse at night. These results demonstrated that the BRNs were at minimum an output for the pacemaker pathway and provided evidence that they were good candidates for being circadian pacemaker neurons./nThis research was expanded several years later by a breakthrough study published in Science in which Dr. Stephan Michel, and others working in Block's laboratory, demonstrated that circadian rhythms in BRN membrane conductance could persist spontaneously in isolated BRNs.[26] These spontaneous circadian rhythms were shown for BRNs in isolation from other retinal cells and in isolation from each other. They showed that these circadian rhythms in membrane conductance were caused primarily by a potassium ion current. BRNs in isolation demonstrated the same patterns shown in Block's previous work in which membrane conductance decreased at dawn and increased at dusk. That similar patterns were seen in isolated cells as in previous multiple cell cultures provided the first strong evidence that individual neurons possessed the capacity to generate circadian rhythms. This research definitively concluded that BRNs are both necessary and sufficient for photoentrainment in Bulla./nBlock and colleagues hypothesized that ion movement across cell membranes plays a role in the generation of circadian rhythms. In 2005, his lab measured rhythms in rat suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in various concentrations of calcium ions. Block found that as calcium concentration decreased, thus lowering the transmembrane ion movement, the amplitude of circadian rhythmicity also decreased.[27] With no calcium added, there was no circadian rhythm at all. Block's lab repeated the experiment with rat liver tissue and mouse SCN tissue and found the same results in each case. This demonstrated that across species and tissues, transmembrane calcium flux is necessary for the generation of circadian rhythms. However, there are still some questions about the function of calcium flux. In this experiment, Block also tried adding calcium channel Blockers to the tissues. Rhythmicity did disappear, but it took several cycles, and it is unknown why rhythmicity was not immediately abolished. In addition, Block suspects that calcium flux plays a role in the entrainment of the mammalian clock to the environment, similar to its role in mollusk entrainment./nBlock has also studied the effect that aging has on the circadian system, collaborating with other leading chronobiologists including Michael Menaker. In 2002, he studied rhythmicity in rats of various ages and found that aging affected rhythmicity differently in different tissues. In the SCN, the intrinsic period shortened with age, while lung tissue often became arrhythmic (showing sporadic activity) and pineal and kidney tissues became phase advanced.[28] In 2008, Block exposed rats of various ages to different light cycles, and found that phase advances took longer in the SCN in old rats than in young rats, but pineal tissues advanced faster in older rats. Liver tissues did not phase shift at all when the light cycle was advanced.[29] These studies together have shown how complex the aging process is in the circadian system. Block notes that some, though not all, of these changes are likely influenced by diminishing synchronizing signals from the SCN. In 2006, Block observed that jetlag significantly increased the death rate in older mice, which highlights the medical importance of understanding the aging process of the circadian system.[30]/nBlock has served on numerous advisory boards and committees, including:/nIn 1970, Block married Carol Kullback, also from Monticello; they have two grown children.[34]", "42208055": "Manju Bansal (born. 1 December 1950) has specialized in the field of Molecular biophysics.

on ecological interactions, evolutionary processes and ecological-evolutionary feedbacks.[2] Hua's background has led to her appreciation of education with coming from a refugee family who \"epitomizes the concept of the American Dream\".[3] Her research aims to help others gain opportunities while also establishing a lab that is inclusive and diverse.[2][3] Hua also enjoys a variety of sports and plays disc golf professionally since 2016.[3][5]/nHua received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Biology and Kinesiology from Southwestern University, TX, in 2008 where she had gone to the university for basketball and picked biology for her major with the intention of going to medical school.[3][6] However, in her Junior year of college she had gotten a lab position with Ben Pierce who ultimately changed her career interests towards research and studying herpetology.[6]/nFollowing her completion of her B.A., Hua went to the University of Pittsburgh, PA, and received her Ph.D. in 2014.[3] Hua worked with Rick Relyea on researching the effects of contaminants on amphibians.[6] This experience led Hua to become a Herpetologists' League member.[6] The article \"Differential Host Susceptibility to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, an Emerging Amphibian Pathogen\" was published during her graduate education in which she was a co-author for.[7] The research was focused on a fungal pathogen that afflicted amphibians, called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, and how amphibian species varied in their sensitivity to this pathogen.[7]/nHua completed her postdoc at Purdue University, IN, from 2014-2015.[3]  She had studied amphibian disease ecology along with her advisor Jason Hoverman.[6] In her research article on \"The contribution of phenotypic plasticity to the evolution of insecticide tolerance in amphibian populations\" she discussed how wood frog populations were seen to have higher tolerance to the pesticide carbaryl when they lived closer to agriculture compared to wood frog populations that were further from farmlands, which follows the evolutionary responses known for pesticides.[8] There was also constitutive tolerance (tolerance that is always expressed despite environmental conditions) seen for frog populations near agriculture but was not seen in populations that were away from agriculture, leading Hua to note that genetic assimilation, a process cause by phenotypic plasticity, may be influencing evolutionary responses with unique environments.[8]/nAt Binghamton University Hua has taught a variety of courses on ecology.[9] These classes aim to educate students on the principles of ecology, how to apply ecology, the significance and diversity of wetlands, as well as how humans impact ecology[9]./nThe Hua Lab investigates mechanisms involving

while working with a variety of organisms from amphibians to insects to isopods.[11]/nResearches human interaction in ecology to understand how human-related activities, such as pollution, has impacted aquatic ecosystems at all levels of the ecosystem.[12] Questions being explored involve species interactions, responses to pollutants and how human activities impact ecological

corticosterone.[12]/nThis is an evolutionary approach on toxicology interested in researching if wildlife can become tolerant to pollutants through evolving tolerance to toxins such as pesticides.[13] Model systems of wood frogs are used to study this topic since wood frogs have a high degree of variance with their pollutant tolerance.[13] In lab they have seen that wood frog populations near agriculture have higher tolerance to the insecticides which shows evolved tolerance to pesticides.[13]/nThis area of research focuses on human activities impacting ecology through studying evolution.[14] The questions asked here consist of how evolving pollutant tolerance can be associated with ecological costs or how plasticity to pollutants influence species relationships and interactions in the environment.[14] Three types of parasites have been significant in this topic of research including trematodes, Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis.[14] Future directions

His life's study was ciliated protozoa of the group Paramecium.[1][2][3][4][5]/nSonneborn attended the Baltimore City Public Schools and graduated from the Baltimore City College (high school) in 1922.[6] As an adolescent, Sonneborn was interested in the humanities and considered becoming a rabbi. After taking a biology course taught by E. A. Andrews, his interest in literature was eclipsed by his interest in science. He earned a B.A. from Johns Hopkins University in 1925 and a Ph.D in 1928. His graduate work, supervised by Herbert S. Jennings, focused on the flatworm Stenostomum.[2]:\u200a271/nSonneborn spent 1928 and 1929 researching the ciliate Colpidium with Jennings as a National Research Council fellow. He remained at Hopkins until 1939, with appointments as research assistant, research associate, and associate. He was offered a faculty position at Indiana University, where he served as associate professor, professor (1943), distinguished service professor (1953), and distinguished service professor emeritus (1976).[2]:\u200a271\u2013272/nSonneborn was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1946,[7] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949,[8] and the American Philosophical Society in 1952.[9]/nSonneborn combined the skilled observation of a natural historian, with a deep interest in cellular, genetic, and organismic methodology.[3]\nAfter completing his thesis in 1930 on the microscopic worm Stenostomum, Sonneborn began to study ciliated protozoa, particularly Paramecium aurelia. Sonneborn made a major step towards the domestication of Paramecium when he discovered mating types in 1937.  Having determined how to regulate Paramecium breeding behavior, he went on to explore heritable variations.[3][10] His books \"Methods in the general biology and genetics of Paramecium aurelia\" (1950) and \"Methods in Paramecium research\" (1970) were highly cited and provided ongoing value to investigators.[3]/nSonneborn was particularly interested in \"the interaction of genes, cytoplasm and the environment in the control of cellular heredity\".[3]  He was the first to show cytoplasmic inheritance in animals, in his work with the cytoplasmic factor \"kappa\".[3][2] Mitochondria and chloroplasts along with other internal cellular organelles (Kappa particles) which had their own DNA were inherited but limited by their distribution in the cytoplasm at the time of cell division.  Only progeny from the 'half' of the cell with the mutant organelles inherited those organelles and thus the associated trait.  Obviously, most cells had a distribution such that the organelles were in both halves but in cases where the new mutant arose and thus is rare then only those cell with cytoplasm containing the rare form inherited the traits associated with it.[2]/nSonneborn found that character differences frequently involved both Mendelian and non-Mendelian elements.  His work on the formation of macronuclei suggested that genetic information passed from an old macronucleus to cytoplasm to a newly forming macronuclei, a mode of inheritance later named macronuclear inheritance.[2]/nAnother important discover was killer traits.  Sonneborn found that some paramecia produced toxins that affected other strains but not their own. He showed that nuclear genes were necessary to perpetuate the killer trait, which depended on the presence of the cytoplasmic \"kappa\" factor. Without kappa, strains became sensitive to the toxin. Sonneborn also developed serotypes, each of which was associated with an independent genetic loci and a specific active gene. Serotype specificity and expression were due to alleles at the serotype loci.[2] \nSonneborn developed plasmagene theory, the idea that genes produce a self-reproducing entity that is retained through somatic cell divisions and lost in sexual reproduction. Other researchers eventually showed that kappa was a symbiotic bacteria, disproving plasmagene theory.  Sonneborn eventually determined that the cytoplasm in mating-type inheritance was only a transmitter of information between the  old and new macronucleus, not a source of self-reproducing cytoplasmic genes.[2]/nSonneborn went on to study the cortical structure of Paramecium, and demonstrated that \"preexisting structure controls the way new structures are formed in the cortex of ciliated protozoans\", a phenomenon he called cytotaxis. This structural inheritance was a new phenomenon in genetics, and could be applied to all types of organisms.[2][11]/nSonneborn also conducted a series of experiments studying synchronised movement of the paramecium's cilia. These hair-like projections move together like dancers in a ballet and enable the single-celled organism to \"swim\" through the liquid in which it lives. Sonneborn surgically rotated a small section of cell wall by 180 degrees, and found that the replaced section continued to 'wave' in the same direction it had before surgery, i.e. now in antiphase to the others. The paramecium's daughters showed the same trait of a reverse phase wave if the reversal overlapped the division plane.   If it did not overlap the division plane only one the progeny showed the inverted sequence.[12]/nSonneborn was an innovative teacher. He taught a course entitled Heredity, Evolution and Society that dealt with the science of genetics and the implications that technological advancements in that field held for society. One of his popular lectures involved students enacting the process of protein synthesis during which the genetic code is translated into the sequential addition of amino acids to form a polypeptide.[citation needed] His enthusiasm was infectious, and his lectures inspired students to study protozoa and algae.[2]:\u200a273\u2013274/nSonneborn married Ruth Meyers in 1929.

As N\u00fcsslein-Volhard was moving to an independent position at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, which was not associated with a graduate program, she referred Lehmann to Jos\u00e9 Campos-Ortega, a researcher at Freiburg University studying the neurobiology of Drosophila [5].

Among other mechanisms, her laboratory discovered that a polyadenylated tail is not required for gene regulation.[16]/nLehmann continued to focus her research efforts on germ cell differentiation well into the early 2000s. She played a substantial role in the discovery of germ cell migratory pathways (namely those involving gap junctions, G protein-coupled receptors like Tre-1, and isoprenoids), particularly those concerning migration into the ovaries and testis.[18][19][20] In 2005, Lehmann's laboratory published a paper relating the lipid phosphatases Wunen and Wunen 2 to germ cell migration and elimination, suggesting that germ cells are sorted into the gonads by a type of repellent mechanism.[21] Her findings up to this point indicated that germ cells avoid differentiation into somatic cells through a combination of her previously studied regulatory mechanisms, each of which has the potential to silence transcription and control translation./nCurrently, Lehmann is studying piRNA production and the role it plays in preventing transposable element insertion and movement across the Drosophila genome.[22] She discovered that biogenesis of piRNAs and activation of the piRNA pathway is directly dependent on a number of proteins and epigenetic interactions.

Lederberg and Tatum showed that the bacterium Escherichia coli entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through bacterial conjugation.[6][7]  With this discovery and some mapping of the E. coli chromosome, Lederberg was able to receive his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1947.[8] Joshua married Esther Miriam Zimmer (herself a student of Edward Tatum) on December 13, 1946./nInstead of returning to Columbia to finish his medical degree, Lederberg chose to accept an offer of an assistant professorship in genetics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. His wife Esther Lederberg went with him to Wisconsin. She received her doctorate there in 1950./nJoshua Lederberg and Norton Zinder showed in 1951 that genetic material could be transferred from one strain of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium to another using viral material as an intermediary step.[9]  This process is called transduction. In 1956, M. Laurance Morse, Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg also discovered specialized transduction.[10][11] The research in specialized transduction focused upon lambda phage infection of E. coli. Transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly./nDuring her time in Joshua Lederberg's laboratory, Esther Lederberg also discovered fertility factor F, later publishing with Joshua Lederberg and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. In 1956, the Society of Illinois Bacteriologists simultaneously awarded Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg the Pasteur Medal, for \"their outstanding contributions to the fields of microbiology and genetics\"./nIn 1957, Joshua Lederberg founded the Department of Medical Genetics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He has held visiting professorship in Bacteriology at the University of California, Berkeley in summer 1950[12] and University of Melbourne (1957). Also in 1957, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[5]/nSir Gustav Nossal views Lederberg as his mentor, describing him as \"lightning fast\" and \"loving a robust debate.\"[13]/nIn 1958, Joshua Lederberg received the Nobel Prize and moved to Stanford University, where he was the founder and chairman of the Department of Genetics. He collaborated with Frank Macfarlane Burnet to study viral antibodies.[14]/nWith the launching of Sputnik in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with Carl Sagan, his public advocacy for what he termed exobiology helped expand the role of biology in NASA.[15]/nLederberg was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959 and the American Philosophical Society in 1960.[16][17]/nIn the 1960s, he collaborated with Edward Feigenbaum in Stanford's computer science department to develop DENDRAL.[14]/nIn 1978, he became the president of Rockefeller University, until he stepped down in 1990 and became professor-emeritus of molecular genetics and informatics at Rockefeller University, reflecting his extensive research and publications in these disciplines.[18][19]/nThroughout his career, Lederberg was active as a scientific advisor to the U.S. government. Starting in 1950, he was a member of various panels of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee. In 1979, he became a member of the U.S. Defense Science Board and the chairman of President Jimmy Carter's President's Cancer Panel. In 1989, he received National Medal of Science for his contributions to the scientific world. In 1994, he headed the Department of Defense's Task Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects, which investigated Gulf War Syndrome./nDuring a 1986 fact finding mission of the 1979 Soviet Union epidemic of anthrax bacteria that killed 66 people in the city of Sverdlovsk, Russia now named Yakaterinberg,[20] Lederberg sided with Soviets that the anthrax outbreak was from animal to human transmission stating, \u201cWild rumors do spread around every epidemic.\" \u201cThe current Soviet account is very likely to be true.\"[21]\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent US investigations in the early 1990s, a team of scientists confirmed the outbreak was caused by a release of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen from a nearby military facility, the lab leak is one of the deadliest ever documented.[22][23]/nLederberg married fellow scientist Esther Miriam Zimmer in 1946; they divorced in 1966. He married psychiatrist Marguerite Stein Kirsch in 1968.

He was French consul general at Cairo, and overseer in the Levant. He formulated an evolutionary hypothesis to explain the origin of the Earth and its contents./nDe Maillet's geological observations convinced him that the earth could not have been created in an instant because the features of the crust indicate a slow development by natural processes. He also believed that creatures on the land were ultimately derived from creatures living in the seas. He believed in the natural origin of man. He estimated that the development of the Earth took two billion years.[1]/nDe Maillet was a nobleman of Lorraine, born into a distinguished Catholic family. He did not attend university, but he received an excellent classical education. De Maillet was interested in geology and natural history, and took advantage of his travels to make observations. He was French general consul at Cairo (1692\u20131708), during which time he studied the Egyptian pyramids, and at Leghorn (1712\u20131717). He was French overseer in the Levant and the Barbary states from 1715 until his retirement./nHis main work, Telliamed (his name in reverse), was based on manuscripts written between 1722 and 1732[2] and was published after his death in 1748.[3][4]  The printed text was the result of ten years' editing by the Abbot Jean Baptiste de Mascrier in an attempt to reconcile the proposed system with the dogma of the Catholic Church.  De Maillet relied on him even though he had done a poor job editing de Maillet's earlier book Description de l'Egypte (1735). As a result of Mascrier's tinkering, none of the printed editions accurately represents de Maillet's work, though the best is the third and final edition, published in the Hague and Paris in 1755, which includes the only known biography of de Maillet.[5]/nAs a result of the assiduous textual work by Neubert,[2] who compared in detail the text of the third edition with the content of copied manuscripts, it is possible to say that the 1755 edition differed from the manuscripts by:/nWith this information as a starting point, it has been possible to largely reconstruct de Maillet's original content. The translation presented in the 1968 edition is not a simple reprint. It is based on the best surviving manuscript, ILL1 (Introduction, p.\u00a031). Extensive notes carry explanations, comments, and variations between sources. This edition therefore becomes the basis for any analysis of Maillet's ideas./nThe 'Indian philosopher' speaks the views of de Maillet himself. The device is transparently obvious, but understandable because the philosopher contradicts the literal word of the Bible at a time when this still carried some risk to his person and livelihood. The delay in publication can also be interpreted the same way, protecting the author and then protecting the editor, giving the latter time to soften the blow by watering down Maillet's ideas./nIt was, in its essence, an ultraneptunian theory of the Earth, and was to a large extent based on field geology discerned during trips throughout Egypt and other Mediterranean countries. It is based essentially on processes today known as sedimentation, excluding all other geological or geomorphological agents except some minor aspects of weathering. The work, therefore, seems modern as it touches sedimentation, but fantastical when touching other fields. De Maillet observed, but did not always understand, all the major types of rocks forming the Earth's crust./nFrom the observation of fossilized shells embedded in sedimentary rocks on mountains high above sea level, de Maillet recognized the true nature of fossils. Not appreciating that the land might rise, he concluded that the Earth had originally been entirely covered by water (a theory of Ren\u00e9 Descartes), which had since been steadily lost into the vortex. De Maillet derived a rate of fall of sea level, of about three inches per century, from sites where former ports were now above sea level. Working back to the highest mountains, he reached a figure of 2.4 billion years for the age of the Earth, so he thought it quite reasonable to accept that at least 2 billion years had passed since the Earth was covered with water. Of course, this attempt is flawed in several ways, but it contains the seed of real progress. He saw the importance of slow natural processes operating over long periods of time, forming and shaping the Earth. He introduced the idea that the Earth might be billions of years old, which even a century and a half after his death would have been denied.[6]/nDe Maillet's idea on biology had a similar basis. He thought that life had begun in the water, after the emergence of the highest mountains, but before the continents. He believes that life arose in the shallows surrounding the first land. Sea life, fish, shellfish, algae, diversified and their remains were covered with sediment and became secondary rocks laid down on the sides of primitive mountains. When continents emerged from the water, so did marine organisms. From seaweed developed trees and shrubs, from flying fish came birds. Man's career began as a fish./nThe context for this proto-evolutionary thought is de Maillet's belief that space contained the seeds of life, invisible spores always available for seeding. This theory of the origin of life is called panspermia. The really important observation he made was that the lower layers of sedimentary rocks contained animals and plants different from those of today, and some types that were unrecognizable. He appreciated that this was a critical issue and offered several explanations, none of which reach the present idea of evolution.[7]/nDe Maillet's ideas on the history of mankind are the weakest part of his conception. He incorporates a number of myths and traditions which are simply incorrect. His system of calculating time does not work because no remains of humans are present in the kind of sedimentary rocks he examined. He believes man has a long history, that he originated in the water, and developed into a land animal. He knows it is a problem that men do not look as though they were sea creatures, but his explanations of such difficulties are feeble. What he had done was to \"combine a correct understanding of artefacts of the Iron and Bronze Ages with the erroneous interpretation of Cainozoic vertebrates as human skeletons, and silicified logs in fluvio-continental deposits as petrified ships (as Steno did).\"[8]", "68225964": "J\u00fcri K\u00e4rner (25 April 1940 \u2013 25 September 2010) was an Estonian biologist.[1]/n1988-1993 he was the rector of Tartu University.[1]/nAwards:/n/nThis article about a biologist is a stub.

His father, Nikolay Andreevich Belozersky, was born in the Russian family that migrated to Central Asia, and worked as a lawyer of the judicial chamber. His mother, Evgeniya Semenovna Lahtina, worked as a musician teacher in a gymnasium. There were three children in their family: Nikolay, Lidiya and Andrey. When parents died in 1913, Andrey was sent to the Gatchina orphanage but he was accepted into the family of his mother's sister in 1917 when the orphanage was closed.

The children were educated in areas close to biology./nA. N. Belozersky died in Moscow from stomach cancer on December 31, 1972, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow./nIn the early 30s, A. N. Belozersky was the first in the USSR who began a systematic study of nucleic acids. At that time, two types of nucleic acids were known: thymonucleic (DNA) isolated from calf thymus and \"yeast\" (RNA) found in yeast and wheat seedlings. The first was called \"animal\", and the second was called \"vegetable\". The first significant works performed by A. N. Belozersky relate to the issue of \"animal\" and \"plant\" nucleic acids. In 1934 articles of A. R. Kiesel and A. N. Belozersky appeared in the journal \"Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift fur physiologishe Chemie''[3] and then in 1935 in the \"Scientific Notes of Moscow State University''.[4] In these articles the presence of thymonucleic acid in plant cells was shown. A. N. Belozersky was the first who isolated and identified thymine first from the seedlings of pea seeds and then from the seeds of other legumes.[5] He isolated the DNA itself from the seeds of horse chestnut. Subsequently, the presence of RNA and DNA was confirmed in linden buds, onion bulbs, wheat germ. The results obtained by Belozersky made it possible to reject the division of nucleic acids into \"animal\" and \"plant\" and to affirm the idea of the universal distribution of DNA in both plant and animal cells./nWhile Belozersky was studying bacteria, he noted the high content of nucleic acids in cells, amounting to 30% of dry weight, unlike higher organisms. A. N. Belozersky concluded that this fact is associated with high rates of reproduction and growth of bacteria. Later, A. N. Belozersky showed that the amount of nucleic acids, especially RNA, is not a constant value for one species and changes with the age of the culture: young bacterial cells \u00a0may contain more RNA than old ones. Andrey Nikolaevich pointed out a new aspect (at the same time with T. Caspersson and J. Brachet) - the relationship of the number of nucleic acids with the intensity of protein biosynthesis. These conclusions were made by A. N. Belozersky long before the appearance of the \"molecular biology\" term associated with the publication in the journal \"Nature\" by James J. Watson and F. Crick on the establishment of a spatial model of the DNA molecule.[6] Thus, as a result of research from 1939 to 1947, A. N. Belozersky obtained the first information in the world scientific space on the content of nucleic acids in various bacterial species./nIn a paper published in 1957 in Russian,[7] and in 1958 in English,[8] A. N. Belozersky and his student A. S. Spirin discovered an inconsistency between the composition of DNA and ribosomal RNA. They noticed with a wide range of DNA changes, the composition of RNA varies little from species to species. At the same time, the composition of proteins also varies greatly from species to species. Soviet scientists have proved that the DNA-RNA-protein biosynthesis scheme requires that all elements be in a certain composite correspondence. This conclusion led to the destruction of the old scheme of this process. F. Crick wrote about the article by Belozersky and Spirin:[9]/n\u201cThe phase of confusion was started by an article by Belozersky and Spirin in 1958. The data they provided showed that our ideas on a number of important points were too simplistic.\u201d/nSoviet scientists discovered that there is a certain part of RNA in the cells, which coincides in composition with DNA and is determined by its structure. Later, they suggested that this part of RNA is a link in the transmission of genetic information from DNA to proteins. Part of the RNA discovered by Belozersky and Spirin turned out to be a rapidly synthesizing form of RNA that transfers genetic information from DNA to ribosomes. Later, this part of the RNA was called messenger RNA (mRNA).The work on the study of the nucleotide composition of DNA and RNA in bacteria was the beginning of numerous studies of the composition of nucleic acids in other organisms. These studies were conducted from 1958 to 1965 in groups of the Moscow State University and the USSR Academy of Sciences, headed by A. N. Belozersky. As a result, the composition of DNA and RNA was studied in many actinomycetes (N. V. Shugaeva), fungi (B. F. Vanyushin), algae (M. V. Pakhomova, G. P. Serenkov), some higher plants (B. F. Vanyushin).A. N. Belozersky actively participated in the creation of modern genosystematics (DNA systematics, DNA taxonomy).[10] Today, this direction is being developed by A. S. Antonov and other students of Belozersky.The scientific activities of the groups headed by A. N. Belozersky include the study of the species functional specificity of adaptive RNAs (G. N. Zaitseva), the study of changes in the amino acid composition of proteins in response to the substitution of nucleotides in DNA (A. S. Antonov), the study of phosphate in the simplest organisms, particular in aspects of its transfer from the environment, transport, accumulation and forms of existence (I. S. Kulaev, M. S. Kritsky)/nAnother object of A. N. Belozersky's research was antibiotics, the study of which he began during World War II. A. N. Belozersky studied the chemical structure of one of the most effective Soviet antibiotics \u2014 gramicidin S, first obtained by G. F. Gause and M. G. Brazhnikova. In the first works on this topic, the polypeptide nature of gramicidin was shown and its amino acid composition was determined (A. N. Belozersky, T. S. Paskhina). Furthermore, several substituted gramicidin derivatives were obtained and their activity was studied. These works were carried out in the newly organized laboratory of antibiotics of the A. N. Institute of Biochemistry Bach./nA. N. Belozersky was interested in the question of the existence of complexes between nucleic acids and proteins (called \"nucleoproteins\") in vivo systems. He made an attempt to fractionate nucleoprotein samples and thus developed a methodological scheme of this process, which later played a major role in the study of nucleic acids. Based on his experiments, Belozersky concluded that nucleic acids in cells exist in various complexes with proteins: unbound, labile bound and firmly bound./nIt was assumed by F. Mischer and A.

Posey was born on March 14, 1947, son of Henry and Pearl Posey, in rural Henderson, Kentucky. From an early age he was a member of the Anglican Church. Educated at Henderson County High School, he had a biology teacher, Mr. Ned Barra, who encouraged his interest in insects./nIn 1970, Posey was graduated with a B.Sc. in Entomology, by the Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He obtained a M.A. in Anthropology, in 1974, also at the Louisiana State University, with the thesis The Fifth Ward Settlement: A Tri Racial Marginal Group. He obtained a Ph.D. in anthropology, in 1979, at the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, with the thesis Ethnoentomology of the Gorotire Kayap\u00f3 of Central Brazil./nPosey's switch from entomology to anthropology was due to his friendship with anthropology professor William G. Haag at Louisiana State University. This is explained in a memorial by Posey.[2]/nEven after his move to anthropology, Posey did not cut his ties with entomology. At the University of Georgia, he was a close associate of entomology professor Murray S. Blum. Years afterward, he continued to research the ethnobiology of insects, a field he termed \"ethnoentomology\" in his 1979 doctoral thesis./nArriving in Brazil in 1976, Posey made lasting friendships with researchers at the Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi, in Bel\u00e9m, and the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz\u00f4nia, in Manaus./nAfter his graduate studies, Posey returned to Brazil in 1982, as a professor in the Department of Biology at the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, then reorganized under the chairmanship of geneticist Dr. Warwick E. Kerr. He mounted an interdisciplinary ethnobiological research project, called the Kayap\u00f3 Project, that would eventually involve over 30 specialists in fields such as agronomy, botany, entomology, plant genetics, astronomy, soil sciences, human geography, anthropology, and linguistics. To document the extensive traditional biological knowledge of the Kayap\u00f3 Indians, Posey and collaborators spent months in the field with Kayap\u00f3 specialists such as chiefs Ut\u00e9, Toto-i, Kanhunk, and Paulinho Paiakan. Paj\u00e9s Beptopup and Kwyre-ka also offered their experience. Many conferences with scientific and indigenous project participants served to disseminate project results, especially at Brazilian scientific conclaves./nThe Kayap\u00f3 Project continued when Posey relocated in 1986 to the Goeldi Museum in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, at the invitation of museum director Dr. Guilherme M. de La Penha. In 1988 he organized the First International Congress of Ethnobiology, in Bel\u00e9m, during which the Kayap\u00f3 Project and its results were highlighted./nAlthough the term \"ethnobiology\" had been used in the past for a different idea, Posey adopted this for his study of indigenous and folk knowledge about plants, animals, and ecosystems. To designate other areas of indigenous and folk knowledge, the term \"ethnoscience\" can be used in an analogous manner./nIn the past, anthropology had been wed to biology in the unholy union of biological determinism, in which Man is treated wholly without culture or the ability to learn. Posey repudiated this view and dared to see indigenous and folk societies as the inheritors of a vast corpus of useful knowledge for the sustainable utilization and management of natural resources. As can be seen in his review of Diamond's best-seller Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies in 1999, Posey would have biological determinism laid to rest. After all, where can one find human groups without culture?/nFor ethnobiology to be scientific, testable hypotheses are generated from information offered by indigenous and folk informants. The emic-etic filter has to be respected, and a decoding of traditional knowledge is necessary to bridge the two cultures./nParticipant-observation in the field with indigenous and traditional communities was always part of Posey's work plan./nInterviews with informants were always unstructured and conducted according to the generative method, specifically designed not to elicit information offered in support of researchers' perceived biases./nDo the Kayap\u00f3 Indians manage their natural resources? Do they plant forest islands in the savanna? Do they recognize eco-zones and know what resources are to be found in each? Is their agriculture sustainable? Their hunting? What about their medicine? Does what they know constitute a science?/nIn his activism, Posey incurred opposition not only from those who would exploit natural resources belonging to Indians but also from scientists and academics who were callous in their disregard for indigenous intellectual property rights. One Brazilian weekly news magazine, Veja, referred to him as a \"gigolo of the Indians\" for his defense of Indians' human and civil rights./nPosey's support for indigenous peoples brought him into conflict with the Brazilian government in 1987, when Paiakan and Kube-l, two young Kayap\u00f3 leaders he was accompanying in Washington, D.C., complained to World Bank officials of a planned hydro-electric dam on the Xingu River that would flood Indian lands. The threat of criminal prosecution from the federal government against Posey and the Kayap\u00f3 chiefs, for interfering in Brazilian foreign affairs, caused a public outcry both in Brazil and abroad./nIn February 1989, Darrell helped organize the \"First Meeting of the Indigenous Peoples of the Xingu\", the first joint meeting of Amazonian tribes to protest the destruction of the forest, in Altamira, Par\u00e1. This event focussed on hydro-electric dams on the Xingu River and caused these ecologically disastrous projects to be cancelled or at least reformulated. In 2008, however, these once-discarded projects are again being proposed by the Brazilian government, with slightly different packaging./nIn 1992, Posey was the main organizer of the Earth Parliament, a parallel event at the United Nations' Rio de Janeiro Conference on the Environment (Rio Earth Summit), aimed at valuing indigenous knowledge and rights. The Earth Parliament was a 15-day assembly of indigenous and minority groups held during the 1992 Earth Summit./nFor Posey, indigenous knowledge was a key to the sustainable use of natural biotic resources.\nmajor/nLike collective rights to land, Indians and other traditional societies have collective intellectual property rights (IPR) to their knowledge. Posey championed the cause of indigenous and folk intellectual property rights during the last decade of his life./nWestern society has appropriated indigenous and traditional knowledge without recompensation or even recognition. Posey questioned whether scientific research, even of the most disinterested sort, might not lead to the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights or bio-piracy./nDuring the July 19\u201324, 1988 International Congress of Ethnobiology, organized by Posey in Bel\u00e9m, the following document was adopted.[3]/nDeclaration of Bel\u00e9m/nLeading anthropologists, biologists, chemists, sociologists and representatives of several indigenous populations met in to discuss common concerns at the First International Congress of Ethnobiology and to found International Society of ethnobiology.

His work is also responsible for the method of human influenza vaccination that is commonly used. Before Webster and his colleagues separated the influenza virus into different particles, the entire influenza virus was injected into a patient as a vaccine - now, only certain parts of the virus are used to create the same response, lessening side effects of the vaccine.[2]/nWebster's work with the avian flu began after a beach walk with fellow researcher Graeme Laver, on which the men noticed a large number of dead birds along the shoreline. Webster wondered whether it was possible that the birds had died from the avian flu, and subsequently traveled to an island to take samples from hundreds of birds. This led to more trips, and eventually Webster discovered a link between the avian flu and the human flu. He deduced that it is possible for the avian and human viruses to combine, creating a new virus that humans would have no antibodies to.[2] In an interview with NBC, he said that when he first proposed this link, few paid attention to what he saw as a great danger.[4] However, Webster theorizes that the only event that has to occur to begin a flu pandemic is the mixing of avian and human flu strains in the same mammalian cell - most likely in a pig. Pigs are similar enough in genetic makeup to humans that they are susceptible to the human flu; also, in many areas, pigs come in close contact with chickens or ducks, making it likely that they will catch the avian flu.[2]/nAnother danger that Webster has uncovered is the duck. Ducks, while capable of catching and transmitting the avian flu virus through contact with chickens, seldom sicken and die from the exposure. Being alive and quite healthy, the ducks are then capable of spreading the virus to other areas.[2]", "23333831": "Steven M.

Zhuchenko.[3]/nImmigration to Israel was always an aspiration in Korol's family, leading his uncle to immigrate to Palestine in the 1930s. Nevertheless, immigration restrictions in the USSR prevented Korol from immigrating until the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Korol was eager to continue his research and has contacted different institutes in Israel.

He has coined a new concept of \u201cgenome dialect\u201d to demonstrate the above-gene sequence organization and its relationship with the evolution of recombination-repair enzymes.[11] A major scope of this field is to explore genome heterogeneity in main groups of organisms where total genome sequence is available (mammals and vertebrates in general, insects, fungi, plants). Another aspect of this field is to reveal genomic peculiarities associated with evolution at contrasting and extreme environments (e.g. extremophiles vs. mesophiles).[12]/nMuch of Korol's work is devoted to understanding peculiarities of recombination and organization of eukaryotic chromosomes and development of multilocus genomic maps allowing reliable ordering of thousands of markers per chromosome, complemented by computing-intensive map verification. As part of these efforts, new heuristics for Evolution Strategy algorithms were developed in Korol's lab to efficiently tackle this subsequent discrete optimization problem (with complexity ~n! where n~102-103).[13] Another complementary problem to reconstructing genetic maps is ensemble a consensus map from data produced by different labs, mapping populations or genotyping technologies.

Sokolowski's subsequent cloning of this gene, which she named foraging (for), was the first ever molecular characterization of a gene which regulates normal individual differences in a behaviour.[13] This gene has since been studied in many other animals, including humans.[8] Sokolowski demonstrated that the for gene can be influenced by the environment of the individual: this means that the style of foraging is dependent on the life that the individual has lived.[14]/nSokolowski has applied her work to early childhood development,[15][16] demonstrating how children who are at risk can benefit from nutritional, financial, educational and emotional interventions.[17]/nIn 2021, the Journal of Neurogenetics published and issue in honor of her.[18]/nSokolowski has published over 200 scientific papers, has numerous contributions to books, and several editorials in news papers.", "20417552": "Nader Pourmand  is a Professor of Biomolecular Engineering leading the Biosensors and Bioelectrical Technology Group at the Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz, Baskin School of Engineering.[1]/nHe has been published in Cancer Research,[2] PLoS ONE,[3] ACS, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.[4]/nPourmand received his PhD at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.[5] While he was at Stanford, his lab developed the science underlying Ion Torrent, a benchtop next-gen sequencing system (acquired by Life Technologies, then by Thermo-Fischer).[6] He has been a cofounder of start-ups Pinpoint Science inc.,[7] BioStinger Inc.

His laboratory was among the group that first showed the involvement of members of the RAS gene family in human cancer,[8] and that point mutations can activate the oncogenic potential of cellular genes.[9]/nWigler's laboratory was the first to demonstrate that some regulatory pathways have been so conserved in evolution that yeast can be used as a host to study the function of mammalian genes and in particular genes involved in signal transduction pathways and cancer.[10] This led to deep insights into RAS function, eventually solving the RAS biochemical pathway in yeasts and humans, and demonstrating the multifunctional nature of this important oncogene.[11] From this work in fungi new cellular mechanisms were recognized for \"insulating\" signal transduction pathways with protein scaffolds that reduce cross-talk[12] and for processing and localization of proteins.[13]/nDuring this period Wigler's lab published the first use of epitope tagging for protein purification.[14] Following the success with epitope tagging, Wigler and collaborator Joe Sorge patented methods for the creating libraries of genes encoding diverse families of antibody molecules.[15] The concept of antibody libraries is most often combined with the method of phage display used in development of antibody-based therapeutics./nIn the early 1990s, Wigler and collaborator W. Clark Still at Columbia University developed the first method for encoding combinatorial chemical synthesis, a method for using gas chromatography tags to record reaction \"history\" while building vast libraries of chemical compounds.[16] This approach[17] is still used today for drug discovery./nIn this same period, Wigler and Nikolai Lisitsyn developed the concept and applications of representational difference analysis,[18] which led to their identification of new cancer genes, including the tumor suppressor PTEN,[19] and by others the cancer virus-causing Kaposi's sarcoma, KSHV. In the late '90s, Drs. Wigler and Robert Lucito combined genome representations with array hybridization leading to a technique called ROMA[20] used to show common structural variation in genomes.[21]/nIn the decade since 2004, Wigler and Jim Hicks at CSHL, together with Anders Zetterberg of the Karolinska Institute, applied methods of copy number analysis for prognostication of breast cancer.[22] The need for accurate measurement of nucleic acid molecules led to the development of varietal tags,[23] more commonly known as unique molecular identifiers. This work led to the first successful sequence-based analysis of the genomes of single cancer cells[24] from tumors by Wigler's then-graduate student Nick Navin, and subsequently, tumor cells in circulation by Wigler's collaborator Jim Hicks./nIn the early 2000s, Wigler, Jonathan Sebat and Lakshmi Muthuswamy began copy number analysis of healthy individuals, leading to the discovery of a new source of genetic variability, copy number variations or CNVs.[21] The abundance of CNVs in the human genome is a major source of individual variation. The team at CSHL then continued this line of work to demonstrate that spontaneous germ-line mutation is likely to be a major cause for autism.[25] Their observations and theories about autism provide a now widely accepted approach for understanding other human mental and physical abnormalities.", "11537475": "Ruth Ella Moore (May 19, 1903 \u2013 July 19, 1994[1]) was an American bacteriologist and microbiologist, who, in 1933, became the first African-American woman to be awarded a Ph.D. in a natural science.[2] She was a professor of bacteriology at Howard University. A decade later, she was installed as the head of the department of bacteriology, which she renamed to the department of microbiology. During that period she was promoted to associate professor of microbiology./nShe published her research on tuberculosis, immunology, dental caries, the response of gut microorganisms to antibiotics, and the blood types of African-Americans./nAlthough there are gaps in the official personnel records of the university, Moore is believed to have continued to teach and conduct her research at Howard until 1973, after which she held the position of associate professor emeritus of microbiology until 1990./nMoore also gained recognition as a fashion designer./nRuth Ella Moore was born in Columbus, Ohio,[3] to Margaret Moore and William E. Moore on May 19, 1903. She had two older brothers, Donovan L. Moore and William E. Moore.[4] Her mother was a successful artist. As a graduate of Columbus State College of Art and Design, she always encouraged Ruth to strive for a college degree and beyond.[4]/nMoore attended Ohio State University for both her undergraduate and graduate education. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in 1926 and her Master of Science degree in 1927.[5] She was awarded her Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1933 from the university, making her the first Black woman in the United States to earn a PhD in the natural sciences,[3][6] as well as the first African American of any gender to earn a PhD in Bacteriology.[6][7] Ohio State University was one of the few universities in the United States admitting Black students at the time.[3]/nHer dissertation was on the tuberculosis bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The two parts were entitled, \"Studies on Dissociation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis\" and \"A New Method of Concentration on the Tubercule Bacilli as Applied to Sputum And Urine Examination\".[6][8][9] At the time, tuberculosis was the second largest cause of death in the United States.[8] This work was referenced in many later articles contributing to the eventual control of the disease.[6]/nIn 1940, she became assistant professor of bacteriology at Howard University College of Medicine in Washington, D.C. In 1952, Moore became chair of the department of bacteriology. She was subsequently promoted to the position of associate professor.[5][10] She was the first woman to be a department Head at the university,[3][6] which is a historically Black university.[3] Moore changed the department name from the department of bacteriology to the department of microbiology.[8][11] In 1957, Moore stepped down from her departmental leadership position, but continued to teach and conduct research on bacteriology at the university. She retired from teaching at Howard University in 1973 and held the position of the associate professor emeritus of microbiology until 1990.[12] It is unclear whether she ever received tenure despite her long career of teaching and research.[3][10] Moore also held other positions at the university, serving as chair of the scholarship and loans committee, as well as chair of the student guidance committee.[5]/nThroughout her career she was a member of the American Public Health Association and the American Society of Microbiology,[7][13] which she joined in 1936.[8] Moore was the first African-American to join the American Society for Microbiology.[14]  As a Black woman, she faced restrictions to attending American Society for Microbiology meetings, particularly where Jim Crow laws were in effect, mandating segregation in hotels and conference venues.[3] Moore also was a member of the American Association of Science, American Society of Immunology, the American Association of Microbiology, and the American Public Health Association.[10]/nMoore's research was published in a wide variety of professional journals and publications, from the Journal of the American Medical Association to the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.[15][16] Some of her research included significant contributions in the study of blood types,[15][16] dental caries (cavities),[17] and the reaction of specific pathogens to different classes of antibiotics.[18]/nHer publications in the 1950s were on blood types among African Americans.[15][16]/nIn some of her earlier work, Moore did research on the distribution and differences in blood types between Black and white Americans. She based her study on the works of L. and H. Hirschfeld, Landsteiner, Wiener, Levine, Belkins and Sonn, Neal and Hanig, and Matson.[19] Moore's study took place at Howard University College of Medicine. The university population included African Americans from throughout the United States. With few exemptions in the states represented, this diversity made her participants a random sample for Black Americans.[19] Moore's study was used for a teaching program. It was conducted by pricking the fingers of participants to collect blood samples and using macroscopic and microscopic processes to observe the blood samples that were collected.[19] Moore's experiment was split into three series, the first two series determined ABO blood types and the third series was used to determine the subgroups of ABO that are MN and Rh.[19]/nThroughout Moore's research she compared her results to that of the scientists who preceded her, such as Landsteiner and Weiner, who discovered the Rh factor in human blood.[19] When concluding her experiment, she was able to determine that the results from her MN study did not fully correspond with the results of the former experimenter, but her investigation into Rh types did correspond with that of the previous experimenter.[19] Comparison of her results to those of the other experiments suggested that Rh blood types might be a good starting ground for studying and building a foundation of knowledge about different racial backgrounds./nBeyond Moore's study of Rh and MN blood types, she also discovered in a group of 2496 African Americans that 51.94% of them were in Group O, 17.32% in Group B, only 27.3% were in Group A, and 3.01% in AB. That data corresponded with an earlier experiment in physical anthropology whose results demonstrated the types O and B were more prominent in African Americans than the other blood types.[19]/nDr. Moore was the only author of a 1938 paper titled \"The Immunology of Dental Caries\", about the etiological agents contributing to formation of dental caries (cavities).[3][17] The article was published in The Dentoscope, a publication by the Howard School of Dentistry.[3][17]/nHer investigations yielded an association of Lactobacillus acidophilus with cavities which she hypothesized to be an instigating factor.[3][17] Specifically, the organism was shown to satisfy the first two rules of Koch's postulates, while the other two had previously been demonstrated in vivo.[17] It was shown that L. acidophilus was present in the mouths of patients susceptible to cavities, but the species was absent from patients without cavities.[17] She therefore hypothesized the saliva of patients without cavities had antibiotic properties against L. acidophilus.[3][17] It is now known that this association with cavities occurs after the cavities have already formed, rather than this species being causal to their formation.[3] She also hypothesized that having a diet high in carbohydrates is a predisposing factor for cavity formation by selecting for specific species including L. acidophilus.[3][17]/nIt was shown that there was a correlation between skin reactions to L. acidophilus filtrate injections and susceptibility to cavities.[17] These reactions were not similar to those described in the Dick test and the Schick test, both of which were used to detect different types of biological toxins (see Dick test and Schick test).[17] Additionally, no toxins had been identified from L. acidophilus, leading Dr. Moore to conclude that the likely explanation was an allergy to the bacterium.[17] However, it was also noted that patients free of caries (cavities) also had skin reactions to L. acidophilus filtrate.[17]/nThe study also included experiments of vaccines on children. Vaccines with different phases of L. acidophilus were included; some vaccines had the rough (R) phase, some had the smooth (S) phase, and some had a mixed phase with both (see Griffith's experiment).[17] R phase vaccines caused abscesses at the site of injection and also increased agglutinin titer, while smooth vaccines did not. Mixed phase vaccines also caused abscesses.[17] The causative agent of these abscesses was not determined.[17]/nIn 1963 she published research on the sensitivity of gut microorganisms to antibiotics.[18] The 1963 publication studied gut isolated microbes of the Death's Head Cockroach, Blaberus caniifer Burmeister, by isolating pure cultures from the cockroach gut and culturing them on trypticase soy agar.[8] Moore later tested the cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility and antibiotic resistance by placing disks containing antibiotics at various concentrations on the plates  (see Disk diffusion test).[8] After incubation, Moore considered the bacteria sensitive to the antibiotic if there was a zone of inhibition present around the disk and as resistant to the antibiotic if there was no zone of inhibition around the disk.[8] Additionally, the study investigated whether antibiotics were bacteriostatic or bactericidal by removing agar from the zones of inhibition and culturing in nutrient broth.[18] If these liquid cultures showed growth, the antibiotic was concluded to be bacteriostatic, and if there was no growth, the antibiotic was concluded to be bactericidal.[18] Her work is considered some of the earliest on microbiomes.[6]/nMoore is believed to be the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in the natural sciences, which she received from Ohio State University.[20][21] Additionally, she was awarded two honorary degrees during her career, a doctorate in literature from Oberlin College and, in 1973, a doctor of philosophy from Gettysburg College.[22]/nMoore received the Centennial Award for Distinguished Alumni from Ohio State University.[5]/nIn 2005, U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson introduced a congressional bill recognizing the work of Ruth Ella Moore along with that of other scientists in the United States.[23]/nOhio State University College of Public Health created the Ella Moore First Generation Student Scholarship to honor Moore\u2019s legacy and to support upcoming trailblazers in a similar field.[24]/nBesides being a well-known scientist with a passion for her professional work, Moore was a talented seamstress and her passion for fashion design was evident throughout her life. Her mother shared the same talent and interest./nShe loved elegant, classic styles of clothing and designed and constructed her own garments for most occasions, from day to evening wear, and from tailored to draped components.[4] Her love for fashion definitely showed in the pieces she wore daily./nSeveral garments designed by Moore were featured in works such as The Sewer's Art: Quality, Fashion, and Economy in 2009. Some of her most notable creations include a two-piece suit composed of an off-white jacket and a black skirt, a long velvet dress, and a taffeta dress that was floor-length and covered in flowers of many colors.[4] The HCTC's Sports & Fashion has one of Moore's swimsuits on display, but due to the lack of labels and dates from the 1930s, no one is sure whether she made it or purchased the stylish garment.[4]/nMoore died at the age of 91 on July 19, 1994, in Rockville, Maryland.

Marshall entered University College, London, in 1838.[1]/nIn 1847 Marshall was appointed assistant-surgeon at University College hospital, becoming in 1866 surgeon and professor of surgery.[1] He was professor of anatomy at the Royal Academy from 1873 until his death.[1] In 1883 he was president of the College of Surgeons, also Bradshaw lecturer (on \"Nerve-stretching for the relief or cure of pain\"), Hunterian orator in 1885, and Morton lecturer in 1889.[1]/nRegarding Marshall's skills as a teacher and lecturer, the opinions of his former students appear to have diverged. One of them, Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer, described him as \"a good surgeon of the old school\"[2] and as \"a good friend\" for whom he had \"great respect and liking\" but also as an \"uninspiring teacher\" whose lectures were \"desperately dull\".[3] However, another former student, Sir John Tweedy, strongly disagreed with Schafer and described Marshall's lectures as \"informative and thought-awakening\" and Marshall himself as \"a cultured, critical and scientific surgeon, ever ready to try new paths and explore avenues of fresh knowledge\".[4]/nSir William MacCormac wrote in his volume on the Centenary of the College of Surgeons (1900):/n\"Marshall's fame, rests on the great ability with which he taught anatomy in relation to art, on the introduction into modern surgery of the galvano-cautery, and on the operation for the excision of varicose veins. He was one of the first to show that cholera might be spread by means of drinking water, and issued a report on the outbreak of cholera in Broad Street, St James's, 1854. He also invented the system of circular wards for hospitals, and to him are largely owing the details of the modern medical student's education.\"[1]/nThe Outlines of Physiology (1867)", "4721759": "Johan Hjort ForMemRS[1] (18 February 1869, in Christiania \u2013 7 October 1948, in Oslo) was a Norwegian fisheries scientist, marine zoologist, and oceanographer. He was among the most prominent and influential marine zoologists of his time./nJohan Hjort was the first child of Johan S. A. Hjort, a professor of ophthalmology, and Elisabeth Falsen, of the Falsen family. Among his siblings was the engineer Alf Hjort, who became a leader of subwater tunnel constructions in New York City. Johan Hjort had wanted to become a zoologist since his early schooldays, but to please his father he took initial courses in medicine, before following Fridtjof Nansen's advice and his own wish, leaving for the University of Munich to study zoology with Richard Hertwig. He then worked at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples on an embryological problem, which led to his doctorate in Munich at the age of 23 in 1892. He returned to Norway to become curator of the University Zoological Museum, where he developed more modern courses for students, and in 1894 he succeeded G. O. Sars as Research Fellow in Fisheries. After a year at University of Jena he was in 1897 appointed the directorship of the University Biological Station in Dr\u00f8bak./nHjort became the director at the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, from 1900 to 1916. His early influences abroad kept him involved in international research work, and he was among the founding fathers of International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1902. He was the Norwegian delegate at ICES from 1902 to 1938, when he was elected President, a position he held to his death in 1948./nIn 1909, Sir John Murray wrote to the Norwegian government that if they would lend the Michael Sars vessel to him for a four-month research cruise, under Hjort's scientific command, then Murray would pay all expenses. After a winter of preparation, this resulted in what was by that time the most ambitious oceanographic research cruise ever. The 1912 Murray and Hjort book The Depths of the Ocean quickly became a classic for marine naturalists and oceanographers./nFor several years, Hjort had been interested in the statistical nature and causes of the large fluctuations of fish populations. He was the first to apply actuarial statistical methods to study these phenomena, aided also by measurement techniques that made it possible to estimate the age of sampled fish. Hjort's studies culminated in the 1914 article Fluctuations in the Great Fisheries of Northern Europe, which was a pivotal work in the development of fisheries science./nThese studies made him interested in population dynamics more generally, the challenge of understanding the growth of populations of different organisms, ranging from cultures of yeast at one extreme to man, whales and fish at the other. He considered implications of such studies important also for human society, influenced in such views by Malthus, Darwin and others. He was early on concerned with effects of over-fishing, with the declining whale populations in the Antarctic an early warning, and worked on methods for determining the optimum catch that would secure sustainable populations./nHjort was a versatile individual who could also apply his broadly based  theoretical knowledge in strikingly practical ways. In 1924 he invented novel industrial mechanical machinery for extraction of whale oil from blubber. He is also credited with being the \"practical inventor of shrimp fishery\", on both sides of the Atlantic. The shrimp, in particular the deep-water shrimp Pandalus borealis, were known species, but were considered rare and not worth looking for. Around 1898, Hjort adapted earlier designs of deep-sea trawls on the soft bottoms of the deep Norwegian fjords and soon discovered enormous stocks of Pandalus borealis. This at first did not impress the fishermen. As H. G. Maurice, the 1920\u20131938 President of ICES, recalls, \"Hjort wasted no time in argument. He went prawn fishing, returned to harbour with a spectacular catch and dumped it on the quay. That was enough. With that practical demonstration he laid the foundation of an exceedingly profitable fishery and a flourishing export trade\".[2] Many years later, when travelling to Harvard in 1936 to collect an honorary degree, he predicted that the deep-sea shrimp would be found off the New England coast, since the ecological conditions were similar to those of the soft-bottomed Norwegian fjords. Taking time off to pursue his hypotheses, he was given command of the research ship Atlantis, and found vast amounts of shrimp exactly where he predicted they would be; this led to the formation of a shrimp fishery industry on the US side./nDuring the First World War, Hjort became engaged to some extent in politics and specifically foreign relations with both Germany and Britain. Hjort was asked to take part in negotiations between Norway and England to reach agreement on fish-purchase, and he did so, on the assumption that the agreement would be made public. Norway's foreign minister Nils Claus Ihlen, who was afraid of German reprisals, demanded however that it should be kept secret. In protest, Hjort resigned, both from the negotiations and also as Director of Fisheries, and left Norway for some years. After spending time in Denmark and at the  University of Cambridge, he was given a professorship in Oslo from 1921./nHjort was a frequent contributor to public debate, and wrote books, essays and newspaper articles on themes ranging from popularisation (and unification) of science to politics and philosophy./nFor his achievements in science and in practical oceanographic and fisheries research Hjort was awarded several honours, including honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge, Harvard and London. He was an elected fellow of a number of foreign scientific societies, including the Royal Society and the American Philosophical Society.[1][3] He was given the first ever Agassiz Medal, and received the Orders of St Olav, of Nordstjernen, and of Dannebrog./nSir Alister Hardy writes the following about Hjort: \"He was one of the great leaders in oceanography whose names will live in the annals of that science [...] His fame will last both for the contributions he made to oceanic biology, especially in that classic The Depths of the Ocean which he published with Sir John Murray as a result of their North Atlantic expedition in 1910, and equally for his remarkable pioneer achievements in practical fisheries research. All in a position to judge [...] regard him as the most outstanding personality in the ICES since its foundation in 1902; from that date until his death he remained the Norwegian delegate and became its President in 1938.\"/nIn his book about Norwegian scientists, Francis Bull gave the following description of Hjort: \"As a superior, he was without peer; helpful, kind, patient \u2013 as an equal, rather difficult, because he always believed he was right \u2013 and as a subordinate, sure of himself and full of the desire to oppose.\"[4]/nHjort had four children with Wanda Maria von der Marwitz (1868\u20131952), whom he met while a student in M\u00fcnchen in 1893. His eldest son was the supreme court lawyer Johan Bernhard Hjort (1895\u20131969)./nThe standard author abbreviation \"J.Hjort\" is used to indicate Johan Hjort as the author when citing a botanical name.[5]", "66751587": "Lilian Edith Hawker (19 May 1908 \u2013 5 February 1991)[1] was a British mycologist, known for her work on fungal physiology, particularly spore production. She was an expert on British truffles, and also published in the fields of plant physiology and plant pathology. She was also known for her contributions to education in mycology. Most of her career was spent at the botany department of the Imperial College of Science and Technology (1932\u201345) and the University of Bristol (1945\u201373), where she held the chair in mycology (1965\u201373) and was dean of the science faculty (1970\u201373). She served as president of the British Mycological Society, and was elected an honorary member of that society and of the Mycological Society of America. She published an introduction to fungi and two books on fungal physiology, of which Physiology of Fungi (1950) was among the first to survey the field, and also co-edited two microbiology textbooks./nHawker was born in Reading, Berkshire in 1908.[1][2] Her father was a schoolteacher. She was educated at Reading School[2] and went up to the University of Reading in 1925, obtaining a BSc in botany (1929) followed by a MSc in plant geotropism (1931). She was taught by Walter Stiles.[3] Her first research paper appeared in 1930, based on work she completed as an undergraduate on reproduction in the yew tree.[1][2]/nHawker briefly researched plant physiology at the University of Manchester (1931\u201332).[1][2] In 1932, after taking a course by the mycologist William Brown, she shifted her focus to fungal physiology.[1][2] Around this time, Walter Buddin at Reading also interested her (and Terence Ingold) in collecting fungi in the wild,[4][5] a lifelong pursuit. Hawker joined Brown's group at the botany department of the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London that year, becoming a research assistant (1933), and rising to demonstrator (1934) and assistant lecturer in mycology and pathology (1937).[1][2] Her research work was acknowledged in the award of PhD (1935) and DSc degrees (1944) from the University of London. Her career was interrupted by the Second World War; she remained at Imperial's London site teaching under difficult conditions,[1] while Brown and others from the department moved to Slough.[6] Michael J. Carlile comments on her relatively slow promotion at Imperial, despite being highly active in both research and teaching, speculating that it might have been due to her not having contacts.[2]/nIn 1945 she was appointed lecturer at the University of Bristol, rising to reader in mycology (1948) and holding the chair in mycology from 1965,[1] one of the early women to hold a chair at the university.[1][7] In 1970\u201373, she served as the science faculty's dean.[2] Bristol's first to be a woman.[8] Her colleagues included Carlile and Michael F. Madelin.[2][9]  After her retirement in 1973, she held an emeritus professorship,[1] She participated in the university's studies of proposals for a Severn Barrage including as co-editor of the report.[2]/nA \"conscientious\",[2] \"enthusiastic and committed\"[1] teacher, Hawker's contributions to university-level education in mycology have been described as \"impressive\".[2] She served on the British Mycological Society's committee investigating this topic in the 1940s.[10] She helped to found the University of Bristol's degree course in microbiology, which under her influence included mycology, and co-edited two microbiology textbooks which included fungi. She visited the United States in 1965, investigating how practical laboratory work \u2013 a particular enthusiasm of hers \u2013 fit into university-level education.[1]/nHawker served as president of the British Mycological Society in 1955, and was also elected an honorary member of the society (1975),[10] as well as of the Mycological Society of America (1966).[11] In 1966, she organised Bristol's Colston Symposium on the topic of \"The Fungal Spore\", which founded the International Fungus Spore Symposium series.[1][2] The following symposium (1974) in Utah was dedicated to her, as well as the American plant pathologist David Gottlieb, and in 1988, Transactions of the British Mycological Society honoured her reaching the age of eighty.[1]/nHawker's initial research was in the field of plant physiology. She studied geotropism, the way in which plants respond to gravity, which resulted in four useful papers published in 1932\u201333.[1][2] She also researched the auxin group of plant growth hormones.[1]/nAt Imperial in the mid-1930s, Hawker began to research fungal physiology, and in particular spore production.[1] She initially chose to study the ascomycete fungus Sordaria destruens (formerly Melanospora destruens), and investigated the factors affecting its spore production, such as the type of carbohydrate that it is growing on.[2] At Bristol she studied reproduction in the zygomycete fungus Rhizopus sexualis, identifying a volatile factor that promotes spore formation, which Graham Gooday and others identified as trisporic acid and related compounds.[2] She continued to study what triggered fungi to switch from vegetative growth to the reproductive phase for more than two decades. At the end of the 1950s, she abandoned this line of research in favour of observing the ultrastructural changes that occur during the production and germination of spores, and published prolifically on this topic from 1963 until her retirement.[1][2] These studies were facilitated when the Bristol botany department purchased an electron microscope in around 1960; she was among the earliest British researchers to take electron micrographs of fungal structures.[2]/nIn the mid-1930s she also researched fungal diseases affecting plants cultivated for their flowers, especially narcissus and gladiolus,[1][2] for example, basal rot caused by Fusarium species.[12] She later studied arbuscular mycorrhizas \u2013 the symbiotic relationship between root-colonising fungi and many plant species \u2013 with her experiments suggesting that the coloniser was often Pythium; however, Barbara Mosse showed that it was instead fungi of the order Glomerales.[2]/nHer interests extended to macroscopic fungi. In 1934, with Terence Ingold, Hawker studied fungal distribution in the Mortimer area, near Reading.[5] In 1948, she started to investigate the distribution in Britain of hypogeous fungi, known as truffles: fungi with underground fruiting bodies.[1][2] She is said to have \"revived  the  study  of  truffles  in  England\";[8] before her work this group had not been studied since the Victorian era, and they were believed to be rare in the country.[1][13] In 1948\u201359, she found 1200 specimens from at least 60 species within 25 miles of Bristol. Her research resulted in a 1954 monograph,[1][2][8] and was described in 2005 as still \"unequalled.\"[2]/nHawker is described as writing \"fluently and with great speed.\"[1] She published Physiology of Fungi (1950), one of the earliest books on the topic,[2][6] and followed it up with Physiology of Reproduction in Fungi (1957).[1] Her undergraduate text Fungi: An Introduction (1960) surveys fungal diversity.[14] She also co-edited two textbooks on microbiology with Alan H. Linton and others, An Introduction to the Biology of Micro-organisms (1960) and Micro-organisms: Function, Form and Environment (1971).[1]/nHawker is not recorded as having married, and in later life she lacked close relatives.[1] Her main recreation was painting in watercolours, and after retirement in oils.

A New Method of Experience,[6] in order to encourage physicians and scientists to apply the Baconian method of inductive reasoning to medicine and the other natural sciences.[1]/nTodd began experiments on healing using newts at the British Naval base in Naples, and continued when he moved to Brighton.[4] He conducted a series of experiments on the newts and other animals such as worms to study the processes of healing and regeneration of wounds and amputated body parts. These were the first experiments that proved that nerves have a role in healing, and that amphibian limbs cannot regenerate if the nerves are cut.[7][4] He observed the healing process microscopically and collaborated with histologist Charles Ager to produce over 3,000 microscope slides to illustrate his findings. These slides are amongst the earliest surviving examples of the use of Canada balsam as a mountant.[8]/nTodd's research was not well known in the second half of the 19th century,[4] but was the basis of many studies in the early 20th century,[9] and more recently the importance of Todd's work has been acknowledged by medical historians.[4][9]/nTodd died from tuberculosis on 4 August 1840, in Hurst, Sussex.

[8]/nAitken was born in Bath,[9] in England, on 4 September 1947.[1] Born into a family of real estate agents in Devon, he attended Barnstaple Boys Grammar School,[9] but quit at the age of 16 to follow his parents' footsteps and become an estate agent.[9] After six months of selling houses to the semi-rural residents of Barnstaple, Aitken decided to return to school.[9] He then re-enrolled at his former school to study art, English, and geography, but they were all full, so he had no choice but to study chemistry, botany, and zoology, despite his initial intention to avoid science.[9]/nAitken graduated from the University of London, where he received a Bachelor of Science (Special Honours) in 1967.[3] While at university, he studied zoology, specifically embryology,[10] which made him interested in reproductive biology, prompting him to pursue a Master's degree in Embryology and Mammalian Reproduction from the University College of North Wales in 1969.[3][2]/nHe continued his post-graduate studies focusing on wild animal reproduction in Veterinary Clinical Studies at the University of Cambridge under Professor Roger Short's supervision.[2]/nIn 1971, Aitken's first paper, \"Ultrastructural changes in the uterine glands of the Roe deer during delayed implantation\u201d was published in the Journal of Physiology.[11] After 4 years working with Dr Roger Short, Aitken completed his thesis,[12] and received a PhD for research on reproductive study in roe deer from the University of Cambridge in 1973.[3]/nAfter Cambridge, Aitken started a postdoctoral position at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Animal Genetics,[3] working collaboratively with Anne McLaren, a graduate from the University of Oxford.[2]  However, for the first 12 months at Edinburgh, he had not done any outstanding research due to transformations in study models from descriptive on wild animals to mechanistic approaches using the mouse, as well as changes in laboratories.[2] Despite initial difficulties, he became familiar with new study models of in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer in the second year.[2] In later years, combining these techniques with electrophoretic analysis of proteins, his publication rate rose dramatically[2] and was being cited by other scientists at that time.[13]/nIn late 1975, Aitken was invited to study problems associated with fertility regulation at the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s Human Reproduction Unit in Geneva.[3] As consulting scientists of WHO, he and Mike Harper[2] conducted several reviews on fertility control strategies, which help prevent or disrupt implantation.[14]/nReturning from the WHO informative sessions, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bordeaux for 1 year[3] before continuing his research activities at the University of Edinburgh in September 1977.[3][2]/nDespite a short period at WHO, Aitken had the opportunity to consider all the problems that concern human health, particular infertility issue, during his time here, which prompted him to pursue research in human reproductive biology.[15]/nIn 1977, Aitken had been appointed to the first Medical Research Council Centre for Reproductive Health at University of Edinburgh, where he and his team focused on the biochemistry of implantation.[2] During his early days at the newly founded centre, he found an advanced technique for examining proteins and carbohydrates more precisely during the pre-ovulatory period to study hormonal control of implantation.[16] Despite early achievements, his team had suspended all research activities due to material shortage from gynaecology wards.[2]/nAfter months of waiting for clinical supplies, Aitken took the lead in Andrology with Roger Short and David Mortimer's encouragement,[2] despite the fact that the discipline was still in its infancy around the 1950s.[17] With this transition in research styles, he could gain direct access without relying on his clinical colleagues' supply,[2] thus solving the need for clinical materials. In 1982, he was promoted to senior scientist at the Medical Research Council;[3] however, it was initially difficult since he and his team were all obscure about how they could influence this field.[2]  After few years with renovated laboratory facilities, Aitken started to focus his future study on clinical research into male contraceptives, androgen physiology, and male infertility, especially molecular mechanisms that regulate sperm function.[2][18]/nAitken remained at the University of Edinburgh for most of the 1980s to 1990s. It was there that he discovered an abnormally free radical attack in failures of fertilisation[19] and later did research on the relationship between reactive oxygen species and their effects on impaired sperm function.[20] He also proposed new techniques in contraception that had helped prevent sexually transmitted diseases and treat male infertility.[21] These contributions laid the foundation for the reproductive studies done in the latter half of the twentieth century and later.[22][23]/nDuring the time at the University of Edinburgh, Aitken worked with multiple antibodies to analyse their effects on fertilisation and human sperm function.[24] When he gave the administration of A23187 to spermatozoa from normal fertile and oligospermia, he discovered a decline in fertilisation rates at a higher dose, which reduced sperm motility.[25] In attempt to explain the cellular basis of defective sperm function association in a 1987 paper in the Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, he found a sudden burst of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with the free radical attack in male infertility.[26] The hyperactive production of ROS causes peroxidative damage to the sperm plasma membrane, which is known as oxidative stress, resulting in loss of sperm function.[23]/nThe discovery was later acknowledged by thousands of scientists as a foundational concept in studying oxygen species associated pathophysiology.[27] Aitken's paper had expanded on the molecular modifications of oxidants in male infertility and resulted in new therapeutic intervention methods to maintain reproductive function.[28][29]/nBesides discovering oxidative stress, Aitken also improved the male contraceptive vaccine in later years.[21] His paper in the European Journal of Pharmacology in 1990 proposed 3 possible targets, including hCG, zona pellucida and sperm surface for contraception development.[30] This research provided the foundation for designing a long-lasting and reversible form of contraceptives, providing an effective method to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases and control the world's growing population.[21][31]/nThe University of Cambridge awarded Aitken a Doctor of Science (ScD) in 1998 to recognise his achievements in gamete biology.[32] At the same time, he got a phone call from the University of Newcastle, inviting him to take up the Chair of Biological Sciences. He first declined because he mistook Newcastle for Newcastle upon Tyne, but then agreed after learning that the university is in Australia.[2] It was here that he later took part in several important roles such as Head of School, Director of an ARC Centre of Excellence then Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Faculty of Health and Medicine at the University of Newcastle.[33]/nWhile serving high positions at the University of Newcastle, Aitken continued his research career on the reproductive studies. He and his colleagues conducted further research on the effects of oxidative stress on the physiological and functional integrity of human sperm.[34] They also researched related oxidative stress problems, such as genetic alterations in male infertility, which culminated in gene mutations, discussing the possible health issues of the next generation from couples using assisted reproductive technology.[35]/nHe and his colleagues continued to research safe and reliable contraception vaccinations for controlling human fertility. Their study included developing the potential contraceptive potential of ZP3 peptides[36] and other chemical compositions of these contraceptive agents, implying the potential effectiveness of the anti-hCG antibodies.[37]/nDuring his early years in Australia, Aitken attempted to diverge his studies from human reproductive science.[2] He released articles that helped identify diseases in various Australian species, including Tammar Wallaby and Brushtail possum.[38] In addition, he discovered Ehrlichia platys in dogs in Australia, which had not previously been found in Australian animals.[39] However, after few years, he decided to return to andrology and the pursuit of understanding the cell biology of spermatozoa.[2]/nAccording to Google Scholar, this is the period where Aitken's papers were receiving an increasing number of citations.[40] During this time, Aitken and his team carried out some studies to identify different causes affecting male reproductive health. They found that environmental conditions such as smoking,[41] toxins, and mobile radiation[42] contribute to various health issues. These not simply affect male fertility by causing oxidative stress, but they also cause DNA damage, increasing the risk of a man's children developing infertility or cancer.[41]/nAlong with the studies on  DNA integrity, the effect of radiofrequency radiation[42] on fertility, contraceptive[37] and fertility preservation in patients, Aitken has been working on molecular markers of oxidative stress and developing sensitive methods to measure reactive oxygen species generation by cells. Their discovery showed the effectiveness of numerous diagnostic techniques, such as chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry, and flow cytometry, as an indicator of oxidative stress, emphasizing the general significance of mitochondrial dysregulation in impaired sperm activity.[43]/nDespite not gaining much success in the animal study, his contribution to developing immunocontraception on animals ranging from horses, sub-mammalian organisms to annelid worms, oysters, and fish enabled the development of a nonsurgical sterilization technique. In 2015, he received a patent for his \"Method for reducing the Reproductive Potential of an Animal\" while working with Eileen McLaughlin.[44] His invention revolutionized Australian horse breeding industry, which provided a new method of controlling the horse population and increase their value.[45]/nIn more recent years, Aitken has been focusing on translational research in male contraception and male infertility. Since 2016, he has been working alongside Memphasis to develop \"Felix\", a device which uses a patented cell separation technology to more gently and effectively separate sperm from semen samples.[46] This project seeks to increase the collection of vital, stable sperm during the crucial early stages of the IVF process.[47]/nAitken's cultural interests go beyond science.[9]/nBefore deciding to pursue a career as a scientist, music was his greatest passion.[9] He played the guitar most of the time during his time at the University of London and joined the university's folk music club.

Pittendrigh is regarded as the \"father of the biological clock,\" and founded the modern field of chronobiology alongside J\u00fcrgen Aschoff and Erwin B\u00fcnning. He is known for his careful descriptions of the properties of the circadian clock in Drosophila and other species, and providing the first formal models of how circadian rhythms entrain (synchronize) to local light-dark cycles.[1]/nHe obtained his botany degree from the University of Durham (King's College) in 1940.[2] Assigned to wartime service as a biologist in Trinidad during World War II, he studied malaria transmission by mosquitoes. After the war, he attended Columbia University to study for his Ph.D. He later joined the faculty of Princeton University and started his chronobiology research.[3] He also co-chaired a Mars exploration project at NASA from 1964 to 1966.[4]/nThe defining principle that Pittendrigh developed throughout his career was that the properties of the circadian clock are independent from those of the behaviors it controls. This gave him the freedom to study the clock through a range of physiological functions from the hatching of fruit flies to rodents' locomotor activities. He performed large series of experiments to demonstrate that circadian rhythmicity is intrinsic and independent of environmental cues. He carried out a famous and protracted debate with Frank Brown, of Northwestern University, on whether circadian timekeeping is intrinsic or environmentally driven. Pittendrigh's data and argument ultimately prevailed and sparked interest in chronobiology.[3]/nPittendrigh died from cancer on Tuesday, March 19, 1996, at his home in Bozeman, Montana.[1] He has been regarded as one of the most influential figures in the field, and his research influences the field of chronobiology even after his death. The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms holds biennial lectures named in honor of Pittendrigh and Aschoff.[5]/nColin Pittendrigh was born in Whitley Bay, on the coast of Northumberland (today Tyne and Wear) on October 13, 1918. He received his first degree in botany in 1940 from University of Durham, now University of Newcastle upon Tyne.[6]/nPittendrigh was a conscientious objector and  so during World War II, he was assigned to wartime service to try and improve the production of bananas and other fruit that was being shipped to the UK during the war. He also worked as a biologist for the Rockefeller Foundation and the government of Trinidad to control malaria near the military bases there. He studied the epidemiology of malaria transmitted by mosquitoes breeding in epiphytic bromeliad (\"tanks\" formed by overlapping leaves) in the forest canopy. He made acute observations on bromeliad distribution within forest canopies and between contrasting forest formations. He observed daily rhythms in mosquito activity patterns, particularly noting that peak activity times were different for different species at different canopy levels. His work with the biting rhythms of these mosquitoes was responsible for the development of his interest in biological rhythms, which later led to his experimental studies on eclosion rhythm in Drosophila.[7]/nPittendrigh married Margaret \"Mikey\" Dorothy Eitelbach during the war. Soon after, they moved to Trinidad and lived in the rain forest, where Pittendrigh worked on malaria control as part of the war effort.[8] He returned to the United States in 1945. Margaret and Colin had two children, Robin Rourk, who currently lives in Louisville, Colorado and Colin Jr., who lives in Bozeman. Pittendrigh had a grandson and a granddaughter.[1] Pittendrigh was an avid fly fisherman and outdoorsman, and he and his wife retired to Bozeman, Montana because of their love of the Rocky Mountains.[1]/nAfter the war, Pittendrigh attended Columbia University to study for his Ph.D. in biology under the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky.[9]  When he finished at Columbia in 1947, he joined the faculty at Princeton,[1] as an assistant professor of biology where he began his work concerning circadian rhythms. While at Princeton, he gained his U.S. citizenship in 1950 and served as dean of graduate studies from 1965 to 1969.[10][11] Pittendrigh also served on a variety of national scientific boards including the Science Advisory Committee to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).[10]/nIn 1969 Pittendrigh left Princeton to join the faculty of Stanford where he helped found the program in Human Biology and later became the director of the Hopkins Marine Station.[1] While serving as the director of the Hopkins Marine Station in 1976-1984, Pittendrigh is credited with helping to rebuild Stanford's century-old marine biology laboratory, bringing in modern molecular biology, ecology and biomechanics, and turning the station into an internationally famous and vigorous one.\"[1]/nPittendrigh retired from Stanford in 1984 and moved to Bozeman, Montana. Here, he continued his studies of biological clocks, working with the faculty and lecturing at Montana State University \u2013 Bozeman.[1]/nPittendrigh met Aschoff in 1958 when Aschoff made his first visit to the United States. Pittendrigh studied the eclosion rate of fruit flies, while Aschoff studied the continuous circadian rhythm of birds, mammals, and humans. They reached two different conclusions of the entrainment model with Aschoff supporting a parametric entrainment concept (gradual entrainment throughout the day) and Pittendrigh supported a nonparametric entrainment concept (entrainment is sudden and once a day). Despite opposing views, Aschoff and Pittendrigh remained close friends, and they had a lifelong intense exchange of notes and ideas.Their research was described by Serge Daan as \"always in harmony, never in synchrony.\"[12]/nDuring WWII, Pittendrigh was sent to Trinidad to help breed vegetables for the North African campaign and devise methods to help control malaria plaguing troops there. Here, he made important discoveries about the breeding habits of mosquitoes and their need for bromeliad water reservoirs to breed. Pittendrigh found an ingenious solution to controlling the mosquito population. Since they bred in the water tanks collecting on these plants, eliminating the tanks destroyed the mosquito population. Spraying a copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution (non-toxic to humans) on the bromeliads killed them and destroyed the mosquitoes' breeding environment. In addition to his malaria research, Pittendrigh's studies of the daily activity rhythms of mosquitoes sparked his interest in biological clocks, a subject which he came to wholly pursue later at Princeton.[13]/nPittendrigh was influential in establishing many of the key criteria that a biological system must have in order to be considered a biological clock. His work studying the eclosion (the process of an insect emerging from its pupa stage) rhythms of Drosophila pseudoobscura[12] demonstrated that 1) eclosion rhythms persist without environmental cues (i.e. in constant conditions), 2) unlike most chemical reactions, the period of eclosion remains relatively constant when exposed to changes in ambient temperature (\"temperature compensation\"),[14] and 3) eclosion rhythms can be entrained by light cycles that are close to the flies' natural period (\u03c4)./nBeginning in 1958, Pittendrigh developed the concept of the phase response curve or PRC.[15] The PRC allowed chronobiologists to predict how a biological system would be affected by a change in its light schedule. The PRCs, detected almost simultaneously in Pittendrigh's and Woody Hastings' labs, served as the basis for the nonparametric entrainment model that was soon after proposed by Pittendrigh. This nonparametric model of entrainment predicted that the difference between an environmental period (T) and an organism's intrinsic period (\u03c4) is instantaneously corrected every day when light falls at a particular phase (\u03c6) of the cycle where a phase shift (\u0394\u03c6) equal to this difference is generated. This is reflected through the expression: \u0394\u03c6(\u03c6)= \u03c4 - T.[12]/nWhile the PRC has been invaluable towards understanding entrainment, there are several notable problems with the model. The PRC, while accurate at describing Drosophila eclosion rhythms, has trouble predicting various aspects of mammalian entrainment. Compressing subjective day or night intervals in mammals leads to changes in activity that are not predicted by the PRC. It was later shown that these differences are partially due to \u03c4 and the PRC being malleable entities modifiable through entrainment. Pittendrigh himself recognized that his model of entrainment was based on simplification and could not accurately model all cases of entrainment. However, this model has been salient in furthering our understanding of entrainment and is widely used today to teach the concept of nonparametric entrainment.[12]/nPittendrigh's close friend, Aschoff, proposed a contrasting parametric model of entrainment in which he proposed that light either lengthened or shortened the endogenous period (\u03c4) while also changing the baseline of oscillation.[12] This parametric model suggested that light may affect the period of circadian oscillation and modify the shape \u2013 or waveform \u2013 and the level around which the oscillation moved. While Aschoff's continuous model of entrainment has largely fallen to the wayside, it is important to remember that Aschoff's contributions helped to address and explain shortcomings in Pittendrigh's nonparametric entrainment model, which is now widely taught and accepted./nIn 1964-65, Pittendrigh co-chaired the National Academy committee on Mars exploration with Joshua Lederberg, to investigate whether life exists on Mars.[4] The project was conducted at Stanford University and Rockefeller Institute, New York, beginning in the summer of 1964 and concluding in October, 1965.[16] During the same period, he received a NASA exobiology grant for his research on \"Circadian Rhythms on a biosatellite and on Earth\",[17] which studied how being in orbit can affect circadian rhythms (though it's not clear what organisms he studied on, and no later publications could be found on this study). Pittendrigh was also involved in the anti-contamination panel in the international Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),[10] which deals with the risk of contaminating Mars with life from earth and thus destroying man's opportunity to learn whether life developed spontaneously on Mars. In 1966, Pittendrigh co-authored Biology and the Exploration of Mars: Report of a Study, which describes the findings in the exobiology study of 1964-65.[16]/nPittendrigh and Daan published a set of five papers reporting their findings on the properties of nocturnal rodents' circadian pacemakers. Below are some major findings:/nOne-pulse system[18]\nInstead of shining light on rodents for a long continuous period (e.g. 12hr) to represent \"daytime\", Pittendrigh showed that a 15 minutes light pulse shone during the subjective night is enough to cause phase shift in animals. This supports the non-parametric property of the circadian clock./nInterspecies and intraspecies differences[19] in responses to light pulses (i.e. difference in PRC)\nRegardless of whether they belong to the same species or not, rodents with longer period (\u03c4) have larger advance zone in their PRC, because they need to have phase delays more often in order to entrain to local time (24hr). The opposite is true for rodents with shorter period (\u03c4). Its implication on real life is that most diurnal organisms, including humans, have periods longer than 24 hours; they therefore tend to have a larger advance zone in their PRC. Nocturnal animals, on the other hand, often have periods shorter than 24hr; they thus have a larger delay zone./nTwo-pulse system (or skeleton photoperiod)[20]\nTo test the effect of Photoperiodism (i.e. varying the length of daytime), Pittendrigh and Daan invented the two-pulse system, with one flash at dawn, and another flash at dusk, and changing the interval between the 2 light pulses to mimic changing photoperiods. When photoperiod (i.e. daytime) gets longer than 12hr, a Phase Jump (also called \u03c8 Jump, where \u03c8 is the phase angle of entrainment) occurs, where the original nocturnal activity jumps to the now longer daytime, and \u03c8 changes abruptly since the clock now treats the second light pulse as light onset and the start of the day. Nonetheless, in nature where photoperiod is complete (i.e. light is constantly shone throughout the daytime), \u03c8 jump is not observed. This supports Aschoff's model of the parametric effect of light./nDual oscillator model[21]\nUnder constant light and high light intensity, Pittendrigh observed the locomotor activity of hamsters split into two parts, each has its own period. He thus proposed the E & M (Evening and Morning) dual oscillator model. Normally the two oscillator are coupled to each other and generate the intermediate free-running period which is what we usually measure. However, under constant high light intensity, the two oscillator uncouple, and each free runs with its own period, until they are stabilized at 180\u00b0 apart or recouple again. Their influence on each other is greater when their peaks of activity are closer together. The model quantitatively accommodates \u03c4 and \u03b1 summarized in Aschoff's rule, and Aftereffects on free-running period are predicted from prior light-dark history./nAs the technology of molecular biology advances, researchers found plenty molecular evidence for the E&M dual oscillator model. For example, the experiments of PDF (pigment dispersing factor)-producing cells in drosophila show that PDF is sufficient in generating morning activity, while having no effects on evening peak. In mammals, while normal hamster show SCNs (Suprachiasmatic nucleus) (the main circadian pacemaker in mammals) on 2 sides being in-phase with each other, the split hamster show SCN being anti-phase with each other. Ongoing research is trying to characterize the evening oscillator and study the interactions between E&M oscillators./nThe later part of Pittendrigh's research is devoted to studying the temperature dependence of photoperiodic responses in drosophila.[22] This work was crucial in developing the Photo-Periodic Response Curve (PPRC), a phase-response-curve that factors in seasonal daylength changes when describing entrainment. He proposed another dual oscillator model, in which the master oscillator is light sensitive, and the slave oscillator is temperature sensitive. This model explains his observations of seeing significant entrainment responses to varying photostimulation and seeing dampened, yet still significant, responses to changing temperatures.   \nPittendrigh also collaborated with Knopka on the study of drosophila per mutants (which genetically have longer or shorter intrinsic periods due to mutation in the per gene) and their different entrainment responses to temperature and light stimuli.[23] The per mutants have impaired temperature dependence, which suggests that the activity of the temperature oscillator in the mutants are reduced as compared to wildtype. This is another evidence that support the temperature-light dual model system.", "40766641": "Elizabeth Jane Robertson CBE FRS MAE is a British developmental biologist based at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford.[1] She is Professor of Developmental Biology[2] at Oxford and a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow.[3] She is best known for her pioneering work in developmental genetics, showing that genetic mutations could be introduced into the mouse germ line by using genetically altered embryonic stem cells.[4][5]  This discovery opened up a major field of experimentation for biologists and clinicians.[6][7][8]/nRobertson earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Oxford.[9] She received a PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1982 under the supervision of Martin Evans.[10]/nAfter her PhD, she stayed on at the University of Cambridge for her postdoctoral fellowship and continued to work there as a research assistant following the completion of her fellowship.[11] She was a professor first at Columbia University and then Harvard University before moving to the University of Oxford.[11] In her lab at Columbia she was the first to show that embryonic stem cells carrying genetic mutations could contribute to all parts of the adult mouse body, including the cells that eventually make up the gametes, i.e. sperm and egg cells, allowing these mutations to be transmitted to the next generation.[4][5] She used this approach to test the role of specific growth factors in embryonic development,[12] and to screen for previously unknown genes that prevent normal development.[13][14] Robertson's work was among the first to show that the disruption of many genes has surprisingly little effect on development and organismal phenotype,[15][16][17] contributing to a long-running challenge in the understanding of the robustness of biological systems.

He is part of the Capital Budget Subcommittee, Transportation and the Environment Subcommittee, and the Personnel Oversight Committee - all part of the Appropriations Committee./nIn August 2021, Beitzel announced that he would not seek a fifth term to the House of Delegates in 2022.[3]/nIn October 2021, he was one of five Maryland state legislators from Garrett, Allegany and Washington counties who sent a pair of letters to West Virginia officials asking about annexation of Western Maryland to West Virginia.[4][5] These letters caused a local uproar, with Allegany County officials calling the request a political stunt, an embarrassment and unneeded distraction.[6] Following criticism from local officials and some constituents, Delegate Jason Buckel and State Senator George Edwards issued a letter withdrawing support for the secession proposal.[7]/nBeitzel was the subject of criticism in 2011 when he received $427,000 in state funds for agreeing not to develop farm land he owned. The deal actually cost the state of Maryland $455,000, since they also contributed fees for appraisal and other professional services, totaling $28,000.00.[8]/nThe property in question was a farm owned by Wendell and Ruth Beitzel near Accident, Maryland, which they acquired around 2007./nBeitzel submitted an application to the Board of County Commissioners to establish an Agricultural District for a farm they own on Accident-Bittner Road For the purpose of seeking conservation easements utilizes the Maryland Rural Legacy Program.  The Beitzel application was approved on February 6, 2008, by the Garrett County Planning Commission and by the Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board on February 28, 2008.  The Board of Garrett County Commissioners approved the application April 29, 2008./nThe Beitzel application was then submitted with 5 others to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation by the Garrett County Department of Planning and Land Development on April 30, 2008.  After approved by the creation of an Agricultural Preservation district by the Garrett County Commissioners, Beitzel submitted an application to participate in the Garrett County Bear Creek Rural Legacy Program to convey development rights to the property in exchange for payment to be determined by appraisal./nThe administration of the program, started by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, ordered three appraisals.  After assessment of the easement, Beitzel was offered $427,000 for the conservation easement on January 12, 2009.  Beitzel accepted the offer on January 28, 2009.  It took several years before the transaction was finally approved by DNR while two other applications were being processed.  After being informed that the application was approved by the DNR for settlement in 2011, Beitzel informed Mr. Williams A Somerville, Ethics Advisor for the Maryland General Assembly Joint Committee and Legislative Ethics of the pending transaction and asked for a review of the easement to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest before and to ensure appropriate disclosure before requesting final approval by the Board of Public Works for Maryland.  In addition, the Delegate submitted Form B&D Disclosure of Interest to the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics./nThe Beitzel application was approved by unanimous vote of the Board of Public Works and the sale of the conservation easement was finalized in 2011./nIn March 2014, Beitzel voted against raising the state minimum wage from $7.25/hour to $10.10/hour. The House of Delegates voted 89 to 46 in favor of the legislation. Beitzel spoke out against the wage increase, stating the bill would harm small business owners and cause them to go out of business.\n[9]/nIn 2016, Beitzel opposed legislation that would prohibit carrying firearms and deadly weapons on Maryland college campuses.[10] Betizel had concerns that the legislation would impact hunters who might inadvertently travel on university property with a firearm in their vehicle.[citation needed]/nBeitzel has sponsored several pieces of legislation related to Deep Creek Lake, a major reservoir in his district, including bills that would allow landowners to purchase contiguous property [11] and a plan to provide funding for state-owned lakes such as Deep Creek.[citation needed]/nBeitzel said he has been supporting the practice for drilling and as a landowner served to gain from drilling. \"I've been criticized from potentially benefiting financially from  (drilling)\", said Beitzel, who added he would not benefit any more than those who had Marcellus Shale under their property.[12]/nIn March 2015 the Maryland Legislature debated a bill, HB449,[13] that would provide for a three-year period to study the health effects of fracking. A panel of experts would study the environmental and public health risks of hydraulic fracturing. Supporting the gas industry's concerns about the bill, Beitzel expressed opposition to the bill[14] and has argued repeatedly that additional studies and regulations would deter gas development in Western Maryland and was not business friendly. Beitzel offered several amendments to the bill which failed on the House floor before a final veto-proof vote in favor of the health study and moratorium. In the end, Beitzel was part of the 103 House members who voted for and helped pass the legislation.[15]/nIn a WCBC radio interview[16] posted online on April 9, 2015, Beitzel further explained his opposition to creating the panel of health experts by stating \"The makeup of the panel was created in such a fashion that I felt it was just so slanted to the one side that they would get the results they wanted\". He finally voted for a version of the bill that did not include public health considerations, stating in an interview on WCBC radio about the final bill \"it was not really a bill that was going to cause a whole lot of harm\".[17]/nThe fracking issue intensified in the legislature in 2017 when two bills to ban fracking in Maryland were introduced in both the House and Senate.[18]/nBeitzel was quoted in The Washington Post as saying \"If you don't have property with natural gas, then you have nothing to gain from it, and it's easier to be opposed to it\". He further suggested that he would not benefit from fracking because \"he does not own the gas rights for his own property, much of which is off-limits to drilling because it is either designated for agricultural preservation or located within one of the watersheds that would be protected under the state's proposed regulations.\"[19]/nThe Washington Post did a follow-up story on the issue when opposition accused Beitzel of a conflict of interest, which he presented to the Maryland Ethics Council in 2011 to assure the public there was no act of wrongdoing. The question of his conservation easements was raised again, along with his former comments which had led many to conclude that he was not disclosing that he stood to benefit financially if he chose to lease his land for drilling. \"I can only lease that land for agricultural purposes and other uses that are not restricted by the conservation easement,\" he explained the preceding month. Beitzel later provided clarifying remarks and the Post included a copy of a legislative ethics committee report on the matter.[20]/nRegardless of Beitzel's stance on the development of natural gas in Western Maryland, his support has become obsolete since both bodies of the General Assembly passed legislation to ban the process of hydraulic fracturing (House Bill 1325/Senate Bill 740).[21] Governor Hogan's support for a ban on hydraulic fracturing[22] and approval to sign the bill into law prevented a proposed moratorium, which would have allowed each county to vote whether or not the residents of that county wanted to ban the practice./nIn February 2017, Beitzel was recognized by the American Conservative Union for his \"commitment to upholding conservative principles through their voting records during the 2016 legislative session.\"[23]/nIn January 2023 Garrett College renamed its career technology training center to honor Beitzel in recognition of his efforts towards its creation.[2]", "60165314": "Babraham Institute/nYiliang Ding has been a group leader with tenure at the John Innes Centre since 2014, working on the functional roles of the RNA structure in living cells.[1][2] She has also been an Honorary Group Leader at the Babraham Institute and an Honorary Associate Professor at the University of East Anglia since\u00a02022./nYiliang received a bachelor's degree from the Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2005.

Early work emphasised the importance of thermogenesis in the regulation of energy balance and the aetiology of obesity, and the role of b2 adrenoreceptor activation in muscle hypertrophy. More recently she has carried out pioneering studies of the role of cytokines and other components of the immune system within the central nervous system. She demonstrated the key role of specific cytokines and the hormone leptin in the integration and regulation by the brain of host defence responses to infection and injury. This led to important discoveries concerning the role of cytokines in neurodegeneration. She was the first to show that the cytokine IL-1 mediates ischaemic brain damage, challenging the view that immune or inflammatory processes are unimportant in the brain. She patented the use of IL-1 inhibitors to prevent acute neurodegeneration and is leading the first clinical trial of such an inhibitor in stroke. Her demonstration that caspases are involved directly in ischaemic brain damage in vivo stimulated the development of caspase inhibitors for possible clinical application.

As the first party chairman of the KPD in Bavaria, he was in April 1919 one of the protagonists of the Bavarian Soviet Republic that emerged in the wake of the German November Revolution of 1918./nResearch has established that Levien was descended from Huguenot immigrants into Russia by the name of Lavigne.[1] Max Levien was born into a German merchant family in Moscow in 1885. His studies began in 1893 at the Moscow German Gymnasium and continued in 1897 in Meissen, Germany, where he graduated in 1902. He discontinued his scientific studies at the University of Halle in the fall of 1905 to participate in the Russian revolution that year. Joining the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SR) in 1906, he was arrested by the Okhrana and sentenced to prison in Moscow in 1907.[citation needed] After his release in 1908, Levien went to Zurich where he continued his studies, and graduated with a doctorate in the summer of 1913. In Switzerland, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Party, had contacts with Lenin and became a follower of the Bolsheviks. After graduation, Levien went to Germany and became a German citizen. On 29 October 1913, he volunteered for the Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment and served from 1914 to 1918 on most fronts in the First World War, fighting alternately in France, Italy, Serbia and Romania./nDuring the November revolution he was active in the soldiers' councils, working closely together with anarchist writer and activist Erich M\u00fchsam.

His mother, Delphine Depois-Auger (1861, Ontere-1902, Belgrade), was French. She was a daughter of the local ship-owner. His father Bo\u017eidar \u201cBo\u017ea\u201d \u0110aja (1850, Dubrovnik-1914, Hinterbr\u00fchl) was a ship master, originally working as a sea captain, later switching to river transportation.[5][10][11] They were married in Le Havre in 1881.[12] Ivan was their eldest child. While they were still living in France, the couple had another son, Aleksandar (1885\u20131968), who later became an agronomist within the Food Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[5][12] When Ivan was six, the family moved to Belgrade in 1890, where his father took over as the captain of a steamboat, Deligrad,[10][11] which was an official diplomatic ship of Serbian rulers. He helmed it until his retirement in 1907. In Belgrade, the couple had a daughter, Olga, their third child (1892\u20131974).[12]/nBo\u017eidar was also an author. He wrote stories about the life of Dalmatian sailors who worked on the sailing ships and published them in the series of books jointly titled Our Seamen: Apprentice in 1903, Young Man in 1904 and Helmsman in 1909, all three published by the Ilija M. Kolarac Endowment. When he died in Vienna, he left three more manuscripts from the same series, ready for print: Nostromo, Captain and Old Age.[13]/n\u0110aja finished elementary and high school in Belgrade. After graduating at First Belgrade Gymnasium in 1902, he moved back to France, spending one year as a student at the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Corneille at Rouen.[5][10] He studied philosophy under \u00c9mile Chartier.[8] In 1903 he enrolled at the Sorbonne, where one of his fellow students and best friends was \u00c9mile Herzog, later famous French author under the name Andre Maurois. He studied natural sciences (botany, physiology and biochemistry) under Albert Dastre, great scientific experimenter, himself a student of Claude Bernard. \u0110aja gave his final exam in 1905 and, mentored by Dastre, received a PhD on 23 July 1909 with the thesis in physiology Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans.[1][3][8]/nDuring his studying, he also had several jobs. In 1904, he became the youngest foreign correspondent of Serbian daily Politika. Only 20 years old, he became recently established newspaper's reporter from Paris and first foreign correspondent in general.[5] He also worked for a while at National Museum of Natural History with Paul van Tieghem, before spending five years at Marine station in Roscoff, Brittany. Starting in 1906, he worked there with Yves Delage and Albert Dastre, beginning his career as a researcher.[8]/nHe was invited by the biologist \u017divojin \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 to return to Belgrade from France, where he became a docent at the Faculty of Philosophy.[14] There, that same year, he founded the first Chair for physiology in this part of the world, within the Institute for Physiology which he also founded and chaired for 40 years.[1][3][4][5][8] When World War I broke out in 1914, he was in Vienna, and was kept in confinement, under the Austro-Hungarian police watch, until December 1918.[5][8][14]/nUpon his return to Srbija, \u0110aja restored the Institute and became associate professor at the University's Faculty of Philosophy in 1919 obtaining the full professorship in 1921. In 1947, when Faculty for mathematics and natural sciences (PMF) split from the Faculty of Philosophy, \u0110aja became PMF's professor.[1][2] In 1934 he was elected to the one-year tenure as the rector of the University of Belgrade. He founded and co-founded numerous scientific institutes both in Yugoslavia and abroad, including People's University in Belgrade.[1][3][5][14] He was vice-president of the Red Cross of Yugoslavia in the Interbellum.[11]/nWorld War II interrupted his work again, as \u0110aja staunchly opposed the German-appointed puppet regime in Serbia. He asked to be retired in 1942 and was even confined for a while by the quisling authorities at the Banjica concentration camp. He was reactivated in 1945, both as the professor and head of the Institute for Physiology, before finally retiring in 1955.[5][8][14]/nHe became associate member of the Serbian Royal Academy on 18 February 1922, and was elected to the full membership on 16 February 1931.[15] Within the Academy, he was member of Academy of natural sciences and its secretary from 7 March 1937 to 7 March 1939. He gave his inaugural academic address on 6 March 1932, titled Some features of the fight against cold.[16] After reorganization of the Academy in 1947, \u0110aja was elected a member of Department for mathematics and natural sciences and Department for medical sciences on 22 March 1948. He became secretary of the former from that date to 10 June 1952, while he was entrusted with developing the latter and creating a new Department for arts and music (he himself played a flute.  He became member of that department, too, on 20 April 1949. In the process of reorganization, Serbian Royal Academy was renamed Serbian Academy of Science in 1947. \u0110aja later proposed for the name to be expanded by adding arts in the title, which was accepted after his death, in 1960, when the academy was officially renamed to Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts./nSoon after becoming an associated member of the Serbian academy, he was elected to the same position in Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb. He helmed the process of collaboration between the two academies in an effort to realize his idea of creating a biology station for students located on the Adriatic Sea. As a result, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries was founded in 1930 in Split, on the Dalmatian coast (today in Croatia).[8][11]/n\u0110aja was also a member of the French Academy of Sciences.[2][6] He was unanimously elected as a corresponding member in 1955,[3] being inaugurated on 28 May 1956 in the Section for medicine and surgery.[17] He was elected for his \u201cseminal work on the behaviour of deep cooled warm blooded animals\u201d and took over the academy seat which was left vacant after the death of Alexander Fleming.[8]/nAfter he founded the Institute, \u0110aja began his experimental work, adopting the motto Nulla dies sine experimentum (Not one day without the experiment).[5] His entire scientific work can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, which started in his student days and lasted up to World War I, he concentrated on the research of the endogenic enzymes or ferments, which are produced by the glands of digestive organs. He created a more rational nomenclature of the enzymes than the ones previously used./nWhen he returned to Serbia in 1919, his second phase was centered on metabolism. In this period, he published a physiology textbook in 1923, Fundamentals of physiology. In preface, he wrote that \u201che arranged the subject matter based on one leading idea: that circulation of matter and energy is the basic phenomenon of life, and that all physiological functions are subordinated to it.\u201d He also researched bioenergetics and an effect of the temperature and asphyxia induced numbness on living organisms. His major work from this phase is the two-volume Homeothermy and thermoregulation from 1938./n\u0110aja began to research hypothermia in 1935 and from 1940 it became the focal point of his scientific work. He was especially interested in the ways it can be achieved. With his treatise State similar to the winter sleep of the hibernators achieved in rat by the means of barometric depression, published on 15 January 1940, he began researching the physiology of the deeply cooled homeothermous organisms. He was interested in thermogenesis, gas circulation in organisms, adaptation to cold, defense role of hypothermia and metabolism in deep hypothermia. His results from this period have found a wide application in medical physiology./nApart from pure chemical processes in the human body, he was interested in philosophical decoding of the complex functional plexus in the natural world in general. Considering physiology as the branch of biology which synthesizes the entire knowledge of the science of life, \u0110aja aimed to present the philosophical interpretation of the nature of science, its foundations and future development. He published his philosophical views in Following the footsteps of life and science in 1931 and Man and the inventive life in 1955. He presented thesis on the origin of the biological inventive power, purposefulness of certain phenomena in the living world and discussed the concept of usefulness in biology. He tried to comprehend the mechanics of life, chemistry and physical chemistry of the living organisms and to give a unifying scientific philosophical theory which would encompass physiology, evolution and genetics.[14]/nHe was also known as the major popularizer of biology, but also of science and arts in general and was remembered as an excellent lecturer and teacher.[6][8]/n\u0110aja married three times. His first wife was French and she died young. He married for the second time to Sofija \u0110aja,[12] village teacher from Bavani\u0161te, Pan\u010devo. They had a daughter, Ivanka \u0110aja-Milankovi\u0107 (1934\u20132002). Ivanka worked as a journalist in Sremska Mitrovica, where she died, though she spent a long time living in Canada. Already at an advanced age, he married for the third time, to Leposava Markovi\u0107 (1910\u20131991). She was his former student and collaborator and worked as an assistant and professor at the University of Belgrade. They lived in Belgrade's neighborhood of Profesorska Kolonija. \u0110aja was a good friend with Milutin Milankovi\u0107.[11]/nHis paternal uncle was Jovan \u0110aja (1846\u20131928), a journalist and politician, member of Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107\u2019s People's Radical Party. He was president of Serbian association of journalists 1897\u20131899 and Minister of internal affairs of Serbia 1890\u20131891 and 1891\u20131892.[18] He was the one who invited Ivan's father Bo\u017eidar to Belgrade, to helm the \"Deligrad\" ship.[12]/nIn 1957, as president of the Symposium on hypothermia, \u0110aja was among the principal organizers of the XV congress of the Committee of International Congresses of Military Medicine and Pharmacy which was held in Belgrade. During the congress, on his way to the venue, \u0110aja died on 1 October 1957. Among many others, the scientific journal Nature marked his passing by publishing an In memoriam.[8]/nAlone, or with his co-workers, \u0110aja authored over 250 works, out of which over 200 were scientific. Rest of it includes popular, philosophical and children books, translations from French and an autobiography./nHe co-authored his first scientific paper in 1906, titled Amylolytic inactivity of dialyzed pancreatic juice. His other initial studies were also centred on enzymology and published in magazines of the Parisian Biology society and French Academy of Sciences. Later, his works were mostly published by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts and Croatian Natural Society.  Since 1913 he was correspondent for the Glasnik, magazine of the Serbian academy, and later for the Medical overview, Serbian literary herald from 1905, Foreign review from 1933 and Science and technics from 1941. In 1927\u20131928 he was an editor of the University's magazine University life./nAfter publishing his PhD thesis Study on ferments of glycosides and carbohydrates in mollusks and crustaceans in 1909, his first monograph was Ferments and physiology in 1912 and other important works in the next decade include Notes on a scientific work (1914), Biology papers (1918), Fundamental biological energy and energetics of kvass (1919), Does living yeast cause fermentation of sugar only by its zymase? (1919), Use of ferments in cell physiology studies (1919), Fundamental biological energy (1920), About electric thermostate (1920) and Experimental search for the common energetic foundation in living beings (1921), while in 1923 he published the first textbook on human and animal physiology in the region, Fundamentals of physiology.[11] Other scientific works include Mutual replacement of food ingredients in peak metabolism (1926), Basal metabolism and homeothermy (1929), Peak metabolism (1929), Problem of evolution (1931), Homeothermy and thermoregulation I-II (1938) and Hypothermia, hyberniation and poikilotherms (1953). Monograph Man and the inventive life, published in 1955, is considered to be his opus magnum./nPopular and philosophical works include Travels of \u201cObili\u0107\u201d through South Serbia in 1923 (1929), Following the footsteps of life and science (1931), From life to civilization (1933), How do we feed?

When he died, he left several writings in manuscripts:  Conversations in Dubrovnik, Short stories, Memories, Physiology and hypothermia and his autobiography Discovery of the world.[1][2][4][7][8][14][19]/nCritics say that \"true word about \u0110aja, as a writer, still hasn't been said\". Starting with his first non-scientific works published in the Sr\u0111 magazine, he was described as a natural born storyteller. His meditative prose is said to have a \"specific place\" in Serbian literature. He was also writing down his thoughts in the form of saying and proverbs.[12]/nIvan \u0110aja is one of the greatest Serbian physiologists and biologists who had the invaluable role in founding the experimentally based scientific physiology in Serbia. Gifted scientist, teacher, philosopher, writer and musician, he was a true modern polymath. As such, he was the founder of biochemistry in Serbia and Southeast Europe. His work brought him a worldwide reputation.[4][8]/nHe was among the first scientists who pointed out the role of the adrenal glands in the body's thermoregulation[1][14] and is considered one of the pioneers in the research of hypothermia. He founded the new scientific branch, high altitude hypothermia (or physiology of the cooled organisms) which has a growing application in modern medicine, much more than it had in \u0110aja's time.[3][14] At one point, based on his research, the NASA examined the possibility of bringing the astronauts to the state of hypothermia, which would bring them to the hibernation stasis and make longer space flights possible.[9]/nA diagram he created in 1938 is today known as the \u0110aja\u2019s diagram (of thermoregulation) or \u0110aja\u2019s curve,[1][3][14][20] and the way he brought organisms to hypothermia (reducing the body temperature by asphyxia and cold environment and then complete recovery by warming up the organism) is named \u0110aja\u2019s method of induced hypothermia (\u201chypercapnian hypothermia\u201d).[3][4] \u0110aja also invented an apparatus for gas exchange measurement (\u0110aja\u2019s apparatus). He coined the terms peak (or maximal) metabolism and metabolic quotient which entered the textbooks on the subject.[1][14]/nIn the Institute for Physiology of Serbia, which he founded in 1910 and made a world class scientific facility, he was succeeded by his student Radoslav An\u0111us (1926\u20132003) who continued his work and the resulting scientific approach became known as the \u201cBelgrade School of physiology\u201c.[3][8][14] Due to the intensive work of \u0110aja on establishing and keeping the professional links with foreign universities, he placed the Belgrade physiology school on a world map.[9]/nCommemoration named \"100 years of Ivan \u0110aja's Belgrade school of physiology\" was organized from 10 to 14 September 2010 by the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Biology. The event was held in the premises of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Artsm with participation of scientists from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Slovakia, etc. A bust of Ivan \u0110aja was dedicated during the event, which was later moved to the hall of the Faculty of Biology.[11]/nAlready for his first monograph from 1912, \u201cFerments and Physiology\u201d, \u0110aja received an award from the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences.[8]/nFor his studies on hypothermia and thermoregulation, French Academy of Sciences awarded him the Pourat prize in 1940 and the Montyon Prize in 1946.[1][7][8][14]/nIn 1952 he was elected a corresponding member of the French Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine.[9] In 1954 he was awarded the doctor honoris causa at the Sorbonne, and was also awarded the French Legion of Honour.[1][3][8] He was the third Serbian scientist who was awarded Sorbonne's honorary degree, after Nikola Tesla and Jovan Cviji\u0107.[14] He was also an associate member of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.[2]/nIn Belgrade's municipality of Vra\u010dar, a street was named in \u0110aja's honor in 2004.[21][22] Celebrating 100 years of the Institute for Physiology, a commemorative plaque was placed in the street on 10 September 2010.[11]/nHe was the recipient of the Serbian Order of the White Eagle, 4th class and Yugoslav Order of Labour, I rank.[2]/n\u0110aja was described as a \"man completely devoid of vanity\".[9] He is remembered as a proper gentleman, always suitably dressed and groomed, and cultural and kind in communication with others. \u0110aja was also known as propagating humanistic approach, always helping his co-workers and students. With his students, he organized and participated in transfer of the Josif Pan\u010di\u0107 remains from Belgrade to the Kopaonik mountain. He was known for joking, saying to his friends: \"Come by too see my daughter, she is the best in the field of physiology I have done\".[11] This was in line with his understanding that \"life, by itself is more perfect than any human achievement\".[9]/nDuring his tenure at the helm of the University of Belgrade in 1934\u20131935, a major anti-government student protest was organized and to put it down, the police stormed the university. \u0110aja then supported the students, staunchly protesting the police action. After the war, when the Communists took over the government, he was introduced to the new authoritarian ruler Josip Broz Tito in 1945 as the \"students mother and red rector\". \u0110aja replied: \"I protected them so that they can study, their political fervor I considered a youthful frivolity\". When Tito was nominated as the honorable member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, \u0110aja was the only one who voted against him. As a result, the secret service labeled him as \"reactionary and misfit\". When he was inaugurated to the French Academy of sciences in 1956, Yugoslavia refused to send an ambassador. \u0110aja stated: \"He was free to come, I criticize my country only when I'm in it\". Though allowed to work and teach at the university, and to publish popular and other books, none of his scientific books were published in Yugoslavia after his fallout with Tito.[9][11]", "32443793": "Ernst H.

Student of the philosopher Georges Canguilhem, trained in the conceptual history of philosophy and science through his postgraduate thesis on the theory of space, he turned to biochemistry and wrote his State thesis on the history of protein biochemistry, in contact with biophysical chemists Jeffries Wyman, John Edsall and Ren\u00e9 Wurmser. In this work, which considers both the long historical duration and the strictly philosophical problems raised by the new biochemistry, as well as the most recent developments, he analyzed the evolution of new theoretical models of allosteric protein function from the perspective of structure-function relationships. Two books have been devoted to this new \"molecular philosophy\". Then, wishing to approach the more strictly experimental aspects of life sciences, and in particular the new neurosciences, he joined, as an epistemologist, the Department of Experimental Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of Lyon headed by Michel Jouvet, to study the development of research on REM sleep and dreams, mainly from the philosophical angle of \"psychophysiological parallelism\", which involved all disciplines of neuroscience, and from that of functional hypotheses, making REM sleep play a functional role in the individuation of the brain.

From this body of experience in the biological and medical sciences, Claude Debru drew the substance from a new book of epistemology and history in order to analyse the process of research and discovery, analysing some of Claude Bernard's work in the light of artificial intelligence, questioning the resolution of the paradoxes that have given rise to neuroendocrinology, unclassifiable leukaemias or cell death. Extending his investigation to new biotechnologies, Claude Debru reflected on their relationship to the notion of possibility and their biological justification./nReturning to neuroscience, its history and its relationship to philosophy, Claude Debru has undertaken several studies on the development of neuroscience in France after the Second World War and on the temporal aspects of brain function, from William James to recent developments, establishing a long-term collaboration with Pierre Buser.

Noted before 1910 for his work in descriptive surgery and pathology, focusing on the treatment of tuberculosis, genital diseases and tumors, he soon became one of the main contributors to medical historiography and bibliography. He founded several hospitals and edited medical journals, setting up a collection of medical instruments which became the basis of a national museum in Craiova. He became a professor at the University of Bucharest, an expert for the League of Nations, and, after distinguished service in World War I, a recipient of the Legion of Honor; additionally, he served for 22 years as president of the International Society for the History of Medicine, of which his wife Viorica was also an active member./nA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Queen Helen and administrator of her Br\u00e2ncovenesc Hospital, Gomoiu fell out with King Carol II, and was arrested in 1934 for protesting against his rule.

Despite this stance and his international profile, Gomoiu was arrested by the postwar communist regime, and spent time in confinement at Sighet and Aiud prisons. He had been posthumously rehabilitated by the 1980s, but his work was only fully recovered after the Romanian Revolution of 1989./nBorn in V\u00e2nju Mare, Mehedin\u021bi County, he was the first child of Romanian Orthodox priest Gheorghe and his wife Ana.[1] He attended primary school in his native village, followed by Traian High School in Turnu Severin from 1893 to 1900. Between 1900 and 1905, he studied at the medical faculty of the University of Bucharest. Meanwhile, he rose steadily through the hospital ranks, from extern at Col\u021bea Hospital in 1903 to intern there in 1905 to apprentice doctor at Bucharest's central military hospital in 1910.[2] Gomoiu was a disciple of anatomist Thoma Ionescu. Alongside Dimitrie Gerota, Ernest Juvara, and Victor Papilian, he continued Ionescu's work in descriptive anatomy as well as, in some instances, physical anthropology.[3]/nIn 1906, Gomoiu published in Bucharest the first volume of his Istoricul Societ\u0103\u021bei Studen\u021bilor \u00een Medicin\u0103 (\"History of the Medical Students' Society\"), with a plate by Ary Murnu; also that year, his study on eye disease among the rural population saw print at T\u00e2rgu Jiu.[4] Affiliated with the left-wing agrarian current, or Poporanism, he established in that city the literary magazine \u0218ez\u0103t\u00f3rea S\u0103teanului (\"Villager's Sitting\"), joining an editorial office which also included George Co\u0219buc and G.

These works were taken up in Eraclie Sterian's magazine, Spitalul, of which Gomoiu was co-editor,[8] or published as brochures.[9] His doctoral thesis, on facial anaplasia, was awarded a magna cum laude in 1909,[10] and published the same year. It was followed in 1910 by Gomoiu's introduction to inguinal hernia surgery, his reviews of surgery as applied to genital tuberculosis, vaginal hydrocele, urethrocele, and varicocele, and a work on the physiological role of cholesterol.[11] A winner of the Manoah Hillel scholarship, that year and the next also saw his first contributions as a medical bibliographer and librarian, with catalogues of entries for the University of Bucharest's graduation papers in medicine.[12] For his service in the Romanian Army, Gomoiu was concentrated in Medgidia.[7]/nGomoiu soon lost his father to pancreatic cancer and found it hard to provide for himself, accepting jobs for which he was overqualified.[7] In March 1911, recommended by Francisc Rainer, he began working as a surgical docent and became director of the Techirghiol tuberculosis sanatorium. He modernized the institution, systematizing records, constructing a laboratory, planting a grove of cluster pines, and furnishing a small facility for the study of regional climatology and radioactivity. He also began experimenting with thalassotherapy, light therapy, and the use of medicinal clay.[13] This inaugurated a ten-year practice at various hospitals, during which Gomoiu patented various new surgical techniques.[14] In November, after a disagreement with medical inspector Gheorghe Proca, who suggested that the sanatorium was unhygienic, Gomoiu handed in his resignation.[15]/nIn 1913, a second-class surgeon at Filantropia Hospital, Gomoiu published a piece on \"the radical treatment of vaginal hydrocele\" in the French journal Lyon Chirurgical, and his opening lesson on \"small surgery\" (Mica chirurgie).[16] That year, he also performed his military obligation by accompanying the ambulatory health service sent to the Ottoman Empire during the Second Balkan War and performing surgery within the unit.[1][2] In parallel, he studied craniometry, publishing a study of 24 craniums in Revista \u0218tiin\u021belor Medicale, then as a booklet, and following up in 1915 with Cercet\u0103ri asupra perimetrului cranian (\"Researching the Cranial Perimeter\"). The same years saw his many conferences at the Surgical Society printed in several editions, alongside separate studies of skin cancer, the sympathetic nervous system in the abdomen, gas gangrene of the thorax, and gastrostomy techniques.[17] In 1916, he and Ionescu together discovered the link between stellate ganglion removal and sympathectomy.[18]/nFor his work as a military physician during the Romanian Campaign of World War I, Gomoiu was decorated with the Order of the Crown (1917), the Order of the Star of Romania (1918), and the Queen Marie Cross (1919).[1] He subsequently served terms as head of the Union of Reserve Officers,[5] and, in 1920\u20131921, was curator (or efor) of Bucharest's civilian hospitals.[14] The author of Hommage a la France et aux m\u00e9decins fran\u00e7ais (\"A Homage to France and French Physicians\", 1918),[16] Gomoiu was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1922.[19] Between 1919 and 1942, he was a surgeon at the Oradea war hospital and at two hospitals in Bucharest, also working at Br\u00e2ncovenesc Hospital. Meanwhile, he held various leadership roles in medical societies and administrative bodies,[2] and, in 1921, became a professor at Bucharest University.[19]/nHis work now included tracts in social medicine, the history of medicine and medical education.

His article covering Danish libraries, and in particular the one Nikolaj Tower, saw print in Cuv\u00e2ntul daily and was also taken up in \u0218coala Noastr\u0103.[25]/nGomoiu also became a trusted supporter of King Ferdinand I, managing the charity set up by his daughter, Princess Ileana.[26] He was one of the specialists who assisted Ferdinand during his losing battle with colorectal cancer.[27] In 1927, under Ileana's patronage,[28] he set up the Sf\u00e2nta Elena Hospital, in the working-class suburb of Bariera Vergului, Bucharest. He personally oversaw the pledge drive, collecting private donations and public money from the National Bank, the Ministry of Health and C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne, offering free medical services to the donors.[5] Gomoiu also designed much of the building, modifying sketches by the architect Gheorghe \u0218imotta. In the end, the hospital developed into a regional model, being cited as such in League of Nations reports.[5]/nTogether with his friend Mihai C\u0103nciulescu, Gomoiu edited Acta Medica Romana magazine from 1928 to 1948. There, the two led a sustained campaign for the establishment of a university at Craiova,[2] and also contributed to the establishment of regional hospitals in V\u00e2nju Mare, Turnu Severin, and Mangalia.[5][7] Considered a founder of medical history and museography in Romania, Gomoiu collected old publications, diplomas, decrees, instruments and medical or pharmaceutical apparatus. He founded the ISHN-affiliated Romanian Medical History Society, which held monthly meetings from 1929 to 1948[2] and was also placed under Princess Ileana's patronage.[28] With his wife Viorica, herself a physician, Gomoiu organized and hosted the ISHM's September 1932 congress in Bucharest.[29]/nFor a while in 1930, Gomoiu served as secretary general in the Ministry of Health.[19][30] In this capacity, he attended a conference on social hygiene in the French industrial hub of Tergnier, meeting with the organizer, Raoul Dautry.[30] He also represented Romania on the League of Nations committee for physical education, inspecting the military school at Joinville-le-Pont.[31] After losing his government office, he returned to the ISHM and, in 1933, was elected its vice president.[28]/nGomoiu also served as private physician to Queen Helen,[19] estranged wife of the new king, Carol II. Around 1933, she also appointed him to lead her charity, A\u0219ez\u0103mintele Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti.[32] During this period of his wife, Gomoiu emerged as \"one of the best known critics of [Carol's] camarilla\".[33] In March\u2013April 1934, Gomoiu created a stir by publishing a manifesto against Carol and his circle of politicians. He was briefly arrested on charges of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9,[34] alongside far-right politicians suspected of having conspired with the Iron Guard, which had just assassinated Prime Minister Ion G.

His account was backed by the Union of Reserve Officers, which staged a public protest; its influence, insiders speculated, explained by Gomoiu was treated leniently in court.[36] In May 1936, Gomoiu was called upon by the Iron Guard to be a defense witness for Viorel Trifa, Alecu Cantacuzino, and other Guardista accused of conspiracy against the state.[33]/nGomoiu was president of the ISHM from 1936 to 1940, having successfully defeated with Maxime Laignel Lavastine, who became his bitter adversary.[37] He had by then established inside the international body a Cantacuz\u00e8ne Commission, named after (and presided upon by) Ion Cantacuzino. It tasked with researching and inventorying European medical folklore\u2014although this subject was of marginal interest to Cantacuzino himself.[38] Gomoiu also returned to his anatomical research, publishing in 1938 a definitive monograph of the connective tissue (\u021aesutul conjunctiv), co-authored by his student V. Pl\u0103t\u0103reanu.[39] Also that year, the two also presented a report on \"the cross in Romanian medical folklore\" to the ISHM Congress in Zagreb; with Al. Raicovicianu, Gomoiu also published the bibliographic corpus Histoire du folklore m\u00e9dical en Roumanie (\"A History of Medical Folklore in Romania\").[40]/nBy that moment in history, Carol had established his National Renaissance Front dictatorship, and, in 1940, appointed Ion Gigurtu to lead a government that included some Iron Guard members. Gomoiu also joined, serving as Gigurtu's Health Minister from July 4 to September 4.[41] In this capacity, and also as a member of the Crown Council, he was marginally involved in the major international crisis which saw the cession of Romanian land to the Soviet Union and the Axis Powers. On the night of August 29\u201330, he was among a majority of ministers who voted to peacefully cede the regions of Northern Transylvania to Regency Hungary.[42] Gomoiu kept his ministerial office during the first government of Ion Antonescu, from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the National Legionary State and Carol's flight from the country.[43] Reportedly, he resented Antonescu's alliance with the Iron Guard, and avoided politics altogether.[28]/nIn October 1942, at the height of Antonescu's alliance with Nazi Germany, Gomoiu's friend Barbu L\u0103z\u0103reanu was arrested with other Jews and scheduled to be deported to Transnistria Governorate, but was spared thanks to Gomoiu's appeal to Queen Helen, who intervened on L\u0103z\u0103reanu's behalf. As a Swiss journalist reported at the time, Gomoiu, \"a man so nice that he could not imagine that the Jews are so persecuted\", personally visited the Jewish detainees and convinced himself of their mistreatment, before contacting the queen. The latter insisted that she would leave the country, and endanger Antonescu's legitimacy, if the deportations would continue.[44]/nUpon the end of World War II and a 6-year hiatus, Gomoiu was finally replaced as head of the ISHM by Laignel Lavastine.[45] Shortly after the establishment of a communist regime in December 1947, Gomoiu was removed from teaching.[19] He was arrested, together with tens of others former dignitaries, on the night of May 5, 1950, and detained with them in the basement of the Ministry of the Interior, Palace Square.[46] Incarcerated at Sighet prison from 1950 to 1953,[19] where he was held in solitary confinement, he was transported to Bucharest in order to participate in a 1954 international congress on medical history.[47] Released in 1954, he refused a position in the communized Health Ministry offered to him in 1956, viewing it is a form of collaborationism.[28] Although some sources claim that he lived the rest of his days in Aiud prison,[19][47] he is known to have died in Bucharest in 1960, \"almost forgotten by everyone.\"[28] He was buried in Plot 33 of Bellu Cemetery.[48]/nIn 1963, Gomoiu's holdings and the minutes of his Medical History Society were donated to the University of Craiova by his widow Viorica, and form the basis for a museum of medical and pharmaceutical history. This was inaugurated within the medical faculty in 1974 and set up in its own building between 1979 and 1982.[2][5] In recognition of Gomoiu's local contribution, an amphitheater was named after him.[2] The Romanian Post also issued, in 1981, a series of stamps honoring the Medical History Society, with a postmark bearing Gomoiu's portrait.[49] In 1990, following the Romanian Revolution, the institution in Bariera Vergului, now a children's hospital, was renamed in honor of its late founder.[5][50] Two years later, the high school in V\u00e2nju Mare became \"Victor Gomoiu Theoretical High School\".[5][51] His memoirs, recovered from the secret archives of the Securitate, were only published in 2006.[5] A street in Craiova is named after him.", "63770026": "Harald E.

Wells' novel Things to Come, released in 1936.[5][7] At the outbreak of World War II, she was 12 years old and her family moved to their estate at Bodnant, North Wales.[5][6] During this time her education was interrupted, so she pursued solitary education through a correspondence course. She enjoyed writing mathematical puzzles, arithmetic, books, and educational pamphlets. At the age of 16 she returned to formal education and attended a private school at Longstowe Hall near Cambridge.[5]/nIn 1945 she was awarded a scholarship for the next year at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford.[5] Her first two years were spent studying Honours Moderations in zoology, physics and mathematics, and her next two years were spent pursuing a course of study in zoology.

McLaren would later take up research on fertility in mice, including superovulation and superpregnancy.[8] In 1958, she published a landmark Nature paper with John D. Biggers reporting the first successful development and birth of mice embryos that were first recovered from naturally fertilized females at the 8\u201316 cells stage, then cultured in vitro for two days until the blastocyst stage, and finally transferred back to females' uterus until birth.[9] This paper, \"Successful Development and Birth of Mice cultivated in vitro as Early Embryos\", has been called \"one of the most significant papers in the history of reproductive biology and medicine\".[10] This was a highly productive time in her life and she contributed to 28 papers.[5]/nDuring this period, she had three children:/nThe marriage ended in divorce in 1959, and McLaren moved to the Institute of Animal Genetics at the University of Edinburgh to continue her research. The couple remained on good terms; Michie also moved to Edinburgh. The experience of raising children as a single career parent made McLaren a strong advocate for government assistance towards childcare.[8][6]/nMcLaren spent the next 15 years (1959\u20131974) at the Institute of Animal Genetics, studying fertility, development and epigenetics, including the development of mouse embryonic transfer, immunocontraception, and the skeletal characteristics of chimerae.[8][6] She published a highly renowned book on Chimaeras in 1976,[11] receiving her first major award that same year.

He is considered to be a main founder of zoology and anthropology as comparative, scientific disciplines.[3] He has been called the \"founder of racial classifications.\"[4]/nHe was one of the first to explore the study of the human being as an aspect of natural history. His teachings in comparative anatomy were applied to his classification of human races, of which he claimed there were five, Caucasian, Mongolian, Malayan, Ethiopian, and American.[5] He was a member of what modern historians call the G\u00f6ttingen school of history./nHe is considered a pivotal figure in the development of physical anthropology.[4] Blumenbach's peers considered him one of the great theorists of his day, and he was a mentor or influence on many of the next generation of German biologists, including Alexander von Humboldt.[6]/nBlumenbach was born at his family house in Gotha.[7] His father was Heinrich Blumenbach, a local school headmaster; his mother was Charlotte Eleonore Hedwig Buddeus.[8] He was born into a well-connected family of academics.[7]/nBlumenbach was educated at the Illustrious Gymnasium in Gotha before studying medicine, first at Jena and then at G\u00f6ttingen. He was recognized as a prodigy by the age sixteen in 1768.[7] He graduated from the latter in 1775 with his M.D. thesis De generis humani varietate nativa (On the Natural Variety of Mankind, University of G\u00f6ttingen, which was first published in 1775, then re-issued with changes to the titlepage in 1776). It is considered one of the most influential works in the development of subsequent human race concepts.[9][10] It contained the germ of the craniological research to which so many of his subsequent inquiries were directed.[11]/nBlumenbach was appointed extraordinary professor of medicine and inspector of the museum of natural history in G\u00f6ttingen in 1776 and ordinary professor in 1778.[10] His contributions soon began to enrich the pages of the Medicinische Bibliothek, of which he was editor from 1780 to 1794, with various contributions on medicine, physiology, and anatomy. In physiology, he was of the school of Albrecht von Haller, and was in the habit of illustrating his theory by a careful comparison of the animal functions of man with those of other animals.[11] Following Georges Cuvier's identification, Blumenbach gave the woolly mammoth its first scientific name, Elephas primigenius (first-born elephant), in 1799./nHis reputation was much extended by the publication of his Institutiones Physiologicae (1787), a condensed, well-arranged view of the animal functions, expounded without discussion of minute anatomical details. Between its first publication and 1821, it went through many editions in Germany, where it was the general textbook of the science of physiology. It was translated into English in America by Charles Caldwell (Philadelphia 1798), and in London by John Elliotson (1807).[11]/nHe was perhaps still more extensively known by his Handbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie (\"Handbook of comparative anatomy\"), which passed through numerous German editions from its appearance in 1805 to 1824. It was translated into English in 1809 by the surgeon William Lawrence, and again, with improvements and additions, by William Coulson in 1827. This manual, though slighter than the subsequent works of Cuvier, Carus, and others, and not to be compared with such later expositions as that of Gegenbaur, was long esteemed for the accuracy of the author's own observations, and his just appreciation of the labors of his predecessors.[11]\nAlthough the greatest part of Blumenbach's life was passed at G\u00f6ttingen, in 1789 he visited Switzerland, and gave a curious medical topography of that country in the Bibliothek. He was in England in 1788 and 1792. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1793[12] and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1794.[13] In 1798, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.[14] He became a correspondent, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1808. This was changed to associated member in 1827.[15] He was then appointed secretary to the Royal Society of Sciences in 1812, elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1813, appointed physician to the royal family in Hanover (German: Obermedizinalrat) by the prince regent in 1816, made a knight-commander of the Guelphic Order in 1821, and elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1831. In celebration of his doctoral jubilee (1825), traveling scholarships were founded to assist talented young physicians and naturalists. He retired in 1935. Blumenbach died in 1840 in G\u00f6ttingen, where he is buried in the Albani cemetery.[10][11]/nBlumenbach explored the biodiversity of humans mainly by comparing skull anatomy and skin color. His work included a description of sixty human crania (skulls) published originally in fascicules as Decas craniorum (G\u00f6ttingen, 1790\u20131828). This was a founding work for other scientists in the field of craniometry. He established a five-part naming system in 1795 to describe what he called generis humani varietates quinae principes, species vero unica (five principal varieties of humankind, but one species). In his view, humans could be divided into varieties (only in his later work he adopted the term \"races\", which had been introduced by others) but he was aware that a clear separation was difficult:/nAll national differences in the form and colour of the human body [. . .] run so insensibly, by so many shades and transitions one into the other, that it is impossible to separate them by any but very arbitrary limits.[16]/nBlumenbach's classification of the single human species into five varieties (later called \"races\") (1793/1795):/nBlumenbach assumed that all morphological differences between the varieties were induced by the climate and the way of living and he emphasized that the differences in morphology were so small, gradual and transiently connected that it was not possible to separate these varieties clearly.[16] He also noted that skin color was unsuitable for distinguishing varieties. He placed the Caucasian form in the center of his description as being the most beautiful and the most \"primitive\" or \"primeval\" one from which the other forms \"degenerated\". In the 18th century, however, these terms did not have the negative connotations they possess today. At the time, \"primitive\" or \"primeval\" described the ancestral form, while \"degeneration\" was understood to be the process of change leading to a variety adapted to a new environment by being exposed to a different climate and diet.[16] Hence, he argued that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., depended on geography, diet, and mannerism. Further anatomical study led him to the conclusion that \"individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other Africans as from Europeans\".[16]/nLike other monogenists such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Blumenbach held to the \"degenerative hypothesis\" of racial origins. Blumenbach claimed that Adam and Eve were Caucasian inhabitants of Asia,[18] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors such as the sun and poor diet. Thus, he claimed, Negroid pigmentation arose because of the result of the heat of the tropical sun, while the cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos, and the Chinese were fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns protected from environmental factors. He believed that the degeneration could be reversed in a proper environmental control and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.[19]/nMoreover, he concluded that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind \"concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities\":[20]/nFinally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage nation known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the Negro.[21]/nHe did not consider his \"degenerative hypothesis\" as racist and sharply criticized Christoph Meiners, an early practitioner of scientific racialism, as well as Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmerring, who concluded from autopsies that Africans were an inferior race.[22] Blumenbach wrote three other essays stating non-white peoples were capable of excelling in arts and sciences in reaction against racialists of his time.[23] At his time, Blumenbach was perceived as anti-racist and he strongly opposed the practice of slavery and the belief of the inherent savagery of the coloured races.[24]/nAlexander von Humboldt wrote on his and Blumenbach's view: \"While we maintain the unity of the human species, we at the same time repel the depressing assumption of superior and inferior races\".[25]/nHowever, selected parts of his views were later used by others to encourage scientific racism.[26][16]/nIn his dissertation, Blumenbach mentioned the name Simia troglodytes in connection with a short description for the common chimpanzee. This dissertation was printed and appeared in September 1775, but only for internal use in the University of G\u00f6ttingen and not for providing a public record. The public print of his dissertation appeared in 1776.[27] Blumenbach knew that Carl Linnaeus had already established a name Homo troglodytes for a badly known primate, and in 1779 he discussed this Linnean name and concluded correctly that Linnaeus had been dealing with two species, a human and an orangutan, neither of which was a chimpanzee, and that by consequence the name Homo troglodytes could not be used. Blumenbach was one of the first scientists to understand the identities of the different species of primates, which were (excluding humans) orangutans and chimpanzees. (Gorillas were not known to Europeans at this time). In Opinion 1368 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) decided in 1985 that Blumenbach's view should be followed, and that his Simia troglodytes as published by Blumenbach in 1779 shall be the type species of the genus Pan and, since it was the oldest available name for the common chimpanzee, be used for this species.[28] However, the commission did not know that Blumenbach had already mentioned this name in his dissertation. Following the rules of the ICZN Code the scientific name of one of the most well-known African animals, currently known as Pan troglodytes, must carry Blumenbach's name combined with the date 1776.[29]/nBlumenbach shortly afterward wrote a manual of natural history entitled Handbuch der Naturgeschichte; 12 editions and some translations. It was published first in G\u00f6ttingen by J. C. Dieterich in 1779/1780. He was also one of the first scientists to study the anatomy of the platypus, assigning the scientific name Ornithorhynchus paradoxus to the animal, being unaware George Shaw had already given it the name Platypus anatinus. However, Platypus had already been shown to be used for the scientific name for a genus of Ambrosia beetles so Blumenbach's scientific name for the genus was used.[30]/nBlumenbach made many contributions to the scientific debates of the last half of the 18th century regarding evolution and creation. His central contribution was in the conception of a vis formativus or Bildungstrieb, an inborn force within an organism that led it to create, maintain, and repair its shape.[31]/nEnlightenment science and philosophy essentially held a static view of nature and man, but vital nature continued to interrupt this view, and the issue of life, the creation of life and its varieties, increasingly occupied attention and \"starting in the 1740s the concept of vital power reentered the scene of generation ... there must be some 'productive power' in nature that enabled unorganized material to generate new living forms.\"[32]/nGeorges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon wrote an influential work in 1749, Natural History, that revived interest in vital nature. Buffon held that there were certain penetrating powers which organised the organic particles that made up the living organism. Erasmus Darwin translated Buffon's idea of organic particles into \"molecules with formative propensities\" and in Germany Buffon's idea of an internal order, moule interieur arising out of the action of the penetrating powers was translated into German as Kraft (power).[32]/nThe German term for vital power or living power, Lebenskraft, as distinct from chemical or physical forces, first appeared with Medicus's on the Lebenskraft (1774).[32] Scientists were now forced to consider hidden and mysterious powers of and in living matter that resisted physical laws \u2013 warm-blooded animals maintaining a consistent temperature despite changing outside temperatures, for example./nIn 1759, Caspar Friedrich Wolff, a German embryologist provided evidence for the ancient idea of epigenesis, that is preformed life, that is a chick out of unformed substance and his dispute with Albrecht von Haller brought the issue of life to the forefront of natural science and philosophy. Wolff identified an \"essential power\" (essentliche Kraft, or vis essentialis) that allowed structure to be a result of power, \"the very power through which, in the vegetable body, all those things which we describe as life are effected.\"[32]/nWhile Wolff was not concerned to name this vital organising, reproducing power, in 1780 Blumenbach posited a formative drive (nisus formativus or Bildungstrieb) responsible for biological \"procreation, nourishment, and reproduction\", as well as self-development and self-perfection on a cultural level.[33]/nBlumenbach held that all living organisms \"from man down to maggots, and from the cedar to common mould or mucor\", possess an inherent \"effort or tendency which, while life continues, is active and operative; in the first instance to attain the definite form of the species, then to preserve it entire, and, when it is infringed upon, so far as this is possible, to restore it.\" This power of vitality is \"not referable to any qualities merely physical, chemical, or mechanical.\"[32]/nBlumenbach compared the uncertainty about the origin and ultimate nature of the formative drive to similar uncertainties about gravitational attraction: \"just in the same way as we use the name of attraction or gravity to denote certain forces, the causes of which however still remain hid, as they say, in Cimmerian darkness, the formative force (nisus formativus) can explain the generation of animals.\"[32]/nAt the same time, befitting the central idea of the science and medicine of dynamic polarity, it was also the physiological functional identity of what theorists of society or mind called \"aspiration\". Blumenbach's Bildungstrieb found quick passage into evolutionary theorizing of the decade following its formulation and in the thinking of the German natural philosophers.[34]/nOne of Blumenbach's contemporaries, Samuel Hahnemann, undertook to study in detail how this generative, reproductive and creative power, which he termed the Erzeugungskraft of the Lebenskraft of living power of the organism, could be negatively affected by inimical agents to engender disease./nKant is said by several modern authors to have relied on Blumenbach's biological concept of formative power in developing his idea of organic purpose.[32][35]\nKant wrote to Blumenbach in 1790 to praise his concept of the formative force (Bildungstrieb). However, whereas Kant had a heuristic concept in mind, to explain mechanical causes, Blumenbach conceived of a cause fully resident in nature. From this he would argue that the Bildungstrieb was central to the creation of new species. Though Blumenbach left no overt indications of sources for his theory of biological revolution, his ideas harmonize with those of Charles Bonnet and especially with those of his contemporary Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803), and it was Herder whose ideas were influenced by Blumenbach.\nBlumenbach continued to refine the concept in his De nisu formativo et generationis negotio ('On the Formative Drive and the Operation of Generation', 1787) and in the second edition (1788) of the Handbuch der Naturgeschichte: 'it is a proper force (eigentliche Kraft), whose undeniable existence and extensive effects are apparent throughout the whole of nature and revealed by experience'.[36] He consolidated these in the second edition of \u00dcber den Bildungstrieb./nBlumenbach had initially been an advocate of Haller's view, in contrast to those of Wolff, that the essential elements of the embryo were already in the egg, he later sided with Wolff. Blumenbach provided evidence for the actual existence of this formative force, to distinguish it from other, merely nominal terms./nThe way in which the Bildungstrieb differed, perhaps, from other such forces was in its comprehensive architectonic character: it directed the formation of anatomical structures and the operations of physiological processes of the organism so that various parts would come into existence and function interactively to achieve the ends of the species.[36]/nBlumenbach was regarded as a leading light of German science by his contemporaries. Kant and Friedrich Schelling both called him \"one of the most profound biological theorists of the modern era.[37] In the words of science historian Peter Watson, \"roughly half the German biologists during the early nineteenth century studied under him or were inspired by him: Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Friedrich Kielmeyer, Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, Heinrich Friedrich Link, Johann Friedrich Meckel, Johannes Illiger, and Rudolph Wagner.\"[38]", "63901259": "Esta Sterneck is an Austrian molecular biologist researching the functions of the C/EBP\u03b4][CEBPD transcription factor as tumor suppressor as well as tumor promoter in breast epithelial cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment.

LaRoche was appointed a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Marine Microbial Genomics and Biogeochemistry, and her husband was appointed the University's Canada Excellence Research Chair.[5] Upon her return, she developed a lab to research how global climate change is affecting marine microbes and biochemical processes.[6] She specifically studied how phytoplankton and marine bacteria are affected by increases in temperature and decreases in pH.[7] In 2016, she received $149,900 in funding for her plankton research project, which allowed her to purchase a holographic microscope for a commercial ship she uses to study the Deep Panuke drilling station.[8] Previously, her team had only been able to analyze sample of water twice a year until The Atlantic Canadian company voluntarily provided the lab with free access on the Atlantic Condor.[9] The next year, she partnered with Canada C3, a 150-day expedition along the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific coasts, to collect and share data.[10]/nIn 2019, LaRoche was renewed as a Canada Research Chair.[11]", "1838677": "Massimo Pigliucci (Italian: [\u02c8massimo pi\u028e\u02c8\u028eutt\u0283i]; born January 16, 1964)[1] is an Italian-American philosopher and biologist who is professor of philosophy at the City College of New York,[2] former co-host of the Rationally Speaking Podcast,[3] and former editor in chief for the online magazine Scientia Salon.[4] He is a critic of pseudoscience[5][6] and creationism,[7] and an advocate for secularism and science education.[8][9]/nPigliucci was born in Monrovia, Liberia, and raised in Rome, Italy.[1] He has a doctorate in genetics from the University of Ferrara, Italy, a PhD in biology from the University of Connecticut, and a PhD in philosophy of science from the University of Tennessee.[10] He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.[1]/nPigliucci was formerly a professor of ecology and evolution at Stony Brook University. He explored phenotypic plasticity, genotype\u2013environment interactions, natural selection, and the constraints imposed on natural selection by the genetic and developmental makeup of organisms.[11] In 1997, while working at the University of Tennessee, Pigliucci received the Theodosius Dobzhansky Prize,[12] awarded annually by the Society for the Study of Evolution[1] to recognize the accomplishments and future promise of an outstanding young evolutionary biologist. As a philosopher, Pigliucci is interested in the structure and foundations of evolutionary theory, the relationship between science and philosophy, and the relationship between science and religion.[10] He is a proponent of an extended evolutionary synthesis to unify parts of biology not covered by the \"modern synthesis\" of the 20th century.[13]/nPigliucci has written regularly for Skeptical Inquirer on topics such as climate change denial, intelligent design, pseudoscience, and philosophy.[14] He has also written for Philosophy Now and maintains a blog called \"Rationally Speaking\".[15] He has debated \"deniers of evolution\" (young-earth creationists and intelligent design proponents), including young earth creationists Duane Gish and Kent Hovind and intelligent design proponents William Dembski and Jonathan Wells, on many occasions.[7][16][17][18]/nHis latest podcast Stoic Meditations[19] consists of readings from the ancient Stoics, followed by his commentary to interpret the reading and put it into context.[20]/nPigliucci is an atheist,[21] but does not believe that science necessarily demands atheism, because of two distinctions: that between methodological naturalism and philosophical naturalism, and that between value judgements and matters of fact. He believes that many scientists and science educators fail to appreciate these differences.[9] Pigliucci has criticized New Atheist writers for embracing what he considers to be scientism (although he largely excludes philosopher Daniel Dennett from this charge).[22] In a discussion of his book Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to a More Meaningful Life, Pigliucci told  Skepticality podcast host Derek Colanduno, \"Aristotle was the first ancient thinker to really take seriously the idea that you need both empirical facts, you need an evidence-based approach to the world and you need to be able to reflect on the meaning of those facts... If you want answers to moral questions then you don't ask the neurobiologist, you don't ask the evolutionary biologist, you ask the philosopher.\"[23]/nPigliucci describes the mission of skeptics, referencing Carl Sagan's The Demon-Haunted World saying \"What skeptics are about is to keep that candle lit and spread it as much as possible\".[24] Pigliucci serves on the board of NYC Skeptics and on the advisory board of the Secular Coalition for America.[8]/nIn 1998, he debated William Lane Craig over the existence of God at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.[25] Also in 2001 he debated Craig about the same topic.[26]/nMassimo Pigliucci criticized the newspaper article by Pope Francis entitled, \"An open dialogue with non-believers\". Pigliucci viewed the article as a monologue rather than a dialogue and, in a response personally addressed to Pope Francis, wrote that the Pope only offered non-believers \"a reaffirmation of entirely unsubstantiated fantasies about God and his Son...followed by a confusion between the concept of love and truth, the whole peppered by a significant amount of historical revisionism and downright denial of the ugliest facets of your Church.\"[27]/nPigliucci became a popularizer of Stoicism and one of the driving forces in Stoicism's resurgence in the United States in the early twenty-first century. His 2015 essay for The New York Times on the topic was one of the most shared articles to date.[28] Pigliucci said he always felt Stoicism was part of his Italian heritage, but he came to practice it after being disenchanted with Buddhism, though he finds both schools of thought to share similarities./nI actually tried to study Buddhism for a bit, but the parts I managed to get exposed to felt too alien, couched in cultural, linguistic, and conceptual terms that did not resonate with me. By contrast, when I picked up Epictetus, or Marcus, or Seneca, I immediately felt at home.[29]/nIn 2021 Pigliucci announced[30] a shift of interest away from Stoicism and towards, as he said, \"a new synthesis, something that I have called Neoskepticism, and which uses the combined insights of the ancient Skeptics and Stoics to craft a better way to think about and especially live one\u2019s life.\"/nPigliucci has criticized David Chalmers' hard problem of consciousness, and he similarly is a critic of panpsychism. While he is a realist about consciousness, he thinks that claiming there is a distinction between the so called hard and easy problems of consciousness is a category error.[31]/nIn August 2000 Pigliucci started a monthly internet column called Rationally Speaking. In August 2005, the column became a blog,[32] where he wrote posts until March 2014.[33] Starting in February 2010, he co-hosted the bi-weekly Rationally Speaking podcast with Julia Galef, whom he first met at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism, held in September 2009.[34] The podcast is produced by the New York City Skeptics. The show has had many guests\u2014scientists, philosophers\u2014discussing matters of reason, skepticism and rationality. In 2010, Neil DeGrasse Tyson explained on the show his justification for spending large amounts of government money on space programs. He eventually printed the transcript of his performance as a guest on the show in his book Space Chronicles as a full chapter covering eight pages.[35] Another episode in which Tyson explained his position on the label \"atheism\" received attention on NPR.[36] Pigliucci left the podcast in 2015 to pursue his other interests. Galef continued to host the podcast solo.[37]/nThe following are a select few of Pigliucci's articles.

Holt (17 October 1864 \u2013 10 June 1922) was an English marine naturalist and biologist who specialized in ichthyology, the study of fish. His work helped lay a scientific foundation for the fishery management in Ireland, and together with William Spotswood Green, he strongly influenced the development of the Irish Fisheries in its early years./nHolt was born in London and was educated at Eton, where he won a prize in biology. After school, he decided on a career in the British Army, enrolling at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and after completing his officer training was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. He participated in the Nile Campaign (1884\u201385) and then in the Third Burmese War of 1886\u201387. During that latter campaign, he fell sick and was invalided home. Back in civilian life, Holt began studying zoology at the University of St. Andrews in 1888./nTwo years later, he participated as assistant-naturalist in a fishery survey on the west coast of Ireland, organized by the Royal Dublin Society. This expedition was led by William Spotswood Green, with whom Holt would work together for much of his later career. That survey made Holt's name as an ichthyologist; he published not only several papers on the eggs and the early larval stages of fish but also wrote the general report of the expedition. As a result of Green's and Holt's work, the government instituted a formal program of fishery surveys under the auspice of the newly formed Congested Districts Board in 1892. Green became the board's Chief Inspector of Fisheries, while Holt participated as a scientific advisor, although he would leave Ireland for a few years./nHolt joined the Marine Biological Association (MBA) and worked until 1894 at Grimsby, where he was in charge of a newly opened research station for the North Sea. After a brief stint at the Station zoologique d'Endoume at Marseille he then worked for three years at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory. Nevertheless, E. W. L. Holt maintained his ties with Ireland, and in 1895 he purchased a dismasted brigantine named Saturn for the Royal Dublin Society and had it equipped as a marine biology research station. In 1899, he returned to Ireland, taking charge of the Saturn and her four small auxiliary sailing boats used for sampling. The floating laboratory was stationed in the Connemara district in County Galway; it lay at Ballynakill in winter and was towed to Inishbofin for the summer months. In 1900, the Saturn was transferred to the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland. Green became Chief Inspector of its Fisheries Branch; Holt was at first scientific advisor and later, as of 1908, Fisheries Inspector. They were joined by other young biologists, among them Rowland Southern and George Philip Farrar./nWith the department's research and fisheries protection vessel Helga they continued their surveys of the west coast of Ireland. In 1908, the ship was replaced by a new one, the Helga II, which was built to the specifications of Green and Holt. With Holt's backing, the new ship participated in the Clare Island Survey of 1909\u20131911. When that was completed, the Helga II returned to her regular fisheries research and protection duties under the direction of Holt./nWhen Green retired in 1914, Holt succeeded him as Chief Inspector. Scientific work was stopped when World War I broke out, and the administrative duties of his post did not allow Holt to continue research work of his own. After the war, the political changes in Ireland as well as Holt's failing health prevented further serious research. In May 1922, Holt became seriously ill and left Dublin for London, where he died on 10 June that year of Bright's disease (an old term for glomerulonephritis, a kidney disease). In 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food (MAFF) put into service a research vessel named after him.", "54431332": "Mariya Yakovlevna Zerova, alternately Marija Jakovlevna Zerova, (Ukrainian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0456\u044f \u042f\u043a\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430; April 7, 1902 \u2013 July 21, 1994) was a Ukrainian biologist and taxonomist known for her work in mycology.[1]/nHer research included work on ectrotrophic mycorrhiza and fungal diseases of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and beet (Beta sp).

The specimens that she collected during this work are now kept in the National Herbarium of Ukraine within the Institute of Botany./nLater, in the 1960s, she worked on fungal classification including of the genera Inocybe and Dacryomstra. She applied the newly available technology of scanning electron microscopy in this research. She led research on increasing the number of fungal species harvested for human food, including developing cultivation methods for more species. These cultivation strategies were considered more important after the realisation that wild fungal fruiting bodies could accumulate heavy metals and radioactive isotopes from the soil.

He compiled a 12\u201313\u20134 record in football./nFaber was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on January 13, 1903, and attended Central High School in Washington, D.C.[1] He then went on to college at the University of Maryland, where he played on the Maryland lacrosse team, earning letters in 1926 and 1927,[2] and the basketball team, earning letters from 1924 to 1927.[3] The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) named Faber an honorable mention All-American as an inside attackman in 1926 and a third-team All-American at the out home position in 1927.[4]/nFrom the University of Maryland, Faber earned a B.S. in 1926, a M.S. in 1928, and a Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1937.[5] In 1945, he was appointed the head of his alma mater's Department of Microbiology, a position he held for 18 years.[6][7] During World War II, Faber joined the United States Army and served from 1942 to 1946, attaining the rank of major.[1] He spent three years working at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.[6]/nWhile teaching bacteriology at Maryland, Faber also held coaching duties.[6] He served as the head coach for the Maryland lacrosse team from 1928 to 1963.[7] During his tenure, Faber's lacrosse teams compiled a 249\u201357 record[7] and secured eight outright or shared USILA national championships and nine Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships.[6][8] From 1930 onward, Faber shared coaching duties with Albert Heagy,[9] with the former running the offense and the latter the defense.[10] In 1936, Faber led Maryland to capture the first Wingate Memorial Trophy, the national championship bestowed by the USILA. The following year, they shared the title with Princeton.[11] In the inaugural North-South Senior All-Star Game in 1940, Faber coached the South team, which lost to the North team coached by Princeton's William F. Logan, 6\u20135.[12] He also coached all-star teams in 1946 and 1956.[1] In 1955 and 1956, Faber led Maryland to back-to-back 11\u20130 seasons, with the only close matches coming against period powerhouse Navy, in 1955, and the highly successful Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, 12\u201311 in 1956.[13] In 1959, Maryland finished with a 10\u20131 mark as USILA co-champions alongside Army and Johns Hopkins, and Faber was named the USILA Coach of the Year.[14]/nFaber also served on the football staff. He became the assistant field coach under Curly Byrd in 1933.[15] Byrd was able to devote less time to the team because of his duties as university vice president.[15][16] In 1930, Faber enticed Bosey Berger, Maryland's first basketball All-American, to join the football team with the promise of free late night dining hall meals.[17] In 1935, Faber took over as head coach when Byrd was promoted to university president. Faber continued to employ his predecessor's pass-oriented \"Byrd system\" and hired Richmond head coach Frank Dobson as an assistant.[18] Despite facing \"an almost suicidal schedule\",[19] Faber's veteran team led by back Bill Guckeyson compiled a 7\u20132\u20132 record to finish in third place in the Southern Conference.[20] Faber was succeeded as head football coach by Dobson in 1936, but in turn, replaced him as a co-head coach alongside Al Heagy and Al Woods in 1940 and 1941.[20] Those teams finished with 2\u20136\u20131 and 3\u20135\u20131 records, respectively, to bring Faber's combined football coaching record to 12\u201313\u20134.[20] The coaching trio was subsequently replaced by Clark Shaughnessy, who two seasons prior had orchestrated a remarkable one-year turnaround at Stanford using a revolutionary version of the T formation.[21] Faber also spent time as an assistant basketball coach at Maryland,[22] and in 1932, filled in for head coach Burton Shipley who had fallen ill.[23] Faber served two terms as a president of the ACC.[6]/nHe retired from the University of Maryland in 1963 but continued teaching Epidemiology into the 1970s. Faber was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame that year and into the University of Maryland Athletic Hall of Fame in 1983.[24] He survived his wife of 62 years, Olyure n\u00e9e Hammack, who died in 1992. Faber died of pneumonia two years later on January 14, 1994, and was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.[6] The University of Maryland Alumni Association Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Faber in 2000.[8] In 2003, Maryland established the Faber Memorial Men's Lacrosse Scholarship Endowment Fund through the Maryland Educational Foundation, Inc. to award scholarships to men's lacrosse players.[25]/n# denotes interim/acting head coach", "4230791": "Howard Curtis Berg (March 16, 1934 \u2013 December 30, 2021)[2] was the Herchel Smith Professor of Physics and professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, where he taught biophysics and studied the motility of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli)./nBerg has been a member of the Harvard University department of molecular and cellular biology since 1986 and of the Harvard University department of physics since 1997.

During his undergraduate career, he pursued research projects, such as studying the use of medicinal plants among indigenous Central American communities with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI).[1] He then worked as a research assistant, with the support of an NIH Diversity Supplement, in Dr. Mariano Garc\u00eda-Blanco's laboratory at Duke University.[2] There, he studied how the architecture of the nucleus of the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii changes to affect cytoplasmic events, such as transcript localization.[3] He then stayed at Duke to pursue his PhD in the laboratory of cell biologist Sally Kornbluth. For his doctoral work, Col\u00f3n-Ramos studied the molecular mechanisms underlying programmed cell death, or apoptosis, and identified a viral family of proteins that induce apoptosis, which are similar to the so-called \"Reaper\" proteins first identified in fruit flies.[4] He also found that these proteins operate by regulating protein translation, directly binding to the ribosomes\u2014which are the cellular machinery that translate RNA messages into protein products\u2014to alter their assembly.[5] He completed his dissertation \"The reaper tales: molecular mechanism of inhibition of translation and induction of apoptosis by a novel family of reaper-like proteins\" in 2003.[6] He dedicated his thesis dissertation \"To those who could have done a better job than I, but never received the opportunities...may they (one day) receive the opportunities to share their knowledge and their skills in a society w/o prejudices\"./nFollowing his PhD, Col\u00f3n-Ramos moved to California in 2004 to pursue a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscientist Kang Shen's  laboratory as a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation fellow, with the additional support of a National Institutes of Health \"Pathways to Independence\" award.[7] There, he shifted his research focus to studying the developmental neurobiology of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To understand how synapses are established and modified to form memories over the course of the worm's life, he established a system to track synapses over the worms development using cellular markers. Using this system, he found that glial cells provide a roadmap for these connections to be made through the signaling molecule netrin.[8]/nIn 2008, Col\u00f3n-Ramos became an assistant professor at Yale University School of Medicine. In 2013, he was promoted to associate professor, and in 2019 to full professor.  His research centers on the underlying mechanisms that allow animals to form memories. Specifically, his research group studies how connections between neurons, otherwise known as the synapses, are precisely made to build the right neuronal architecture, how they are maintained and how they are modified to code a particular behavior or memory. To understand how neurons find and connect to each other in the right way, his group uses the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system.[9] His laboratory has developed genetic screens to identify pathways through which synapses are formed, as well as techniques to re-route how pathways are formed by manipulating single cells to track how those changes influence behavior.[1]/nIn collaboration with William A.

To accomplish this, we have developed what is now called the \"quick-freeze, deep-etch\" technique for electron microscopy and have disseminated the equipment and procedures needed to carry out this technique throughout the field. Currently, we use \"quick-freezing\" to capture several different cellular processes that are unusually fleeting, including membrane budding and fusion, synaptic vesicle discharge during neural transmission, movement of cilia and flagella on vertebrate and protozoal cells, and muscle contraction. In each case, our aim has been to visualize the underlying molecular mechanisms occurring. We also use \"deep-etching\" to visualize molecules adsorbed to inert substrates in order to study mechanisms of macromolecular assembly and disassembly in various processes, including remodeling of cytoskeletons, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, cell-to-cell recognition, and the formation of extracellular matrices.\"[citation needed]", "36507313": "Daniel T.

His laboratory has shed new light on the strategy utilized by DNA polymerases to prevent ribonucleotide incorporation (NAR, 2019, 47:10693). In 2018, his laboratory showed that pyrophosphate hydrolysis is an intrinsic and critical step in the DNA synthesis reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerases and this discovery was accorded breakthrough status by the journal Nucleic Acids Chemistry (NAR, 2018, 46:5875). Regarding the piggyBac transposase, his laboratory has shown that the dimerization through the Ring Finger Domain present at the C-terminus attenuates the excision activity of this enzyme (Biochemistry, 2018, 57:2913).  He has discovered the mechanism employed by DNA polymerase IV to rescue replication stalled at damaged nucleotides with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy (Structure, 2014, 23:56\u201367). Nair has provided insight into how specialized DNA polymerases that participate in adaptive mutagenesis ensure achieve function (Nucleic Acids Research, 2013, 41:5104\u20135014; Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2012 68:960-7, J Nucleic Acids. 2012:285481). His laboratory has shown how GTP binding to the viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase ensures accurate initiation of replication of the viral genome (Nucleic Acids Research, 2014, 42:2758\u20132573). In addition, he has shown that reactive oxygen species do play an important role in the antimicrobial activity of bactericidal antibiotics (Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2016 55:2397-400). In collaboration with D. N. Rao (Department of Biochemistry, IISc), his laboratory has also contributed towards understanding how proteins involved in the post-replicative repair of DNA mismatches function (Nucleic Acids Research, 2018, 46:256\u2013266; PLoS One. 2010, 5:e13726). His laboratory has shown that the proofreading domain of the Pfprex DNA polymerase from Plasmodium falciparum is capable of removing misincorporated oxidized nucleotides from the primer (Sci Rep. 2020,10(1):11157) and translesion DNA synthesis past common oxidized template nucleotides (FEBS J., 2022 289:5218). Recently his laboratory has helped in the characterization of a monoclonal antibody that can neutralize different Variants-of-Concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (PLoS Pathog., 2022,18(12):e1010994). Using computational tools his laboratory has also identified possible inhibitors of the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (IUBMB Life., 2020, 72:2112) and proofreading exoribonuclease from SARS-CoV-2 (Int J Biol Macromol.,2021,168:272). His laboratory also provided the structure of P4A2, a broadly neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb, in complex with the Receptor-Binding-Domain of the Spike protein (Plos Path. 2022,e1010994) So far, he has been centrally involved in the deposition of 76 entries in the protein data bank, which is a repository of three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules./nAs a post-doctoral fellow (Dec 2001\u2013 July 2007) he focused on understanding the structural basis of DNA lesion bypass by eukaryotic Y-family DNA polymerases using X-ray crystallography. Due to the action of a variety of agents, lesions are formed on DNA which interferes with normal replication and may also prove carcinogenic. Eukaryotes possess up to four specialized DNA polymerases that are able to synthesize DNA across these lesions and thus prevent the replication fork from stalling. Nair determined the crystal structure of the catalytic cores of two such polymerases, human DNA polymerase iota (hPol\u03b9) and yeast REV1 (yREV1) \u2013in complex with DNA and incoming nucleotide. The structures of hPol\u03b9 and yRev1 in complex with undamaged and damaged DNA has shown that these two polymerases prefer altered modes of base-pairing in the active site to facilitate lesion bypass (Nature, 2004, 430:377; Science, 2005, 309:2219; Structure, 2005, 13:1569; Structure, 2006, 14:749; Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol., 2006, 13:619; Structure, 2008, 16:239; Structure, 2009, 17:530). Both hPol\u03b9 and yREV1 have unique active sites that facilitate the formation of non-Watson-Crick base pairs to achieve lesion bypass and rescue stalled replication. He also played a role in the determination of the structure of a third Y-family polymerase human DNA Polymerase kappa in its functional state (Mol. Cell, 2007, 25:601).  In addition, he also participated in projects aimed at understanding the nature of interactions between the translational regulator Pumilio and non-cognate RNA targets (Structure, 2008, 16:549) and discerning the preference of hPol\u03b9 for incorporating dGTP when the base of the templating nucleotide is thymine (Structure, 2009, 17:974)./nHis doctoral thesis (July 1996 \u2013 Dec 2001) describes the crystallographic analysis of a panel of three murine monoclonal antibodies raised against the same promiscuous peptide antigen PS1 (HQLDPAFGANSTNPD). (J Immunol, 2000, 165:6949; J. Immunol, 2002, 168:2371). The comparison of the structure of the antibodies in their bound and unbound state suggests there could be a convergence of both epitope and paratope conformations in an antibody response against a flexible immunodominant epitope (J. Immunol, 2002, 168:2371). He also carried out a computational analysis of the conformational propensities of native and retro-inverso versions of B-cell and T-cell epitopes (J. Immunol, 2003, 170:1362). This study showed that conformational and functional mimicry can be achieved through retro-inversion only if the native peptide is present in a linear extended conformation in its functional state. He was also involved in the structure determination of an antibacterial protein from tasar silkworm Antheraea mylitta (J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276:41377). In addition, he modeled the complex of the ribonuclease restriction and its rRNA substrate (Biochemistry, 2001, 40:9115)./nDeepak T.

He was the inventor of a unique treatment for the healing of pressure ulcers and other severe wounds that do not respond to conventional treatments.  Before the creation of the state of Israel, he was a commander in Irgun, the Zionist paramilitary group also known as \"Etzel\".  He was the founder and the first commander of the Israeli Air Force's first airborne military medical evacuation unit, the founder and first president of the Israeli Association for Electron Microscopy, director of the Gerontology Center at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Health.[1]/nDavid Danon was born in 1921 to Regina and Moshe Danon in Pazardzhik (Bulgarian: \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a, also spelled as Pazardjik or Pazarjik), Bulgaria. David's parents were doctors: his mother was a gynecologist and his father was a family physician. His parents were Zionists and in 1924 they immigrated with three children (Nora, David and Ida) and settled in the Jaffa section of Tel Aviv./nImmediately after graduation from high school, David Danon joined the Irgun (Etzel) and his nom de guerre was \"Ehud\".[2][3]  He joined the Irgun together with his two classmates and close boyhood friends Amichai Paglin (who was later to become the Chief Operations Officer of the Irgun, Prime Minister Menachem Begin's counter-terrorism advisor, and Prime Minister Begin's Ambassador to the United States) and Eliyahu Bet-Zuri (who later joined the more militant Lehi, and was executed in Egypt for the assassination of Lord Moyne).[4] Over time, as a member of the Irgun, David Danon was appointed a commander in the punch units. With the declaration of rebellion against the British Mandate by Menachem Begin, Danon participated in several of the first attacks against British government targets, and was sent to Beirut to try to obtain weapons. During what was then dubbed The Hunting Season (the Saison), as was proclaimed by the Haganah, he was arrested based on information obtained by an informant, taken to jail in Jaffa, and later sent to detention in Latrun. Seven month later, David's father succeeded in negotiating his release from the British by promising to register David as a medical student at the University of Geneva Medical School (where David's father had professional connections) and by committing to the British that David would not return to Palestine for the duration of the British Mandate. Per agreement with the British, David traveled to Geneva by ship within one or two days of his release from Latrun and began his medical studies. By the end of 1947, however, he postponed his medical studies and returned to Irgun activity, seeking out and collecting weapons in France to be sent to Irgun fighters in Palestine.  He did so primarily by obtaining weapons left over from World War II from sympathetic former members of the French Resistance.  Having collected the needed arms, he prepared to send them from France to the Irgun on the ill-fated ship, the \"Altalena\", which departed for the newly created state of Israel, then in the midst of its War of Independence. While David remained in exile in Geneva to continue his studies, several of his Irgun friends and compatriots were either injured or killed when Israeli forces clashed with Irgun fighters from the Altalena and ultimately shelled the ship.  Later, David was sent to ][Tunis\\\\ to organize self-defense among the Tunisian Jewish community./nDavid Danon arrived at Medical School of University of Geneva on December 31, 1946 late in the first semester pursuant to the agreement between his father and the British Mandate authorities, essentially exiling him from Palestine for the duration of the British Mandate.  He arrived without any knowledge of the French language.[5] Despite his late start in his first year of medical school and his having to learn the French language, he excelled.  During his second year in medical school he began to do research.  His research was published in the scientific literature between the years 1948 and 1950.[6][7] \nOne of his Important projects was the study of the structure of the human nervous system. The use of conventional microscopes for this work was an obstacle due to the limited resolution capability of the common optical microscope. In order to facilitate the use of the more sophisticated electron microscope it was necessary to cut thinner slices of tissue.  Thus, David Danon developed the Microtome (a device for cutting extremely thin slices of tissue) for use on the electron microscope.  The University of Geneva recognized David for his development of this innovative device by awarding him the \"best dissertation\" award./nFollowing the 1948 declaration of the State of Israel and following the completion of his medical studies, in 1953 David returned to Israel and began his mandatory military service in the Israeli Air Force. In 1954, Dan Tolkowsky (the commander of the Israeli Air Force at that time) ordered David to establish the airborne medical evacuation unit and appointed him first commander of the unit.[8]  In later years, David participated in the airborne evacuation of Israeli military casualties during the Suez Crisis (1956), the Six-Day War (1967), the War of Attrition (1967\u20131970) and the Yom Kippur War (1973).  During the War of Attrition, he developed a unique device for checking the cardiac activity of the wounded on the field of battle, permitting medical personnel in the field to determine whether an injured soldier was still alive.  Immediately after the Yom Kippur War, David canceled a planned sabbatical year in the United States and enlisted instead in the Israeli Air Force for one year of service, to assist in improving the capacity of the airborne medical evacuation unit.  In 1978, he was recognized by the Israeli Air Force for his commitment to the Air Force medical unit and for all the above-mentioned activities./nWhile David was still serving in the Air Force, Prof. Aharon Katzir from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, asked David to rebuild the Institute's electron microscope which had been damaged while researchers tried to activate it. For a few months, David was working as a military doctor during the day and at the Weizmann Institute of Science at night.  In 1955, upon his completion of military service, he began working in the Department of Polymers of the Weizmann Institute. In addition to restoring the function of the electron microscope, he developed and prepared the microtome[9] and other devices necessary for the operation of the electron microscope. Later he founded the Electron Microscopy Laboratory at the Weizmann Institute. His pearly research in the Institute's Electron Microscopy Laboratory involved the membrane structure of erythrocytes, their adherence and thrombocytes.[10] In 1957, while working at the Weizmann Institute David Danon founded with Dr. Kalman the Department of Physiology and Anatomy of Animals, at the Faculty of Agriculture in Rehovot where he taught until 1962. His research during this period continued to focus on erythrocytes and thrombocytes, as well as the interaction between these cells and the influenza virus.  In 1964 he was appointed head of the Section for Biological Ultrastructure at the Weizmann Institute.  In 1967 he was assigned the title of \"professor of biology.\"  Prof. Danon was the founder and first President of the Israeli Society for Electron Microscopy and President of the Israeli Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion. At this time he developed and built Fragiligraph,  \u2013 a device that enables automatic registration of osmotic fragility curve of erythrocytes, later produced by \"Elron\".\n. In later years, Prof. Danon became interested in the process of aging of erythrocytes, and joined the Israeli Association of Gerontology.  In 1975 he was elected president of the International Association of Gerontology, and was the first and only Israeli scientist to date to serve in this position (1975-1978).[11] Between the years 1978 to 1987, Prof. Danon served as the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Health.[12] In 1979, he was appointed director of the Center for Research on Aging at the Weizmann Institute, a position he held until his retirement from the Institute in 1987.[13] During a Sabbatical in geriatric medicine at Montefiore Hospital in New York in 1984-1985, he devoted major efforts to alleviating the suffering of patients with pressure ulcers. Between the years 1998 to 1991 he served as scientific advisor to the Israeli Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. Upon his retirement from Weizmann Institute, Prof. Danon was the director of the Waldenberg Gerontology Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana from 1987 to 1992. At that time while continuing his research on the healing of pressure ulcers, he discovered the critical role of macrophages (a special type of white blood cell) in wound healing.  He discovered that the injection of macrophages from young mice, accelerated the healing of wounds in old mice. From 1993 onwards Prof. Danon devoted himself entirely to the development of a unique, remarkably simple, yet new method for the treatment of severe wounds, based on the injection of \"activated\" macrophages.[14][15][16]  In this method, Macrophages were prepared from blood units of standard donated blood, using white blood cells that are typically considered undesirable in routine blood transfusions.  Macrophages were prepared from a blood unit in a closed sterile system that consisted of a number of interconnected plastic bags. According to the method developed by Prof. Danon, macrophages activation is done by the \"hypo-osmotic shock\" without any of the toxic materials usually used to activate cells. This work was carried out in the laboratories of Magen David Adom (the Israeli blood bank), and after many years of work the project was crowned with success.

He was also a published theatre historian and researcher, and, in particular, was an authority on the works of W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan who, as Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote 14 comic operas in the late Victorian era./nRees was born at Barry in Glamorgan, educated at the local county school, the University of Cardiff (1948\u20131952), and the University of London (1954\u20131957). He spent 1965 to 1967 as a Research Fellow at the Institute of Diseases of the Chest at Brompton in London, and between 1967 and 1981 he lectured in microbiology at The Institute of Laryngology and Otology at University College London.  Rees later resided in Powys and in Swansea, Wales. Rees was an avid researcher of theatrical topics, and his oft-cited 1978 book, Theatre Lighting in the Age of Gas, has been called \"(aptly) illuminating, and pleasantly non-technical.\"[1]/nAfter considerable research about Gilbert and Sullivan's first collaboration, Thespis, Rees developed, and in 1964 published, a version of the libretto for that work that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto, as part of his book Thespis \u2013 A Gilbert & Sullivan Enigma.[2] Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert's non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs.  A score was supplied by Garth Morton, based on music from lesser-known Sullivan operas, and this version was premiered in 1962 at the University of London and recorded in 1972.[3][4]/nRees collected a number of original Sullivan manuscripts, including the operas The Zoo, The Contrabandista, Haddon Hall, The Chieftain, and The Emerald Isle, and several major Sullivan orchestral pieces.[5] He purchased several of these at auction in 1966,[6] following the death of the widow of Arthur Sullivan's nephew Herbert Sullivan.[7] Herbert had inherited the scores on his uncle's death, and on his own death in 1928 they passed to his wife, who later remarried, becoming Mrs Elena M. Bashford.[8] She died in 1957.[9] Rees and David Russell Hulme worked together to save a number of autograph manuscripts of the composer Edward German.[10]/nThe Zoo is an 1875 one-act operetta by Arthur Sullivan and B. C. Stephenson, who wrote the libretto under the pseudonym Bolton Rowe. The score was believed lost until Rees located it in the 1950s in the vault at Coutts Bank, where several Sullivan manuscripts were stored. The discovery was particularly important, because Herbert Sullivan wrote in 1927 that his uncle re-used the music of The Zoo in the later operas, but this turned out to be false. After Herbert's widow died, Rees purchased the manuscript at the 1966 auction. He then arranged for a piano/vocal reduction of The Zoo to be published. Using Rees's materials, the operetta received its first modern production in 1971, was subsequently broadcast by the BBC and was recorded by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1978.[11] Rees also discovered the libretto to W. S. Gilbert's 1863 play Uncle Baby (Gilbert's first produced play), which he published in 1968, and in 1983 he found six of the original 1887 portraits from the original production of Ruddigore at the former Normansfield Hospital.[12] In 1977, Rees and Roderick Spencer published a collection of then-rarely heard Sullivan vocal selections, Sing With Sullivan. These included cut numbers from Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard and songs from several of Sullivan's operas with librettists other than Gilbert that were then nearly unknown.[10] This volume did much to encourage the rehabilitation of these works.[4]/nIn 2006, Rees donated to the British Library his collection of original manuscript scores, including The Zoo, The Contrabandista, The Chieftain, Haddon Hall, The Emerald Isle, Gilbert and Frederic Clay's Princess Toto, and Edward German's Merrie England and A Princess of Kensington, as well as prompt books for Princess Toto and Haddon Hall, among 19 volumes of materials.[13]/nHe died in 2014, aged 86.[10]", "40767189": "Margaret Buckingham, ForMemRS (born 2 March 1945) is a British developmental biologist working in the fields of myogenesis and cardiogenesis.

Skene is a chronobiologist with specific interest in the mammalian circadian rhythm and the consequences of disturbing the circadian system. She is also interested in finding their potential treatments for people who suffer from circadian misalignment. Skene and her team of researchers tackle these questions using animal models, clinical trials, and most recently, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.[1] Most notably, Skene is credited for her evidence of a novel photopigment in humans, later discovered to be melanopsin. She was also involved in discovering links between human PER3 genotype and an extremely shifted sleep schedules categorized as extreme diurnal preference.[2] Skene received her Bachelor of Pharmacy, Master of Science, and Ph.D. in South Africa.[1]/nSkene is a professor of neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom. She has been conducting research in the field of chronobiology for over 25 years and has published over 150 papers.[1] She is also a past Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award Holder.[1] This award is granted to UK-based scientists with outstanding achievement in their field, provides an enhancement to their current salary, and is funded by both the Wolfson Foundation and the Royal Society.[3]/nIn late 1980s, Skene and her team tracked the parameters of melatonin synthesis pattern in the pineal gland of Syrian hamsters under different photoperiod.[4] Since then, Skene and her team have been studying both melatonin synthesis patterns in various diseases, and ways that melatonin can be used reset and alleviate symptoms of disrupted circadian clock experienced in jetlag, night shifts, blindness, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases.[1] These symptoms of disrupted circadian clock include fatigue, sleepiness, insomnia, difficulty waking up, and cognitive and metabolic problems.[5] In the early 2000s, her team discovered that administering melatonin can entrain the circadian clock that is normally free-running in totally blind people.[6] Around the same tine, her team also began researching how aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease affect melatonin synthesis, and the link between disrupted melatonin synthesis and sleep disorders AD patients experience in early stages of the disease.[7] In the early 2010s, her team performed a meta-analysis on the efficacy of melatonin in treating various sleep disorders.[8] They concluded that melatonin treatment is effective in reducing sleep latency and improves overall sleep quality in certain types of adult sleep disorders.[9]/nIn 2001, Skene published a paper demonstrating the presence of a novel photopigment, outside of the traditional rods and cones, sensitive to short-wavelength light suppression of circadian melatonin secretion in humans.[10] Later, it was found that this novel photopigment, melanopsin, plays an important role in non-visual responses to light within the human body and is present in a distinct class of photoreceptor cells called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs).[10] Her subsequent research has demonstrated that phase advances in circadian melatonin rhythm occur when short wavelength light is presented at very low intensities in the morning, with similar phase advances being observed for white light presented at 185x greater intensity, indicating a special sensitivity of the human circadian system to short wavelength light.[11] Further, her team has found that this suppression of melatonin by short wavelength light is less effective in older, postmenopausal women when compared to younger, premenopausal women.[12] Overall Skene's findings have played a role in prompting further research in the optimal use of light as a therapeutic agent in sleep related and circadian disorders.[13]/nThe human PER3 gene is an important part of the mechanism for maintaining autonomous oscillations of the molecular circadian clock.[14] In 2003, Skene\u2019s team demonstrated the first connection between the number of variable number tandem repeat polymorphisms in the human PER3 gene with extreme diurnal preference also known as extreme morningness or eveningness.[15] Homozygous alleles with short polymorphisms having 4 repeat sequences were associated with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), while 5 repeat sequences were shown to be associated more with advanced sleep period.[2] Additionally, these same polymorphisms have been implicated in sleep homeostasis by Skene\u2019s later research.[15] Individuals homozygous for the 5 repeat PER3 allele showed increased slow wave sleep, greater ability to fall asleep or stay asleep, and suffered more on cognitive tests following sleep deprivation than people with the homozygous 4 repeat genotype.[2] Taken together, Skene\u2019s findings have important implications for how a person\u2019s PER3 genotype can affect how they tolerate the effects of shift work.[2]/nIn the early 2000s, Skene and her team found that many human circadian variables such as the timing of melatonin synthesis, body temperature and heart rate are responsive to blue-enriched light, and that blue-enriched light is more effective in reducing subjective sleepiness and improving alertness, compared to other wavelength lights.[16] Since people who work night shifts often suffer from fatigue, Skene and her team have sought to improve the cognitive and metabolic symptoms night shifts workers experience due to their disrupted circadian rhythm.[1] Recently, her team found that blue-enriched white light improved performance in stimulated night shift conditions.[17] Her team also tested whether exercise could help stabilize non-behavioral indicator of circadian rhythm, but found that low-intensity exercise before starting night-shift did not affect glucose tolerance.[18]/nSkene's current research interests are two-fold. One area is understanding how circadian clocks, sleep, and metabolism relate to each other within people with dysfunctional circadian rhythms, such as shift workers, and those with metabolic disorders, like liver disease or Type 2 diabetes.[1] The other is using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics to explore how various factors such as sleep, food, time of day, and circadian rhythms impact the human metabolome.[1]", "44076811": "Vidya Avinash Arankalle (born 1952) is an Indian virologist whose work is multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of cell culture and microbiology./nShe is a fellow of the Indian National Science Academy,[1] and the Indian Academy of Sciences.[2]", "18517775": "Brigid L.

Both of her parents were artists.[4] As a child she faced the difficulties of post-World War II Britain. Her father, a stage designer, died in 1945 shortly after coming back from the front lines.  Her single mother, a dressmaker, raised her and her sibling. She was a support and inspiration to Hogan. The village Hogan grew up in was close to nature and fostered her love for biology. Her rational scientific thinking helped her cope with her uncertain home life. She attended a High Wycombe High School for girls, where her biology teacher mentored her as she applied to Cambridge University. She was admitted to Newnham College, Cambridge's all-women's college, where she faced negative attitudes from male faculty due to her gender, typical of the time.[7]/nSince Cambridge offered no courses in cell or developmental biology at the time, Hogan did her post-doctorate work on sea urchin development with Paul Gross at MIT.  Around 1974, back in Britain, Hogan began her work on mouse embryonic stem cells at the Mill Hill Labs of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London under director John Cairns. Encouraged by Anne McLaren, she focused her career on mouse development and has continued on this path ever since.[7] She was the head of the Laboratory of Molecular Embryology at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and then the National Institute of Medical Research in London.

The expeditions took place during the latter half of the 18th century and the students were designated 'apostles' by Linnaeus.[1]/nMany apostles began their journey from Sweden. Some would act as chaplains or doctors aboard a Swedish East India Company ship. The expeditions were often dangerous. Seven of the seventeen apostles never came home. The first apostle, Christopher T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m, died of a tropical fever on C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island in 1746. T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m's widow was angry with Linnaeus for making her children fatherless. After this incident, Linnaeus sent only unmarried men./nLinnaeus remained involved in most expeditions. He often left notes for the apostles and outlined what they should look for during their journeys, and the apostles sent letters and botanical samples to Linnaeus. Upon their return, it was usual to give Linnaeus a selection of anything collected. However, Daniel Rolander elected not to transfer his collection and was criticised by Linnaeus./nMany newly discovered plants, animals and insects were named and catalogued by Linnaeus and apostles. As a result, the apostles' expeditions helped spread the Linnaean taxonomy, a system for classifying organisms. Additionally, one of Linnaeus' admirers, the English botanist Joseph Banks, was inspired to begin the tradition for all British research ships to have a naturalist aboard. Thus the apostles had a direct influence on future expeditions such as Charles Darwin's expedition aboard HMS Beagle.[2]/nCarl Linnaeus was born in R\u00e5shult, Sm\u00e5land, Sweden on 23 May 1707.[3] Linnaeus enrolled at Uppsala University to study botany and medicine in 1728.[4] Following his studies, he went to the Netherlands to study medicine.[5] While in the Netherlands, he published Systema Naturae that describes a new system for classifying plants.[6]/nLinnaeus returned to Sweden in May 1741 and was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University. Nine years later he became the university's rector, starting a period where natural sciences were held in the greatest esteem.[7]/nPerhaps the most important contribution Linnaeus made during his time in Uppsala was as a teacher.[according to whom?] His lectures were normally full and often held in the Botanical Garden. The Saturday botanical excursions during summer were more popular than his lectures. Linnaeus and students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.[1] Additionally, he let some of the best students live with him at his house.[8]/nAmong Linnaeus' notable students, the most promising and committed ones made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with the help of their professor. These seventeen adventurers were referred to as Linnaeus' apostles.[9] The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a place on an expedition or a scholarship.[10] Most apostles were given instructions of what to find during their journeys. The apostles collected, organised and classified new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' classification system. Most gave their collections to Linnaeus when their journey finished.[11]/nChristopher T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m (1703\u20131746) was the first apostle. Linnaeus permitted T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m to conduct a botanical expedition in China.[12] In early 1746, T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m received free passage on the Swedish East India Company ship Calmar to China. He took a list, written by Linnaeus, of things to collect which included plants, animals and insects. However, Calmar stopped sailing beyond C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island (off the modern-day Vietnamese coast) because it had been forced to find a winter berth.[13] On 4 December 1746, T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m died of a tropical fever without a botanical or zoological specimen having been sent to Sweden.[14] His widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless. Following the death of T\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m, Linnaeus allowed only unmarried men to become his apostles.[15]/nPehr Kalm (1715\u20131779) was born in Sweden to Finnish parents and became a student of Linnaeus in December 1740. He proposed to Linnaeus that he travel to North America on a botanical expedition. Linnaeus concurred and in November 1747 Kalm began his journey to North America sponsored by the universities in Uppsala and \u00c5bo. After a long stay in England, on the way he reached Philadelphia in autumn 1748. Once there, he stayed in North America for two and a half years, visiting the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and southern Canada. He then returned to Sweden. Kalm is one of the few apostles who actually lived up to Linnaeus' hopes; bringing with him a large collection of pressed plants and seeds. His travel experience was later published in a three-volume book, En resa til Norra America.[13][17][18][19][20]/nFredric Hasselquist (1722\u20131752) heard Linnaeus talking about the botanically unexplored Eastern Mediterranean and he was inspired to travel there. Hasselquist was poor and to make the expedition possible, he relied on sponsorships from Linnaeus and Olof Celsius. On 7 August 1749, Hasselquist sailed from Stockholm to Izmir (a city in Turkey) where he spent the winter. Subsequently, he sailed to Egypt where stayed for ten months before returning. On the way he passed: Syria; Cyprus; Rhodes; and Chios. He returned to Izmir with a rich collection of botanical and zoological findings and also minerals. On 9 February 1752, he died before returning to Sweden. During his expedition he accumulated a large debt and Linnaeus was informed that Hasselquist's collections and manuscripts would not be sent home until the debt was paid. Swedish Queen Louisa Ulrika paid the debt and Linnaeus received Hasselquist's findings. In 1757, Linnaeus published Iter Palaestinium based on Hasselquist's collections and manuscripts.[13][21][22][23]/nOlof Tor\u00e9n (1718\u20131753) travelled to Surat and India as a priest with the Swedish East India Company in 1750. He continued to Guangzhou (Canton) and China before returning to Sweden. During his journey, he corresponded with Linnaeus; these letters were published posthumously as an appendix in the travelogue of another apostle, Pehr Osbeck. He fell ill during his journey and died shortly after his return in 1753. He returned with a large collection of specimens.[24][25][26]/nPehr Osbeck (1723\u20131805) sailed from G\u00f6teborg to China in 1750 on ship Prins Carl. His primary task was to collect a tea plant for Linnaeus. He spent four months in Guangzhou where he collected many plants, but not the tea plant. He returned to Sweden in June 1752 with his collection and several other objects which he gave to Linnaeus.[27][28][29][30]/nPehr L\u00f6fling (1729\u20131756) was recommended by Linnaeus when the Spanish ambassador in Stockholm asked for help exploring Spanish flora. L\u00f6fling travelled to Madrid in 1751 where he stayed for approximately two years. He explored the flora and fauna and regularly sent plants to Linnaeus. In 1754 the Spanish organised an expedition to South America and L\u00f6fling was invited to join them. They first stopped in the Canary Islands, staying for a short time before continuing to Venezuela. In Venezuela, L\u00f6fling collected plants with the help of his two assistants. L\u00f6fling stayed in South America until his death on 22 February 1756 in Guyana.[10][31][32]/nDaniel Rolander (1725\u20131793) followed Linnaeus' acquaintance, Carl Gustav Dahlberg, to Suriname in 1755. Although he became ill on the way, he had almost recovered by the time he arrived. In Suriname he tried to explore the rainforests but disliked the climate. He developed an alcohol addiction and his health began to decline. He stayed for seven months and then returned with a collection containing plants and insects. He did not, however, give anything from his collection to Linnaeus. This is reported to have made Linnaeus \"furious\". Linnaeus, determined to acquire parts of Rolander's collection, broke into Rolander's home and reportedly stole a Sauvagesia plant. This incident ended the relationship between the two men and Linnaeus was heard to speak ill of Rolander on several occasions.[33][34]/nAnton Rolandsson Martin (1729\u20131785) was born in what is now Estonia and later came to Sweden to be taught by Linnaeus. Linnaeus helped Martin get a small grant from Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences to go to Spitsbergen, an island in the Arctic Ocean. In 1758, Martin joined a whaling expedition to the island but was only able to get ashore a few hours. He managed to bring back mosses and lichen. Despite how few samples he was able to bring back, Martin's expedition gained Linnaeus' praise.[35][36]/nCarl Fredrik Adler (1720\u20131761) sailed to the East Indies in 1761 on a Swedish East India Company ship. He also visited China and Java on the same expedition. His journey was short. He died later in the year of his departure while still in Java. However, before his death he had succeeded in sending some samples back to Linnaeus from China.[37]/nPehr Forssk\u00e5l (1732\u20131763) was born in Finland and became a student of Linnaeus when he was 18 years old. Forssk\u00e5l was asked if he wanted to join a Danish expedition, commissioned by the Danish King Frederick V, to the Middle East. He consulted Linnaeus and was given permission to go. Although it was a Danish expedition, King Frederick V stated that the findings would not be placed in Copenhagen until several international botanists, including Linnaeus, had studied them. Forssk\u00e5l and the expedition sailed in the winter of 1761. Their first stop was Alexandria, Egypt. Forssk\u00e5l made many findings at Suez and was one of the first to describe the flora and fauna of the Red Sea. The expedition reached Yemen in April 1763 where Forssk\u00e5l found a Commiphora which Linnaeus was particularity interested in. However, Forssk\u00e5l died of malaria on 11 July 1763 before he could deliver Commiphora to Linnaeus. Forssk\u00e5l worked on Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica and Descriptiones Animalis during the expedition. His works were published posthumously in 1775 by another expedition member. Carsten Niebuhr.[38][39][40]/nG\u00f6ran Rothman (1739\u20131778) studied medicine at Uppsala University and carried out his dissertation with Linnaeus as his supervisor. In 1773 Rothman travelled to North Africa that was commissioned by the Swedish Academy of Sciences. He visited Libya and Tunisia but was unable to go as far inland as he wished due to local unrest. He returned to Sweden in 1776 with very few findings.[41][42]/nJohan Peter Falk (1732\u20131774) arrived in Uppsala University in 1751 and became an apostle. He followed Linnaeus on his expedition to the island province Gotland and later became a tutor to Linnaeus' son, Carl. In 1760, Linnaeus encouraged Falk to follow apostle Forssk\u00e5l on the Danish expedition to Egypt but Falk did not gain approval from the Danes. In 1768, the Russian Academy of Sciences created several expeditions to explore eastern Russia. Thanks to Linnaeus, Falk was given responsibility for one of the expeditions and headed out the same year. The expedition explored many places in Russia, including Volgograd and the steppes. Falk explored and described native customs as well as both flora and fauna. During the journey Falk became addicted to opium and caused him to suffer depression throughout the expedition. In 1774 the expedition reached Kazan where Falk committed suicide. Following his death, his collections and journals were sent to Saint Petersburg to be later completed and published as Beytr\u00e4ga zur topografischen Kenntniss des Russichen Reichs in 1785\u201386 by Samuel Georg Gmelin.[43][44][45]/nDaniel Solander (1733\u20131782) was living in Linnaeus's house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was fond of him, promising Solander his eldest daughter's hand in marriage and telling Solander that he would become his successor. Based on Linnaeus's recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760 where he spread the Linnaean taxonomy. Two years later Linnaeus got Solander a position as professor in botany in Saint Petersburg. Linnaeus was surprised and disappointed when Solander answered that he had decided to stay in England. This damaged their relationship and thereafter Linnaeus was heard to refer to \"the ungrateful Solander.\" In 1768 Solander was employed by the English botanist Joseph Banks to follow James Cook on his first journey to the Pacific Ocean aboard the Endeavour. The Endeavour sailed to Australia, Asia, Africa and several other places where Solander and Banks made many natural sciences discoveries. About a year after the expedition, in 1772, Solander and Banks made another botanical journey to Iceland. He never sent anything from his collection home to Linnaeus, but continued to organise his samples according to Linnaeus's system.[46][47][48]/nEven before he became an apostle, Anders Sparrman (1748\u20131820) had made a two-year-long journey to China as a surgeon on a Swedish East India Company ship. In 1771, he sailed to South Africa as one of Linnaeus' apostles where he tutored and explored the flora and fauna. The next year he was asked to join Cook's second expedition on Resolution. On the journey, he visited and studied plants in various locations including Oceania and South America. He returned to South Africa two years later having made many botanical findings. He stayed there for another eight months before returning to Uppsala in 1776. In 1787, he travelled to Senegal on an expedition to find land for colonisation. He published his travel diary Resa till Goda Hopps-Udden, s\u00f6dra Polkretsen och omkring Jordklotet, samt till Hottentott- och Caffer-Landen \u00c5ren 1772-1776 in three volumes, 1783-1818.[49][50]/nJust like Linnaeus, Carl Peter Thunberg (1743\u20131828) arrived in Uppsala at the age of 18. Having completed his dissertation in 1770, he travelled to Paris. On the way back to Sweden he met Linnaeus' friend Johannes Burman in Amsterdam. With Burman's influence, Thunberg became a surgeon in the Dutch East India Company. He joined an expedition heading to Japan, which at that time was only open for Dutch ships. The expedition stopped in South Africa in 1772 where it remained for three years. During this time Thunberg found 300 new plant species and sent many of his findings to Linnaeus. In 1775, the expedition continued to Java and then to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the Dejima island, outside Nagasaki, so it was difficult for Thunberg to study the mainland flora. However, he got many translators to bring him some mainland specimens to add to those plants he found in the gardens of Dejima. The only time Thunberg could explore the Japanese landscape was when he visited the sh\u014dgun in Edo. After 15 months, he returned to Sweden, passing Sri Lanka on the way. From his findings in Japan, Thunberg published Flora Japonica. From his findings in South Africa, he published Flora Capensis.[51][52]/nAndreas Berlin (1746\u20131773) studied in Uppsala University with Linnaeus as his student before travelling to London to find a botanical expedition he could join. In 1773 he travelled to Guinea with the English naturalist Henry Smeathman. The purpose of the expedition was to explore the central parts of Africa but prior to reaching the mainland, Berlin died of a stomach illness while on the \u00celes de Los. Before his death, Berlin managed to send a few plants to Linnaeus.[53][54]/nAdam Afzelius (1750\u20131837) joined an English expedition to Sierra Leone in 1792 after studying and lecturing in Uppsala. He returned in 1796 having found many new samples, which he described in some of his botanical writings. He also published Linnaeus' autobiography.[55]", "18517784": "Patricia \"Pat\" Simpson FRS is a distinguished British developmental biologist.

She is an Emeritus Professor at the University of Bath.[4]/nTickle was educated at the University of Cambridge graduating with a Master of Arts degree in 1967, and received her Ph.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1970.[5][6]/nTickle worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, as a lecturer and reader at the Middlesex Hospital Medical School, and (after Middlesex merged with it in 1987) a reader and professor at University College London. She then moved to the University of Dundee in 1998, where she became Foulerton Professor of the Royal Society in 2000, and moved again to the University of Bath in 2007, retaining the Foulerton Professor title.[7][8]/nTickle's research in developmental biology investigates how single cells, the fertilised egg, gives rise to a new individual during embryogenesis.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]/nAs Tickle was nearing the end of her undergraduate career at the University of Cambridge, the concept of sorting-out was on the rise. Sorting-out or cell sorting is the phenomenon where cultured cells are disaggregated and then re-aggregated with the purpose of observing the reestablishment of the spatial organization of cell structures within a cell.[23]/nFollowing the completion of her PhD in 1970, Tickle was given a NATO fellowship where she completed a postdoc in the United States working with John Philip Trinkaus at Yale University on cell sorting in fish embryos. After two years, Tickle moved back to London where she worked with Lewis Wolpert, who had been her PhD supervisor. At this time, she decided that she was going to focus on the effects of positional or pattern information on the sorting out process of cells during the limb development of chicken embryos. Tickle\u2019s hypothesis was that if cells of the embryonic limb were to be given distinct characteristics in a random arrangement the cells would arrange themselves into a generated pattern or \u201csort out\u201d.[23]/nIn 1969, a scientist named John Saunders established that the apical ectodermal ridge (AER)--a transparent rim along limb buds\u2014plays an important role in the development or outgrowth of a limb along with the zone of polarizing activity(ZPA). Using these findings, Tickle focused her research on how the ZPA controlled the development of the limb, specifically along the anterior and posterior axis of a developing limb as this axis is controlled by the signaling of the ZPA.[23]/nIt was at this time that Wolpert suggested that the ZPA produced morphogen to create a concentration gradient so that cells at varying positions along the limb bud would be exposed to different concentrations ultimately providing them with the information necessary to develop into the appropriate number of digits. In other words, he believed that the distance from the polarizing region would lead to the formation of different digits during limb development. Tickle\u2019s experiments in his lab on embryonic chicken wings did find that the type of digit that developed did depend on its distance from the polarizing region. Cells closest to the polarizing region on the posterior side of the limb would come in contact with higher concentrations of morphogen to then form a chicken digit 4, whereas the cells furthest from the polarizing region on the anterior side of the limb would experience much lower concentrations and therefore develop the chicken digit 2. These results were important in the field of developmental biology at this time, as it suggested that this model would be a definitive way of understanding how the polarizing region or ZPA worked.[23]/nIn 1976, Bruce Alberts, an American biochemist, brought the concept of using beads to further their research in the development of limbs. Together, they came up with the idea to soak the beads in extracts made from the polarizing region and then position them along the anterior margin of a developing chicken limb. There was also little known about what other chemicals were utilized during development, so the beads were soaked in many other substances thought to be significant, including insulin which was suggested to lead to duplication of limbs in ducks. In the early 1980\u2019s, Tickle\u2019s lab identified retinoic acid as a chemical that could mimic the signaling of the polarizing region by using carriers soaked in the retinoic acid.[23]/nBy 1990, it was discovered that homologs of many developmentally important genes in vertebrates were found in Drosophila melanogaster and multiple scientists cloned chick homologs of these genes. Cheryll Tickle worked alongside Eddy De Robertis and Denis Duboule to look at Hox gene expression in developing limbs to relate it to chicken wing patterns. They found that if a limb was duplicated with retinoic acid, the pattern of Hox gene expression would also be copied.[23]/nTickle also worked with Gail Martin and Lee Niswander in 1994 to find that fibroblast growth factors (FGF) are what is used by the apical ectodermal ridge for signaling. They also discovered that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) were involved in the polarizing region signaling. To test this, Tickle utilized the bead technology introduced by Bruce Alberts by using particular beads to apply various chemicals to developing limbs. When the ACR was removed and FGF soaked beads were substituted within a chick wing bud, it was found to be able to promote proper chicken wing development. This was a significant finding that led to further discovery of this concept within mice by Gail Martin on a more complex scale. A student in Tickle\u2019s lab found that the placement of a bead soaked with FGF for only a few hours could induce the development of a new limb where one would not naturally form. It was concluded that FGF signaling must be turned off following the completion of limb development or else the organism risks additional digit formation and other abnormalities taking place.[23]/nTickle was elected  a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1998, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 2000, a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2001, and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 2001. In 2004 the University of St. Andrews awarded her an honorary doctorate. In 2005 she was named a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE).[24] She also serves as a governor of the Caledonian Research Foundation.[25] Her nomination for the Royal Society reads:/nDistinguished for her contribution to developmental biology. She demonstrated a quantitative relationship between the signal from the polarizing region in the embryo limb and the pattern digits, and that a similar signal was present in mammals. She discovered that local application of retinoic acid can mimic the signal from the polarizing region. Both these signals were shown to control homeobox gene expression. She has now shown that the signal from the apical ridge which is essential for limb development is a fibroblast growth factor. Her work is characterized by outstanding experimental skill, design and interpretation.[3]/nTickle married John Gray in 1979.[1]", "58822439": "Fran\u00e7ois Gros (French pronunciation: [f\u0281\u0251\u0303swa \u0261\u0281o]; 24 April 1925 \u2013 18 February 2022) was a French biologist and one of the pioneers of cellular biochemistry in France.

This discovery has allowed for a breakthrough in understanding a causative link between Helicobacter pylori infection and stomach cancer.[6][7][8]/nMarshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of eight. His father held various jobs, and his mother was a nurse. He is the eldest of four siblings. He attended Newman College for his secondary education and the University of Western Australia School of Medicine, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 1974.[3]  He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 and has four children.[9][10][11]/nIn 1979, Marshall was appointed Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. He met Dr. Robin Warren, a pathologist interested in gastritis, during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together, they both studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis. In 1982, they performed the initial culture of H. pylori and developed their hypothesis on the bacterial cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.[9] It has been claimed that the H. pylori theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach. Marshall was quoted as saying in 1998 that \"everyone was against me, but I knew I was right.\"[12] On the other hand, it has also been argued that medical researchers showed a proper degree of scientific scepticism until the H. pylori hypothesis could be supported by evidence.[13]/nIn 1982 Marshall and Warren obtained funding for one year of research. The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after two days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures unusable after two days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the following Monday. In that sample, they discovered the presence of H. pylori.  They later found out that H. pylori grow more slowly than two days, and the stomach cultures were not contaminated by other organisms.[14]/nIn 1983 they submitted their findings thus far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received that year.[14]/nAfter failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Sam Wang reported that Marshall, after having a baseline endoscopy done, drank a broth containing cultured H. pylori, expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer.[15] He was surprised when, only three days later, he developed vague nausea and halitosis, due to the achlorhydria.  There was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach and their waste products manifested as bad breath, noticed by his wife.[16] On days 5\u20138, he developed achlorhydric (no acid) vomiting. On day eight, he had a repeat endoscopy, which showed massive inflammation (gastritis), and a biopsy from which H. pylori was cultured, showing it had colonised his stomach. On the fourteenth day after ingestion, a third endoscopy was done, and Marshall began to take antibiotics.[17] Marshall did not develop antibodies to H. pylori, suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute H. pylori infection. Marshall's illness and recovery, based on a culture of organisms extracted from a patient, fulfilled Koch's postulates for H. pylori and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcers. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia[18] and is among the most cited articles from the journal.[19]/nAfter his work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985\u201386) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986\u2013present), before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia.[2] He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia (UWA) from 1998 to 2003.[20] Marshall continues research related to H. pylori and runs the H. pylori Research Laboratory at UWA.[21]/nIn 2007, Marshall was appointed Co-Director of The Marshall Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Training, founded in his honour. In addition to Helicobacter pylori research, the Centre conducted varied research into infectious disease identification and surveillance, diagnostics and drug design, and transformative discovery. His research group expanded to embrace new technologies, including Next-Generation Sequencing and genomic analysis.  Marshall also accepted a part-time appointment at the Pennsylvania State University that same year.[22] He established the Noisy Guts Project in 2017 \u2013 a research team dedicated to investigating new diagnostics and treatments for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This resulted in a spin-out company Noisy Guts Pty Ltd[23] which develops functional food products.  In August 2020, Marshall, along with Simon J. Thorpe, accepted a position at the scientific advisory board of Brainchip INC, a  computer chip  company.[24]/nIn 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Marshall and Robin Warren, his long-time collaborator, \"for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease\".[25]/nMarshall also received the Warren Alpert Prize in 1994; the Australian Medical Association Award and the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 1995; the Gairdner Foundation International Award in 1996; the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1997; the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement,[26] the Dr A.H.

His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads:[1]/nBarry Marshall, together with Robin Warren, discovered spiral bacteria in the stomachs of almost all patients with active chronic gastritis, or duodenal or gastric ulcers, and proposed that the bacteria were an important factor in the aetiology of these diseases. In 1985, Marshall showed by self-administration that this bacterium, now called Helicobacter pylori, causes acute gastritis and suggested that chronic colonisation directly leads to peptic ulceration. These results were a major challenge to the prevailing view that gastric disorders had a physiological basis, rather than being infectious diseases. Marshall showed that antibiotic and bismuth salt regimens that killed H. pylori resulted in the cure of duodenal ulcers. The view that gastric disorders are infectious diseases is now firmly established and there is increasing evidence for a role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancers.

\"macrophage activation\", a term he has become associated with.[2][3] Discovering antibiotics was his side interest and his work in this field later earned him a fellowship to the Royal Society.[4] At Florey's suggestion, Mackaness simultaneously took to studying anti-tuberculous medicines, including streptomycin and isoniazid.[1] His investigations into how isoniazid acted in tuberculosis, published in 1952, were some of the first on this topic.[1] He used the techniques he had developed during his study of the life history of monocytes and macrophages to show that for a drug to be effective against tuberculosis, it had to be effective inside the macrophage, and showed that isoniazid entered the macrophage to be active against M. tuberculosis.[1][5] He delayed completing his

resistance\", and he attributed this to macrophages.[2] Compared to macrophages from uninfected mice, these macrophages could then be removed and were found to kill several other bacteria.[2] The protection faded with time, but regained when the mice were re-challenged with the original bacteria.[2] The macrophages were activated immediately.[2] When challenged with other un-related bacteria, the macrophages did not respond.[2] He concluded that the macrophage response was dependent on the particular original infection and the findings were published in The Journal of Experimental Medicine

At the time, degrees were issued by the University of New Zealand, and she obtained a BSc and MSc with first class honours.[1]/nShe obtained a scholarship, the King George V Memorial Fellowship for New Zealand, that allowed her to undertake postgraduate studies in the United States for one year. When she arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, she found that her New Zealand postgraduate degree was not recognised, which denied her access to the library, research facilities, and health insurance. To overcome this problem, she enrolled for a PhD, which she studied towards at the UC Berkeley College of Chemistry (1956\u201359) under the supervision of Melvin Calvin; Calvin received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1961.[2][3]/nShe then taught at Wellington Girls' High School under a bond, but broke this arrangement to take up a job offer with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) made to her four years earlier by John Falk of CSIRO Plant Industry.[2]/nShe was the first to show that the photosynthetic mechanism comprises two fundamental components: photosystem I and photosystem II.[4] Anderson was an adjunct professor at the Australian National University.[2]/nAnderson died on 28 August 2015.[2] Her funeral was held at St John the Baptist Church, Reid, Canberra.[5]/nShe received many honors and awards for her work, including election as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1987, and as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996.[6][7] She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Ume\u00e5 University in 1998.

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "528214": "Mister Sinister (Nathaniel Essex) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont, the character was first mentioned as the employer behind the team of assassins known as the Marauders in The Uncanny X-Men #212 (December 1986), and later seen in silhouette in The Uncanny X-Men #213, with both issues serving as chapters of the 1986 \"Mutant Massacre\" crossover. Mr. Sinister then made his first full appearance in The Uncanny X-Men #221 (September 1987). His appearance was designed by artist Marc Silvestri.[3]/nA villain who usually prefers to act through agents and manipulation, Mr. Sinister is born Nathaniel Essex in Victorian London. A human scientist, Essex is inspired by the work of his contemporary Charles Darwin and becomes obsessed with engineering humanity into a perfect race of superhumans. As he learns about mutants (superhuman beings born with the X-gene), Essex encounters the mutant villain Apocalypse. The two become allies and Apocalypse uses alien Celestial technology to transform the British scientist into Mr. Sinister, an ageless man with super-powers.[4] Later on, Sinister increases his power through self-experimentation. In the modern-day, Sinister develops a great interest and protective attitude towards the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey, believing their DNA can create the ultimate mutant. This and other factors lead him to have repeated clashes with the X-Men (a group Cyclops and Jean Grey helped found) and related teams. Sinister's body has been destroyed more than once, but he survives due to regenerative abilities and/or by transferring his mind into new host bodies or clones. Several co-existing Mr. Sinister clones (all sharing the original's memories and basic personality) later formed a community. This community was later destroyed, but one clone that was born with an X-gene (making him a mutant) survived and continues to operate to this day. Mr. Sinister is often associated with the characters Apocalypse, Cable, and Madelyne Pryor, and is leader of the team of trackers and assassins known as the Marauders./nMaking frequent appearances in the X-Men comics and related spin-off titles, Mr. Sinister has also featured in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, toys, trading cards, and video games. IGN's list of the \"Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time\" ranked Sinister as #29.[5] In 1993, Mr. Sinister made his television debut on the animated series X-Men in the first two episodes of season 2, voiced by Christopher Britton, exposing the character to a wider audience. Mister Sinister appears in the 2009 animated series Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Clancy Brown./nWriter Chris Claremont conceived Sinister as a new villain for the X-Men. Having felt \"tired of just going back to Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and the same old same old\" Claremont recalled:/nDave Cockrum and I went over ideas, and what we were coming towards was a mysterious young boy\u2014apparently an 11-year-old\u2014at the orphanage where Scott (Cyclops) was raised, who turned out to be the secret master of the place. In effect what we were setting up was a guy who was aging over a lifespan of roughly a thousand years. Even though he looked like an 11-year-old, he'd actually been alive since the mid-century at this point\u2014he was actually about 50 [...] He had all the grown-up urges. He's growing up in his mind but his body isn't capable of handling it, which makes him quite cranky. And, of course, looking like an 11-year-old, who'd take him seriously in the criminal community? [...] So he built himself an agent in a sense, which was Mister Sinister, that was, in effect, the rationale behind Sinister's rather\u2014for want of a better word\u2014childish or kid-like appearance. The costume... the look... the face... it's what would scare a child. Even when he was designed, he wasn't what you'd expect in a guy like that.[6]/nMister Sinister was first mentioned by the assassin Sabretooth as the employer behind the team of assassins known as the Marauders in The Uncanny X-Men #212 (December 1986), which was part of the 1986 \"Mutant Massacre\" storyline, in which Sinister ordered the Marauders to kill the Morlocks living beneath New York City.[7] In the next issue, drawn by Alan Davis, Mr. Sinister is first glimpsed as a generic silhouette when the telepathic X-Man Psylocke scans Sabretooth's mind.[8] Mister Sinister appeared unobscured for the first time on the opening splash page of issue #221 (September 1987), drawn by Marc Silvestri. The character is one of the major antagonists in the 1989 \"Inferno\" storyline, where it is revealed he created the character Madelyne Pryor, estranged wife of Scott Summers (the mutant hero Cyclops), by cloning Scott's former lover Jean Grey, who was believed dead at the time. Sinister sent Madelyne into Scott's life in the hopes that the combined DNA of Grey and Summers would result in the birth of a powerful mutant.[9] Soon after \"Inferno\", Sinister is also revealed to have manipulated Cyclops' life since early childhood and who at times has influenced his behavior from afar. After a battle with the X-Men and X-Factor, the villain is apparently destroyed by Cyclops' optic beam, leaving behind only bones.[10]/nMonths after his apparent death, backup stories by Claremont published in the reprint series Classic X-Men #41\u201342 (December 1989) detailed the role Mister Sinister played in Cyclops' early life at an orphanage in Nebraska. The stories feature a boy named Nate who is roommates with the young Scott Summers. Despite Scott saying he doesn't particularly like Nate, the boy appears to be unhealthily attached to him and is aggressively protective, blocking Scott from having other friends. Claremont intended Nate to actually be Mister Sinister, revealing this was his true form and the armored villain simply an illusion he used to threaten others. However, Claremont left the X-Men comics before this origin was revealed to readers. Fans later considered \"Nate\" to be Sinister in disguise as a boy, whereas his adult, armored appearance was his true form.[11] The 2009 series X-Men Forever (vol. 2) showed an alternate timeline, beginning at roughly the same point where Chris Claremont left as head writer of the X-Men years before. Written by Claremont, the series revealed how he would have continued the stories and what revelations he would have made about different characters. The 2010 sequel series, X-Men Forever 2 features Mr. Sinister as a character who is over a century old yet still physically an adolescent boy, using a robot called Mr. Sinister to act as a proxy./nDespite his apparent death in 1989, Sinister appeared again in X-Factor in 1992, now leader of the Nasty Boys team and displaying the ability to regenerate from damage. He played a major role in the 1992-1993 crossover storyline \"X-Cutioner's Song\", unwittingly helping to unleash the Legacy Virus on the world. In X-Men (vol. 2) #22-23 (1993), Sinister reveals his seeming death in 1989 was a \"ruse\" so he could retreat rather than fight the combined X-Men and X-Factor teams. The same story depicts Sinister willing to protect Cyclops from other villains./nBy 1994 Mister Sinister was popular enough that Chef Boyardee used him to advertise its pasta.[12] In X-Men (vol. 2) Annual 1995, flashbacks reveal Sinister living in Los Angeles in the 1930s as \"Nathan Essex\" and depict him as an adult man during that era. In the 1996 limited series The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, writer Peter Milligan (with artists John Paul Leon and Klaus Janson) establishes Sinister's origin, revealing he was originally a Victorian-era scientist named Nathaniel Essex who later gained superhuman powers from Apocalypse, thus abandoning Claremont's idea that he was an immortal trapped in the form of a child./nThe 2006 mini-series X-Men: Colossus Bloodline revealed that Mr. Sinister's powers were weakening and he hoped to restore them. Before he can restore his full power, Sinister is killed in New X-Men (vol. 2) #46 (2008). The same year, a contingency plan in X-Men: Legacy #214-215 involves him attempting to take a new host body, but fails. In X-23 (vol. 3) #5-6 (2011), another resurrection contingency plan led to the creation of Miss Sinister and to Mr. Sinister's mind inhabiting a clone body of himself. In The Uncanny X-Men #544 (2011), it is revealed that Sinister is now an entire colony of Sinister clones co-existing, each with minor differences. In subsequent battles, the leader Sinister and other clones were killed, only to be replaced by new clones with the same consciousness and improved genetics. The community of Sinister clones is destroyed in The Uncanny X-Men (vol. 2) #16 (2012). In issue #17 (2012), reveals that one copy of Mr. Sinister's mind survived, however, planting himself in the mind of X-Men public relations manager Kate Kildare. The surviving Sinister mind kills her and creates a new clone body to inhabit./nIn the 2019 mini-series Powers of X, it is revealed that several years before the present-day, one of the Sinister clones created possessed an X-gene, making him a mutant like the X-Men. This mutant Sinister assumed leadership of the community of Sinister clones and seems to be the surviving version who operates today. The same mini-series involved Mr. Sinister joining the new mutant community of the island Krakoa, and joining its ruling Quiet Council alongside Magneto, Professor X, Apocalypse, and others./nBorn in Milbury House in Victorian London, Nathaniel Essex is the son of Admiral Erasmus Essex and Mary Essex. Earning a full scholarship to the University of Oxford, Essex becomes a biologist in 1859 and marries his wife Rebecca. A contemporary of Charles Darwin, Essex becomes highly interested in research regarding evolution and \"survival of the fittest.\" He concludes humanity is undergoing increasing mutation due to what he calls \"Essex Factors\" in the human genome. After the loss of his four-year-old son Adam due to birth defects, Essex becomes more obsessed with his research in perfecting and improving the human race. Arguing that science is beyond morality, his questionable research methods and ideas lead to suspicion, mockery, and finally ousting from the Royal Society and the scientific community. Angry and bitter, Essex accepts that being a \"monster\" in the eyes of others may be necessary to achieve his goals.[4]/nEssex later hires the criminal Cootie Tremble and his gang, known as the Marauders. The Marauders kidnap homeless people off the streets of London as test subjects for Essex's experiments, including a man named Daniel Summers (whose descendant Scott Summers will one day be the hero called Cyclops). Two years after Adam Essex's death, Nathaniel Essex learns that some humans are born with mutant genetics that make them superhuman and discovers that one called En Sabah Nur (\"The First One,\" known in later years as Apocalypse) is in hibernation. The Marauders awaken En Sabah Nur who then offers Essex an alliance, believing they have similar goals in perfecting the world and humanity./nNur then intends to conquer 19th century England but is confronted by Cyclops and Phoenix, heroes from the future who arrive via time travel.[4] Nur defeats the two heroes, leaving them for Essex to experiment on. Hoping to stop Apocalypse and possibly the origin of Mr. Sinister, Phoenix tells Essex that continuing his work with Nur will lead to worldwide destruction. Sensing truth in her words, Essex releases the heroes and decides to rededicate himself to family, as his wife Rebecca is pregnant again. Meanwhile, Rebecca Essex discovers Nathaniel's imprisoned human test subjects and his lab where he has experimented on the remains of their son. After freeing the prisoners and reburying her son, Rebecca goes into premature labor and her second child dies in stillbirth. Nathaniel then finds Rebecca, who is now dying from blood loss, and asks for forgiveness. Rebecca refuses, saying with her dying breath, \"To me, you are... utterly... and contemptibly... sinister!\" Following Rebecca's death, Essex continues his alliance with En Sabah Nur, becoming the villain's first \"prelate.\" Apocalypse reveals he has alien technology belonging to the Celestials (god-like beings who manipulated humanity in the past, resulting in the creation of the Eternals and the Deviants, as well as humanity's genetic potential for superhumans). With the Celestial machines, Apocalypse subjects Essex to a painful genetic transformation, turning him into an ageless being with chalk-white skin and a form of telekinesis. En Sabah Nur tells the transformed scientist to shed his past identity and choose another, and Essex renames himself \"Sinister.\"[4] Although he claims his humanity is gone, Essex continues to carry Rebecca's photo until 1882.[4]/nWhen Apocalypse demands Sinister create a plague that will wipe out much of humanity, leaving only \"the strong\" alive, the scientist refuses, arguing that cruelty without purpose is ignorance and the enemy of science. Appreciating Sinister has shown strength through defiance, Apocalypse returns to his hibernation state, promising that when he returns he and Sinister will reshape the world.[4] Following the death of Charles Darwin, Sinister travels to America and assumes the identity of obstetrician \"Nathan Milbury\" (taking the name of his ancestral home), head of the Essex Clinic in New York in the 1890s. There he continues secret experiments on people. He comes to understand more and more that mutants are human beings born with an \"X-factor gene\" or \"X-gene\", causing powers, traits, and abilities that often manifest during puberty or trauma. One early test subject is a mutant with a long lifespan named Amanda Mueller. To study how the X-gene may pass on to children in different ways, Sinister arranges for Amanda to marry his former test subject Daniel Summers (who recently became the first of his family to immigrate to America). On several occasions when Amanda is pregnant, Sinister pays her to feign miscarriage and then secretly bring him the child for study. Seeing great potential in the Summers genetic line, Sinister decides to monitor the family./nAround this same time, Sinister encounters two other mutants traveling from the future, the athletic thief-turned-hero Gambit (who can charge objects with kinetic energy) and the shape-shifter Courier. After experimenting with a cell sample from Courier, Sinister gains complete control over his physical form, allowing regenerative abilities and shape-shifting. Before the two time travelers leave, Sinister sees evidence of his own surgical techniques on Gambit.[13]/nIn 1899, Apocalypse emerges from hibernation again and is pleased with Sinister's work, including the development of a deadly techno-organic virus. Sinister then injects the virus into Apocalypse, but it only weakens the villain. As Apocalypse returns to hibernation to heal, he promises to kill Sinister when next they meet. Sinister decides to engineer a mutant who can kill Apocalypse.[14]/nIn 1907, Sinister works at the Ravencroft Institute and employs the mutant killer and mercenary Sabretooth as an agent. Sabretooth brings him the mutant called Logan for experimentation, but the man is then freed by coworker Dr. Claudia Russell (ancestor of the werewolf Jack Russell). Sinister leaves Ravencroft afterward.[15] In 1912, Sinister encounters Grigory Rasputin and encourages him to father many children, promising they will have superhuman potential. Rasputin's descendants later include the mutant warrior siblings Colossus, Magik, and Mikhail Rasputin.[16] A few years after meeting Rasputin, Sinister grants shape-shifting abilities to Jacob Shaw (father of the X-Men villain Sebastian Shaw).[17] It is possible that during the 1920s, Sinister also gave Dr. Herbert Edgar Wyndham information regarding how to map and break the human genetic code. Wyndam, a student of the Inhuman scientist Phaeder, later becomes the master geneticist called the High Evolutionary.[18]/nDuring the 1920s, Sinister lives in Los Angeles as \"Nathan Essex\" and befriends radio comedian Faye Livingstone. Realizing Faye's potential to have mutant children, Sinister temporarily imprisons and experiments on her. After her release, Faye never has children and develops cancer. As her mind and health deteriorate, she becomes a hospital patient in San Diego for the rest of her life, her treatment provided by Sinister himself, who visits annually in his human guise of Nathan Essex.[19]/nDuring World War II, Sinister works with the Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele. Several Nazis who encounter Sinister nickname him \"Nosferatu.\" A young Max Eisenhardt (who will grow to be Magneto) encounters him at this time and realizes Sinister is experimenting on children, killing those he deems failures or no longer needed. During these experiments, Sinister sometimes plays a favorite piece by Franz Schubert.[20] During his work with the Nazis, Sinister creates a clone of the Atlantean warrior Namor, calling it N2. This clone is defeated by Captain America. Soon afterward, Sinister leaves the Nazis, concluding they will lose the war. Mr. Sinister's research during World War II is later recovered and used by the Weapon X project.[21]/nFollowing World War II, Sinister adopts the name \"Dr. Nathan Milbury\" again and works on Project: Black Womb with Dr. Kurt Marko (the father of Juggernaut), Dr. Alexander Ryking (who, like Marko, is a friend and colleague of Brian Xavier, father of Charles Xavier), and the precognitive mutant Irene Adler. They conduct research on many mutant children and take note of several families that may produce mutant children later, allowing Sinister to monitor these bloodlines for decades.[22] Concerned his own physical death may be inevitable, Sinister uses the Cronus Device to implant his own hidden cells of his genetic information into the DNA strands of the Marko, Ryking, Shaw, and Xavier family lines. In time, their descendants can act as hosts for Sinister's consciousness.[23]/nDuring the Vietnam War, Mr. Sinister sets up a lab in Saigon and has his agent Scalphunter bring him soldiers and civilians for experimentation. Locals refer to Sinister as the \"White Devil.\" In 1968, Sabretooth investigates Sinister's operation but is then bribed and blackmailed to not interfere. He is told Sinister may have use for him in the future.[24] Some years later, as \"Dr. Milbury\", Mr. Sinister becomes a professor at the University of Oxford. His students include Moira MacTaggert and the mutant telepath Charles Xavier, who realizes he cannot sense Milbury's thoughts.[25][a]/nYears after Sinister's time back at Oxford, and during the time that Charles Xavier is first befriending Magneto while both are living in Israel, a version of the heroic mutant Hank McCoy from an alternate timeline (known as the \"Age of Apocalypse\") enters the mainstream Marvel reality. Known as the Dark Beast, this corrupt version of McCoy is former student and employee of his reality's Sinister. Dark Beast eventually makes his way to New York City and experiments on many mutants, using techniques his Sinister taught him. Several of his surviving test subjects become deformed or disabled by their own abilities as a result, choosing to hide underground and join a sewer-dwelling mutant community known as the \"Morlocks\" (taking the name from the subterranean race of the novel The Time Machine). Years later, Dark Beast's experiments indirectly lead to Sinister ordering the \"Mutant Massacre.\"/nReturning to America, Sinister creates an orphanage to monitor some of the children of families he first observed during Project: Black Womb. The State Home for Foundlings in Omaha, Nebraska hides a high-tech, underground laboratory. Later, young Jean Grey's mutant telepathy prematurely activates when she witnesses the death of her best friend. Becoming aware of Jean's power, Mr. Sinister plans to kill her parents and bring her to the orphanage, only to learn the Greys have already contacted the now adult Charles Xavier for help, due to his background as a leading geneticist and psychological expert in trauma cases. Not wishing to be detected by Xavier, who at this point has already fought terrorists and superhuman menaces, Sinister decides to keeps his distance after acquiring a DNA sample from Jean.[9]/nSoon afterward, Sinister discovers a recently orphaned mutant boy named Scott Summers (descendant of Daniel Summers) released the same type of optic blasts displayed by the time-traveling hero Cyclops. Sinister tracks down Scott and his younger brother Alex, both of whom survived an airplane explosion that seemingly killed their parents. Scott awakens in the hospital and accidentally releases another optic blast, unable to shut off his power (perhaps due to brain-damage suffered during the fall). To experiment on the boy in a controlled environment, Sinister causes Scott to slip into a coma then arranges for him and his brother to be entrusted to the State Home for Foundlings. Mr. Sinister allows Alex to be adopted by people he can easily monitor, then spends the next year conducting experiments on the comatose Scott. Concluding the boy will never be able to fully control his power, Sinister learns the kinetic force blasts can be blocked by ruby quartz lenses. After placing temporary mental blocks in Scott, Sinister allows the boy to awaken. Scott experiences migraines until he is given ruby quartz glasses.[10]/nScott spends a few years in the care of the State Home for Foundlings. Hoping to make Cyclops an isolated warrior who can be easily manipulated, Sinister takes on the guise of Nate, another orphan who acts as Scott's overly territorial friend while sometimes bullying him.[26] As part of his long-term plan, Sinister allows Scott Summers to be adopted by a criminal named Jack Winters who abuses the boy and forces him to help with crimes. Rather than bend to his abusive guardian, Scott resists and is discovered by Professor Charles Xavier and his ally FBI agent Fred Duncan. With Duncan's help, Scott becomes Xavier's ward and the first official recruit of the original X-Men, a team of mutant heroes trained to stop mutant terrorists. Jean Grey joins this same team weeks later.[27] Sinister continues to monitor Scott somewhat but keeps his distance so the telepathic Xavier and the other X-Men don't become aware of and interfere with his plans. Not long afterward, Mr. Sinister hires the villains Blob and Kraven the Hunter to fight and wound each of the X-Men. This results in a battle that draws the attention of the teenage hero Spider-Man. Kraven then brings the blood samples of the X-Men and Spider-Man back to Sinister for study, even providing a sample of his own DNA.[28]/nMr. Sinister concludes that offspring of Jean Grey and Scott Summers could represent the ultimate stage of mutant potential, possibly a mutant capable of destroying Apocalypse. Using Jean Grey's cell sample, Mr. Sinister creates a clone who is rapidly aged. When the clone shows no sign of the X-gene, Sinister leaves her in a hibernation chamber. Years later, Jean Grey suffers catastrophic radiation poisoning but is saved by the cosmic Phoenix Force, who desires her to be a host. With her increased power, Jean creates a new body for her consciousness and the cosmic Phoenix Force to occupy, while creating a healing cocoon to repair the damage done to her original body. As \"Phoenix\", Jean becomes a more powerful hero. She is later temporarily corrupted, causing the Phoenix Force itself to become a corrupt and deadly entity. The new \"Dark Phoenix\" asserts control, burying Jean's personality. Jean's personality later resumes control and she eventually kills herself rather than allow Dark Phoenix to rise again and destroy more lives. Without a host, the Phoenix Force reverts to its original nature and feels remorse for its role in Jean's death. To make amends, it restores Jean's consciousness to her original body, now fully healed. Simultaneously, the Phoenix Force causes a spark of life in the Jean Grey clone Sinister created.[9]/nDeciding his clone may be useful after all, Sinister names her Madelyne Pryor (a joke on the fact that she was birthed from a \"prior existence\", a cell sample taken from a previously existing person). Mr. Sinister gives \"Maddie\" false memories and documentation of a life where she is a pilot who survived a plane crash that occurred at the same time Jean Grey killed herself. After influencing her personality to be one that will appeal to Scott Summers and will also fall in love with him, Sinister arranges for Maddie to have a job working alongside Scott's grandfather in Alaska.[9] Unaware of her own true nature, Maddie meets Scott at a Summers family reunion. Seeing Maddie's resemblance to Jean and hearing about the timing of her experience in a plane crash, Scott wonders if Pryor is somehow his first love reborn. Maddie admits to having feelings for Cyclops but insists she is her own person and must be seen as such rather than as a copy of Jean Grey. Scott concedes and over time the two fall in love, deciding to marry soon afterward. They have a son, Nathan Christopher Charles Summers. While Christopher was Scott's father's name and Charles was Professor Xavier's first name, it is later said that Sinister influenced Scott and Maddie to name their son Nathan Summers after him as well. Scott decides to leave behind the dangerous world of the X-Men so he can raise his family in peace in Anchorage, Alaska, nearby his own grandparents.[10]/nStudying the sewer-dwelling community known as the Morlocks, Mr. Sinister decides these mutants should not be allowed the chance to mix with the gene pool of other mutants and humans. His studies also reveal that several Morlocks bear signs of genetic manipulation based on his own research (due to Dark Beast's experiments). Enraged that someone has used his \"signature\" without his permission, Sinister decides to wipe out the mutant Morlocks living beneath Manhattan. He hires the mutant thief Gambit (who has not yet time traveled and so considers this to be his first meeting with Sinister) to recruit a new team of Marauders who will work with Sabretooth and Scalphunter. In exchange, Mr. Sinister performs surgery on Gambit to correct a defect that would have ensured the mutant thief would one day lose control of his powers.[29]/nBefore sending his Marauders against the Morlocks, Sinister learns the Avengers have discovered Jean Grey is alive and well in her cocoon. Sinister decides to seize the opportunity and at last kidnap Nathan Summers for experimentation. When Scott Summers learns of Jean's reappearance, Sinister mentally influences him to immediately leave Alaska to see for himself that it's actually her, leaving his family behind and without protection. Sinister then continues his mental influence, causing Scott to abandon his family and remain in New York City with Jean and the other original X-Men recruits.[10] The group of old friends decide to create a new team together called X-Factor.[30] With Cyclops gone and occupied, Sinister sends his newly formed Marauders to attack the now vulnerable Summers house in Alaska. The Marauders attack Maddie and leave her for dead, then take Nathan Summers to the State Home for Foundlings. Meanwhile, Sinister erases all records of Maddie and arranges for the furniture from the house in Anchorage to be removed. Unbeknownst to Sinister, Maddie is taken to a hospital and survives, though she slips into a coma.[31]/nReturning to New York, the Marauders are finally sent after the Morlocks. Using his stealth and tracking skills, Gambit leads the group to the Morlock community but abandons the group when he learns they intend murder. The Marauders dismiss Gambit and begin their slaughter, causing the \"Mutant Massacre\" event, a series of battles that include the X-Men, the new X-Factor team, and other heroes such as Thor. Some of the Marauders are killed in action. Scanning the mind of Sabretooth, the X-Man called Psylocke learns the massacre was ordered by someone called \"Sinister\", alerting the X-Men to his presence for the first time.[32]/nSoon afterward, Cyclops returns to Alaska to make amends with Maddie and be a father. Discovering the house is completely empty, he concludes Maddie left with Nathan, deliberately leaving no trace of where she might be. He is then confronted by Master Mold, the robot whose primary task is to create mutant-hunting Sentinels. During the battle, Master Mold refers to Cyclops as one of \"the Twelve\" who must be destroyed.[33] Later on, Master Mold explains the Twelve are \"The dozen mutant humans who will one day rise up and lead all of mutantkind in war against Homo sapiens in the twilight of Earth.\"[34]/nMonths after Nathan's kidnapping, Maddie awakes from her coma, amnesiac.[35] After regaining her memory, she contacts and reunites with the X-Men. Now bitter and increasingly desperate regarding her missing child, Maddie believes Scott completely abandoned them and never cared enough to contact her or look for her.[36] She later joins forces with the demons S'ym and N'Astirh who take advantage of her state of mind and corrupt her, turning her into the Goblyn Queen and leading into the Inferno storyline. During this storyline, the mutant precog Irene Adler (now calling herself Destiny) sends the X-Factor team to Sinister's lab where they discover and rescue Nathan along with other children. The Goblyn Queen then arrives and retrieves Nathan and several other babies to use as sacrifices for a demonic ritual.[citation needed]/nSinister reforms his Marauders, even resurrecting the fallen ones through his now perfected cloning technology. He then confronts Madelyne and reveals her true origins. At the end of Inferno, Maddie dies and her life-force and memories merge with Jean Grey's. As the X-Factor and X-Men teams fight Sinister, the villain reveals his many manipulations of Scott Summers over the years, how he mentally influenced Scott to abandon his family, and his quest to create offspring from his and Jean's DNA.[10] After realizing the villainous scientist may be vulnerable to his power, Cyclops releases a high-intensity blast that seems to atomize Mr. Sinister, leaving only charred bones. The battle over, Scott and Jean decide to raise the baby Nathan together.[10] In truth, Mr. Sinister is alive, having decided to fake his death so he can retreat rather than continue to battle both X-Factor and the X-Men single-handedly.[37]/nLater on, Nathan is fatally infected by a techno-organic virus. Rather than watch his son die, Cyclops sends him into the future where treatment exists. Soon afterward, Gambit joins the X-Men team after having befriended the X-Man called Storm. His connection to Sinister and the Mutant Massacre is not revealed for some time. Many months after Nathan Summers is sent into the future, the X-Men learn he grew up to become Cable, a powerful mutant time traveler and one of Apocalypse's most persistent enemies. This also makes the mutant terrorist Stryfe a son of Cyclops in his own way, as he is a clone of Cable.[citation needed]/nSinister recruits a new team of agents called the Nasty Boys[38] and allies with Stryfe, now leader of the terrorist Mutant Liberation Front.[39] During this time, he establishes a new cover identity of \"Mike Milbury\", a neighbor to Scott Summers' grandparents. During the storyline \"X-Cutioner's Song\", Stryfe gives Sinister a canister he claims contains a sample of his own genetic material, in exchange for a service.[40] When Sinister opens the container, he is angered to find it seemingly empty. He later realizes that he unknowingly unleashed the Legacy Virus, a pathogen engineered by Stryfe that targets mutants.[41] Not long afterward, Scott Summers meets Mike Milbury, who then reveals himself to be Mr. Sinister, still alive. Sinister warns of the Legacy Virus and also hints that there is a third Summers brother unknown to either Scott or Alex. When the villainous Dark Riders arrive to attack Cyclops, Sinister declares the mutant hero under his own protection.[37] Not long afterward, Scott and Jean Grey marry while Sinister monitors from afar, interested in the possible offspring that may result. Some time later, he recruits a new agent named Threnody, a mutant who can sense the dying and draw energy from them.[citation needed]/nNot long after Scott and Jean's wedding, the X-Men learn that due to an alteration to history, their reality is about to be replaced by another. Believing they are about to die, the X-Man Rogue kisses her teammate Gambit, something she had not done before due to the risk that her energy absorbing abilities could harm him. During the kiss, she sees his memories and learns of his part relationship with Mr. Sinister.[42] The alteration to the timeline is due to Xavier's powerful mutant son Legion traveling back in time to kill Magneto before the X-Men have even formed, but accidentally killing Charles Xavier instead. This creates a new \"Age of Apocalypse\" reality where Apocalypse conquers much of the Western hemisphere and Magneto forms his own team of X-Men rebels, naming them in honor of his fallen friend Charles. In this reality, Sinister helps Apocalypse rule, adopts both Alex and Scott Summers as his personal soldiers, and recruits Henry McCoy (Dark Beast) as his lab assistant. Believing Apocalypse will ultimately destroy the Earth in his quest to eliminate the weak, Sinister still works to create a living weapon against him using DNA from Scott Summers and Jean Grey. The result is a powerful teenage mutant named Nate Grey.[citation needed]/nLater on, the timeline is restored. Rogue is disturbed by Gambit's connection to Sinister, which is later revealed to the rest of the X-Men. This drives a wedge between them and Gambit for some time.[29]/nThe Age of Apocalypse reality is seemingly erased but some of its inhabitants are transported to the original timeline. Dark Beast is transported to the past and experiments on several Morlocks. Nate Grey winds up in the modern day Marvel Universe, appearing on Earth only days after the X-Men thought their world would wink out of existence. Learning of Nate Grey and his similarity to Cable, Sinister assigns Threnody to earn the young man's trust. When Threnody develops genuine friendship with Nate and decides to leave Sinister's employ, the Marauders are sent after her. Nate Grey intervenes, killing the  entire team except for Prism (though Sinister later clones the fallen again).[43]/nApocalypse gathers the Twelve, now revealed to be twelve powerful mutants he can use to ascend to a god-like state of power, with Nate Grey acting as a new host. After this plan fails, Sinister takes on the appearance of an elderly man, \"Dr. Essex\", and visits the High Evolutionary. He influences the powerful geneticist to use his advanced space station to remove the powers of all mutants on Earth, causing widespread injury and several deaths, including most of the community of evolved mutants known as the Neo.[44] Sinister then reveals his true nature and takes over the High Evolutionary's satellite, intending to use it to alter the genetics of people at his discretion, making Earth a giant lab where he could create the ultimate race of superhumans. Sinister's plan is then stopped by the X-Men, who restore mutant powers to all of those with the X-gene.[45] The surviving Neo then hunt Sinister to avenge their fallen members, killing 17 clone doppelgangers.[46] Sinister later resurfaces as Dr. Robert Windsor, experimenting on mutants again, with Scalphunter acting as his bodyguard.[47] Later on, an encounter with Colossus and the hero's brother Mikhail Rasputin reveals that Sinister's powers are weakening and he is becoming desperate to find a way to restore them.[16]/nDuring the storyline X-Men: Endangered Species, Sinister sends the Marauders and Acolytes to murder all those who have knowledge of the future.[48] Due to the event known as M-Day, most mutants lose their powers overnight and it seems there are no new mutant births occurring on Earth. Later on, a mutant named Joe Buggs is murdered by a mysterious mutant hunter. His friend Ed seeks the X-Men for help, claiming the killer is Kraven the Hunter (believed dead at the time). The X-Men consult with Spider-Man, Kraven's greatest enemy, and the heroes discover the true killer is Sinister's later creation, Xraven, a telepathic hunter. Realizing Xraven believes he is Sinister's \"favorite son,\" Cyclops invites the hunter to read his own mind. Seeing Cyclops' memories of Sinister's obsession with him and learning the scientists treats all of his soldiers and creations like pawns, Xraven flees but takes DNA samples of the X-Men Shadowcat, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine. Later, Mister Sinister tells Xraven he plans to create a new generation of mutants through cloning. Realizing Sinister will enslave these mutants, Xraven destroys the samples and causes the destruction of Sinister's lab and hideout. Sinister survives, but Xraven's fate is unknown.[49]/nSome time later, the first new mutant since M-Day is born. Sinister sends agents to kidnap the child in the storyline \"X-Men: Messiah Complex.\" Later, Sinister (whose powers are still weakened) is confronted by Mystique, who presses the villain's face against an unconscious Rogue. Rogue's energy absorption abilities are amplified at the time, causing her skin-to-skin contact with Sinister to kill the villain almost instantaneously.[50]/nThanks to using the Cronus Device decades earlier to implant his own genetic information into the Marko, Ryking, Shaw, and Xavier family lines, Sinister's consciousness is able to inhabit Charles Xavier's body following his death at Mystique's hands.[51] Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy the machine, enabling Xavier to drive out Sinister's consciousness. A fail-safe plan allows Sinister's consciousness to then activate within former test subject Claudine Renko, whose body then transforms to mimic Sinister's powers and genetics but with female sex characteristics.[52] Although she gains some of Sinister's memories and his knowledge of science, Renko's personality remains intact and resists Sinister's personality. Seeing herself as a different person rather than a host or a clone, Renko takes the name Miss Sinister.[53]/nGambit and Laura Kinney, a young woman known as X-23, who was cloned from Wolverine's DNA, encounter a girl named Alice, who introduces them to her owner/adoptive mother, Miss Sinister. Renko explains Alice is also a clone, the fourth of a series created by Essex as one of several experiments involving children held in a desert lab. Renko explains Sinister's mind is like a virus attempting to overtake her. She hopes to maintain her own mind by switching bodies with X-23. The plan backfires when Essex's mind telepathically takes control of X-23 and uses her to mortally wound Renko. Laura overcomes Essex's presence, then escapes the lap with Alice and Gambit, freeing the other children test subjects in the process. In the wreckage left behind, Claudine Renko lives, looked over by a fifth Alice clone who now contains Mr. Sinister's consciousness in her mind.[54]/nMiss Sinister is next seen in the company of the reality displaced X-Men of a now-dead universe. One member of this team, Jimmy Hudson, has a genetic anomaly that could enable Renko to create and control spontaneous mutation.[55] Over the following months, Renko further researches this anomaly, calling it Mothervine, for the purpose of controlling mutant childbirths, causing further evolution in natural-born mutants, and triggering mutation in non-mutants.[56] Though she realizes the secondary and primary mutations caused by such tampering are debilitating to the point of being lethal, Renko works with Bastion, Emma Frost, and Havok to unleash Mothervine on a global scale.[57]/nMothervine bombs containing the catalyst are launched into a dozen major American cities resulting in the emergence of primary mutations in people that didn't possess the X-Gene, as well as the appearance of secondary and tertiary enhancements in mutants. The time-displaced X-Men attack but are quickly defeated and captured. Seeing the damage done by Mothervine and realizing all mutants may become enslaved to Miss Sinister, Emma Frost telepathically forces the New Marauders to fight Renko. Miss Sinister activates genetic implants in the New Marauders, killing them instantly. Emma Frost frees Jimmy Hudson from his metal restraints, and he seemingly slays Miss Sinister. The effects of Mothervine are then contained and reversed by Magneto and Elixir.[58]/nMister Sinister is eventually able to fully possess the fifth clone of Alice, returning in The Uncanny X-Men #544. Now dressed in Victorian-era garb and using knowledge gained from Apocalypse, he merges with the alien giant known as the Dreaming Celestial, gaining great power. Sinister turns San Francisco's residents into doppelgangers of himself and attempts to create a society resembling 19th century England, which he claims to now see as a perfect culture. His true plan is to gain the attention of the alien Celestials so they might deem humanity too chaotic and then eradicate the species, leaving him to rebuild the planet with a better version of humanity. The X-Men restore San Francisco and defeat Sinister, who loses his enhanced power.[59]/nForeseeing the Phoenix Force will one day return to Earth, Sinister tells the young mutant Hope Summers about its existence, knowing she will be its choice for a new host. In truth, he intends to steal the Phoenix energy by using a group of Madelyne Pryor clones.[60] When the Phoenix Force arrives on Earth during the \"Avengers vs. X-Men\" storyline, its power is divided between five people, including Cyclops. The Phoenix Five track down Mister Sinister, learning he has built his own city (based on Victorian-era London) within Subterranea that is inhabited by clones of himself, several of his agents, and some acquaintances. Sinister orders his clones to war against the Phoenix Five.[61] After help arrives, the Phoenix Five kill each and every clone of Sinister present.[62]/nIn the aftermath of \"Avengers vs. X-Men,\" Sinister visits Cyclops and explains that some time ago he killed the X-Men public relations manager Katie Kildare, placing his own personality in the woman's mind while a secondary Sinister clone was left in charge of the city. While his clones and resources are gone, he still lives and will strike again.[63] Sinister, now again in a cloned body of his old form, then infiltrates the X-Men's original mansion home, recently renamed the Jean Grey School, through its student Ernst. Ernst provides Sinister access to DNA samples from the mutants within the school in exchange for providing her friend Martha Johannesen with a new body. His efforts are ultimately foiled by the students and Spider-Man, who was asked by Wolverine to help locate the school's mole. Sinister escapes but his new DNA samples are destroyed.[64]/nWhen the Inhuman city of Attilan is under attack, its leader Black Bolt releases Terrigen Mist across Earth, the same mutagenic agent derived from Terrigen crystals that unlock an Inhuman's superhuman potential. This causes many humans with latent Inhuman genes (due to an ancestor) to discover new powers. It also proves deadly to mutants after sustained exposure.[65] Mister Sinister experiments on unwilling subjects to see if Inhuman and mutant DNA together can create a genetically superior species. His tests prove such a species would be unstable. After witnessing the death of a test subject that is a copy of Cyclops, Sinister is defeated by the X-Men and taken to the authorities.[66]/nDuring the \"Hunt for Wolverine\" storyline, Mister Sinister's cell samples of Logan are stolen by a thief who attempts to auction them off. Sinister attacks the thief but is then fought by X-23, who forces him to retreat.[67] The auction attendees are evacuated to South Korea's National Intelligence Service Helicarrier as Iron Man, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, and X-23 interrogate the seller Declan Fay. He directs them to the Kerguelen Islands where Mister Sinister has collected the genetic make-up of every person on Earth.[68] Sinister reveals a kill team recently stole his work. The heroes then destroy his database before leaving.[69] Soon after this, Sinister becomes highly interested in Iceman's increased power and control.[70]/nIn the 2019 Powers of X series, it is revealed that at some point in the past, Sinister created his first clone community on an island in the South Pacific, calling it Bar Sinister. While here, he is approached by Professor Xavier and Magneto regarding his collection of DNA samples. Xavier asks Sinister to prioritize cataloging mutant DNA to create a comprehensive database that would be safe, secure, and redundant. In exchange, he offers to provide samples Sinister would have trouble getting on his own. The lead Mister Sinister clone is not interested in the deal but is suddenly killed by another Sinister clone who has a functional X-gene, making him a mutant too. This Sinister clone becomes leader of the community and agrees to have his memories of this deal and encounter telepathically repressed until the day Xavier and Magneto tell him to remember.[71]/nIt is apparently this version of Sinister, or another X-gene clone with his memories, who survived the slaughter of the Phoenix Five. This meeting between the mutant Sinister clone, Magneto, and Xavier may have taken place soon before the first X-Men team was formed (in which case, the mutant Sinister has been the primary version the X-Men have fought over the years), or during the early 1980s era of X-Men stories (during which time Magneto and Xavier sometimes acted as allies again and before Xavier regained the ability to walk from 1983 to 1991), or during the early or late 1990s era of stories (indicated by Xavier using a Shi'ar hover chair he started using in 1991, Moira MagTaggert's journal claiming the meeting happened before her apparent death in 2001, and Magneto operating openly as he did from 1990 to 1991 and from 1997 to 2001, whereas he was believed dead from 1992 to 1993, was catatonic from 1993 to 1995, and was operating in secret as Erik the Red from 1995 to 1997).[72] The existence of this mutant version of Sinister helps explain why the villain is classified as an \"Alpha-level mutant\" in X-Men (vol. 2) #94 (1999) despite previous stories establishing Nathaniel Essex was born a human without an X-gene and was granted powers by Apocalypse using alien technology.[4]/nSometime later, along with other mutants, the X-gene Sinister is welcomed to the new mutant community existing on the island Krakoa. At the invitation of Xavier, Magneto and Apocalypse, he joins the Quiet Council that governs Krakoa, agreeing to not continue his schemes to harvest the DNA of mutants.[72] In Marvel's 2019 relaunch of its X-Men franchise, Dawn of X, Sinister finds himself already bored with his new status on Krakoa, and decides to resume his schemes by utilizing a loophole in the Quiet Council rules. To begin, he starts a file concerning Franklin Richards, the mutant son of Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman.[73]/nAfter the Quiet Council became aware of Moira's secret alliance with Professor X and Magneto, and her mutant power to reincarnate and reset the timeline upon her death with all the knowledge of all her past lives, Mister Sinister created another top-secret lab unbeknownst to his fellow Council members, where he's still meddling with cloning technology. Interested in exploiting Moira's power, he created several clones of Moira MacTaggert. After extracting all knowledge from the clones and a way to activate the X-Gene in them, he can now, when something goes wrong, upload all of his knowledge of what happened and then kills a Moira clone, resetting the timeline to the moment the clone was created and deliver that information to his earlier self. Sinister checks in on the Moira clones, every day, to see if any of them have new information uploaded. Basically, if his future self reset the timeline, the Moira he made will have new information for him because she reset back to the time he made her. Due to the sophistication of Moira's mutant ability, each clone could only be used up to 10 times. He says he has done this 25 times, so we are on the 26th life of clone Moira.[74]/nImmortal X-Men #8 (January 2023), which opens in 1895 London, shows that the powers that Apocalypse gave Essex were slowly deteriorating and killing him, and to survive he needed to feast upon the flesh of innocent people who he killed, prompting two long-lived mutants, Mystique and Destiny to confront and imprison him. Essex told the two woman that Apocalypse did grant him the power to see the future, including major developments in the 20th and 21st centuries such as the escalation of the scale of war and the rise of the machines as the dominant beings on the planet. After Sinister dies, consumed by his own out-of-control powers during the 19th century, Destiny finds in a basement level, four human-sized tanks, each one marked with one of the four suits found on playing cards, smashed open and empty. As it turns out, Essex had envisioned four possible routes that could be explored as a solution to the ascension of the artificial intelligence: the potential of mankind itself, the wonders of space beyond the stars, the mystical knowledge beyond the understanding of machine mind and the Essex-men themselves.[2]/nBy using Moira MacTaggert's mutant gift to reset reality repeatedly, Sinister continuously tried and attack the Quiet Council. After many tries, he finally manages to kill Charles Xavier, Hope, Exodus, and Emma Frost, and the next stage of his plan is put into motion. As the four council members who died were resurrected, its revealed that Sinister had actually corrupted the resurrection process and they are now under the control of Sinister. Slowly, Sinister manipulates the council to give the gift of immortality to the world by giving people an X-Gene. Through this X-Gene, they could be resurrected but also fall under the control of Sinister. Over the next few years, the mutants of Krakoa dismantle Orchis, the Avengers, and even the living tree of Krakoa but Storm realizes something is amiss. Since she deleted her resurrection protocols, she was not subjected to Sinister's manipulation. Retreating to Arakko, she prepared for war, which she ultimately lost but is still at large. Sinister continues his science experiments and creates mutant chimeras to increase his army. However, the council is worried about alien forces trying to take them out, especially with Storm at large. Sinister decides to redo the timeline and heads to his lab to use Moira's mutant gene, only to find his lab missing.[75]/nWhile Sinister was trapped within the Pit, the genetic code he had implanted into the assassinated council members was nullified by Forge, with one key exception; Professor X, whom Sinister had experimented on as a child. As Krakoa was destroyed by Orchis, with mutantkind scattered, the part of Sinister within Xavier began looking for ways to overcome its host, and began piloting his body while he slept, simultaneously working on a way to fight the Sinister Dominion. After Xavier discovered the truth, Sinister revealed himself to him. He opened his mind to Xavier and managed to convince him not to kill himself and to work together with Sinister to stop the Dominion.[76]/nXavier and Sinister eventually discover the truth behind the four Nathaniel Essex Sinister clones, they were all created to absorb data, leading to the birth of a 5th \"child\" of Nathaniel Essex, an \"apex AI\" called Enigma, the same force revealed that stands above all creation, and is coming to end Eternity, the personification of the Multiverse.[77]/nIn truth, years ago, Essex decided the only way to defeat the coming machine supremacy was to join them, creating his own all-powerful artificial intelligence, which is where Enigma comes in. Enigma - using a Crown symbol similar to a card deck's King - is the 5th \"child\" of Essex, an AI that was able to reach Dominion outside time and space after all four clones attempted, got incredible close, and then failed to ascend.[78]/nAs a result of undergoing genetic engineering at the hands of Apocalypse,[4] the original Mister Sinister gained, as revealed in Immortal X-Men #8, precognitive powers that granted him the power to see the future, including major developments in the 20th century such as the escalation of the scale of war. However these powers were slowly killing him.[2] By the late twentieth century, Sinister's mind had been copied into the bodies of others, as well as clones of his own creation. Since no clone is completely perfect on a cellular level, some differences emerged in their biology and personality. At least one clone of Mr. Sinister developed the X-gene in his DNA. This mutant version of Mr. Sinister became the leader of the many versions of the clone community in the 2019 Powers of X miniseries, and has been the primary Sinister to encounter the X-Men since.[71]/nMister Sinister has the ability to shape-shift from a humanoid form to an amorphous one.[1]/nSinister is an expert at genetic manipulation[13][1] and a skilled surgeon.[1]/nOn rare occasions, Mister Sinister has exhibited the ability to teleport, but it was indicated that this was not an inherent power and was accomplished through the technology of his tesseract headquarters.[79]/nNathaniel Essex cloned himself many times. In addition to countless Mister Sinister variations are four unique clones.[2]/nDoctor Stasis is a clone of Mister Sinister with a suit of clubs on his forehead. He became the director of the Orchis Sixth Petal of Human Resources where different Chimeras served him. As a precaution to protect himself from psychic attacks, Doctor Stasis wears a full mask over his head.[80]/nMother Righteous is a red-skinned female clone of Nathaniel Essex's wife Rebecca with a suit of hearts on her forehead. She studies the different arts of magic so that she can solve it's mysteries.[81]/nOrbis Stellaris is a clone of Mister Sinister with a suit of spades on his forehead who became an organic/mechanical fusion. He took over the World Farm and later allied with S.W.O.R.D.[82]/nFirst mentioned as a force that stands above all creation and a serious threat to the Marvel Universe which forced the Beyonders to orchestrate the destruction of the Seventh Cosmos through the Molecule Man and the Incursions. A glimpse of the Enigma was first seen by Loki after he survived the destruction of the Seven Cosmos, and before he landed in Taaia's Sixth Cosmos.[83]. The God of Stories describes it as \" the Crown Above All Things,\" a menace from beyond the threshold of time, beyond the Multiverse itself. Enigma is actually Nathanial Essex's 5th \"child\", an \"apex AI\" which used the other four Nathaniel Essex clones to achieve Dominion./nIn 2017, WhatCulture ranked Mister Sinister 4th in their \"10 Most Evil X-Men Villains\" list.[84]/nIn the alternate timeline of the 1995\u201396 \"Age of Apocalypse\" storyline, Nathaniel Essex is one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen, making him one of the ruling council that oversees the villain's dominion. He calls himself simply \"Sinister\" rather than \"Mr. Sinister.\" In this world where Earth's general population became aware of the power and abundance of mutants over a decade earlier than they would have otherwise, Sinister does not bother with manipulating Alex and Scott Summers from the shadows via his orphanage. Instead, he adopts them directly after they are orphaned, becoming their foster father, encouraging their training as warriors and teaching them that their mutant genes place them above the non-mutant \"flat scans\" who inhabit the Earth. Scott becomes Sinister's obvious favorite son, creating great resentment and animosity in Alex. Later on, Sinister recruits the amoral scientist Hank McCoy, the Dark Beast, as his lab assistant. Though impressed with Dark Beast's abilities, Sinister is disturbed and at times angry with McCoy's habit of enhancing and altering mutations just for the enjoyment of seeing the results, rather than having a true purpose or benefit for his research.[86]/nAs the years go on, Cyclops comes to doubt the path of Apocalypse. Though publicly he enforces Sinister's will, fighting criminals and rebels such as that timeline's X-Men, in secret he aids humans and others who need to escape Apocalypse's territory or Sinister's holding pens. Unknown to Cyclops, his \"father\" Sinister is disillusioned with Apocalypse's empire, convinced the mutant conqueror's actions will simply cause the destruction of Earth eventually, leaving no possibility for a master race to live. Wishing a living weapon he can use against Apocalypse, Sinister clones a powerful mutant from the combined genetic codes of Scott Summers and the X-Man rebel named Jean Grey. Sinister names the genetically engineered boy \"Nathan Grey\", deciding that while Jean Grey was the boy's mother, he himself was the father. Sinister accelerates Nathan's aging and the boy quickly becomes a teenager, his mutant X-gene granting him incredible telekinetic and telepathic power. Realizing the boy's raw power could easily burn out his life and body prematurely, Sinister becomes desperate to gain full control of Nathan's mind and abilities to use him as a weapon.[87] One night, not knowing the boy's intended purpose or their connection to each other, Cyclops finds and frees Nathan Grey from Sinister's secret lab in the Blightlands. Before Cyclops can lead him to safety, the impulsive teenager immediately unleashes his power and leaves on his own, eventually meeting a group of traveling entertainers called the Outcasts, led by the mutant inventor Forge. The Outcasts accept \"Nate\" into their ranks.[88]/nRealizing his creation has fled, Sinister abandons his labs to quickly recapture Nate before he is discovered and killed, knowing Apocalypse will consider his sudden departure a sign of betrayal regardless. Changing his appearance and calling himself simply \"Essex,\" Sinister joins the Outcasts and is present when they are attacked by Apocalypse's assassin Domino. When Forge realizes that Essex has a dark plan for Nate, Sinister kills him and reveals himself. Sinister explains Nate's origin and purpose to be the destroyer of Apocalypse. Nate defeats and dismisses Sinister, choosing to be an individual rather than a weapon. He then leaves to face Apocalypse on his own which then leads to Nate Grey being transported into the original timeline of the mainstream Marvel Universe.[89]/nIn the Age of Apocalypse 10th anniversary limited series, Sinister collected the seemingly dead Jean Grey after discovering that it was her connection to the Phoenix Force that saved the world from annihilation. When Magneto was credited with saving the planet, Sinister confronted him and revealed the truth. With Magneto now the head of the Department of Mutant Affairs, Sinister blackmailed him to keep his X-Men away even though Sinister was wanted for war crimes.[90]/nThe X-Men still attempted to hunt down Sinister, unaware that their leader was secretly avoiding this outcome. The truth came out when Paige Guthrie, an X-Man abandoned by her mentors during a mission,[91] attempted to get her revenge on them. Her dying words exposed Magneto's duplicity.[92] After explaining the situation to his X-Men, Magneto and the others found Sinister hidden on Liberty Island. He faced the X-Men with his minions the Sinister Six, which included Cloak and Dagger, Sonique, Sauron, Blob and Jean Grey herself.[93]/nIn the final battle, Jean broke free from Sinister's control and bombarded him with the Phoenix energy, heavily charing his body. Sinister was impaled by both Weapon X and Kirika, slaying him.[92]/nIn the alternate universe of the series Mutant X, Mr. Sinister is responsible for Christopher Summers and his wife Katherine Anne Summers meeting, ensuring that the powerful mutants Cyclops and Havok would be born. Sinister joins forces with a villainous Xavier and clashes with this reality's version of Apocalypse, who becomes allies with Jean Grey and Magneto. Sinister and Xavier create the clone Madelyne Pryor, guiding her to meet and fall in love with Havok, leading to a son named Scotty. Sinister also creates another Summers clone called X-Man (a version of Nate Grey). He and Xavier hope to control the evolution of humanity, but Sinister turns on Xavier when he realizes the telepath has his own agenda. Xavier kills Sinister but his plans are then stopped by that reality's heroes and the Havok of the mainstream Marvel timeline.[94]/nA trilogy of mini-series under the banner X-Men: The End was published from 2004 to 2006, taking place in a possible future timeline, roughly \"fifteen years\" forward from where the X-Men stories were in 2004. Sinister is featured in the first mini-series, and then in the second mini-series he blackmails Gambit into bringing him the children of Scott Summers and Emma Frost as well as his own children that he conceived with Rogue.[95] Sinister reveals Gambit is not a natural-born mutant but actually a clone of himself with some of Cyclops's DNA imprinted into his code. The purpose had been to create a \"son\" with Cyclops's abilities. Knowing Sinister's plan to transplant his own mind into this potentially powerful mutant form, Apocalypse arranged for the boy to be kidnapped and then sent to be raised by the Thieves Guild in New Orleans./nGrowing up, Gambit only developed a variation of Scott's powers, giving him red eyes and the ability to charge things with explosive force instead of releasing great kinetic force from his body.[96] Taking on Gambit's appearance, Sinister kills Rogue when she arrives to rescue the children. In the end, Rogue's adopted mother Mystique murders Sinister in vengeance.[97]/nIn Paradise X, an alternate universe first introduced in the 1999 miniseries Earth X, an older Colossus reveals that he was Mister Sinister all along. After years with the X-Men, he fell in love with Jean Grey and then traveled back in time to learn how to preserve her as a clone, leading to his transformation into the psychopathic geneticist Mr. Sinister who then fought the X-Men, including his younger self.[98]/nIn the Ultimate X-Men series, taking place in the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Nathaniel Essex is reimagined as a heavily tattooed street thug nicknamed \"Sinister\" due to his tattoo. He is a former OsCorp scientist who experiments on himself after failing to perfect his formula on stealth and mind-altering drugs to create a super-soldier who could evade any form of detection and hypnotically persuade others. He seemingly suffers from hallucinations of a being called \"Lord Apocalypse\" who orders him to kill a number of mutants to complete his transformation.[99] After committing suicide in the Triskelion,[100] Sinister returns to life and transforms into the Ultimate Marvel version of Apocalypse himself, battling an armored Cable and Professor X in his Onslaught form.[101] However, the Phoenix Force appears and destroys his form.[102]/nAfter the \"Ultimatum Wave\", he reforms his body and gets a job at Roxxon as part of their \"brain trust\".[103] He then allies with Layla Miller and the two embark on a mission to find four specific mutants, at least one of whom is Alex Summers.[104] Their mission and full agenda never come into fruition, as the entire Ultimate Universe soon ends due to a universal incursion depicted in the 2015 Secret Wars event.[105]/nThe 2009 series X-Men Forever (vol. 2) featured stories and canon Chris Claremont would have established had he continued working on the X-Men comics after 1991. In the 2010 sequel series X-Men Forever 2, Nathaniel Essex is a mutant who is over a century old but stuck in the body of a ten-year-old child. Reasoning that no one would be intimidated by his true appearance, Essex uses creates the robot Mr. Sinister, using it as an avatar to command the Marauders./nIn this timeline, mutants do not live long lives (with rare exceptions) because their mutant abilities cause \"burn-out\" in their bodies, leading to death later on (which happens earlier if more power is used as they approach middle age). Essex's genetic research and interest in the X-Men is because he believes they may be a key to finding a cure for X-gene burn-out.[106]/nSinister's Mauraders attack Cyclops's family in Alaska, including his son Nate.

Kaufgetz was also an amateur biologist and animal breeder./nValentinus Kaufgetz, Raynold's father, was a professor in Zurich and one of the leading figures in the fight to unify the disparate colleges of the city into the unified University of Zurich. Valentinus was a descendant of Reformed church leader Heinrich Bullinger, and brought his twelve children up in a strict, religious household. Raynold originally intended to study theology at Zurich, but was soon obsessed with the then-burgeoning field of economics./nAfter completing his studies at the University of Zurich, Kaufgetz joined the Swiss Army. Although reported to be physically imposing and naturally brave, Kaufgetz joined at a time of national peace and unity. Kaufgetz soon became bored with the military life, and returned to Zurich to take up a post teaching at the University of Zurich./nAs an economist he was heavily influenced by Thomas Robert Malthus and many of his theories on domestic economics. Kaufgetz advocated for high tariffs to encourage domestic production of goods, and advocated for a more nationalized Swiss economy. An early proponent of the economic theories of David Ricardo and Adam Smith, he was accused by his fellow academics of being an Anglophile when it came to economics. This criticism would have a lasting effect on his future works, and many of his later theories diverted from strict economics to nationalist, romantic ideas of how a Swiss economy should function in comparison to the other European economies of the time./nAlthough it was a science in its infancy, Kaufgetz became obsessed with biology. Famously, Kaufgetz attempted to breed a type of cow specifically designed to survive the harsh Swiss climate. Although he failed in his ultimate goal, he is sometimes seen as a Swiss Gregor Mendel. Although he was out of academia by the time On the Origin of Species was published, he was convinced by Charles Darwin's arguments and was working on a German translation of the book at the time of his death./nAt the outbreak of the Sonderbundskrieg on November 3, 1847 Kaufgetz petitioned to have his military commission restored. While qualified for service, Kaufgetz's petition was denied./nKaufgetz saw it as a deeply personal insult that he was not given a chance to win glory and fight the Catholic cantonments, which he saw as existential threats to Switzerland. Nevertheless, Kaufgetz became a strong advocate for the Swiss Federal Constitution and volunteered to write a draft of the document. While Kaufgetz was once again denied, he wrote a number of letters to leading members of government proposing amendments and lauding their work. It was during this writing campaign that Kaufgetz would strike up a friendship with Guillaume Henri Dufour, which would last until Kaufgetz's death. Conversely, Kaufgetz also struck up an exchange with leading Swiss politician Jonas Furrer. Although they both affiliated with the Radical Party, Furrer took an intense dislike to the economist. With Furrer becoming the first President of the Swiss Confederation in 1848, what little chance Kaufgetz had of a political career was over./nDue to his friendship with Dufour, Kaufgetz found himself swept up into many of Henry Dunant's projects. Kaufgetz, through Dufour, became an early supporter of the International Red Cross. While he publicly and privately criticized Dunant for making the operating language French as opposed to Kaufgetz's beloved German, he applauded the fact that Roman Catholics were prevented from serving in its governing body./nIt was through his support of the Red Cross that Kaufgetz became involved, with Dunant, in advocating for the first Geneva Convention. Although Kaufgetz sought a position in the Swiss delegation to the convention and was denied the opportunity to serve his country yet again, he still supported the final document and wrote several glowing letters to Dunant, praising his accomplishments.", "41717596": "Gordon Lynn Walls (April 4, 1905 \u2013 August 22, 1962) was an American professor of physiological optics and optometry at the University of California, Berkeley/nWalls started his education at Boston English High School. He earned his B.S. as a mechanical engineer in 1926 at Tufts  College. In addition he was an undergraduate in biology and was awarded both the Goddard Prize and the Olmsted Scholarship in Biology. Walls decided not to pursue his career in engineering. Instead he entered Harvard on a graduate scholarship. His first studies dealt with  photomechanical changes in the retina, laying the fundaments of his career in vision. He continued his study of the retina as a graduate student (Sc.D. in zoology, 1931) and postdoctoral fellow (1931 to 1934, Alfred G. Lloyd and National Research Council Fellowships) at the University of Michigan and as an associate in zoology at the State University of Iowa from 1934 to 1937./nHis interest in vision was confirmed during a four-year research associateship in ophthalmology at Wayne University College of Medicine and culminated with the publication in 1942 of his book The Vertebrate Eye and its Adaptive Radiation. This 785-page classic contains about 200 illustrations, many of which Gordon Walls drew himself. In 1946 he joined the Faculty of the School of Optometry at the University of California. He came to Berkeley as an associate professor of physiological optics and optometry and lecturer in physiology. He also taught courses in morphology and physiology of the eye, physiological optics, evolution of the visual system, and color vision. He was appointed professor in 1952. Walls died in 1962 by a heart attack.[1]/nIn 1942 Walls published The Vertebrate Eye and its Adaptive Radiation a classic on eye physiology and evolution. In this book Walls described a diversity of rod cells and cone cells in the animal world. He detected the communalities of photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate eye and was first in describing the cone cell as a specialized cell, obviously evolved from an early rod cell. He described the nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting with their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.[2]/nIn 1958 Walls wrote a chapter in The eye in evolution, the first volume (780 pages) of Stewart Duke-Elder's work System of Ophthalmology, a monumental multivolume contribution to medical literature.[3] In all, he published more than sixty journal papers and monographs, one book, and chapters to three other books.[4]", "18517854": "Anne E. Warner FRS (25 August 1940 \u2013 16 May 2012)[1] was a British biologist and a professor in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at University College London.[2] Her major field of research was morphogenesis.[3] Warner was known for her work and leadership in a variety of research projects and organisations. She is perhaps most well known for her roles as a cell electrophysiologist, politician of science, and founder of the organisation UCL centre CoMPLEX.[4][5][6][7][8][9]/nBorn Anne Elizabeth Brookes on 25 August 1940 at Golders Green, she was the only child of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Marshall) and James Frederick Crompton Brooks (1914\u20131996), an engineer in the Ministry of Aircraft Production.[10] She was educated at Pate's Grammar School for Girls in Cheltenham, going on to study at University College London where she graduated with a BSc in physiology.[10] She studied for her PhD at the National Institute for Medical Research under the supervision of Otto Hutter, receiving her doctorate in 1964 at the age of 23.[4] That same year she took up a staff position at the Institute and began research into the effect of pH on skeletal muscle chloride conductance./nWarner was a participant and leader in a wide variety of research projects, and is best known for her work into the role of gap junctions in embryological development, which she began to pursue during the late 1970s following her research at the National Institute for Medical Research.[4] For the last 20 years before Warner began her research on gap junctions, embryologists had been working hard to prove that gap junctions were the means through which cells communicated and associated into tissues during embryological development. Warner, along with her colleague Sarah Guthrie, was said to have ended this journey with her discovery and conclusions.[11] While working with the embryos of frogs,[12] Warner observed \"electrical coupling\"[13] between adjacent cells, meaning that an induced change in the resting voltage of one cell resulted in a corresponding change in an adjacent cell, which demonstrated the fact that junctions between the cells are responsible for transporting ions from one location to the next.[11] However, Warner noticed that the gap junctions appeared to be present during some developmental stages, but not others./nTo prove the essential role of these gap junctions in embryological development, Warner conducted experiments during the 1980s to block these junctions and observe the resulting effects.[11] Using the 8-cell-embryos of the African clawed frog, Xenopus,[14][15] she used antibody injections to block the channels in the connections of the gap junctions. After injecting the embryos with a specific antibody, which was said to have blocked the channels of gap junctions, Warner confirmed the blockage of the channels by injecting dyes into the cells in addition to confirming the lack of electrical coupling that she observed in earlier experiments.[11]/nAfter confirming the successful blocking of the gap junctions in the 8-cell-embryos, Warner continued to grow the embryos and took note that due to the blockage of the gap junctions, development of the toads was abnormal.[11] Thus, Warner was the scientist responsible for confirming the crucial role of gap junction in the successful and normal development of cells from embryos to mature organisms. Through this discovery, Warner contributed to the growing research on the process of cell proliferation and maturation from an embryo to a fully functioning organism./nIn addition to her research, Warner was involved in many scientific organisations, often in a leadership role.[citation needed] She was a member of NERC, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, the Roslin Institute, the editorial board of The Journal of Physiology, the Committee of The Physiological Society, and many Medical Research Council boards and policy committees. In 1976, Warner returned to her alma mater, University College London, when she was appointed as a lecturer at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine.[4] Throughout her years of work at the university, Warner held several positions including the position of Reader at the Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology and Royal Society Foulerton Professor, an honour she received in 1986.[4] In addition, Warner was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1985.[citation needed][16] Of all of the organisations and leadership roles that Warner was involved in, she is perhaps most well known for her role as vice-president of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) council and Director of the CoMPLEX (Centre of Mathematics, Physics, and Life Sciences) at the University College London. With Warner's role in the MBA, she is partially responsible for the organisation's survival and legacy to this day. Among many of the programs that Warner initiated in the organisation, she founded the cell physiology Workshop in 1984, which was responsible for creating many cell physiologist cohorts across the world.[4] As director of the UCL CoMPLEX during its infantile stages, Warner was a co-founder of the organisation and fostered its development during her many years as its leader. As the leader of the organisation, Warner brought together a variety of different scientists to work towards the common goal of developing the field of biology. The organisation became an example and model for similar organisations in other countries.[4] Her work with the organisations that she was involved in created a lasting legacy through her many programs that are still used today./nWarner met her husband Michael while they were both members of the stage crew at University College London. Her husband predeceased her by a few weeks./nHer health declined after a heart valve replacement that her body did not accept well, and at this time she was no longer able to be physically involved in the many organisations that she was a part of. However, she remained in communication with the organisations and gave them advice throughout the time of her illness. After an extended illness she died on 16 May 2012 at University College Hospital, Camden, of a cerebral haemorrhage.[10] Upon her death, one particular colleague of the UCL wrote an article about Warner which demonstrated her personality that enabled her to reach many of her goals in life.[17] Warner was known as a formidable lady who brought together her colleagues through her perseverance and motivation to solve problems. Through her efforts, Warner dedicated her life to making a difference in her field of research and the many organisations that she was a part of.", "64196447": "Michael Grimes (1888\u20131977) was a scientist and researcher from Ireland.

The nuclear lamina provides structural support to the nucleus and is invaluable in its role in cell differentiation in the embryonic stage and its role in regulating certain cellular events such as cell division and DNA replication.   Although her research is concerned with the functional role of the nuclear lamina the applications of her research may provide insight into the causes and genetic origins of laminopathies./nLaminopathies are a group of rare genetic disorders that are caused by defects in genes that code for the nuclear lamina.[2]  Symptoms of laminopathy may include muscular dystrophy, diabetes, dysplasia and progeria (premature aging).[2]  Although there are a number of rare mutations that may result in laminopathy one of the most well researched causes is a mutation in the gene coding for lamin A/C (LMNA).[3] Dr. Parnaik's research is concerned with discovering the cause of a number of defects on the nuclear level that result from mutations in LMNA that include failure to differentiate in adipose tissue, impaired nuclear integrity, impairment in the cell's ability to respond to DNA damaging agents, and cellular toxicity which may lead to premature aging.[2]/nA large role of Dr. Parnaik's research into the nuclear lamina is focused on the nuclear lamins, fibrous proteins found in the nuclear lamina that provide structural support and are essential for proper cell differentiation and gene regulation.  Through her research, Dr. Parnaik has made considerable progress in understanding the role of nuclear lamins during embryonic development.  She identified human lamin A/C as being invaluable to proper embryonic development by demonstrating that depletion leads to improper cell differentiation in stem cells.[3]  In cells where lamin A/C has been depleted the stem cells fail to differentiate into endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm.[3]  In addition to stem cell differentiation, Dr. Parnaik's research has also shown a relationship between lamin A/C and cyclin D3.[4]  From her research, Dr. Parnaik pointed towards a complex that formed between lamin A/C and cyclin D3 that played an important role in muscle cell differentiation.[4] Dr. Parnaik's research may pave the way to new understanding of how cell's differentiate in the embryonic stage and may provide insight into how mutations and deletions in these molecules may explain certain embryonic defects and failures to differentiate./nDr. Parnaik has served on the Executive Committee of the Indian Society of Cell Biology for numerous years (1991-1994, 2003-2005, and 2007-2009) and she served as the president of the Society from 2011 to 2013.[1]  In 2004 she was elected Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy in New Delhi and in 2008 she was elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in Bangalore.

Membrane transporters, and their roles in metabolism, drug transport and signaling are being investigated heavily in Giulio Superti-Furga\u2019s laboratory. As they are overall a large and neglected gene family in humans, Giulio Superti-Furga proposed to intensify and coordinate research on the largest group of membrane transporters in the human genome, the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily.[21]/nA large part of Giulio Superti-Furga\u2019s laboratory in working in the RESOLUTE and REsolution projects supported by the IMI, the EU and the EFPIA. RESOLUTE and REsolution are private-public partnerships co-led by Giulio Superti-Furga and Claire Steppan (Pfizer). On one hand, RESOLUTE's goal is to intensify research on SLCs worldwide and to establish them as a novel target class for medical research.[22] On the other hand, The REsolution project focuses on human genetic variations in transporters and their link to human disease, and it links the RESOLUTE knowledge to physiology and disease through human genetics. To that end, RESOLUTE and REsolution are empowering the scientific community with biological tools and data sets for SLC research, developing robust transport assays,[23] and compiling the information in the SLC knowledgebase.[24][25]/nBesides the systems biology approach used in RESOLUTE / REsolution for the whole family of SLCs, Giulio\u2019s laboratory also focuses on individual transporters. His lab showed that the supply of purines, as well as the purine synthesis of a cell can influence BRD4 activity and thus play a role in the carcinogenesis process.[26] Additionally, in cooperation with scientists from the University of Bari, Giulio\u2019s lab identified the protein responsible for the important transport of NAD into mitochondria: the SLC25A51 transporter.[27] Also his laboratory contributed to elucidate the role of SLC38A9 in the mechanism by which the cell recognizes the presence of amino acids and thereby controls mTOR activity.[28][29]/nThe central aim of personalized medicine is to find the right treatment for the right patient at the right time. Giulio Superti-Furga developed new approaches with applications in precision medicine. In collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna, Giulio developed a technique called \u201cPharmacoscopy\u201d to screen primary patient material using automated confocal microscopy and quantify single-cell events such as differential cell death, protein expression, cell morphology \u2013 creating robust and unique data sets.[30][31] This technology allowed to determine the best treatment for patients with late stage and refractory hematological malignancies.[32] Within the framework of EXALT (Extended Analysis for Leukemia/Lymphoma Treatment), this novel approach was tested and the result was that most advanced patients with aggressive hematological cancers clearly benefited from the approach.[33]/nGiulio Superti-Furga\u2019s research has a long-standing interest in understanding the molecular wiring of transformed cells of the haematopoietic system, as well as studying the mode of action of targeted agents counteracting leukemia cell proliferation.[34]/nGiulio Superti-Furga's lab, in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna, identified sensitivities among 15 myeloid leukemia cell lines by using a small drug library (CeMM Library of Metabolic Drugs; CLIMET) targeting a variety of metabolic pathways.[35] Previously, he also showed that SLC proteins located in different sub-cellular compartments are amenable to degradation by ligand-induced proteolysis.[36] Furthermore, in a pioneering study by his laboratory, they found that a particular transporter, was required for an experimental cancer drug\u00a0 to enter cells and exert its activity,[37] which later led to a systematic investigation on the role of transporters in determining the activity of a large and diverse set of cytotoxic compounds.[38] In 2018, driven by the interest in identifying underlying genetic determinants of drug response in a specific type of cancer of the haematopoietic system, his lab reported on the mechanistic link between RAS and the LZTR1 gene, previously associated with a variety of rare disorders.[39] Furthermore, Giulio\u2019s lab with Florian Grebien\u2019s lab and Johannes Zuber\u2019s lab were able to identify common, conserved molecular mechanisms that drive oncogenesis in the context of the large number of different MLL-fusion proteins.[40]/nHis laboratory has been also interested in better characterize the impact of known drugs on cells, using various omics approaches. The laboratory developed a small molecule interaction mapping technology using mass spectrometric thermal stability shifts at the proteome-wide level.[41] Giulio also identified new target candidates for known drugs, previously unknown mechanisms of drug resistance, \u201ceffector\u201d genes for the compounds, mechanisms of synergy between compounds[42] and, in a few cases, indeed new medical use of existing drugs.[43][44]/nGiulio Superti-Furga is also interested in understanding how the body responds to foreign threats, such as bacterial and viral infections, and how autoimmune defenses are triggered when these defenses go awry. Recently, his lab determined by biochemistry and mass spectrometry the molecular interactions that involved SLC15A4, which led to the identification of an uncharacterized protein CXorf21 (named TASL). Strikingly, the lab found that TASL harbors a specific motif essential for the recruitment and activation of IRF5.[45][46]/nOver the past decade, his lab has discovered that viruses employ a multitude of ways to both subvert as well as coup the host cellular system, and that the host largely relies on the homeostasis of the cellular system to detect and inhibit viral intrusion.[47] Furthermore, in collaboration with the University of Geneva, discovered that SLC4A7 plays an essential role in phagocytosis and phagosome acidification. His research also combined genetic perturbations of sphingolipid metabolism with the quantification of diverse steps in TLR signaling and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, which revealed that membrane lipid composition was affected by these perturbations.[48][49]/nGiulio Superti-Furga is interested in many aspects of science, from hard-core biochemistry and molecular biology to the processes leading to innovation and creativity of whole communities.

As a child, Edith Kann lived first in Spitz and from 1911 in Vienna. From 1918 to 1926 she attended the Realgymnasium for civil servants' daughters Vienna VIII, after which she completed the Lehramt (teacher qualification) for natural history and geography at the University of Vienna. In 1930 and 1931 she took part in limnological summer courses at the biological research station at Lunz am See and began her dissertation under Franz Ruttner (1882\u20131981) on the ecology of the littoral algae of the Lunzer See (Lake Lunz). On March 21, 1931, she received her doctorate \"sub auspiciis Praesidentis\" from the University of Vienna. On June 6, 1932, she passed her teaching examination. Because she became unemployed after the probationary year as a result of the global economic crisis, Kann went to Ankara as a private teacher from 1935 to 1936.

His scientific interest was devoted to a broad spectrum of geological topics: volcanism, petrology, fossils, stratigraphy and mountain formation. His most remembered accomplishment is the scientific definition of the Jurassic system./nBuch studied with Alexander von Humboldt under Abraham Gottlob Werner at the mining school in Freiberg, Saxony. He afterwards completed his education at the universities of Halle and G\u00f6ttingen.[2]/nHe began writing on geological topics early in life.  His Versuch einer mineralogischen Beschreibung von Landeck (Breslau, 1797) was translated into French (Paris, 1805), and into English as Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of Landeck (Edinburgh, 1810). In 1802 he published Entwurf einer geognostischen Beschreibung von Schlesien (\"The Geognosy of Silesia\"), which became the first volume of his Geognostische Beobachtungen auf Reisen durch Deutschland und Italien (\"Geognistic Observations while Travelling through Germany and Italy\", see below). He was at this time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of Werner, with some modifications. In 1797, he met Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the geological formations of Styria, and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of 1798, Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where his faith in the Neptunian theory was shaken. In his early works, he had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations,[2] but now he saw cause to abandon Werner's theory, and to recognize the volcanic origin of the basalts./nHe saw Vesuvius for the first time in 1799. Later, in 1805, he had the opportunity, along with Humboldt and Gay Lussac, of witnessing its actual eruption. It was a remarkable eruption, and supplied Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained regarding volcanoes. In 1802 he examined the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne in the south of France. The aspect of the Puy de D\u00f4me, with its cone of trachyte and its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The results of all these geological travels were given to the world in the two volumes of his Geognostische Beobachtungen (Berlin, 1802 and 1809).[2]/nIn 1806, Buch proceeded to Scandinavia and spent two years in examining its physical constitution. This furnished the materials for his work entitled Reise durch Norwegen und Lappland (\"Travels in Norway and Lapland\", Berlin, 1810).  He made many important observations on the geography of plants, on climatology and on geology. He showed that many of the erratic blocks on the North German plains must have come from Scandinavia. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederikshald to \u00c5bo.[2]/nIn 1815 Buch visited the Canary Islands in company with Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist. These volcanic isles furnished the starting point from which Buch commenced a regular course of study on the production and activity of volcanoes. This is attested by his standard work on the subject entitled Physical Description of the Canary Isles (1825). His observations convinced him that these and other islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the most intense kind, whereas the groups of islands in the South Sea were the remains of a pre-existing continent.[2] During his time in the Canary Islands, he visited the Las Ca\u00f1adas Caldera on Tenerife and the Caldera de Taburiente on La Palma. When he published his memoirs and observations about his excursion, he introduced the Spanish word \"Caldera\" (meaning \"Bowl\") into the geological and scientific vocabulary.[citation needed] After his return from the Canaries he visited the basaltic group of the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland and Ireland.[2]/nBuch's geological excursions, even in countries which he had repeatedly visited before, continued without interruption until a very advanced age: eight months before his death he visited the mountains of Auvergne, and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic formation before the Academy of Berlin. Humboldt, who had known him intimately for a period of more than sixty years, called him the greatest geologist of that period.

His graduate work centered on the mushroom Morchella esculenta and the yeast Hansenula anomala./nAfter completing his Ph.D., Brock took a position in the antibiotics research department at the Upjohn Company in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where out of necessity he became self-taught in microbiology and molecular biology.  By the time he left Upjohn, he had published six papers in respectable journals and become a member of the Society of American Bacteriologists.  In 1957, Brock joined the faculty of the Department of Biology at Western Reserve University.  In 1960, he accepted the position of assistant professor of bacteriology at Indiana University, where he was promoted to full professorship in 1964.

From a sample of pink bacteria collected from Mushroom Spring, Brock and undergraduate student Hudson Freeze isolated an organism thriving at 70\u00a0\u00b0C (160\u00a0\u00b0F) which they named Thermus aquaticus.  The ability of an enzyme (DNA polymerase) from T. aquaticus to tolerate high temperatures would, 20 years later, make possible the  invention of a procedure called polymerase chain reaction.  PCR utilizes an enzyme from T. aquaticus, now known as Taq polymerase, to make multiple copies of a part of a DNA molecule. PCR can also be used to introduce specifically chosen mutations into DNA, and for numerous other ways of manipulating or analyzing DNA.[6] Kary Mullis, jointly with Michael Smith, who had invented another essential method of manipulating DNA, was awarded a Nobel Prize[7] in chemistry.[8]/nIn 1970 Brock wrote a college textbook Biology of Microorganisms, and published 7 editions alone or with co-authors.

While the birds did not originally seem sick, they ended up losing six per cent of their body weight over six hours and ate up to 70 per cent less.[8] As a result, she openly criticized the EPAs approval of sulfoxaflor as an alternative pesticide by saying it \"lingers a long time in water bodies, exposing aquatic insects to low but long-term doses of the chemical.\"[9] Overall, Morrissey's research showed that 500 million boreal forest birds have been lost since 1970, a 33 per cent decline in populations.[10] In an effort to combat neonicotinoids, she formed the Canadian Prairie Agroecosystem Resilience Network with 30 university researchers, nine international organizations, and more than 30 partners from government, non-government agencies, agriculture industry groups and First Nations.[11]/nIn 2020, Morrissey was elected to the Royal Society of Canada's College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists.[11]", "34607088": "Augustus Hamilton[1] (1 March 1853 \u2013 12 October 1913) was a New Zealand ethnologist, biologist and museum director.

During a five-decade career with the United States Bureau of Fisheries, United States Fish and Wildlife Service and its Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, Sette pioneered the integration of fisheries science with the sciences of oceanography and meteorology to develop a complete understanding of the physical and biological characteristics of the ocean environment and the effects of those characteristics on fisheries and fluctuations in the abundance of fish.[1] He is recognized both in the United States and internationally for many significant contributions he made to marine fisheries research and for his leadership in the maturation of fisheries science to encompass fisheries oceanography,[3] defined as the \"appraisal or exploitation of any kind of [marine] organism useful to Man\" [2] and \"the study of oceanic processes affecting the abundance and availability of commercial fishes.\"[2] Many fisheries scientists consider him to be the \"father of modern fisheries science.\"[3]/nOscar Elton Sette was born in Clyman, Wisconsin,[2] on 29 July 1900, the fourth child and second son of Martin and Louise Sette.[1] After a few years the family moved to Juneau, Wisconsin, and in 1910 to a lemon ranch in Chula Vista, California.[1] As a child, Sette developed an early interest in nature and living things and became an avid butterfly collector, which became a lifelong hobby.[1]/nSette attended National City High School in National City, California. After graduation in 1917, he began studies at San Diego Junior College in San Diego, California,  planning to transfer to the University of California in Berkeley in the fall of 1918 to study entomology. By chance, however, he met his high school chemistry teacher, Elmer Higgins, on a San Diego street in 1918. Higgins was working as a scientific assistant at the California State Fisheries Laboratory in San Pedro, and he invited Sette to accompany him on an exploratory trawling trip in a fishing boat. Sette immediately was fascinated with the variety of sea creatures caught in the fishing trawler's nets and decided to pursue a career as a fisheries scientist. The California State Fisheries Laboratory soon hired him to check canneries for albacore landings, beginning his career in fisheries science at the age of 18.[1][2]/nSette scrapped his plans to attend the University of California, instead entering service in the United States Army in 1918 during the late stages of World War I. After his discharge in 1919, he became part of the staff of the  California State Fisheries Laboratory. Sardines had become increasingly important commercially in the United States, and in 1920 he received his first major assignment for the laboratory, which was to study the sardine fishery off California to assist the laboratory in improving its understanding of the life cycle and behavior of sardines and to determine the effect of fishing on sardine stocks. Based in Monterey, California, Sette found the fluctuation of sardine populations from year to year to be of particular interest. Based on his work at Monterey, he wrote his first article on fisheries, discussing the Monterey fishery, his work there, and the need to better understand changes in the abundance and size of fish in order to manage fish stocks properly; the article was published in California Fish and Game[1] in 1920 with the title \"The Sardine Problem in the Monterey Bay District.\"[2] The interest in the reasons for fluctuations in fish size and populations stayed with him for the rest of his life and played a major role in his career.[1][2]/nOn September 1, 1920, Sette took a leave of absence to attend Stanford University in Stanford, California, and finish college. Stanford was a major center for the study of fisheries on the United States West Coast, and while there, he studied under the noted ichthyologist and educator David Starr Jordan (1851\u20131931). Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Zoology in June 1922,[1][2] he returned to the California State Fisheries Laboratory, working in Monterey during the sardine fishing season and for the rest of the year at the San Pedro Laboratory, where he conducted research related to the tuna fishery. His first academic paper on fisheries \u2013 providing statistics on the sardine fishery and describing sampling systems he used at Monterey \u2013 resulted from this work, and it was accepted for publication in April 1924.[1]/nImpressed by Sette's use of statistics in studying the sardine fishery at Monterey, United States Commissioner of Fisheries Henry O'Malley hired Sette in 1924 to work at the headquarters of the United States Bureau of Fisheries in Washington, D.C., as Chief of the Division of Fishery Industries.[1][2] Beginning work in his new position on January 8, 1924,[4] Sette supervised the bureau's research in fishery technology, particularly the canning and preservation of fishery products, as well the distribution of technological and production information on fisheries to the public. He also was responsible for a special effort to improve the United States Government\u2032s system of collecting and publishing fisheries statistics. He wrote annual statistical arid economic reports of United States fisheries and articles concerning commercial fisheries for bureau publications and trade journals.[1]/nIn addition to his administrative and supervisory responsibilities in Washington, Sette remained active in fisheries biology, particularly as it related to his interest in fluctuations in the abundance of fish stocks.[1] As early as 1911, the Bureau of Fisheries had expressed interest in working as part of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to determine the reasons for fluctuations in the annual catch of Atlantic mackerel in the Atlantic Ocean, but the United States had withdrawn from the ICES in 1916 after making little progress.[2] Having himself noted highly variable annual Atlantic mackerel catches, Sette began an investigation of the Atlantic mackerel on his own initiative. His former chemistry teacher Elmer Higgins, now also at the Bureau of Fisheres in Washington as Chief of the Division of Scientific Inquiry, noted his work on the Atlantic mackerel and offered him a position as a full-time fisheries investigator in his division, which Sette accepted in 1928.[1]/nAt the same time that Sette took up his new duties in Higgins' division, the Bureau of Fisheries was establishing regional research teams, or \"investigations,\" to investigate fisheries around the United States, and Sette became the chief of one of them, the North Atlantic Fishery Investigations. Sette set up the headquarters of the new investigations office at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under his guidance, the Bureau of Fisheries' understanding of Atlantic Ocean fisheries off the United States East Coast increased substantially.[1] Each summer, Sette also served as director of the Bureau's Fisheries Station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts.[1][2]/nSette himself conducted research of the Atlantic mackerel fishery aboard the Bureau of Fisheries research ship Albatross II from 1926 until 1932. After a preliminary cruise in 1926, his research aboard Abatross II began in earnest in 1927, focusing on the effects of changes in ecological conditions on Atlantic mackerel eggs and larvae. Before his research ended abruptly in June 1932, when the aging ship became uneconomical to operate and was decommissioned, he concluded that mortality rates among Atlantic mackerel larvae changed from year to year according to variations in drift based on winds and not, as had earlier been proposed, based on changes in mortality at the critical period when larvae switched over from their yolk sacs to exogenous food sources.[2] Sette's study pioneered the computation of population estimates of larval fish growth and mortality rates.[2]/nIn addition to his official duties, Sette pursued postgraduate studies and received a Master of Arts in Biology from Harvard University in 1930.[1][2]/nMeanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean fishery off the U.S. West Coast, a \"sardine crisis\" was looming.  From 1916 through 1939, the annual sardine catch had more than doubled every six years, and had reached an annual high of about 1,500,000,000 pounds (680,000,000\u00a0kg) in 1936. Although California state biologists had warned against overfishing, the California state government had been unable to regulate sardine fishing through legislation. Amid rising concerns about the food supply in the United States, the Bureau of Fisheries sent Sette \u2013 who had demonstrated his ability to manage fisheries and had experience in the California sardine fishery and good contacts in the California fishing industry \u2013 to California in 1937 under a Congressional mandate to conduct sardine research that would allow better management of the Pacific sardine fishery. Sette became director of the bureau's new South Pacific Fisheries Investigations and established the organization's headquarters on the campus of Stanford University with instructions to \"direct and perform research on the nature and causes of fluctuations in pelagic fish populations.\"[1][2]  Sette quickly developed a plan for the study of the life cycle of the sardine in relation to the fishery; his plan included ecological studies of all stages of the life history of sardines as well as studies of the impact of fishing that contrasted sharply with the more narrowly focused fisheries research approach that preceded them.[2] He enlisted the assistance of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, thereby ensuring that ecological factors would be part of the findings in his sardine investigations.[2]/nSette at first encountered hostility and resistance in California, where the Chief of the State Bureau of Marine Fisheries, N.B. Schofield, who resented federal intervention in California fisheries investigations, openly urged Sette to abandon his mission and return to Washington. The local fishing industry also viewed federal involvement in its activities with suspicion and preferred no federal intervention in California fisheries. Sette, however, overcame the hostility and opposition through tact and diplomacy, and his previous work in fisheries science and honesty in his dealings won over those who opposed him.[1]/nFisheries research was interrupted by the U.S. participation in World War II from 1941 to 1945, when manpower was short and many fishing vessels were commandeered for the support of the war effort. Sette nonetheless remained influential in U.S. West Coast fisheries management, serving as a paid consultant for the San Francisco Sardine Association and the California Sardine Products Institute from 1942 to 1947 and as Area Coordinator of Fisheries for California from 1943 to 1945. He commanded such respect in his paid consultancy that the sardine organizations followed his advice without question even when he refused to endorse their proposals for increased catches, and in his area coordinator role he succeeded in strictly controlling all fishing vessels and fish processing plants operating in California and off its coast, assigning fishing boats to plants and then shifting them around to ensure that all plants would remain in operation and no waste would occur \u2013 all despite a fiercely competitive environment in the California fishing industry.[1] Throughout the period, he held that proper management of fisheries required an understanding of the causes of fluctuation in fish populations and in 1943 published a paper that emphasized the need to understand the causes of mortality of fish early in their life cycle to truly understand fishery fluctuations.[2]/nAfter World War II ended in 1945, commercial fishing in the United States experienced a boom as demand for fish to feed a growing population attracted international investment. International meetings to discuss fishery issues of common interest increased in frequency and stature, and Sette was a U.S. representative at many of these. The sardine fishery quickly declined alarmingly, and in response the California state government in 1947 created a Marine Research Committee made up of fishing industry representatives, with Sette as its scientific advisor. Sette, who had pondered fluctuating fisheries since 1920, was influential in the committee's decision to create the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program, which in 1953 was renamed the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), in which five U.S. Government agencies, California state government agencies, and universities took part. Sette played a prominent role in planning the new effort, and in doing so made one of his greatest contributions to the maturation of fisheries science by pioneering the integration of fisheries research with that of oceanography and meteorology to gain a complete picture of the impact of the environment on fisheries.[1][2]/nTuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean had also come under significant pressure since the end of World War II, and the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2013 which had absorbed the old Bureau of Fisheries in 1940 and would be reorganized in 1956 as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \u2013 responded by building a new Honolulu Laboratory adjacent to the campus of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, Hawaii, purchasing two research ships to support its efforts, and creating the new Pacific Ocean Fisheries Investigations (POFI). In 1949, Sette became the first director of the new laboratory and of POFI.[1][2] Drawing on his experience in California, he set up an integrated team of fisheries scientists, oceanographers, and meteorologists to pursue a pioneering program to understand not only the effect of environmental phenomena on oceanic fishes as they studied tuna populations along the equator, but also to gain a greater general understanding of the region. During the studies, a member of his team, oceanographer Townsend Cromwell (1922\u20131958), in 1952 discovered what became known as the Cromwell Current. The POFI team's integrated effort under Sette's overall direction greatly advanced scientific knowledge of the equatorial Pacific Ocean.[1]/nIn 1955, the Fish and Wildlife Service created a new program, Ocean Research, and made Sette its director. Again, Sette took charge of a new laboratory and, from a headquarters on the campus of Stanford University, pioneered yet another new aspect of fisheries science, namely, an examination of all available data concerning the oceans and development of an understanding of how they relate to the abundance and distribution of fish. He again created a team of biologists, oceanographers, and meteorologists, and they analyzed a mass of data on sea surface temperatures, weather observations, and all known data on the abundance of fish over time. By 1961, Sette had published analysis that demonstrated that abundance in a fishery depended not only fish population size itself, but also on the availability of the fish population to exploitation by fishing vessels, with oceanographic and meteorological factors playing a role in the latter as currents and weather differed from year to year. One of the team's innovative achievements was the publication of an atlas of 168 monthly mean sea surface temperature charts for the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20\u00b0 North covering the years 1949 through 1962.[1][2]/nWhile directing the Ocean Research project \u2013 which was placed under the control of the Fish and Wildlife Service's new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries when the bureau was created in 1956 \u2013 Sette pursued a doctoral degree, receiving a Ph.D. in Biology from Stanford University in 1957. He also lectured at the university.[1][2]/nSette retired from U.S. Government service in March 1970, but was immediately rehired as a paid annuitant and continued to work in the Ocean Research program until June 1970, when it completed its work and its office at Stanford closed.[1] He then took charge of the Ocean Ecology unit at the Tiburon Laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries Service \u2013 an element of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created along with NOAA in 1970 that replaced the Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and took over almost all of its functions \u2013 in Menlo Park, California.[2] In July 1970, he became a member of the editorial board of the Fishery Bulletin of the Fish and Wildlife Service, which was renamed the Fishery Bulletin[5] in 1971./nAs director of the Ocean Ecology unit, Sette continued work on various issues in fisheries science, including an analysis of the Alaska herring fishery, until his death.[1]/nSette married the former Elizabeth G. Jackson on December 20, 1924. They had a daughter.[1]/nA lifelong butterfly collector, Sette maintained a substantial collection of the insects and wrote authoritative articles describing them. He also was an avid tennis player and gardener, employing composting techniques long before their widespread adoption. He also became an amateur meteorologist and entomologist.[1]/nSette strongly believed in the value of informal meetings and chaired, or was a committee member of, numerous planning and steering committees during his career. He helped to design and actively participated in the Sardine Meetings from their beginning in 1920, played a major role in organizing the Pacific Tuna Conferences, and helped structure and participated actively in the CalCOFI Conferences as their scientific advisor.[1][2] While attending the 1954 meeting of the Oceanography Fisheries Meteorology Committee, he proposed that groups involved in related fisheries science studies in the eastern Pacific Ocean coordinate the planning and execution of their work at sea and exchange information on the results of their research; the Committee approved his proposal at its 1955 meeting, and in 1956 the Eastern Pacific Oceanic Conference (EPOC) was created to carry out his idea by serving as a forum for the discussion of oceanographic research and as a medium for the coordination of research by diverse, geographically separated academic and governmental agencies. EPOC first met in 1956 with Sette as its chairman, and he served EPOC for the next 15 years. He also took part in many other international conferences and meetings during his career, including service as an official U.S. delegate to the Indo-Pacific Fisheries Council in Singapore in 1949 and to the International Technical Conference on the Living Resources of the Sea in Rome in 1955, and as an advisor to the U.S. delegation at a Fisheries Conference in Santiago, Chile, in 1955 and to the U.S. delegation at the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1958.[1][2]/nAmong the more important academic papers Sette wrote during his career were:[1][2]/nSette was an advisor to the University of California's Institute of Marine Sciences and a member of the Ocean Resources Panel of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Fisheries Society, the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, the American Wildlife Society, the Biometric Society, the California Academy of Sciences, the Oceanographic Society of the Pacific, the Western Society of Naturalists, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi. He was a founding fellow of the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[1]/nOn January 16, 1961, Sette received the U.S. Department of the Interior's highest award, the Distinguished Service Award, for outstanding service to the U.S. Government.[1] The citation for the award, signed by United States Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton (1909\u20131974) and delivered before an audience of several hundred people, read in part:/n\"Dr. Sette is an internationally recognized leader in marine science, highly respected by his contemporaries in University, State, and Federal Service.

He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea in the Pacific Ocean from the deck of the NOAA research ship NOAAS David Starr Jordan (R 444) on September 7, 1972.[5]/nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration named one of its research ships, NOAAS Oscar Elton Sette (R 335), for Sette.[3] The ship was commissioned on January 23, 2003.[6]/nSince 1991, the Marine Fisheries Section of the American Fisheries Society has presented the annual Oscar E.

He has long stated an interest in developing a scientific semiotics (particularly biosemiotics) that would contribute to both linguistic theory and cognitive neuroscience.[1]/nDeacon's research combines human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. His work extends from laboratory-based cellular-molecular neurobiology to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language and language origins. His neurobiological research is focused on determining the nature of the human divergence from typical primate brain anatomy, the cellular-molecular mechanisms producing this difference, and the correlations between these anatomical differences and special human cognitive abilities, again, particularly language.[1]/nHis 1997 book, The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain is widely considered a seminal work in the subject of evolutionary cognition. His approach to semiotics, thoroughly described in the book, is fueled by a career-long interest in the ideas of the late 19th-century American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce. In it, he uses the metaphors of parasite and host to describe language and the brain, respectively, arguing that the structures of language have co-evolved to adapt to their brain hosts./nHis 2011 book, Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, explores the properties of life, the emergence of consciousness, and the relationship between evolutionary and semiotic processes. The book speculates on how properties such as information, value, purpose, meaning, and end-directed behavior emerged from physics and chemistry. Critics of the book argue that Deacon has drawn heavily from the works of Alicia Juarrero and Evan Thompson without providing full citations or references, but a UC Berkeley investigation exonerated Deacon.[2]/nIn contrast to the arguments presented by Juarrero in Dynamics in Action (1999, MIT Press) and by Thompson in Mind in Life (2007, Belknap Press and Harvard University Press), Deacon explicitly rejects claims that living or mental phenomena can be explained by dynamical systems approaches.[3] Instead, Deacon argues that life- or mind-like properties only emerge from a higher-order reciprocal relationship between self-organizing processes.", "38506504": "Adam \u0141omnicki (28 June 1935 \u2013 15 December 2021) was a Polish evolutionary biologist and ecologist, a member of Polish Academy of Sciences, Polish Academy of Learning and Academia Europaea, professor of Mammal Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences./n\u0141omnicki graduated in Biology from the Jagiellonian University.

Even though she had to overcome many difficulties, she was able to make a significant contribution to science that will never fade. In addition to inspiring and influencing our understanding of the natural world, Villepreux-Power's work has set the path for upcoming generations of marine scientists./nJeanne Villepreux-Power, born Jeanne Villepreux (24 September 1794 \u2013 25 January 1871), was a pioneering French marine biologist who in 1832 was the first person to create aquaria for experimenting with aquatic organisms. The English biologist Richard Owen referred to her as the \"Mother of Aquariophily.\"[1] She was the inventor of the aquarium and the systematic application of the aquarium to study marine life, which is still used today. In her time as a forefront cephalopods researcher, she proved that the Argonauta argo produces its own shells, as opposed to acquiring them.[2] Villepreux-Power was also a noted dressmaker,[3] author, and conservationist, as well as the first female member of the Catania Accademia Gioenia.[4]/nVillepreux-Power was born in Juillac, Corr\u00e8ze, on September 24[2] or 25th, 1794,[5] the eldest child of a shoemaker and a seamstress.[2] She lived until age 18 in rural  France.[2] Where she learned to read and write.[5] With the exception of reading and writing, Jeanne's schooling was fairly basic.[6] They had to live on a strict budget and her mother died when she was eleven years old./nAt the age of 18, in 1812, she walked to Paris to become a dressmaker, a distance of over 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi). The relative who was designated as her travel guardian assaulted her on the way to Paris and took her identity documents with him.[7] She have to seek refuge in an Orleans police station until she could receive new travel documents.[5]/nDue to that delay, her initial opportunity had since been occupied by someone else. She found another opportunity working as a seamstress assistant.[5] She built out and proved her skills many times over, until she became fairly well known./nIn 1816, she became well known for creating the wedding gown of Princess Caroline in her wedding to Charles-Ferdinand de Bourbon. She met and married the English merchant James Power in 1818, and she took the surname Villepreux-Power following their marriage. The couple moved to Sicily and settled in Messina where they lived for about 25 years.[8]/nIt was after moving to Sicily where Jeannette Villepreux-Power took an interest in continuing her education. She began to study geology, archeology, and natural history;[9] in particular she made physical observations and experiments on marine and terrestrial animals. She wanted to inventory the island's ecosystem[8] and did so during frequent walks around the city. She was a self-taught naturalist who explored Sicily, cataloging and commenting on its flora and fauna while gathering examples of minerals, fossils, butterflies, and shells.[10] As she traveled, she would document and collect samples which were later compiled and published in Itinerario della Sicilia riguardante tutti i rami di storia naturale e parecchi di antichit\u00e0 che essa contiene and Guida per la Sicilia.[5]/nVillepreux-Power then began to more intently study cephalopods and other marine life and was in need of a vessel that would allow her better access to observation over time of the same marine animals.[4] While land animals could be observed somewhat easily, marine life was distinctly harder to examine. As such, she worked to develop a glass enclosure, ultimately developing three working models to study live marine life in and out of the water.[11] The first was the aquarium as we know it today; the second glass surrounded by a case that was submerged in the ocean; the third an anchored cage also to be submerged in the ocean for larger marine life like mollusks.[4] It was revolutionary at the time as she was the first to record that some species of octopuses could use tools to pry open their prey's shells.[12]/nIn 1834, a professor, Carmelo Maravigna, wrote in the Giornale Letterario dell\u2019Accademia Gioenia di Catania that Villepreux-Power should be credited with the invention of the aquarium and systematic application of it to the study of marine life.[13] She created three types of aquarium: a glass aquarium for her study, a submersible glass one in a cage, and a cage for larger molluscs that would anchor at sea.[14] Her first book was published in 1839 describing her experiments, called Observations et exp\u00e9riences physiques sur plusieurs animaux marins et terrestres.[14]/nHer second book, Guida per la Sicilia, was published in 1842.[14] It has been republished by the Historical Society of Messina.[15] She also studied molluscs and their fossils; in particular she favoured Argonauta argo. At the time, there was uncertainty over whether the Argonaut species produced its own shell, or acquired that of a different organism (similar to hermit crabs). Villepreux-Power's work showed that they do indeed produce their own shells.[8] As a groundbreaking discovery, there was a considerable amount of backlash that she received for her work.[9]/nVillepreux-Power was also concerned with conservation, and is credited with developing sustainable aquaculture principles in Sicily.[14] She was among the first to investigate aquaculture as a means of safeguarding and restoring fish and other marine animal populations.[12] Being intrigued also helped to find ideas of aquaculture, which is largely considered a more sustainable food source in the future, specifically through utilizing cages attached to the shore containing fish at different lifecycle stages to generate repopulation opportunities that could be moved to underpopulated rivers.[4]/nShe was the first woman member of the Catania Accademia Gioenia, and a correspondent member of the London Zoological Society and sixteen other learned societies.[16]/nShe gained admission into prestigious scientific societies after developing one of the most significant experimental tools in marine biological research.[17] One of her most important creations was the first glass aquarium. A critical pain point in the study of marine biology was fulfilled by Villepreux-Power's glass tank. Before it was created, studying marine species presented several difficulties for biologists. The development of marine biology as a scientific field was hampered by the incapacity to efficiently investigate these organisms in their native habitats. This problem was resolved by Villepreux-Power's idea, which helped scientists learn more about the biology and behavior of marine life./nLater, the modern style of glass aquarium was developed by the British biologist Philip Gosse (1810\u20131888). The first public aquarium opened in London in 1853, and Gosse supplied the units displayed there. Aquaria became popular among the middle classes. Following London, the Berlin Aquarium Unter den Linden (Berlin) opened its doors in 1869, and the Public Aquarium of Trocadero (Paris) opened its doors in 1867.[17]/nThe invention has evolved into something better and is still in use today. There are already more than 200 marine aquariums and ocean life centers across the globe. The world is seeing an increase in the construction of aquariums, which are now enjoyable destinations for both children and adults to explore. We wouldn't be able to examine and investigate aquatic life more easily without her innovation./nSince women were not permitted to give talks at academic conferences, enroll in colleges, or work in the scientific community, her results were disseminated around the globe via a proxy. Her research was given to the London Zoological Society on her behalf by Sir Richard Owen, the preeminent scientist in England before Charles Darwin. Throughout her experiments, they had been communicating with one another. In no time at all, it was published in German, French, and English and rapidly dispersed throughout Europe.[7]/nVillepreux-Power and her husband left Sicily in 1843, and many of her records and scientific drawings were lost in a shipwreck.[15][14] Although she continued to write, she conducted no further research.[14] She did, however, become a public speaker.[2] She and husband divided their time between Paris and London. She fled Paris during a siege by the Prussian Army in the winter of 1870, returning to Juilliac.[14] She died in January 1871./nIt wasn't until much later, in 1997, that Jeanne's work was rediscovered after she had been forgotten for more than a century. In 1997 her name, \"Villepreux-Power,\" was given to a crater on Venus discovered by the Magellan probe.[16]/nA biographical song about Jeanne Villepreux is featured on \"26 Scientists Volume Two: Newton to Zeno\", a 2008 album by the California band Artichoke.[18]/nSecrets of the Sea: The Story of Jeanne Power, Revolutionary Marine Scientist, a 2021 biographical picture book by Evan Griffith and illustrated by Joanie Stone, adapts the story of Jeanne's discoveries and legacy into an educational children's book.[19]", "19632164": "Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi (French: [f\u0281\u0251\u0303swaz ba\u0281esinusi] \u24d8; born 30 July 1947) is a French virologist and Director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Division (French: Unit\u00e9 de R\u00e9gulation des Infections R\u00e9trovirales) and Professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.[1] Born in Paris, France, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi performed some of the fundamental work in the identification of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the cause of AIDS. In 2008, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with her former mentor, Luc Montagnier, for their discovery of HIV.[2] She mandatorily retired from active research on August 31, 2015, and fully retired by some time in 2017.[3]/nBarr\u00e9-Sinoussi was interested in science from a very young age. During her vacations as a child, she would spend hours analyzing insects and animals, comparing their behaviors and trying to understand why some run faster than others for example. Soon after, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi realized she was very talented in the sciences compared to her humanity courses. She expressed interest to her parents that she would like to attend university to study science or become a researcher. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi admitted that she was more interested in becoming a doctor but at the time she was under the false impression that studying medicine was both more expensive and lengthier than a career in science. After two years studying at the university, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi attempted to find part-time work in a laboratory to ensure that she had made the right career choice. After nearly a year of searching for laboratory work, she was finally accepted by the Pasteur Institute. Her part-time work at the Pasteur Institute quickly became full-time. She began to only attend university to take the exams and had to rely on her friends\u2019 class notes because she was not regularly attending class. However, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was actually scoring higher on her exams than before because she finally had the motivation because she had realized a career in science was what she wanted to do.[4]/nBarr\u00e9-Sinoussi joined the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the early 1970s. She received her PhD in 1974 and interned at the U.S. National Institutes of Health before returning to the Pasteur Institute in Montagnier's unit.[5][6]/nDuring the early AIDS epidemic in 1981-1984, the viral cause of the outbreak had not yet been identified. Working with Luc Montagnier, Jean-Claude Chermann and others at the institute, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi isolated and grew a retrovirus from a biopsied swollen lymph node of a patient at risk for AIDS.[7] This virus would later be known as HIV-1, the causative agent behind the outbreak.[8][9][10][5] This discovery allowed for the development of diagnostic tests to aid in controlling the spread of the virus, for informing policy on the treatment of people living with AIDS, and for many important advancements in the science of HIV/AIDS that ultimately saved countless lives./nBarr\u00e9-Sinoussi started her own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in 1988. Among Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's many recent research contributions are studies of various aspects of the adaptive immune response to viral infection,[11][12] the role of innate immune defenses of the host in controlling HIV/AIDS,[13] factors involved in mother-to-child transmission of HIV,[14] and characteristics that allow a small percentage of HIV-positive individuals, known as elite suppressors or controllers, to limit HIV replication without antiretroviral drugs.[15][16] She has co-authored over 240 scientific publications, has participated in over 250 international conferences, and has trained many young researchers./nBarr\u00e9-Sinoussi has actively contributed to several scientific societies and committees at the Institut Pasteur as well as to other AIDS organizations, such as the National Agency for AIDS Research in France. She has also been implicated at an international level, notably as a consultant to the WHO and the UNAIDS-HIV./nSince the 1980s, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi has initiated collaborations with developing countries and has managed multidisciplinary networks with dedication. In 2016, she was interviewed by the Sunday Observer and reflected on how Jamaica is dealing with HIV.[17] She constantly works on establishing permanent links between basic research and clinical research with the aim of achieving concrete improvements in the areas of prevention, clinical care, and treatment.[18]/nProfessor Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi believes that scientists have made steady progress given the development of antiretroviral treatment which UNAIDS states is being accessed by 17 million of the people globally who are living with AIDS, but finding a cure, or cures, will take time, and a continued investment in research.[17][19] As the co-chair of the 21st International AIDS Society (IAS), she said the search for curative strategy of HIV is a goal of paramount importance and a priority for the future of HIV research. Moreover, even though research to achieve such cures is in a formative stage, significant advances are being made towards a HIV cure.[20]/nIn 2009, she wrote an open letter to Pope Benedict XVI in protest over his statements that condoms are at best ineffective in the AIDS crisis.[21]/nIn July 2012 Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi became President of the International AIDS Society./nWhen Francoise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi began working on retroviruses at the Pasteur Institute there were large programs in the United States working on the association between cancer and retroviruses, so she decided to study the link between retroviruses and leukemia in mice. After the new disease emerged (not yet named AIDS), a group of French physicians came to the Pasteur Institute to ask the rather simple question: is this new disease caused by a retrovirus? After much discussion with other colleagues, including Luc Montagnier, they concluded the agent causing this new disease may be a retrovirus but it was not HTLV, the only known retrovirus at the time, because of differing defining characteristics.  In the early 1980s, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi was already familiar with the technique of detecting reverse transcriptase activity. If reverse transcriptase activity is present, it confirms that the virus is a retrovirus. In December 1982, heavy research began and clinical observations suggested that the disease attacked immune cells because of the significant CD4 cell depletion. However, the depletion of the CD4 lymphocytes made it very difficult to isolate the virus in patients with the disease later known as, AIDS. Because of the difficulty isolating an infected cell from a patient with late disease progression, Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to use a lymph node biopsy from a patient with generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy was a common symptom of patients in the early stages of disease progression. In the second week of checking the biopsied cell cultures for reverse transcriptase activity, enzymatic activity was detected and increased for a short time until the reverse transcriptase activity decreased dramatically after the T-lymphocytes in the culture began to die. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to add lymphocytes from a blood donor in order to save the culture and it proved successful after the virus transmitted to the newly added lymphocytes from the blood donor and significant reverse transcriptase activity was again detected. At this point, the virus was named LAV for Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus, which would later be renamed to HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. 1983 marked the beginning of Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's career researching HIV that continued until her retirement. 1983 was also the year it became clear that HIV was not only a target for what was known as the 4Hs, homosexuals, hemophiliacs, Haitians and heroin addicts, but that HIV was also targeting heterosexuals\u2009\u2013 making the likelihood that the HIV related disease, AIDS, was an epidemic very high.[4][22]/nFrancoise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi remained at the Pasteur Institute and was appointed head of the Biology of Retroviruses Unit in 1992. The Biology of Retroviruses Unit was reconfirmed in 2005 and renamed the Regulation of Retrovirial Infections Unit. Currently, the unit is working on vaccine research against HIV and the correlates of protection against AIDS for immunotherapy. Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's career has also included integration with resource-limited countries, such as Vietnam and Central African Republic.

In 1961 he joined the research laboratories of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann LaRoche, leaving in 1968 to spend a year working with the Axelrod group at NIMH. In 1971 he joined the newly-formed Biocentre at the University of Basel as research group leader in Neurobiology. In 1977 he relocated to Munich where the Max Planck Institute for Psychiatry had offered him the directorship of a new institute \u2013 what is now the Max Planck Institute for Neurobiology \u2013 which he led until his retirement in 1996.[1][3]/nWhile testing dopamine analogues at Hoffman-LaRoche, he was surprised by the toxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine on sympathetic nerves and investigated its mechanisms of action. Its selective effect on dopaminergic neurons has made it a useful tool in animal models of Parkinson's disease.[2]/nThis line of research had an unexpected payoff. While working with Axelrod at NIMH, Thoenen discovered that repeated stimulation of the adrenal medulla led to increased levels of the monoamine synthesis enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Trans-synaptic enzyme induction had never previously been detected: it transpired that it was a general phenomenon.[2]/nAt Basel, his attention turned to nerve growth factor and other neurotrophins. His laboratory made a series of groundbreaking contributions to the field, including the cloning of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor. Almost all his subsequent research focused on this class of proteins, the elucidation of their physiological functions, and the factors that influenced their expression and release \u2013 including other growth factors, the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters,  glucocorticosteroids, and stress.[2] His work has been instrumental in demonstrating the importance of neurotrophins for brain plasticity (the formation and pruning of synaptic connections in, for example, learning and memory), and has pursued their relevance for remediating nerve damage and dementia.[3]/nThoenen won the Feldberg Award (1980),[4] the Clo\u00ebtta Prize (1985),[5] the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievement in Health (1994) and the Neuronal Plasticity Prize (1994).[6] He received the Ralph W.

Shooter. He was awarded the Ernst Jung Gold Medal in 2007.[9] He was a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina[10] and a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences.[11] He received honorary doctorates from the Universities of W\u00fcrzburg and Zurich.[1]", "43094065": "David John Beerling FRS[6] FLSW (born 21 June 1965)[4] is the Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate change mitigation and Sorby Professor of Natural Sciences in the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences (APS) at the University of Sheffield, UK.[1][7][8][9][10][11] He is also Editor-in-Chief of the Royal Society journal Biology Letters./nBeerling was educated at University of Wales, College of Cardiff where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Botany in 1987 followed by a PhD in 1990[2] for research into the biogeography, ecology and control of two important and highly invasive alien plant species Japanese knotweed Reynoutria japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera. His PhD was supervised by Ron Walter Edwards CBE[2] and he authored two ecological monographs on the species[12][13] and scientific papers reporting simulated projections of their potential future distributions in Europe with global climate change.[14][15]/nBeerling's research group investigate fundamental questions concerning the conquest of the land by plants and the role of terrestrial ecosystems in shaping Earth's global ecology, climate and atmospheric composition.  This is achieved by approaches that integrate evidence from fossils, experiments and theoretical models applied across spatial and temporal scales.  Increasingly, his group's research discoveries are informing our understanding of current global climate change issues./nAn important early success of his biophysical approach to palaeobotany was the discovery of evidence for a substantial increase in the atmospheric CO\u2082 concentration and 'super-greenhouse' conditions across the Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary, 200 million years ago, based on analyses of fossil stomata and leaf morphology from Greenland.[16] This causally linked a catastrophic extinction event with the break-up of Pangaea.  Before his group's work, the Tr-J extinction represented one of the most poorly understood of the so-called 'big-five' mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic (past 540 million years). His paper resulted in major new international research programmes that subsequently identified evidence confirming the carbon cycle perturbation in marine and terrestrial sediments world-wide.  He extended this discovery by evaluating hypothesized causal mechanisms with numerical geochemical carbon cycle modelling in collaboration with the Yale University geochemist Robert Berner.[17]/nBeerling was the only UK participant in an international consortium led by James Hansen (former Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies) analysing Cenozoic CO\u2082 and palaeoclimate evidence to investigate the broader societal question of the target CO\u2082 level required to avoid 'dangerous' anthropogenic interference of the climate system.  Stabilization of human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level avoiding this concern is a core objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The resulting 2008 'Target CO\u2082' paper[18] made the front page of the UK newspaper The Guardian which commented:/n\"World's leading climate scientists warn today that the EU and its international partners must urgently rethink targets for cutting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because of fears they have grossly underestimated the scale of the problem\"[19]/nBeerling is a leading architect in the field of experimental palaeobiology, adopting advanced experimental research programmes to address fundamental questions raised by the fossil record of plant life.  Characterized by the formulation and evaluation of rigorous hypotheses, these programmes demonstrate how experimental evidence serves to deepen our causal understanding of past events.  By productively collaborating with Jonathan Leake,[20] his group established essential missing functional evidence supporting the long-standing conjecture, based largely on 400-million-year-old-fossils from the Devonian Rhynie chert,[21] that the establishment of rootless early land plants in skeletal soils was promoted by their mutualistic symbiotic partnership with soil fungi.[22] They went on to reveal how the simulated high CO\u2082 Palaeozoic atmosphere and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi synergistically enhanced plant fitness to create uniquely strong selection pressures favouring the establishment of mycorrhiza-like partnerships in 'lower' land plants.  These findings now place fungi as key players in the earliest symbiotic events during the greening of the Earth's land-masses./nBeerling's investigations into vegetation interactions with past environments extend to those guided by the fossil remains of ancient polar forests.  Through a creative combination of experiments simulating high CO\u2082 ancient polar environments, and modelling of forest biogeochemistry, his group's analyses helped define our modern understanding of the physiological ecology of Mesozoic high-latitude forests [ref].  In doing so, they overturned 'textbook dogma' concerning the adaptive significance of polar forest deciduousness, established following Scott of the Antarctic's discovery of Glossopteris fossils on the Beardmore Glacier at 82\u00baS in 1912.[23] BBC News covered these findings in a 2003 report 'Antarctic Scott's lasting legacy'[24] and again in a 2011 report entitled 'Secrets of Antarctica's fossilised forests'.[25]/nBeerling's has published over 200 papers in leading peer reviewed scientific journals including Science[26][27] and Nature.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]/nBeerling's best-selling popular science book The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history [5] presents a case for recognising the role of plants in shaping Earth's history.  Reviewed in many journals (e.g. Nature[36]) and newspapers, including The Times[37] and The Guardian,[38] the book was named by Oliver Sacks as his favourite non-fiction book of the year in The Observer.[39] Sacks wrote of it/nThe story Beerling tells could not have been put together even 10 years ago, for it depends on the latest insights from palaeontology, climate science, genetics, molecular biology and chemistry, all brilliantly and beautifully integrated./nThe Emerald Planet has been translated into three languages and attracted public acclaim and that of his academic peers.  The book formed the basis of a major three-part BBC Two television series, How to Grow a Planet,[40] for which Beerling acted as the Scientific Consultant.  Enhanced public awareness of plant science followed, with the series attracting average viewing figures of 1.7\u00a0million per episode.  The book was reprinted by Oxford University Press in 2009 with a foreword written by Iain Stewart, the presenter of How to Grow a Planet. Beerling is also the author of an advanced technical book Vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle: the first 400 million years.[41]/nBeerling is interested in the history of science and publishes occasional scholarly articles on this theme. These have included an invited commentary entitled 'Gas valves, forests and global change: a commentary on Paul Gordon Jarvis classic 1976 paper[42] written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,[34] and the discovery that Isaac Newton's interest in botany extended to thinking about how water moves from roots to leaves and into the atmosphere over 200 years before botanists got round to explaining it.[1][43] His discovery was widely reported including in Scientific American[44] and Science[45] which coined the memorable 'Newton was no sap' strap line. In 2010, he wrote a piece for Nature discussing theoretical analyses revealing how plant investment in the architecture of leaf veins can be shuffled for different conditions, minimising the construction costs associated with supplying water to leaves.[46] He placed these findings in the context of the pioneering English plant physiologist Stephen Hales's book Vegetable Staticks published in 1727. Hales observed that plants lose water by \"perspiration\" and then went one better by conducting experiments to quantify the process./nBeerling's research has been funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),[47] the Department for International Development (DFID),[48] the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),[48] The Royal Society,[49] and The Leverhulme Trust.[10] In 2012 he was awarded a prestigious European Research Council Advanced Investigator Grant to research 'Carbon dioxide regulation of Earth's ecological weathering engine: from microorganisms to ecosystems'.[50]/nIn 2015, he was awarded \u00a310\u00a0million for establishing a Leverhulme Centre for Climate change mitigation which hopes to revolutionise approaches to climate change mitigation and transform the evidence base needed to alter land management options for mitigating climate change and promoting food security, whilst safeguarding natural resources. The vision is to develop and assess the role of enhanced rock weathering as a means of safely removing large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the atmosphere to cool the planet, while also mitigating ocean acidification.[51]/nAs of 2015[update] the plan is to deliver these aims through Earth system modelling, lab-based controlled environment experimental investigations and large-scale field studies, embedded with social science analyses of sustainability and public engagement. Beerling, Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation at the University of Sheffield, said:/nI am delighted that the Leverhulme Trust is providing substantial long-term investment in our pioneering Leverhulme Centre at the University of Sheffield. It couldn't be more timely and represents a huge vote of confidence for the outstanding team of scientists and social scientists involved from Sheffield and elsewhere.[52][53]/nBeerling added:/nThe ambition of our new interdisciplinary Leverhulme Centre is to deliver a step-change in the development of feasible, scalable, atmospheric CO\u2082 removal options and avert ocean acidification. We will objectively develop the science, sustainability and ethics necessary for harnessing the photosynthate energy of plants to accelerate the breakdown of silicate rocks applied to agroecosystems and ultimately sequester carbon on the sea floor. In effect, the approach uses natural reactions that have been stabilising climate for millions of years to safely remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\"[52][53]/nOn 29 November 2018, the BBC's Science Editor, David Shukman, reported on progress of the Centre on the National BBC news and in an accompanying BBC New online article entitled Climate change: Can 12 billion tonnes of carbon be sucked from the air?[54]/nBeerling was awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize in Earth sciences for outstanding contributions to palaeobotany and palaeoclimatology in 2001.[citation needed] He was elected the 2008/9 Edward P Bass Distinguished Visiting Environmental Scholar at the Yale Institute for Biosphere Science, Yale University.[55] The Edward P.

She was the first person without a PhD or MD to be appointed a Professor of Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine.[2]/nMinnich was born on January 24, 1910, in Zanesville, Ohio, and raised on her family's farm. She suffered severe burns at the age of four when her dress caught fire from a gas stove and she underwent close to thirty operations to correct the resultant disfigurement.[1] Despite the surgeries, she was left with considerable scarring to her face, neck, and upper body that led some colleagues to discourage her from jobs requiring much human interaction.[2]/nShe had wanted to become a nurse, but was discouraged from this career path, so she decided to study to become a dietician.[3] She received a Bachelor of Science in Home Economics from Ohio State University in 1937 and a master's degree in Nutrition from Iowa State College in 1938.[4] In her senior year, Minnich worked part-time in the hematology laboratory of Carl V. Moore, with whom she would later work with extensively at Washington University.[5] Minnich never received a doctorate degree, a decision which she regretted and which she attributed to dissuasion from Moore.[2] She believed Moore's discouragement held back her salary and career advancement compared to men doing similar work.[4]/nAfter graduating from Ohio State University in 1938, Minnich wrote to Carl Moore to ask for a job and he offered her a position as a research technician helping start a Hematology department at Washington University.[1] She remained at Washington University for her entire career. She was promoted to a research associate in 1954, research assistant professor in 1958, research associate professor in 1963, and full professor of Medicine in 1974 (the first person without a doctorate degree to reach this rank at Washington University).[1] She became professor emeritus in 1978 and retired in 1984.[1] She also worked at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis from 1975 to the mid-1980s as assistant and then associate director of Hematology.[1]/nShe was regarded as an excellent teacher and, in addition to her official teaching responsibilities, she gave informal \"night courses\" to pathologists, lab technicians, and others.[4] She created a series of audiovisual teaching materials describing the morphology of blood and bone marrow that were published by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists in the early 1980s as a 10-part course in morphologic hematology.[1]/nMinnich established a hematology laboratory at the University of Havana in 1945.[1] In 1951, she went to Bangkok, Thailand for a year as part of an exchange program between Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital and Washington University.[1] There, in addition to teaching, she began her research on thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies and she returned for three months in 1954 to continue this work.[2] In 1964, she traveled to Turkey on a Fulbright scholarship and set up a Hematology laboratory in the University of Ankara's pediatrics department (later renamed the Virginia Minnich Hematology Laboratory in her honor).[1]/nMinnich's research encompassed a variety of hematology and nutrition topics, many centered around iron metabolism. She published over 45 scientific papers and 19 abstracts including noted work on blood disorders (in particular thrombocytopenic purpura, thalassemia, and hemoglobinopathies); the relationship between pica and iron deficiency; and synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione.[1]/nEarly Work/nMinnich participated in early research into iron metabolism, including studies of fluctuation in women's iron levels throughout their menstrual cycle and investigations into how iron is best absorbed.[2] Through this work she helped develop more accurate methods for analyzing the data they collected and, throughout her career she continued to ensure that best practices were being followed in Washington University's Hematology department.[2] From 1949 to 1951 she worked with William Harrington in a landmark study involving self-experimentation that showed that low blood platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura were caused by an immune response leading to platelet destruction.[6][4]/nHemoglobin E/nWhile in Thailand in 1951, Minnich found an unusually high rate of thalassemias, blood disorders characterized by decreased levels of the oxygen-carrying molecule hemoglobin. Upon further examination, she discovered that this was an undescribed form of thalassemia involving a novel abnormal hemoglobin molecule, hemoglobin E caused by a mutation in the \u03b2-globin gene (HBB).[2] People who inherit one copy of the HbE gene and one copy of the normal \u03b2-globin gene (HbA) are said to \"carry the HbE trait\", and are asymptomatic, as are most people who inherit two copies of HbE. However, inheritance of one HbE copy and one copy of HBB with a different mutation, such as one that causes \u03b2-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia, leads to a thalassemia ranging from mild to severe depending on the nature of the second mutation.[7] Minnich was the first person to describe hemoglobin E/\u03b2-thalassemia, in 1951.[8] Her work led to further research into this disease, which is estimated to affect a million people worldwide.[7] HbE is considered to be one of the most common genetic mutations, with carrier rates approaching 60% in some parts of Southeast Asia, and  testing for HbE is now part of routine neonatal screening and genetic counseling.[9][7]/nPica/nIn 1965, while in Turkey setting up a hematology laboratory at the University of Ankara, Minnich noticed a form of pica involving clay eating. When she followed up this research upon her return to Washington University, she found a similar clay eating practice in parts of the United States.[2] Pica had been known to be associated with iron deficiency but the cause/effect relationship was unclear; Minnich found that that clay actually made iron deficiency worse by acting as a chelating agent, binding iron in the bloodstream and removing it from the body.[4]/nGlutathione synthesis/nIn 1970, a former colleague, Dan Mohler, referred her to a family with a glutathione synthetase deficiency, leading her to develop and perform biochemical assays to elucidate the glutathione synthesis pathway.[2]/nMinnich retired from Washington University in 1984.[1] She died of ovarian and colon cancer April 26, 1996, in Pensacola, Florida.[10] She willed her estate to the Washington University School of Medicine to be used for student scholarships, and Washington University established a visiting professorship in clinical hematology in her name.[1]/nThrombocytopenic purpura/nHemoglobin E/nPica/nGlutathione synthesis", "26054823": "Andrew Balmford is a professor of conservation science at the University of Cambridge.

They reported that shallow forked shaped tails (such as those of the house martin) are aerodynamically optimal and that species with them had similar lengthed tails, indicating they could have developed through natural selection. In species with longer tails, males tend to have longer tails than females and which also create drag, since this is no advantage except for when courting, the authors suggested long tails may have evolved through sexual selection.[5][6]/nIn 1998, he published a paper in Nature describing how the biodiversity of rainforest in Uganda could be estimated by counting populations of birds and butterflies.[7][8] In 1999, again in Nature, he reported that the cost of conserving all life on earth would be approximately $320bn a year compared to the $6bn spent then.[9][10] According to his group's research, this was less than 25% of the cost of environmentally damaging subsidies that governments supported at that time. The Financial Times commented that removing agricultural subsidies was already known to be \"fraught with difficulties\" and that only $1bn had been channelled into conservation projects since an agreement in 1992. Balmford was quoted as saying that the strongest argument to protect nature is \"moral, cultural and philosophical\".[11]/nIn 2002, he led a research project that found children could name a greater proportion of Pok\u00e9mon characters than common species of British wildlife; 8-year-olds could identify 80% of Pok\u00e9mon characters but only 50% of species. Balmford suggested that conservationists could create a game similar to Pok\u00e9mon to encourage children to learn about the environment, saying \"People tend to care about what they know.\"[12][13] He also reported in Science that the benefits of conserving nature far outweigh the benefits of development, by a factor of 100 to 1, due to the loss of ecosystem services. It was estimated that humanity loses about $250bn per year due to habitat destruction.[14][15]/nOne-third of the world's wild nature has been lost since I was a child and first heard the word 'conservation'. That's what keeps me awake at night.  Andrew Balmford \u2013 2002[14]/nIn 2003, he led a study which collected data on the maintenance costs of different conservation projects around the world. It was found that there was huge variation in the cost of conserving nature, ranging from $0.07 per acre to $1.37\u00a0million per acre depending on the project. Projects in the developing world were generally cheaper than those in the developed world, boding well for the protection of biodiversity hotspots in poorer countries such as Indonesia and Madagascar. Balmford stated that it is important that the value for money of a conservation project should be taken into account as well as the number of threatened species in the region.[16]/nIn 2004, he published as a lead researcher a paper in PNAS which estimated that to protect 30% of the world's oceans by making them protected areas would cost between $12bn and $14bn each year. He told the BBC that, \"meeting this commitment to marine protection will require international effort on an unprecedented scale\".[17][18]/nIn 2009, a paper that Balmford co-authored was published in Science that found that the benefits gained from deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest were quickly reversed. In recently deforested areas, the Human Development Index (HDI) was higher than other regions, but once deforestation was complete and replaced by other activities, for example farming, the HDI decreased to the same extent as that in areas that had not been deforested. Balmford described the current situation as \"disastrous for local people, wildlife and the global climate\" but hoped that REDD may allow changes to occur in the future.[19][20] Another paper published in PLoS Biology found that between 1992 and 2006, the overall number of visitors to 280 protected areas in 20 countries had increased. Visitor numbers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America all grew significantly, while those in North America and Australasia did not change significantly. The results contrasted with an earlier study of visitor numbers to protected areas in Japan and the USA which found they had fallen consistently over a number of decades.[21][22]/nBalmford helped to establish the Cambridge Conservation Forum, a network of 1000 conservation professionals from a range of organisations, the Cambridge Conservation Initiative and the annual Student Conference on Conservation Science.[23][24] He is Principal Investigator on the Valuing the Arc programme, which is focused on the conservation of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania.[25]/nIn 2000, Balmford was awarded the Zoological Society of London Marsh Award for Conservation Biology.[26][27] In 2003, he was included on a list of the top 50 visionaries building a better world by Scientific American for his work on economic development and its impact on the environment.[28] In 2010 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.", "60002473": "Holly P.

Uribe, was known for creating the term \"autopoiesis\" about the self-generating, self-maintaining structure in living systems, and concepts such as structural determinism and structural coupling.[1] His work was influential in many fields, mainly the field of systems thinking and cybernetics. Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.[2] Maturana (2002) insisted that autopoiesis exists only in the molecular domain, and he did not agree with the extension into sociology and other fields:/nThe molecular domain is the only domain of entities that through their interactions give rise to an open ended diversity of entities (with different dynamic architectures) of the same kind in a dynamic that can give rise to an open ended diversity of recursive processes that in their turn give rise to the composition of an open ended diversity of singular dynamic entities.[3]/nMaturana was born in Santiago, Chile. After completing secondary school at the Liceo Manuel de Salas in 1947, he enrolled at the University of Chile, studying first medicine in Santiago, then biology in London and Cambridge, Mass. In 1954, he obtained a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation to study anatomy and neurophysiology with J. Z.

Maturana's work extends to philosophy and cognitive science and even to family therapy. He was inspired by the work of the biologist Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll./nHis inspiration for his work in cognition came while he was a medical student and became seriously ill with tuberculosis.  Confined in a sanatorium with very little to read, he spent time reflecting on his condition and the nature of life. What he came to realize was \"that what was peculiar to living systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves\u00a0... whether a dog bites me or doesn't bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself.\" This paradigm of autonomy formed the basis of his studies and work.[2]/nMaturana and his student Francisco Varela were the first to define and employ the concept of \"autopoiesis\", which was Maturana's original idea. Aside from making important contributions to the field of evolution, Maturana is associated with an epistemology built upon empirical findings of neurobiology. Maturana and Varela wrote \"Living systems are cognitive systems, and living as a process is a process of cognition. This statement is valid for all organisms, with or without a nervous system.\"[8]/nIn an article in Constructivist Foundations.

He was the second son of Maria Sarah Turner, eldest daughter of the banker Dawson Turner and sister-in-law of Francis Palgrave, and the famous botanist Sir William Jackson Hooker, Regius Professor of Botany. From the age of seven, Hooker attended his father's lectures at the University of Glasgow, taking an early interest in plant distribution and the voyages of explorers like Captain James Cook.[5] He was educated at the Glasgow High School and went on to study medicine at the University of Glasgow graduating with an MD in 1839./nHis degree qualified him for employment in the Naval Medical Service. He joined the polar explorer Captain James Clark Ross's Antarctic expedition to the South Magnetic Pole after receiving a commission as Assistant-Surgeon on HMS\u00a0Erebus.

Though well-behaved he was indolent. Hector sent him on a cruise on a Government steamer the Sturt with a son (also 15) of Colonel Haultain the Defence minister. Mrs Hector treated him like a younger brother. After eight months and in better health Hector sent him home to England, saying he had greatly improved. His father was grateful, and surprised when Willy passed the civil service examination. He got an administrative job in the India Office, and lived to age 89./nHowever, his third son, Brian, was a \"great worry\" to him. He qualified as a geologist and mining engineer at the Royal School of Mines but unable to get a job in Britain emigrated to Australia, where he married. He resigned a Queensland lectureship to invest (with his brother Willy) in an impressively named but cash-strapped gold-mining company which collapsed, the Queensland Minerals Exploration Company. Joseph was appalled; Brian could not support his wife and children or find employment./nIn 1891, Hector sent a pessimistic report on a proposed tin mine on Stewart Island, and saw Brian in 1892 and 1893, after he left his family in Australia. Hector ceased to be involved with mining in New Zealand under the new Liberal government. Brian returned to his family in Australia in 1894.[12]/nOn 10 December 1911, after a short and apparently minor illness, Hooker died in his sleep at home, the Camp, Sunningdale, Berkshire. The Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey offered a grave near Darwin's in the nave but insisted that Hooker be cremated before.[13]/nHis widow, Hyacinth, declined the proposal and eventually Hooker's body was buried, as he wished to be, alongside his father in the churchyard of St Anne's Church, Kew, a short distance from Kew Gardens. His memorial tablet in the church, with a motif of five plants, was designed by Matilda Smith.[14]/nHooker's first expedition, led by James Clark Ross, consisted of two ships, HMS\u00a0Erebus and HMS\u00a0Terror; it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail.[15] Hooker was the youngest of the 128-man crew. He sailed on the Erebus and was assistant to Robert McCormick, who in addition to being the ship's Surgeon was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens.[16] The ships sailed on 30 September 1839. Before journeying to Antarctica they visited Madeira, Tenerife, Santiago and Quail Island in the Cape Verde archipelago, St Paul Rocks, Trindade east of Brazil, St Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope. Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets./nFrom the Cape they entered the Southern Ocean. Their first stop was the Crozet Islands where they set down on Possession Island to deliver coffee to sealers. They departed for the Kerguelen Islands where they would spend several days. Hooker identified 18 flowering plants, 35 mosses and liverworts, 25 lichens and 51 algae, including some that were not described by surgeon William Anderson when James Cook had visited the islands in 1772.[17] The expedition spent some time in Hobart, Van Diemen's Land, and then moved on to the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island, and onward to Antarctica to locate the South Magnetic Pole. After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and the Bay of Islands in New Zealand from 18 August to 23 November 1841.[18] They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the Erebus and Terror, they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. When Hooker arrived on the Falkland Islands with the expedition of Ross, he developed a close friendship with Richard Clement Moody, the Governor of the Falkland Islands.[7] Moody granted Hooker full use of his personal library, which Hooker described as 'excellent',[6] and Hooker described Moody as 'a very active and intelligent young man, most anxious to improve the colony and gain every information [sic] respecting its products'.[19]/nSubsequently, the Ross expedition made a landing at Cockburn Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, and after leaving the Antarctic, stopped at the Cape, St Helena and Ascension Island. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline.[20]/nIn 1845, Hooker applied for the Chair of Botany at the University of Edinburgh. This position included duties at the Royal Botanic Gardens of Scotland, and so the appointment was influenced by local politicians. An unusually protracted struggle ensued, resulting in the election of the locally born and bred botanist, John Hutton Balfour. The Darwin correspondence, now public, makes clear Darwin's sense of shock at this unexpected outcome.[21] Hooker declined a chair at Glasgow University which became vacant on Balfour's appointment. Instead, he took a position as botanist to the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1846. He began work on palaeobotany, searching for fossil plants in the coal-beds of Wales, eventually discovering the first coal ball in 1855. He became engaged to Frances Henslow, daughter of Charles Darwin's botany tutor John Stevens Henslow, but he was keen to continue to travel and gain more experience in the field. He wanted to travel to India and the Himalayas. In 1847 his father nominated him to travel to India and collect plants for Kew. In 2011, a collection of glass plate slides of paleontological fossils, some prepared by Darwin, William Nicol and others, which had been lost following Hooker's brief tenure with the Survey, were rediscovered in the Survey vaults in Keyworth in Nottinghamshire, and they shed light on the international breadth of English scientific research in the first half of the nineteenth century.[22]/nOn 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three-year-long Himalayan expedition.[23] This was just 10 days after being granted two and a half years\u2018 leave from the Geological Survey to study fossil plants in India and Borneo on behalf of Kew and the Admiralty.[24] He would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalaya, but abandoned the projected visit to Labuan. He received free passage on HMS\u00a0Sidon, to the Nile and then travelled overland to Suez where he boarded a ship to India. He arrived in Calcutta on 12 January 1848, leaving on 28th to begin his travels with a geological survey party under 'Mr Williams', who he left on 3 March to continue travelling by elephant to Mirzapur, up the Ganges by boat to Siliguri and overland by pony to Darjeeling, arriving on 16 April 1848./nHooker's expedition was based in Darjeeling where he stayed with naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson. Through Hodgson he met British East India Company representative Archibald Campbell who negotiated Hooker's admission to Sikkim, which was finally approved in 1849 (He was later briefly taken prisoner by the Raja of Sikkim). Meanwhile, Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India, and collected plants in Bengal. He explored with local resident Charles Barnes, then travelled along the Great Runjeet river to its junction with the Teesta River and Tonglu mountain in the Singalila range on the border with Nepal./nHooker and a sizeable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848. They travelled to Zongri, west over the spurs of Kangchenjunga, and north west along Nepal's passes into Tibet. In April 1849 he planned a longer expedition into Sikkim. Leaving on 3\u00a0May, he travelled north west up the Lachen Valley to the Kongra Lama Pass and then to the Lachoong Pass. Campbell and Hooker were imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim as they travelled towards the Cho La in Tibet.[25][26] A British team was sent to negotiate with the king of Sikkim. However, they were released without any bloodshed and Hooker returned to Darjeeling, where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals, replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India. According to an 1887 journal written by Indian administrator Richard Temple, many of the rhododendrons found in English gardens of the time were grown from seeds collected by Hooker in Sikkim.[27]/nReluctant to return to Sikkim, and unenthusiastic about travelling in Bhutan, he chose to make his last Himalayan expedition to Sylhet and the Khasi Hills in Assam. He was accompanied by Thomas Thomson, a fellow student from Glasgow University. They left Darjeeling on 1 May 1850, then sailed to the Bay of Bengal and travelled overland by elephant to the Khasi Hills and established a headquarters for their studies in Churra, where they stayed until 9 December, when they began their trip back to England./nHooker's survey of hitherto unexplored regions, the Himalayan Journals, dedicated to Charles Darwin, was published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office in 1854, abbreviated again in 1855 and later by the Minerva Library of Famous Books published by Ward, Lock, Bowden & Co. in 1891./nWhen Hooker returned to England his father, who had been appointed director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1841, was now a prominent man of science. William Hooker, through his connections, secured an Admiralty grant of \u00a31000 to defray the cost of plates for his son's Botany of the Antarctic Voyages, and an annual stipend of \u00a3200 for Joseph while he worked on the flora. Hooker's flora was also to include that collected on the voyages of Cook and Menzies held by the British Museum and collections made on the Beagle. The floras were illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch (trained in botanical illustration by William Hooker), who would go on to become the most prolific Victorian botanical artist./nHooker's collections from the Antarctic voyage were described eventually in one of two volumes published as the Flora Antarctica (1844\u201347). In the Flora he wrote about islands and their role in plant geography: the work made Hooker's reputation as a systemist and plant geographer.[28] His works on the voyage were completed with Flora Novae-Zelandiae (1851\u201353) and Flora Tasmaniae (1853\u201359)./nThis trip was taken in the autumn of 1860, with Daniel Hanbury. They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine; no full-length report was published, but a number of papers were written. Hooker recognised three phytogeographical divisions: Western Syria and Palestine; Eastern Syria and Palestine; Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria.[29]/nHooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871, in the company of John Ball, George Maw and a young gardener from Kew, called Crump.[30] They published an account of their travels entitled Journal of a Tour in Marocco and The Great Atlas (1878)./nThis was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray, the leading American botanist of the day. They wished to investigate the connection between the floras of eastern United States and those of eastern continental Asia and Japan; and the line of demarcation between Arctic floras of America and Greenland. As probable causes they considered the Glacial periods and an earlier land connection with an Arctic continent. \"A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern-Asiatic afinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types.\"[31]/nHooker visited a number of cities and botanical institutions before moving west and climbing to 9,000\u00a0ft to camp at La Veta. From Fort Garland they climbed the Sierra Blanca at 14,500\u00a0ft. After returning to La Veta, they went beyond Colorado Springs to Pike's Peak. Next to Denver and Salt Lake City for an excursion into the Wasatch Range. A journey of 29 hours took them to Reno and Carson City, then Silver City and ten days by wagon across the Sierra Nevada. Thus they came to the Yosemite and Calaveras Grove, and ended up in San Francisco. Hooker was back in Kew with 1,000 dried specimens by October./nHis comments on his encounters include the following:/nHis views on the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or mountain floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a sub-alpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges.[33]/nHis overview of North American flora contained these elements:/nWhile on the Erebus, Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage embarked.[a] After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.[36] Hooker agreed and the pair began a lifelong friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the transmutation of species and natural selection,[37] and Hooker showed interest.[38] In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's \"Essay\" explaining the theory,[39] and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback.[40] Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwin's theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was \"the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy\".[41]/nFreeman 1978 wrote \"Hooker was Charles Darwin's greatest friend and confidant\". Certainly they had extensive correspondence, and they also met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Alfred Russel Wallace's famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin's notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realisation of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of The Origin of Species recorded his indebtedness to Hooker's wide knowledge and balanced judgment./nIn December 1859, Hooker published the Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae, the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage. It was in this essay (which appeared just one month after the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species), that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection, thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin./nAt the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford University Museum on 30 June 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwin's theory, and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it.[42][43][44][45] According to Hooker's own account, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce's arguments.[45][46]/nHooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868, when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories. He was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, a member of the X-Club (which dominated the Royal Society in the 1870s and early 1880s), and the first of the three X-Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society. In 1862, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nBy his travels and his publications, Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant-Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in 1865 he succeeded his father as full Director, holding the post for twenty years. Under the directorship of father and son Hooker, the Royal Botanic gardens of Kew rose to world renown. At the age of thirty, Hooker was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1873 he was chosen its president (till 1877). He received three of its medals: the Royal Medal in 1854, the Copley in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892. He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting. His journeys to Palestine, Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew./nHe started the series Flora Indica in 1855, together with Thomas Thompson. Their botanical observations and the publication of the Rhododendrons of Sikkim\u2013Himalaya (1849\u201351), formed the basis of elaborate works on the rhododendrons of the Sikkim Himalaya and on the flora of India. His works were illustrated with lithographs by Walter Hood Fitch./nHis greatest botanical work was the Flora of British India, published in seven volumes starting in 1872. On the publication of the last part in 1897, he was promoted Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (being made a Knight Commander of that Order in 1877). Ten years later, on attaining the age of ninety in 1907, he was awarded the Order of Merit./nHe was the author of numerous scientific papers and monographs, and his larger books included, in addition to those already mentioned, a standard Students Flora of the British Isles and a monumental work, the Genera plantarum[47] (1860\u201383), based on the collections at Kew, in which he had the assistance of George Bentham. His collaboration with George Bentham was especially important. Bentham, an amateur botanist who worked at Kew for many years, was perhaps the leading botanical systematist of the 19th century.[48] The Handbook of the British flora, begun by Bentham and completed by Hooker, was the standard text for a hundred years. It was always known as 'Bentham & Hooker'./nIn 1904, at the age of 87, Hooker published A sketch of the Vegetation of the Indian Empire. He continued the compilation of his father Sir William Jackson Hooker's project, Icones Plantarum (Illustrations of Plants), producing volumes eleven through nineteen, with most of the illustrations being prepared for him by Matilda Smith./nThe Herbarium at Kew was founded in 1853, and quickly grew in size and importance. At the time, Richard Owen was the Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum, reporting only to the Head of the British Museum. Hooker, appointed in 1855 as Assistant Director of Kew, was the man most responsible for bringing foreign specimens to Kew./nThere is no doubt that rivalry resulted between the British Museum, where there was the very important Herbarium of the Department of Botany, and Kew. The rivalry at times became extremely personal, especially between Joseph Hooker and Owen. ... At the root was Owen's feeling that Kew should be subordinate to the British Museum (and to Owen) and should not be allowed to develop as an independent scientific institution with the advantage of a great botanic garden.[b]/nThe relationship between the two men continued to deteriorate after Hooker became a supporter of Darwin\u2019s views and a member of the X-Club, who set out to get their way with the Royal Society. In 1868 Hooker had proposed that the whole of the huge herbarium collection of Joseph Banks should be moved from the British Museum to Kew, a reasonable idea, but a threat to Owen's plans for a museum in South Kensington to house the natural history collections. Hooker cited mismanagement at the British Museum as a justification.[50][5]/nAfter Joseph had succeeded his father as Director, in 1865, the independence of Kew was seriously threatened by the machinations of a member of parliament, Acton Smee Ayrton, whose appointment as First Commissioner of Works by Gladstone in 1869 was greeted in The Times with the prophecy that it would prove \"another instance of Mr. Ayrton's unfortunate tendency to carry out what he thinks right in as unpleasant a manner as possible\".[51] This was relevant because Kew was funded by the Board of Works, and the Director of Kew reported to the First Commissioner. The conflict between the two men lasted from 1870 to 1872, and there is a voluminous correspondence on the Ayrton Episode held at Kew./nAyrton behaved in an extraordinary way, interfering in matters and approaching Hooker's colleagues behind his back, apparently with the aim of getting Hooker to resign, when the expenditure on Kew could be curtailed and diverted. Ayrton actually took staff appointments out of Hooker's hands.[52] He seemed not to value the scientific work, and to believe Kew should be just an amusement park. Hooker wrote:/nMy life has become utterly detestable and I do long to throw up the Directorship. What can be more humiliating than two years of wrangling with such a creature!/nFinally, Hooker asked to be put in communication with Gladstone's private secretary, Algernon West. A statement was drawn up over the signatures of Darwin, Lyell, Huxley, Tyndall, Bentham and others. It was laid before Parliament by John Lubbock, and additional papers laid before the House of Lords. Lord Derby called for all the correspondence on the matter. The Treasury supported Hooker and criticised Ayrton's behaviour.[c]/nOne extraordinary fact emerged. There had been an official report on Kew, which had not previously been seen in public, which Ayrton had caused to be written by Richard Owen.[54] Hooker had not seen the report, and so had not been given right of reply. Nonetheless, the report was amongst the papers laid before Parliament, and it contained an attack on both the Hookers, and suggested (amongst much else) that they had mismanaged the care of their trees, and that their systematic approach to botany was nothing more than \"attaching barbarous binomials to foreign weeds\".[d] The discovery of this report no doubt helped to sway opinion in favour of Hooker and Kew (there was debate in the press as well as Parliament). Hooker replied to the Owen report in a point by point factual manner, and his reply was placed with the other papers on the case. When Ayrton was questioned about it in the debate led by Lubbock,[55] he replied that \"Hooker was too low an official to raise questions of matter with a Minister of the Crown\".[56]/nThe outcome was not a vote in the Commons, but a kind of truce until, in August 1874, Gladstone transferred Ayrton from the Board of Works to the office of Judge Advocate-General, just before his government fell. Ayrton failed to get re-elected to Parliament. From that moment to this, the value of the Botanic Gardens has never been seriously questioned. In the midst of this crisis, Hooker was elected as President of the Royal Society in 1873. This showed publicly the high regard which Hooker's fellow scientists had for him, and the great importance they attached to his work./nHooker Oak in Chico, California, was named after him.[61]\nHooker Island in Franz Josef Land was named after him following its 1880 discovery.[62]", "42307766": "Jean-Pierre Gosse (May 14, 1924 \u2013 June 6, 2001) was a Belgian biologist and ichthyologist.[1]/nGosse was a biologist with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences.[2]/nGosse went on missions in South America with Leopold III of Belgium.[2]/nGosse described the following species:/nLethrinops gossei W.

Moore in the early twentieth century but often applied to certain related views of David Hume in the eighteenth century. Hume pointed out the logical fallacy that occurs when deductive reasoning jumps from statements about what is to prescriptions about what ought to be. Davis thus referred to the \"moralistic fallacy\" as \"in effect, an illogical effort to derive an 'is' from an 'ought'.\"/nSometimes a theory is rejected with a reference to the danger of misuse. In doing so, one fails to differentiate sufficiently clearly between its epistemological value and its practical value, or between the moral, value-free knowledge and \u2013 in consideration of moral valuations \u2013 the potentially negative consequences of the knowledge. From a perspective of scientific theory, the accuracy of a theory is relevant, not its practical value, its origin or history of use. No theory is protected against misuse, nor can a theory be falsified by misuse. Both misuse as well as renunciation of knowledge can have disadvantageous consequences./nAn example of the naturalistic fallacy would be approving of all wars if scientific evidence showed warfare was part of human nature, whereas an example of the moralistic fallacy would be claiming that, because warfare is wrong, it cannot be part of human nature./nOn the current format of scientific writing, Davis had opined, \"A scientific paper is an unusual art form. It has to be as compact as possible, while giving the reader all the information needed to repeat the experiments. Because the literature is vast, the format of a paper is standardized so the reader can quickly find the parts that interest him; readers skim most of the papers that they look at, except those very close to their interests.

He was born in Firbeck, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, and died at Thames Ditton, Surrey./nWatson was the eldest son of Holland Watson, a Justice of the Peace and Mayor of Congleton in Cheshire, and his wife, Harriet Powell. His mother died when he was fifteen. He had seven older sisters and two younger brothers and his early life was overshadowed by a terrible relationship with his father, a reactionary conservative whose character Watson himself detailed in later years. Watson attended Dinnington High School, then a dame school, until his early teens[1]. As a teenager, Watson suffered a serious injury to his knee in a cricket match, and never recovered full movement in the joint again. Watson's mother had attempted to distract him from family tensions by sending him to work with the family's gardener, and it was after her death that his obsession with botany began.  While training for the legal profession in Liverpool, Watson became interested in phrenology and decided to study medicine and natural history at Edinburgh University (from 1828 to 1832). He was elected a Senior President of the Royal Medical Society as an undergraduate, but left without taking a degree because of a breakdown in his health. In Edinburgh, he became friendly with the botanist Robert Graham, who encouraged his interest in biogeography, and with the phrenologist George Combe, joining the Edinburgh Phrenological Society in 1829. Soon afterwards, Watson inherited an estate in Derbyshire. In 1833, he moved to Thames Ditton. He travelled to the Azores in 1842, spending three months collecting botanical specimens from four of the larger islands, while serving at his own expense as ship's botanist for the Styx under the command of Captain Vidal.[2]/nWatson edited the Phrenological Journal from 1837 to 1840 and the London Catalogue of British Plants with George Edgar Dennes from 1844 to 1874./nWatson was noted for his intellectual brilliance and for his often difficult and cantankerous personality. He led an isolated and restricted life, never married and travelled only once outside Britain.  He applied unsuccessfully \u2013 or withdrew his applications \u2013 for senior academic positions in London and Dublin and for a senior post at Kew \u2013 yet he was a widely acknowledged authority on botanical science and on the distribution of botanical species in the British Isles. Despite his social isolation, Watson showed a remarkable command of the scientific questions of the day, including the importance of statistical methods in scientific enquiry, the asymmetric lateralization of brain function and the transmutation of species (evolutionary theory). In 1836, he published a paper in the Phrenological Journal entitled What is the Use of the Double Brain\u00a0? in which he speculated about the differential development of the two human cerebral hemispheres. This was eight years before Arthur Ladbroke Wigan published his influential The Duality of Mind (1844). Watson was unusual among the phrenologists in explicitly disavowing phrenology in later life./nIn subsequent years, Watson was heavily influenced by the ideas of the evolutionary phrenologist Robert Chambers, and collected evidence for \u2013 and defended \u2013 the concept of species transmutation.  He corresponded with Charles Darwin who lived at Downe, some 30 miles from Thames Ditton, and Darwin drew heavily on Watson's unique appreciation of the distribution of British plant species. In 1856, Watson actually declined a personal invitation to discuss evolutionary theory with Darwin and Joseph Hooker, because he was too busy and did not wish to travel. Nevertheless, in On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin made generous acknowledgement of Watson as a vitally important source of scientific information and, in turn, on the publication of On the Origin of Species, Watson was one of the first to write to Darwin \u2013 on 21 November 1859 \u2013 congratulating him on his extraordinary achievement./nThe system of Watsonian vice-counties used by botanists to this day is one of his enduring contributions to botanical science./nEleocharis watsonii Bab.

For this work he was elected in 1984 to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In the mid-1980s he established the Manzanar Project[1] aimed at attacking the planet's most critical problems as poverty, hunger, environmental pollution, and global warming through low tech biotechnological methods in salt water deserts that can be transferred to the indigenous inhabitants./nSato was the son of an Issei (Japanese-born immigrant) father and a first generation American born Nisei mother in Los Angeles, California. His fisherman and gardener father taught him the basic concepts of how to cultivate and appreciate living things both on land and water. He was raised on Terminal Island, East San Pedro, where a substantial Japanese American community had developed prior to World War II. Since the area was the home of the Pacific fleet, the Japanese community was forced to relocate after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  After first moving into Los Angeles, in 1942 his family was forced to move to the Manzanar relocation camp for internment of Japanese Americans in the Owens Desert of California. He attended Manzanar High School in the camp where he was a member of the camp baseball team and played saxophone in the camp jazz band called the Jive Bombers. During internment in Manzanar he learned the challenges of gardening in a desert, the importance of becoming self-sufficient under deprived conditions, and sympathy toward aggrieved peoples. After graduation from Manzanar High School in 1944, he attended Central College in Pella, Iowa for a year while working at the Wakonda Country Club[2] before enlisting in the United States Army. In the Army, after service in Korea he landed in Hakata, Japan and saw the home country of one of his parents and his grandparents for the first time./nSupported by the G.I. Bill, Sato received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the University of Southern California in 1951 and obtained a Ph.D. in biophysics at the California Institute of Technology in 1955. His mentor was future Nobel Prize winner Max Delbr\u00fcck. After post-doctoral training with Gunther Stent at the University of California, Berkeley and Theodore Puck in Genetics at the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center, he was a professor of biochemistry at Brandeis University, Boston, Massachusetts, from 1958 to 1969. He joined the department of biology at the University of California, San Diego where he was a professor from 1970 through 1983. Sato spent summer 1974 through spring 1975 on sabbatical working with Dr. Niels Kaj Jerne at the Basel Institute for Immunology in Basel, Switzerland./nSato was recruited as director of The W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Lake Placid, New York (1983 to 1992). His vision was to build a research university similar to Rockefeller University in the peaceful setting of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Instead of the dependence on the labile support of individual government and private grants, the goal was to fund and endow the institute by proceeds from a for-profit biotechnology venture called Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.(UBI) which he established in the early 1980s. The idea was a radical concept for the period in which a non-profit research institute (The W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center) would be supported and endowed from profits of a for-profit entity (UBI) solely owned by the non-profit entity. Start-up funds for UBI were solely from loans from tax-deductible gifts to The W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center in order to avoid conflict with private interests with the sole goal of funding the non-profit research goals./nBeyond his basic contributions in cell biology, Sato is known for his unique impact on many students and associates from around the world particularly from Japan and China, both in cell biology and the Manzanar Project. He was one of the first to personally recruit Chinese students and visiting scientists during visits to major Chinese universities at the beginning of the Deng Xiaoping Open Door Policy in the early 1980s. He first developed the idea of companies that directly market research reagents from individual researchers who know most about the product to the science community at large. This concept both helped fund the original investigators who were source of products, distributed essential research tools to the scientific community at large and generated cash flow to support basic research activities.  Collaborative Research, Inc. was the first successful venture of this kind./nSato is co-inventor with his son, Denry Sato, and John Mendelson, CEO of University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, of the original technology used in chemotherapeutic agents based on inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor as Cetuximab (Erbitux)./nWhile director of the Lake Placid Center from 1983 to 1992, Sato established the Manzanar Project named after the camp where he and his family were interned in 1942. In 1992 soon after Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. became profitable, private interests acquired control of the company and the mission was diverted from support and endowment of The W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center. Sato subsequently resigned as director and devoted himself full-time to the Manzanar Project./nThe project aimed at making salt water and desert combinations productive through application of the simplest, low cost rational scientific approaches had its first prototype in the Salton Sea in southern California.  A simple food chain consisting of sewage and other waste on which salt- and heat-resistant algae would feed that then fed brine shrimp that then could be utilized in aquaculture as a food source for larger fishes was developed./nThe idea was then expanded to larger scale manmade salt water tidal ponds in coastal deserts that could be utilized for aquaculture in controlled ponds and a tide-controlled food source for larger scale fish ranching that would come to the tidal wash on the coast to feed. Relatively formal conventional pilot projects supported through government programs in China, the Atacama Desert of Chile and the Sudan convinced Sato that the simple aquaculture concept was unlikely to reach those who need and could benefit from it most when administered through government agencies. Through contacts developed in the field that started as modest grassroots relief efforts for suffering remote villagers in Eritrea during the late stages of its war of independence with Ethiopia, Sato solidified and focused the approaches behind the current Manzanar Project that centers in the Eritrean desert on the Red Sea. The project focuses on building economic development by application of the simplest biological principles to develop an entire self-sufficient economy village by village./nThe base of the support system centers on development of mangrove forests along the desert coastline. Mangrove trees grow in salt water, provide the base of an entire ecology for aquatic life, and provide lumber for fuel and construction and food for indigenous livestock as camels, goats and sheep. Coupled with Sato's earlier developments in food chain generation for aquaculture, the mangrove forests provide both a land and sea-based economy that once local needs for food and housing are met can be capitalized into a specialty seafood export market. Sato envisions that saltwater deserts when sufficiently populated with mangrove forests and other plants that can flourish in salt water could counteract global impact of deforestation in other areas of the world and bring desert areas into agricultural production./nSato's first working village prototype is Hargigo, on whose nearby coastline construction of the forests provides jobs for both men and women, the latter of which was unheard of in the local area prior to the project. The population of Hargigo was essentially devastated at one time during the Eritrean War of Independence. Sato and the villagers planted a Mangrove Memorial Garden with the objective of one mangrove tree dedicated to every villager killed in the 1975 massacre. It is estimated that the Manzanar Project has planted nearly one million mangrove trees on the coast of Eritrea since the project began. In a February 2007 National Geographic article, Sato was called a \"maritime Johnny Appleseed\".[3]/nIn 1982 Sato share Brandeis University's Rosenstiel Award with subsequent 1986 Nobel prize winners, biochemist Stanley Cohen and Rita Levi-Montalcini, and in 1984 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his contributions to cell biology./nIn 2002 Sato was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology in 2002 for his contributions in both cell biology and global issues./nSato was a Laureate of the Rolex Awards for Enterprise in 2002.

In particular, she found that cuckoos are able to produce eggs that mimic those of their host bird species.[4] Kilner found that cowbirds, which are also brood parasites, do not try to outcompete the host chicks that they hatch next to (as with cuckoos) and instead cowbirds do better when the host chicks remain.[5]/nParental care is common in burying beetles. Kilner's work on burying beetles has shown that beetle parents can produce a slime mixture that can influence bacteria communities on the meat they provide for their larval offspring; the bacteria aid digestion in the beetle stomach and prevent decomposition of the meat, so that beetle larvae grow larger and healthier.[6] She also examined what happens when parents are prevented from caring for larvae over 30 successive generations. She found that the beetle larvae evolved larger jaws to help them feed from carcasses better without help.[7] She also found that motherless beetle larvae were less competitive between each other and had higher survival rates than when mothered larvae had to cope alone.[8]/nHer research with burying beetles has also shown that they can form symbiotic relationships with mites. Smaller beetles which lose out in fights with larger beetles can benefit from the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi, which helps them to warm up and enables them to win contests with other beetles for a carcass food source.[9]/nIn 2023 Kilner was interviewed by Jim Al-Khalili on the BBC's Life Scientific radio programme, talking about the relationship between social behaviours and evolution, including burying beetles.[10]", "3281246": "Leander (Franz) Czerny (4 October 1859 \u2013 22 November 1944) was an Austrian entomologist and priest.

Tadeusza Reytana)[12] in Warsaw, Poland, under the tutelage of the revered pedagogue, Ireneusz Gugulski\u00a0[pl]. From 1967 to 1972, Dziarski attended the University of Warsaw with a major in Biology and Microbiology, which he studied under W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kunicki-Goldfinger\u00a0[pl].

In 1991, Dziarski was promoted to a Full Professor of Microbiology and Immunology with tenure.[1][2] He held this position until his retirement in 2021, when he became Professor Emeritus of Microbiology and Immunology.[2]/nIn his early research, Dziarski focused on the role of bacterial peptidoglycan in innate immunity. He showed that peptidoglycan is an immunomodulator[13][14][15] and a polyclonal activator of B lymphocytes.[16][17][18][19][20][21] He determined the role of DNA synthesis, intracellular calcium, protein kinase C, and inhibitory G proteins in peptidoglycan-induced polyclonal B lymphocyte activation.[22][23][24][25] He also established the role of peptidoglycan and other polyclonal B cell activators in the induction of autoantibody responses in various models of autoimmunity.[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]/nIn his subsequent research, Dziarski set out to identify peptidoglycan receptors on immune cells that mediate the cell-activating and immunomodulating effects of peptidoglycan. His early attempts using biochemical methods were not successful, as they were prone to nonspecific interactions and technical artifacts.[35][36][37][38][39]  He also showed that similar problems and artifacts plagued the early attempts to identify the cell receptors for bacterial lipopolysaccharide and other cell activators.[37][38][39]/nThe molecular biology approach to identifying the cell-activating peptidoglycan receptors was more successful. Using this approach, Dziarski and his research group, in collaboration with Dipika Gupta and her group (also at Indiana University School of Medicine), identified CD14 as the cell-activating receptor for peptidoglycan and showed that CD14 physically binds peptidoglycan.[40][41][42][43][44][45][46] Furthermore, Dziarski's and Gupta's groups identified the involvement of several signal transduction molecules and pathways in peptidoglycan-induced cell activation.[47][48][49][50] Dziarski also established that chemokines are the main pro-inflammatory mediators in human monocytes activated by peptidoglycan and other bacterial cell activators.[51][52][53]/nUsing similar molecular biology approach the research groups of Carsten J. Kirschning (at Tularik Inc.) and Douglas Golenbock (at Boston University School of Medicine) in collaboration with Dziarski, discovered that TLR2 is the cell-activating receptor for peptidoglycan and other components of Gram-positive bacteria.[54][55] In the follow-up studies, Dziarski's and Gupta's groups identified the signal transduction pathway activated by peptidoglycan through TLR2 and verified that TLR2 is indeed the peptidoglycan cell-activating receptor.[56][57][58][59]/nDziarski's best known contribution to innate immunity is his research on mammalian peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). In 2001, Dziarski's and Gupta's groups discovered and cloned three human PGRPs, which they named PGRP-L, PGRP-I\u03b1, and PGRP-I\u03b2 (for long and intermediate size transcripts).[6] They established that the human genome codes for a family of 4 PGRPs: PGRP-S (short PGRP), PGRP-L, PGRP-I\u03b1, and PGRP-I\u03b2.[6] Subsequently, the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee changed the gene symbols of PGRP-S, PGRP-L, PGRP-I\u03b1, and PGRP-I\u03b2 to PGLYRP1, PGLYRP2, PGLYRP3, and PGLYRP4, respectively, and this nomenclature is currently also used for other mammalian PGRPs.[7][8][9][10]/nDziarski and his collaborators showed that mammalian PGRPs are selectively expressed in immune and epithelial cells.[6][60][61][62]/nDziarski and his collaborators established that all mammalian PGRPs bind bacterial peptidoglycan.[6][60][61] Then, they identified the functions of human PGRPs: PGLYRP2 is a peptidoglycan-lytic enzyme, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase,[63][64] and PGLYRP1, PGLYRP3, and PGLYRP4 are directly bactericidal for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.[60][61][65]/nIn further research, Dziarski's group established the mechanism of bacterial killing by human PGRPs. They showed that human PGRPs kill bacteria by simultaneously inducing three synergistic stress responses: oxidative stress, thiol stress, and metal stress, by interfering with the function of the bacterial respiratory electron transport chain.[66][67][68][69][70][71] Dziarski also showed that bacterial killing by these PGRPs does not involve cell membrane permeabilization, cell wall hydrolysis, or osmotic shock,[61][65][66] but is synergistic with antibacterial peptides.[65]/nCollaborative research of Dipika Gupta's and Dziarski's groups also identified and cloned three zebrafish PGRPs and showed that they are highly expressed in eggs, developing embryos, and adult tissues that contact the external environment.[72] They further showed that these PGRPs have both peptidoglycan-lytic amidase and bactericidal activities and are essential for defense against bacterial infections and survival of the developing zebrafish embryos.[72]/nDziarski's group also identified several in vivo functions of mammalian PGRPs. Dziarski showed that despite their bactericidal activity, mammalian PGRPs have only a limited role in defense against infections. Intranasal application of PGLYRP3 or PGLYRP4 in mice protects from intranasal lung infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli,[61][73] and PGLYRP1-deficient mice are more sensitive to systemic infections with non-pathogenic bacteria (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis).[74]/nDziarski's group further showed that mouse PGRPs play a role in maintaining healthy microbiome, because PGLYRP1-, PGLYRP2-, PGLYRP3-, and PGLYRP4-deficient mice have significant changes in the composition of their intestinal microbiomes.[75][76][77] PGLYRP1-deficient mice also have changes in their lung microbiome.[77]/nDziarski's and Gupta's groups further showed that mouse PGRPs play a role in maintaining anti- and pro-inflammatory homeostasis in the intestine, skin, lungs, and joints.[8][10] They demonstrated that all four PGLYRPs protect mice from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and the effect of PGLYRP2 and PGLYRP3 on the intestinal microbiome is responsible for this protection.[75][76][78] They showed that PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 are anti-inflammatory and protect mice from experimentally induced atopic dermatitis,[79] and PGLYRP2 is also anti-inflammatory and protects mice from experimentally induced psoriasis-like inflammation.[80] They also showed that some PGRPs have opposite effects, i.e., PGLYRP2 also has a pro-inflammatory effect, as it promotes the development of experimental arthritis,[81] and PGLYRP1 is pro-inflammatory and promotes experimentally induced asthma[82] and skin inflammation[79][80] in mice. The pro-inflammatory effect of PGLYRP1 on asthma depends on the PGLYRP1-regulated intestinal microbiome.[77]/nIn collaborative research, Dipika Gupta's and Dziarski's groups showed that patients with two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, have significantly more frequent missense variants in all four PGLYRP genes than healthy control individuals.[83] These results suggest that PGRPs may protect humans from these inflammatory diseases, and that mutations in PGLYRP genes may be among the genetic factors predisposing to these diseases.[83]/nDziarski authored over 150 scientific publications, which have over 14,000 citations, h-index of 49, and i10-index of 90.[84] From 1979 to 2020, Dziarski was a Principal Investigator on more than 20 research grants, including 10 awards from the National Institutes of Health.[2]/nDziarski is a dedicated educator.
