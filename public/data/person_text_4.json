After living in the British Mandate of Palestine for several years, her family moved to the United States when she was 11. She attended the Girls' Latin School in Boston,[3] and first became excited by mathematics in her sophomore year, when she studied Euclidean geometry.[4]/nEntering Radcliffe College,[3] she began studying physics, because she thought that studying mathematics could only lead to a career as a schoolteacher and, at that time, teachers were dismissed once they married. However, her experiences with unknown environmental influences in physics experiments led her back to mathematics, where \"we have control over our assumptions\".[4]\nAs an upper-division undergraduate at Radcliffe, Haimo could enroll in mathematics courses at Harvard College.[3] Her instructors there included Hassler Whitney and Saunders Mac Lane, and it was in one of these classes that she met her future husband, Franklin Tepper Haimo.[2] She graduated in 1943 from Radcliffe, with both a bachelor's and master's degree in mathematics.[3]/nNext, Haimo worked as a mathematics instructor at a sequence of institutions: Lake Erie College, Northeastern University, Washington University in St. Louis, and Southern Illinois University. During this time, she also raised a family of five children. After a ten-year break from her education, she returned to graduate study while she taught at Washington University and Southern Illinois University,[3] and completed her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1964. Her dissertation, supervised by David Widder with additional unofficial mentorship from Isidore Isaac Hirschman Jr. of Washington University, was Integral Equations Associated With Hankel Convolutions.[3][5]/nOn completing her doctorate, she was promoted to a regular-rank faculty member at Southern Illinois. She moved to the University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis in 1968, soon becoming department chair there.[3] She served as MAA president for 1991\u20131992, becoming the third female president of the MAA after Dorothy Lewis Bernstein and Lida Barrett.[6] During her term as president, she created a teaching award, reorganized the MAA's committee structure, and worked to promote women in mathematics.[1][2] She retired in 1992 and moved to La Jolla, California,[3][1] where she took an appointment as a visiting scholar at the  University of California, San Diego.[2] She died on May 17, 2007.[3][1]/nFranklin & Marshall College gave Haimo an honorary doctorate in 1991.

The result was Rashevsky's move to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and his taking ownership of the well-funded \"Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics\".[citation needed]/nHe also formed in 1969 a non-profit organization, \"Mathematical Biology, Incorporated\", which was to be the precursor of \"The Society for Mathematical Biology\", with the purpose of \"dissemination of information regarding Mathematical Biology\".[citation needed]/nIn his later years, after 1968, he became again very active in relational biology and held, as well as Chaired, in 1970 the first international \"Symposium of Mathematical Biology\" at Toledo, Ohio, in USA with the help of his former PhD student, Dr. Anthony Bartholomay, who has become the chairman of the first Department of Mathematical Medicine at Ohio University. The meeting was sponsored by Mathematical Biology, Inc.[citation needed]/nRashevsky was greatly influenced and inspired both by Herbert Spencer's book on the Principles of Biology (1898), and also by J. H. Woodger `axiomatic (Mendelian) genetics', to launch his own search and quest for biological principles, and also to formulate mathematically precise principles and axioms of biology. He then developed his own highly original approach to address the fundamental question of What is Life? that another theoretical physicist, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, had asked before him from the narrower viewpoint of quantum theory in biology.[citation needed]/nHe wished to reach this `holy grail' of (theoretical/ mathematical) biology, but his heavy work load during the late 1960s\u2014despite his related health problems\u2014took its toll, and finally prevented him in 1972 from reaching his ultimate goal. Rashevsky's relational approach represents a radical departure from reductionistic approaches, and it has greatly influenced the work of his student Robert Rosen.[citation needed]/nIn 1917, Nicolas Rashevsky joined the White Russian Navy and in 1920 he and his wife, Countess Emily had to flee for their lives to Constantinople where he taught at the American College. In 1921 they moved to Prague where he taught both special and general relativity.[citation needed]/nFrom Prague, he moved in the 1930s to Paris, France, and then to New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago, USA. His life has been dedicated to the science that he founded, Mathematical Biology, and his wife Emily was very supportive and appreciative of his scientific efforts, accompanying him at the scientific meetings that he either initiated or attended.[citation needed]/nHe cut a tall, impressive figure with a slight Eastern European accent, but a clear voice and thought to the very day when in 1972 he died from a heart attack caused by coronary heart disease. His generosity was very well known and is often recognized in print by former associates or visitors. As the Chief Editor of BMB he had a declared policy of helping the authors to optimize their presentation of submitted papers, as well as proving many valuable suggestions to the submitting authors.[citation needed]/nHis suggested detailed changes, additions and further developments were like a real `gold mine' for the submitting authors. He managed to stay aloof of all science `politics' most of the time, even in very adverse circumstances such as those during the McCarthy era when completely unfounded political accusations were made about one or two members of his close research group. Not unlike another American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, he then had much to lose for his loyal support of the wrongly accused researcher in his group.[citation needed]/nThis article incorporates material from Nicolas Rashevsky on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.

He made significant contributions to real and complex analysis, the calculus of variations, and measure theory. He also created an axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics. Carath\u00e9odory is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of his era[3] and the most renowned Greek mathematician since antiquity.[4]/nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory was born in 1873 in Berlin to Greek parents and grew up in Brussels. His father Stephanos\u00a0[tr], a lawyer, served as the Ottoman ambassador to Belgium, St. Petersburg and Berlin. His mother, Despina, n\u00e9e Petrokokkinos, was from the island of Chios. The Carath\u00e9odory family, originally from Bosnochori or Vyssa, was well established and respected in Constantinople, and its members held many important governmental positions./nThe Carath\u00e9odory family spent 1874\u201375 in Constantinople, where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of pneumonia in Cannes. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time./nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 on the Italian Riviera. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium./nAt this stage Carath\u00e9odory began training as a military engineer. He attended the \u00c9cole Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the \u00c9cole d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 a war broke out between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carath\u00e9odory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the Assiut dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as Jordan's Cours d'Analyse and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of conic sections. He also visited the Cheops pyramid and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901.[5] He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country.[6]/nCarath\u00e9odory studied engineering in Belgium at the Royal Military Academy, where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student./nCarath\u00e9odory had about 20 doctoral students among these being Hans Rademacher, known for his work on analysis and number theory, and Paul Finsler known for his creation of Finsler space./nCarath\u00e9odory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: Hermann Minkowski, David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Albert Einstein, Edmund Landau, Hermann Amandus Schwarz, Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze./nEinstein, then in a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was working on his general theory of relativity when he contacted Carath\u00e9odory asking for clarifications on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and canonical transformations. He wanted to see a satisfactory derivation of the former and the origins of the latter. Einstein told Carath\u00e9odory his derivation was \"beautiful\" and recommended its publication in the Annalen der Physik. Einstein employed the former in a 1917 paper titled Zum Quantensatz von Sommerfeld und Epstein (On the Quantum Theorem of Sommerfeld and Epstein). Carath\u00e9odory explained some fundamental details of the canonical transformations and referred Einstein to E.T. Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics. Einstein was trying to solve the problem of \"closed time-lines\" or the geodesics corresponding to the closed trajectory of light and free particles in a static universe, which he introduced in 1917.[7]/nLandau and Schwarz stimulated his interest in the study of complex analysis.[8]/nWhile in Germany Carath\u00e9odory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at G\u00f6ttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carath\u00e9odory helped the Greek topologist Christos Papakyriakopoulos take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carath\u00e9odory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.[9]/nIn his doctoral dissertation, Carath\u00e9odory showed how to extend solutions to discontinuous cases and studied isoperimetric problems.[8]/nPreviously, between the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s, Leonhard Euler, Adrien-Marie Legendre, and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi were able to establish necessary but insufficient conditions for the existence of a strong relative minimum. In 1879, Karl Weierstrass added a fourth that does indeed guarantee such a quantity exists. [10] Carath\u00e9odory constructed his method for deriving sufficient conditions based on the use of the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as Carath\u00e9odory's method of equivalent variational problems or the royal road to the calculus of variations.[10][11] A key advantage of Carath\u00e9odory's work on this topic is that it illuminates the relation between the calculus of variations and partial differential equations.[8] It allows for quick and elegant derivations of conditions of sufficiency in the calculus of variations and leads directly to the Euler-Lagrange equation and the Weierstrass condition. He published his Variationsrechnung und Partielle Differentialgleichungen Erster Ordnung (Calculus of Variations and First-order Partial Differential Equations) in 1935.[10]/nMore recently, Carath\u00e9odory's work on the calculus of variations and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation has been taken into the theory of optimal control and dynamic programming.[10][12] The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.[citation needed]/nCarath\u00e9odory's theorem in convex geometry states that if a point \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n of \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\nd\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{d}}\n\n lies in the convex hull of a set \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n, then \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n can be written as the convex combination of at most \n\n\n\nd\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d+1}\n\n points in \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. Namely, there is a subset \n\n\n\n\nP\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P'}\n\n of \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n consisting of \n\n\n\nd\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d+1}\n\n or fewer points such that \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n lies in the convex hull of \n\n\n\n\nP\n\u2032\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P'}\n\n. Equivalently, \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n lies in an \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n-simplex with vertices in \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nr\n\u2264\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r\\leq d}\n\n.  The smallest \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n that makes the last statement valid for each \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n in the convex hull of P is defined as the Carath\u00e9odory's number of \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. Depending on the properties of \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n, upper bounds lower than the one provided by Carath\u00e9odory's theorem can be obtained.[13]/nHe is credited with the authorship of the Carath\u00e9odory conjecture claiming that a closed convex surface admits at least two umbilic points. As of 2021, this conjecture remained unproven despite having attracted a large amount of research./nHe proved an existence theorem for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions./nAnother theorem of his on the derivative of a function at a point could be used to prove the Chain Rule and the formula for the derivative of inverse functions.[14]/nHe greatly extended the theory of conformal transformation[15] proving his theorem about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains. In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of prime ends.[8] He exhibited an elementary proof of the Schwarz lemma.[8]/nCarath\u00e9odory was also interested in the theory of functions of multiple complex variables. In his investigations on this subject he sought analogs of classical results from the single-variable case. He proved that a ball in \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}}\n\n is not holomorphically equivalent to the bidisc.[8]/nHe is credited with the Carath\u00e9odory extension theorem which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carath\u00e9odory extended the theory from sets to Boolean algebras./nThermodynamics had been a subject dear to Carath\u00e9odory since his time in Belgium.[16] In 1909, he published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"[17] in which he formulated the second law of thermodynamics axiomatically, that is, without the use of Carnot engines and refrigerators and only by mathematical reasoning. This is yet another version of the second law, alongside the statements of Clausius, and of Kelvin and Planck.[18] Carath\u00e9odory's version attracted the attention of some of the top physicists of the time, including Max Planck, Max Born, and Arnold Sommerfeld.[8] According to  Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carath\u00e9odory's approach is called \"mechanical,\" rather than \"thermodynamic.\"[19] Max Born acclaimed this \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" and he expressed his enthusiasm in his letters to Einstein.[20][16] However, Max Planck had some misgivings[21] in that while he was impressed by Carath\u00e9odory's mathematical prowess, he did not accept that this was a fundamental formulation, given the statistical nature of the second law.[16]/nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance heat is not an essential concept but a derived one.[22] He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The Second Law of Thermodynamics was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term adiabatic accessibility.[23]/nCarath\u00e9odory's work in optics is closely related to his method in the calculus of variations.  In 1926 he gave a strict and general proof that no system of lenses and mirrors can avoid aberration, except for the trivial case of plane mirrors.\nIn his later work he gave the theory of the Schmidt telescope.[24] In his Geometrische Optik (1937), Carath\u00e9odory demonstrated the equivalence of Huygens' principle and Fermat's principle starting from the former using Cauchy's theory of characteristics. He argued that an important advantage of his approach was that it covers the integral invariants of Henri Poincar\u00e9 and \u00c9lie Cartan and completes the Malus law. He explained that in his investigations in optics, Pierre de Fermat conceived a minimum principle similar to that enunciated by Hero of Alexandria to study reflection.[25]/nDuring the Second World War Carath\u00e9odory edited two volumes of Euler's Complete Works dealing with the Calculus of Variations which were submitted for publication in 1946.[26]/nAt the time, Athens was the only major educational centre in the wider area and had limited capacity to sufficiently satisfy the growing educational need of the eastern part of the Aegean Sea and the Balkans. Constantin Carath\u00e9odory, who was a professor at the University of Berlin at the time, proposed the establishment of a new University [27] - the difficulties regarding the establishment of a Greek university in Constantinople led him to consider three other cities: Thessaloniki, Chios and Smyrna.[28]/nAt the invitation of the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos he submitted a plan on 20 October 1919 for the creation of a new University at Smyrna in Asia Minor, to be named Ionian University of Smyrna. In 1920 Carath\u00e9odory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the War in Asia Minor which ended in the Great Fire of Smyrna. Carath\u00e9odory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who took him by rowboat to the battleship Naxos which was standing by.[29] Carath\u00e9odory brought to Athens some of the university library and stayed in Athens, teaching at the university and technical school until 1924./nIn 1924 Carath\u00e9odory was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Munich, and held this position until retirement in 1938. He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950./nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carath\u00e9odory, finally materialised with the establishment of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1925.[30]/nCarath\u00e9odory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family. Greek and French were his first languages, and he mastered German with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks.[31] Carath\u00e9odory also spoke and wrote English, Italian, Turkish, and the ancient languages without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extended his fields of knowledge./nMuch more than that, Carath\u00e9odory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected German philologist and professor of ancient languages, Kurt von Fritz, praised Carath\u00e9odory  on the grounds that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Von Fritz conducted numerous philosophical discussions with Carath\u00e9odory./nThe mathematician sent his son Stephanos and daughter Despina  to a German high school, but they also obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest, and  at home he allowed them to speak Greek only./nCarath\u00e9odory was a talented public speaker, and was often invited to give speeches. In 1936, it was he who handed out the first ever Fields Medals at the meeting of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo, Norway.[8]/nIn 2002, in recognition of his achievements, the University of Munich named one of the largest lecture rooms in the mathematical institute the Constantin-Carath\u00e9odory Lecture Hall.[32]/nIn the town of Nea Vyssa,  Caratheodory's ancestral home,  a unique  family museum is to be found. The museum is located in the central square of the town near to its church, and includes a number of Karatheodory's personal items,  as well as letters  he  exchanged with Albert Einstein.  More information is provided at the original website of the club,  http://www.s-karatheodoris.gr./nAt the same time,  Greek authorities had long since intended  to create a museum honoring Karatheodoris in Komotini, a major town of the northeastern Greek region,  more than 200km away from his home town above. On 21 March 2009, the \"Karatheodoris\" Museum (\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03ae\u03c2) opened its gates to the public in Komotini.[33][34][35]/nThe coordinator of the Museum, Athanasios Lipordezis (\u0391\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039b\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ad\u03b6\u03b7\u03c2), has noted that the museum provides a home for original manuscripts of the mathematician running to  about 10,000 pages,  including correspondence with the German mathematician Arthur Rosenthal for the algebraization of measure.  At the showcase, visitors are also able to view the books \" Gesammelte mathematische Schriften Band 1,2,3,4 \", \"Mass und ihre Algebraiserung\", \" Reelle Functionen Band 1\", \" Zahlen/Punktionen Funktionen \", and a number of others. Handwritten letters by Carath\u00e9odory to Albert Einstein and Hellmuth Kneser, as well as photographs of the Carath\u00e9odory family, are on display./nEfforts to furnish the museum with more exhibits are ongoing.[36][37][38]/nA complete list of Carath\u00e9odory's journal article publications can be found in his Collected Works(Ges.

In Rio de Janeiro, she graduated from high school at Bennett College and joined the National Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Brazil (today UFRJ), in the Mathematics Degree.[1]/nFrom 1964 to 1968, she taught mathematics at a secondary school in Rio. She completed her university course in 1967 and began her higher education activities at the Institute of Mathematics of UFRJ in 1968. Between 08/1968 to 07/1969, she attended a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Michigan, USA, while accompanying her husband who was study abroad. Upon returning to Brazil, she returned to teaching at UFRJ and began a doctoral program at IMPA.

From 1975 to 1978 she pursued a postdoctoral position at the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. During this period, she developed her research under the influence of S. S.

Though called to the Bar in due course, he never practised, but was speedily promoted to the office of an Examiner, the duties of which he discharged with marked attention and success, while finding time for other work which made for him a name among men of science. ... He was an early member of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects, of which he was for many years Honorary Secretary, receiving a handsome testimonial on his retirement in 1875. Some mathematical papers he had contributed to the Transactions of some of the learned societies, and especially some memoirs on the calculation of elliptic integrals in the Philosophical Transactions, led to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863. In 1867 the Government established the Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at South Kensington, and Mr. C. W. Merrifield, at the request of the authorities, accepted the office of Vice-Principal. He only intended to take this as a temporary measure, but as the result of the lamented death of Mr. Purkiss, who was to have been Principal, Mr. Merrifield was appointed to that office. On the transfer of the Institution to Greenwich in 1873, he resumed his office of Examiner in the Education Department.[2]/nFor the British Association's Section of Mechanical Science, he was in 1875 the Section's Vice-President at the Brighton meeting and then in 1876 the Section's President at the Glasgow meeting. He served on the British Association's committee given the task of reporting on Charles Babbage\u2019s analytical machine. For the London Mathematical Society, he served as Vice-President in 1876\u20131878, as President in 1878\u20131880, and as Treasurer in 1880\u20131882.[3]/nCharles was the eldest son of the author and artist Mary Philadelphia Merrifield and brother of the barrister Frederick Merrifield.  His nieces were the classical scholar Margaret Verrall (nee Merrifield) and suffrage campaigner Flora Merrifield.", "2633325": "Norman Macleod Ferrers (11 August 1829 \u2013 31 January 1903) was a British mathematician and university administrator and editor of a mathematical journal./nFerrers was educated at Eton College before studying at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was Senior Wrangler in 1851.  He was appointed to a Fellowship at the college in 1852, was called to the bar in 1855 and was ordained deacon in 1859 and priest in 1860.  In 1880, he was appointed Master of the college, and served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University from 1884 to 1885.[1]/nFerrers made many contributions to mathematical literature. From 1855 to 1891 he worked with J. J. Sylvester as editors, with others, in publishing The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics. Ferrers assembled the papers of George Green for publication in 1871.[2]/nIn 1861 he published \"An Elementary Treatise on Trilinear Co-ordinates\".[3] One of his early contributions was on Sylvester's development of Poinsot's representation of the motion of a rigid body about a fixed point./nIn 1871 he first suggested to extend the equations of motion with nonholonomic constraints.[4]\nHis another treatise on \"Spherical Harmonics,\" published in 1877, presented many original features. \nIn 1881 he studied Kelvin's investigation of the law of distribution of electricity in equilibrium on an uninfluenced spherical bowl \nand made the addition of finding the potential at any point of space in zonal harmonics./nHe died at the College Lodge on 31 January 1903.[5]/nFerrers is associated with a particular way of arranging the partition of a natural number p. If p is the sum of n terms, the largest of which is m, then the Ferrers diagram starts with a row of m dots. The terms are arranged in order, and a row of dots corresponds to each term./nAdams, Ferrers, and Sylvester articulated this theorem of partitions: \"The number of modes of partitioning (n) into (m) parts is equal to the number of modes of partitioning (n) into parts, one of which is always (m), and the others (m) or less than (m).\" The proof, attributed to Ferrers by Sylvester in 1883, involves flipping a Ferrers diagram about a diagonal line.[6]/nIn 1951 Jacques Riguet adopted this manner of ordering to the rows of a logical matrix. Alignment of rows of ones along the right side of a matrix is used, instead of the alignment of dots on the left. The logical matrix corresponds to a heterogeneous relation of Ferrers type.[7]/nOn 3 April 1866, he married Emily, daughter of John Lamb, dean of Bristol cathedral. \nThey had four sons and one daughter.[5]", "34942573": "Sara Cosette Billey (born February 6, 1968 in Alva, Oklahoma, United States) is an American mathematician working in algebraic combinatorics.

The literal translation of Jordanus de Nemore (Giordano of Nemi) would indicate that he was an Italian.[1] He wrote treatises on at least 6 different important mathematical subjects: the science of weights; \u201calgorismi\u201d treatises on practical arithmetic; pure arithmetic; algebra; geometry; and stereographic projection. Most of these treatises exist in several versions or reworkings from the Middle Ages. We know nothing about him personally, other than the approximate date of his work./nNo biographical details are known about Jordanus de Nemore. Cited in the early manuscripts simply as \u201cJordanus\u201d, he was later given the sobriquet of \u201cde Nemore\u201d (\u201cof the Forest,\u201d \u201cForester\u201d) which does not add any firm biographical information. In the Renaissance his name was often given as \"Jordanus Nemorarius\", an improper form./nAn entry in the nineteenth-century manuscript catalogue for the S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek in Dresden suggested that Jordanus taught at the University of Toulouse, but the text in question was not written by Jordanus and this possible association is without foundation.[2] A fourteenth-century chronicle of the Order of Preachers by the Englishman Nicholas Trivet (or Triveth, 1258\u20131328) suggested that the second master-general of the Dominican Order, Jordanus of Saxony (d. 1237) wrote two mathematical texts with titles similar to two by Jordanus de Nemore, but this late suggestion is more likely a confusion on the part of Trivet, rather than any proof of identity. Jordanus of Saxony never uses the name \u201cde Nemore\u201d and is nowhere else credited with mathematical writings \u2013 in fact he had lectured in theology at the University of Paris. Likewise the name of Jordanus of Saxony is never found with a mathematical text. This identity, popular among some in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, has been for the most part abandoned./nIt is assumed that Jordanus did work in the first part of the thirteenth century (or even in the late twelfth) since his works are contained in a booklist, the Biblionomia of Richard de Fournival, compiled between 1246 and 1260.[3]/nThe medieval \u201cscience of weights\u201d (i.e., mechanics) owes much of its importance to the work of Jordanus. In the Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum, he introduces the concept of \u201cpositional gravity\u201d and the use of component forces. Pierre Duhem (in his Origines de la statique, 1905) thought that Jordanus also introduces infinitesimal considerations into statics in his discussion of \"virtual\" displacements (this being another interpretation of Duhem) of objects in equilibrium. He proves the law of the lever by means of the principle of work. The De ratione ponderis also proves the conditions of equilibrium of unequal weights on planes inclined at different angles \u2013 long before it was re-established by Simon Stevin (with his clootcrans -- \"wreath of spheres\" experiment)  and later by  Galileo./nThe Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum seems to be the one work which can definitely be ascribed to Jordanus; and the first of the series. Jordanus took what Joseph Brown has called the \"Logician\u2019s Abstract of On the Karaston\" (a skillful compression of the conclusions of Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra\u2019s Liber karastonis) and created a new treatise (7 axioms and 9 propositions) in order to establish a mathematical basis for the four propositions on the Roman balance called the Liber de canonio. An early commentary on this (which also contains a necessary correction to Proposition 9) is the \u201cCorpus Christi Commentary\u201d./nThe Liber de ponderibus fuses the seven axioms and nine propositions of the Elementa to the four propositions of the De canonio. There are at least two commentary traditions to the Liber de ponderibus which improve some of the demonstrations and better integrate the two sources./nThe De ratione ponderis is a skillfully corrected and expanded version (45 propositions) of the Elementa. This is usually ascribed to Jordanus, but more likely it is the work of an unidentified mathematician because the citations by Jordanus of his other works are deleted./nRelated to these treatises is an anonymous set of comments, each of which begins with the words \u201cAliud commentum\u201d (and thus known as the \u201cAliud commentum\u201d version). This commentary surpasses all others, especially the commentary on Proposition 1./nThere are 5 algorismi treatises in this category, examined by Gustaf Enestr\u00f6m early in the twentieth century, dealing with practical arithmetic./nThe Communis et consuetus (its opening words) appears to be the earliest form of the work, closely related to the much expanded Demonstratio de algorismo. Enestr\u00f6m believed that the Communis et consuetus was certainly by Jordanus./nThe later Demonstratio de algorismo contains 21 definitions and 34 propositions. This is probably a later version of the Communis et consuetus, made either by Jordanus himself or by some other thirteenth-century mathematician./nThe Tractatus minutiarum on fractions seems to be a second part of the Communis et consuetus \u2013 they are often found together in the manuscripts./nThe Demonstratio de minutiius likewise is linked to the Demonstratio de algorismo, and contains and expands the propositions found in the Tractatus minutiarum \u2013 again a re-edition of the original text./nThe Algorismus demonstratus is a spurious attribution although for a long time this item was ascribed to Jordanus. Up until Enestr\u00f6m began to sort out the various treatises, the Algorismus demonstratus \u2013 since it was the only one published (ed. Johannes Sch\u00f6ner, Nuremberg, 1543) \u2013 was the heading under which all the treatises were grouped. Enestr\u00f6m thought it highly unlikely, however, that this version was the work of Jordanus since no manuscript ascribes it to him (if they give an author, it is generally a Magister Gernarus, or Gerhardus or Gernandus). The first part of this treatise (also known as the Algorismus de integris) contains definitions, axioms and 43 propositions. The second part (the Algorismus de minutiis) contains definitions and 42 propositions. Enestr\u00f6m shows that while different from the algorismi treatises of Jordanus, the Algorismus demonstratus is still closely related to them./nThis treatise on arithmetic contains over 400 propositions divided into ten books. There are three versions or editions in manuscript form, the second one with different or expanded proofs than found in the first, and a number of propositions added at the end; the third version inserts the added propositions into their logical position in the text, and again changed some of the proofs. Jordanus\u2019 aim was to write a complete summary of arithmetic, similar to what Euclid had done for geometry.[4]/nJordanus collected and organized the whole field of arithmetic, based both on Euclid\u2019s work and on that of Boethius. Definitions, axioms and postulates lead to propositions with proofs which are somewhat sketchy at times, leaving the reader to complete the argument. Here also Jordanus uses letters to represent numbers, but numerical examples, of the type found in the De numeris datis, are not given.[5]/nThe editor of this treatise on algebra, Barnabas Hughes, has found two sets of manuscripts for this text, one containing 95 propositions, the other, 113. As well some of the common propositions have different proofs. There are also 4 digests or revisions in manuscript form./nJordanus\u2019 De numeris datis was the first treatise in advanced algebra composed in Western Europe, building on elementary algebra provided in twelfth-century translations from Arabic sources. It anticipates by 350 years the introduction of algebraic analysis by Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te into Renaissance mathematics. Jordanus used a system similar to that of Vi\u00e8te (although couched on non-symbolic terms) of formulating the equation (setting out the problem in terms of what is known and of what is to be found), of transforming the initial given equation into a solution, and the introduction of specific numbers that fulfil the conditions set by the problem./nThis is medieval geometry at its best. It contains propositions on such topics as the ratios of sides and angles of triangles; the division of straight lines, triangles, and quadrangles under different conditions; the ratio of arcs and plane segments in the same or in different circles; trisecting an angle; the area of triangles given the length of the sides; squaring the circle./nAgain there are two versions of this text: the shorter and presumably first edition (the Liber philotegni Iordani de Nemore) and a longer version (Liber de triangulis Iordani) which divides the text into books, re-arranges and expands book 2, and adds propositions 4-12 to 4-28. This latter set of 17 propositions also circulated separately. While the longer version may not be by Jordanus, it was certainly complete by the end of the thirteenth century./nThis treatise of five propositions deals with various aspects of stereographic projection (used in planispheric astrolabes). The first and historically the most important proposition proves for all cases that circles on the surface of a sphere when projected stereographically on a plane remain circles (or a circle of infinite radius, i.e., a straight line). While this property was known long before Jordanus, it had never been proved./nThere are three versions of the treatise: the basic text, a second version with an introduction and a much expanded text, and a third, only slightly expanded. The introduction is sometimes found with version 1 and 3, but it was obviously written by someone else./nThe De proportionibus (on ratios), the Isoperimetra (on figures with equal perimeters),[6] the Demonstrationes pro astrolapsu (on astrolabe engraving), and the Pre-exercitamina (\u201ca short introductory exercise\u201d?) are dubiously ascribed to Jordanus. A number of other texts including a Liber de speculis and a Compositum astrolabii are spurious ascriptions.[7]/nThe book \"Eresia Pura\", by Adriano Petta is a fiction, in italian, based on historical research, around the life of Jordanus de Nemore.

Jean (1788\u20131836) emigrated to North America and became a general in the Mexican army. Jacques \u00c9tienne Victor (1799\u20131855) took part in Louis de Freycinet's exploring voyage in the Uranie from 1817 to 1821, and on his return to France devoted himself to his journalism and the drama. The fourth brother, \u00c9tienne Vincent (1802\u20131892), is said to have collaborated with Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in The Heiress of Birague, and from 1822 to 1847 wrote a great number of light dramatic pieces, mostly in collaboration.[4]/nShowing decided military tastes, Fran\u00e7ois Arago was sent to the municipal college of Perpignan, where he began to study mathematics in preparation for the entrance examination of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Within two years and a half he had mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a great deal more, and, on going up for examination at Toulouse, he astounded his examiner by his knowledge of J.-L. Lagrange 's work.[4][5]/nTowards the close of 1803, Arago entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Paris, but apparently found the professors there incapable of imparting knowledge or maintaining discipline. The artillery service was his ambition, and in 1804, through the advice and recommendation of Sim\u00e9on Poisson, he received the appointment of secretary to the Paris Observatory. \nHe now became acquainted with Pierre-Simon Laplace, and through his influence was commissioned, with Jean-Baptiste Biot, to complete the meridian arc measurements which had been begun by J. B. J. Delambre, and interrupted since the death of P. F. A. M\u00e9chain in 1804 (the meridian arc of Delambre and M\u00e9chain). \nArago and Biot left Paris in 1806 and began operations along the mountains of Spain.\nBiot returned to Paris after they had determined the latitude of Formentera, the southernmost point to which they were to carry the survey.[4] \nArago continued the work until 1809, his purpose being to measure a meridian arc in order to determine the exact length of a metre./nAfter Biot's departure, the political ferment caused by the entrance of the French into Spain extended to the Balearic Islands, and the population suspected Arago's movements and his lighting of fires on the top of Mount Galatz\u00f3 (Catalan: Mola de l'Esclop) as the activities of a spy for the invading army.[5] Their reaction was such that he was obliged to give himself up for imprisonment in the fortress of Bellver in June 1808. On 28 July he escaped from the island in a fishing-boat, and after an adventurous voyage he reached Algiers on 3 August. From there he obtained a passage in a vessel bound for Marseille, but on 16 August, just as the vessel was nearing Marseille, it fell into the hands of a Spanish corsair. With the rest the crew, Arago was taken to Roses, and imprisoned first in a windmill, and afterwards in a fortress, until the town fell into the hands of the French, when the prisoners were transferred to Palamos.[4][5]/nAfter three months' imprisonment, Arago and the others were released on the demand of the dey of Algiers, and again set sail for Marseille on 28 November, but then within sight of their port they were driven back by a northerly wind to Bougie on the coast of Africa. Transport to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary delay of three months; Arago, therefore, set out over land, guided by a Muslim priest, and reached it on Christmas Day. After six months in Algiers he once again, on 21 June 1809, set sail for Marseille, where he had to undergo a monotonous and inhospitable quarantine in the lazaretto, before his difficulties were over. The first letter he received, while in the lazaretto, was from Alexander von Humboldt; and this was the origin of a connection which, in Arago's words, \"lasted over forty years without a single cloud ever having troubled it.\"[4]/nArago had succeeded in preserving the records of his survey; and his first act on his return home was to deposit them in the Bureau des Longitudes at Paris. As a reward for his adventurous conduct in the cause of science, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences, at the remarkably early age of twenty-three, and before the close of 1809 he was chosen by the council of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique to succeed Gaspard Monge in the chair of analytical geometry. At the same time he was named by the emperor one of the astronomers of the Paris Observatory, which was accordingly his residence till his death. It was in this capacity that he delivered his remarkably successful series of popular lectures in astronomy, which were continued from 1812 to 1845.[4]/nIn 1818 or 1819 he proceeded along with Biot to execute geodetic operations on the coasts of France, England and Scotland. They measured the length of the seconds pendulum at Leith, Scotland, and in the Shetland Islands, the results of the observations being published in 1821, along with those made in Spain. Arago was elected a member of the Bureau des Longitudes immediately afterwards, and contributed to each of its Annuals, for about twenty-two years, important scientific notices on astronomy and meteorology and occasionally on civil engineering, as well as interesting memoirs of members of the Academy.[4]/nArago's earliest physical researches were on the pressure of steam at different temperatures, and the velocity of sound, 1818 to 1822. His magnetic observations mostly took place from 1823 to 1826. He discovered rotatory magnetism, what has been called Arago's rotations, and the fact that most bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Michael Faraday./nArago warmly supported Augustin-Jean Fresnel's optical theories, helping to confirm Fresnel's wave theory of light by observing what is now known as the spot of Arago. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted of a resolution of rectilinear propagation into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the polariscope and discovery of Rotary polarization are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812.[6] He was the first to perform a polarimetric observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the Great Comet of 1819.[7]/nThe general idea of the experimental determination of the velocity of light in the manner subsequently effected by Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault was suggested by Arago in 1838, but his failing eyesight prevented his arranging the details or making the experiments./nArago's fame as an experimenter and discoverer rests mainly on his contributions to magnetism in the co-discovery with L\u00e9on Foucault of eddy currents, and still more to optics. He showed that a magnetic needle, made to oscillate over nonferrous surfaces, such as water, glass, copper, etc., falls more rapidly in the extent of its oscillations according as it is more or less approached to the surface. This discovery, which earned him the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called \"magnetism of rotation\"[8][9][10] but (after Faraday's explanation of 1832[11]:\u200a283\u200a) is now known as eddy current.  Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded as having proved the long-suspected connexion between the aurora borealis and the variations of the magnetic elements.[4] In 1827 he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he became foreign member.[12] In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nIn optics, Arago not only made important optical discoveries on his own, but is credited with stimulating the genius of Jean-Augustin Fresnel, with whose history, as well as that of \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus and Thomas Young, this part of his life is closely interwoven./nShortly after the beginning of the 19th century the labours of at least three philosophers were shaping the doctrine of the undulatory, or wave, theory of light. Fresnel's arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace, Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the paper.[4] This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further fundamental laws of the polarization of light known by their means. As a result of this work, Arago constructed a polariscope, which he used for some interesting observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. He also discovered the power of rotatory polarization exhibited by quartz.[13]/nAmong Arago's many contributions to the support of the undulatory hypothesis, comes the experimentum crucis which he proposed to carry out for measuring directly the velocity of light in air and in water and glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory, it should be retarded. In 1838 he communicated to the Academy the details of his apparatus, which utilized the relaying mirrors employed by Charles Wheatstone in 1835 for measuring the velocity of the electric discharge; but owing to the great care required in the carrying out of the project, and to the interruption to his labours caused by the revolution of 1848, it was the spring of 1850 before he was ready to put his idea to the test; and then his eyesight suddenly gave way. Before his death, however, the retardation of light in denser media was demonstrated by the experiments of H. L. Fizeau and B. L. Foucault, which, with improvements in detail, were based on the plan proposed by him.[4]/nIn 1830, Arago, who always professed liberal opinions of the republican type, was elected a member of the chamber of deputies for the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales d\u00e9partement, and he employed his talents of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all questions connected with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many of the most creditable national enterprises, dating from this period, are due to his advocacy \u2013 such as the reward to Louis Daguerre for the invention of photography, the grant for the publication of the works of Fermat and Laplace, the acquisition of the museum of Cluny, the development of railways and electric telegraphs, the improvement of the reneile. In 1839, Arago reported the invention of photography to stunned listeners of a joint meeting of the academies of Arts and Sciences./nIn 1830, Arago also was appointed director of the Observatory, and as a member of the chamber of deputies he was able to obtain grants of money for rebuilding it in part, and for the addition of magnificent instruments. In the same year, too, he was chosen perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, the place of Joseph Fourier. Arago threw himself into its service, and by his faculty of making friends he gained at once for it and for himself a worldwide reputation. As perpetual secretary it was his duty to pronounce historical eulogies on deceased members; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of thought, and his happy piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge peculiarly adapted him. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.[14]/nIn 1834, Arago again visited Scotland, to attend the meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh. From this time till 1848 he led a life of comparative quiet \u2013 although he continued to work within the Academy and the Observatory to produce a multitude of contributions to all departments of physical science \u2013 but on the fall of Louis-Philippe he left his laboratory to join the Provisional Government (24 February 1848). He was entrusted with two important functions, that had never before been given to one person, viz. the ministry of marine and colonies (24 February 1848\u00a0\u2013 11 May 1848) and ministry of war (5 April 1848\u00a0\u2013 11 May 1848); in the former capacity he improved rations in the navy and abolished flogging. He also abolished political oaths of all kinds and, against an array of moneyed interests, succeeded in procuring the abolition of slavery in the French colonies./nOn 10 May 1848, Arago was elected a member of the Executive Power Commission, a governing body of the French Republic. He was made President of the Executive Power Commission (11 May 1848) and served in this capacity as provisional head of state until 24 June 1848, when collective resignation of the commission was submitted to the National Constituent Assembly. At the beginning of May 1852, when the government of Louis Napoleon required an oath of allegiance from all its functionaries, Arago peremptorily refused, and sent in his resignation of his post as astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes. This, however, the prince president declined to accept, and made \"an exception in favour of a savant whose works had thrown lustre on France, and whose existence the government would regret to embitter.\"/nCape Gregory in Oregon was named by Captain Cook on 12 March 1778 after Saint Gregory, the saint of that day; it was renamed Cape Arago after Fran\u00e7ois Arago.[15]/nArago remained a consistent republican to the end, and after the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1852, though suffering first from diabetes, then from Bright's disease, complicated by dropsy, he resigned his post as astronomer rather than take the oath of allegiance. Napoleon III gave directions that the old man should be in no way disturbed, and should be left free to say and do what he liked.  In the summer of 1853 Arago was advised by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he accordingly set out to the eastern Pyrenees, but this was ineffective and he died in Paris.  His grave is at the famous P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Arago was an atheist.[16]/nArago's works were published after his death under the direction J. A. Barral, in 17 vols., 8vo, 1854\u20131862 (F. Arago (1854), Jean-Augustin Barral (ed.), \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Francois Arago (in French), Paris, Leipzig: Gide et J.

Moreover, he predicted the Poisson spot in his attempt to disprove the wave theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, which was later confirmed./nPoisson was born in Pithiviers, Loiret district in France, the son of Sim\u00e9on Poisson, an officer in the French army./nIn 1798, he entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris as first in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free to make his own decisions as to what he would study. In his final year of study, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs, one on \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout's method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite difference equation and this was so impressive that he was allowed to graduate in 1800 without taking the final examination[1],.[2] The latter of the memoirs was examined by Sylvestre-Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the Recueil des savants \u00e9trangers, an unprecedented honor for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on, and became his friend. Meanwhile, Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career, until his death in Sceaux near Paris, was occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.[3]/nImmediately after finishing his studies at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, he was appointed r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur (teaching assistant) there, a position which he had occupied as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for his schoolmates had made a custom of visiting him in his room after an unusually difficult lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made deputy professor (professeur suppl\u00e9ant) in 1802, and, in 1806 full professor succeeding Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, whom Napoleon had sent to Grenoble. In 1808 he became astronomer to the Bureau des Longitudes; and when the Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Paris was instituted in 1809 he was appointed a professor of rational mechanics (professeur de m\u00e9canique rationelle). He went on to become a member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school (\u00c9cole Militaire) at Saint-Cyr in 1815, graduation examiner at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1816, councillor of the university in 1820, and geometer to the Bureau des Longitudes succeeding Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1827.[3]/nIn 1817, he married Nancy de Bardi and with her, he had four children. His father, whose early experiences had led him to hate aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the First Republic. Throughout the Revolution, the Empire, and the following restoration, Poisson was not interested in politics, concentrating instead on mathematics. He was appointed to the dignity of baron in 1825,[3] but he neither took out the diploma nor used the title. In March 1818, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,[4] in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[5] and in 1823 a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The revolution of July 1830 threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the government of Louis-Philippe was adroitly averted by Fran\u00e7ois Jean Dominique Arago, who, while his \"revocation\" was being plotted by the council of ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the Palais-Royal, where he was openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who \"remembered\" him. After this, of course, his degradation was impossible, and seven years later he was made a peer of France, not for political reasons, but as a representative of French science.[3]/nAs a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been extraordinarily successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. As a scientific worker, his productivity has rarely if ever been equaled. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure mathematics,[3] applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and rational mechanics.  (Arago attributed to him the quote, \"Life is good for only two things:  doing mathematics and teaching it.\"[6])/nA list of Poisson's works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago's biography. All that is possible is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.[3]/nNext (or in the opinion of some, first) in importance stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s s\u00e9culaires des moyens mouvements des plan\u00e8tes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de m\u00e9canique, both published in the Journal of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and Sur le mouvement de la terre autour de son centre de gravit\u00e9, in M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la th\u00e9orie des variations des \u00e9l\u00e9ments des plan\u00e8tes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.[3]/nAs a tribute to Poisson's scientific work, which stretched to more than 300 publications, he was awarded a French peerage in 1837./nHis is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower./nPoisson's well-known generalization of Laplace's second order partial differential equation for potential \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }/nis known as Poisson's equation after him, was first published in the Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 philomatique (1813).[3] If \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho =0}\n\n, we retrieve Laplace's equation/nIf \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho (x,y,z)}\n\n is a continuous function and if for \n\n\n\nr\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r\\rightarrow \\infty }\n\n (or if a point 'moves' to infinity) a function \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n goes to 0 fast enough, a solution of Poisson's equation is the Newtonian potential of a function \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho (x,y,z)}/nwhere \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n is a distance between a volume element \n\n\n\nd\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle dV}\n\nand a point \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n. The integration runs over the whole space./nPoisson's two most important memoirs on the subject are Sur l'attraction des sph\u00e9roides (Connaiss. ft. temps, 1829), and Sur l'attraction d'un ellipsoide homog\u00e8ne (Mim. ft. l'acad., 1835).[3]/nPoisson discovered that Laplace's equation is valid only outside of a solid. A rigorous proof for masses with variable density was first given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1839. Poisson's equation is applicable in not just gravitation, but also electricity and magnetism.[7]/nAs the eighteenth century came to a close, human understanding of electrostatics approached maturity. Benjamin Franklin had already established the notion of electric charge and the conservation of charge; Charles-Augustin de Coulomb had enunciated his inverse-square law of electrostatics. In 1777, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the concept of a potential function that can be used to compute the gravitational force of an extended body. In 1812, Poisson adopted this idea and obtained the appropriate expression for electricity, which relates the potential function \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n to the electric charge density \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho }\n\n.[8] Poisson's work on potential theory inspired George Green's 1828 paper, An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism./nIn 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted demonstrated that it was possible to deflect a magnetic needle by closing or opening an electric circuit nearby, resulting in a deluge of published papers attempting to explain the phenomenon. Amp\u00e8re's law and the Biot-Savart law were quickly deduced. The science of electromagnetism was born. Poisson was also investigating the phenomenon of magnetism at this time, though he insisted on treating electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. He published two memoirs on magnetism in 1826.[9] By the 1830s, a major research question in the study of electricity was whether or not electricity was a fluid or fluids distinct from matter, or something that simply acts on matter like gravity. Coulomb, Amp\u00e8re, and Poisson thought that electricity was a fluid distinct from matter. In his experimental research, starting with electrolysis, Michael Faraday sought to show this was not the case. Electricity, Faraday believed, was a part of matter.[10]/nPoisson was a member of the academic \"old guard\" at the Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences de l'Institut de France, who were staunch believers in the particle theory of light and were skeptical of its alternative, the wave theory. In 1818, the Acad\u00e9mie set the topic of their prize as diffraction. One of the participants, civil engineer and opticist Augustin-Jean Fresnel submitted a thesis explaining diffraction derived from analysis of both the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle and Young's double slit experiment.[11]/nPoisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrated that Fresnel's theory predicts an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a point source of light, where the particle-theory of light predicts complete darkness. Poisson argued this was absurd and Fresnel's model was wrong. (Such a spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)/nThe head of the committee, Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago, performed the experiment. He molded a 2\u00a0mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.[12] To everyone's surprise he observed the predicted bright spot, which vindicated the wave model. Fresnel won the competition./nAfter that, the corpuscular theory of light was dead, but was revived in the twentieth century in a different form, wave-particle duality. Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the Arago spot and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle[12] and Giacomo F. Maraldi[13] a century earlier./nIn pure mathematics, Poisson's most important works were his series of memoirs on definite integrals and his discussion of Fourier series, the latter paving the way for the classic researches of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Bernhard Riemann on the same subject; these are to be found in the Journal of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique from 1813 to 1823, and in the Memoirs de l'Acad\u00e9mie for 1823. He also studied Fourier integrals.[3]/nPoisson wrote an essay on the calculus of variations (Mem. de l'acad., 1833), and memoirs on the probability of the mean results of observations (Connaiss. d. temps, 1827, &c). The Poisson distribution in probability theory is named after him.[3]/nIn 1820 Poisson studied integrations along paths in the complex plane, becoming the first person to do so.[14]/nIn 1829, Poisson published a paper on elastic bodies that contained a statement and proof of a special case of what became known as the divergence theorem.[15]/nFounded mainly by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the eighteenth century, the calculus of variations saw further development and applications in the nineteenth.[16]/nLet/nS\n=\n\n\u222b\n\na\n\n\nb\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n(\nx\n)\n,\n\ny\n\u2032\n\n(\nx\n)\n)\n\nd\nx\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=\\int \\limits _{a}^{b}f(x,y(x),y'(x))\\,dx,}/nwhere \n\n\n\n\ny\n\u2032\n\n=\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y'={\\frac {dy}{dx}}}\n\n.

Soon he realized that the key idea in Heisenberg's paper was the anti-commutativity of dynamical variables and remembered that the analogous mathematical construction in classical mechanics was Poisson brackets. He found the treatment he needed in E. T. Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies.[19][20]/nUnder what conditions do solutions to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations exist and are smooth? This is a Millennium Prize Problem in mathematics./nIn 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, Claude-Louis Navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids, now identified as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In 1829 Poisson independently obtained the same result. George Gabriel Stokes re-derived them in 1845 using continuum mechanics.[21] Poisson, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and Sophie Germain were the main contributors to the theory of elasticity in the nineteenth century. The calculus of variations was frequently used to solve problems.[16]/nPoisson also published a memoir on the theory of waves (M\u00e9m. ft. l'acad., 1825).[3]/nIn his work on heat conduction, Joseph Fourier maintained that the arbitrary function may be represented as an infinite trigonometric series and made explicit the possibility of expanding functions in terms of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials, depending on the context of the problem. It took some time for his ideas to be accepted as his use of mathematics was less than rigorous. Although initially skeptical, Poisson adopted Fourier's method. From around 1815 he studied various problems in heat conduction. He published his Th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique de la chaleur in 1835.[22]/nDuring the early 1800s, Pierre-Simon de Laplace developed a sophisticated, if speculative, description of gases based on the old caloric theory of heat, to which younger scientists such as Poisson were less committed. A success for Laplace was his correction of Newton's formula for the speed of sound in air that gives satisfactory answers when compared with experiments. The Newton\u2013Laplace formula makes use of the specific heats of gases at constant volume \n\n\n\n\nc\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{V}}\n\nand at constant pressure \n\n\n\n\nc\n\nP\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{P}}\n\n. In 1823 Poisson redid his teacher's work and reached the same results without resorting to complex hypotheses previously employed by Laplace. In addition, by using the gas laws of Robert Boyle and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Poisson obtained the equation for gases undergoing adiabatic changes, namely \n\n\n\nP\n\nV\n\n\u03b3\n\n\n=\n\nconstant\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle PV^{\\gamma }={\\text{constant}}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nP\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P}\n\n is the pressure of the gas, \n\n\n\nV\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V}\n\n its volume, and \n\n\n\n\u03b3\n=\n\n\n\nc\n\nP\n\n\n\nc\n\nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma ={\\frac {c_{P}}{c_{V}}}}\n\n.[23]/nBesides his many memoirs, Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did not live to complete. Among these may be mentioned:[3]/nAfter political activist \u00c9variste Galois had returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did January 1831. In early July, Poisson declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible,\" but encouraged Galois to \"publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\"[24] While Poisson's report was made before Galois' 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois vehemently decided against publishing his papers through the academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Yet Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice. He began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on\u00a029 April 1832,[25] after which he was somehow persuaded to participate in what proved to be a fatal duel.[26]", "73707160": "Martha Mechthild Ingeborg Seynsche (21 October 1905 in Barmen \u2013 27 June 1994 in G\u00f6ttingen) was a German mathematician.

Ciruelo was born in the kingdom of Aragon where Daroca held political, military, and administrative significance for the kingdom.[1] He came from a family of Jews and Judaizers according to papers that traced his genealogy during the Spanish Inquisition.[1] Ciruelo claimed to be an orphan, but the validity of this claim is not well-supported as Ciruelo had living relatives and received an education which was costly at the time.[1] This claim may have been used to distance himself from his Jewish ancestry because his grandfather, Francisco S\u00e1nchez Ciruelo, was condemned for apostasy, and an uncle, Bartolom\u00e9, was a confeso who confessed to reverting from Catholicism to Jewish beliefs.[1] His family is not thought to have been wealthy as several members were into common trades like shoe-making or meat cutting.[1]/nCiruelo first studied grammar and rhetoric at Daroca's Studium Artibus, which made him interested in scholarship. He went on to study at the University of Salamanca in 1482 where he found an interest in logic and mathematics. During his time at the University of Salamanca, Ciruelo gained new interests in astronomy and astrology after developing a great appreciation for Abraham Zacuto's works on the subjects.[1]/nProfessors at the University of Salmanca went on to use Zacuto's work after he left the university, and continued to influence Ciruelo's education.[1] He admired Rodrigo Vasurto, the chair of astrology at Salamanca.[1] Zacuto and Vasurto are mentioned in future texts that he goes on to write.[1] He then studied theology at the University of Paris, living there for ten years during which he, along with Juan Martinez Siliceo,[2] Gaspar Lax, Miguel Franc\u00e9s, Jacobo Ram\u00edrez, and Alfonso Osorio became part of a circle of Spanish calculatores interested in mathematical physics and the works of Oxford Calculatores.[3] Here, together with Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d\u2019\u00c9taples, Ciruelo helped to standardize the mathematics curriculum at the university.[3]/nCiruelo also published a number of books during his tenure through the French printer and publisher Guy Marchant.[3] He returned to Spain in 1502 and taught philosophy at the Colegio de San Antonio de Portaceli\u00a0[es] in Sig\u00fcenza and later at the University of Zaragoza. In 1509, he moved to the University of Alcal\u00e1 to teach theology and mathematics -- among his students being Domingo de Soto. In 1533 he moved to Segovia, where he served at the city's Cathedral until 1537. He later moved back to Salamanca where he continued to write until his death.[1]/nCiruelo wrote a commentary on the Sphaera de Sacrobosco, and on Thomas Brawardine's mathematical works Arithmetica Speculativa and Geometria Speculativa, among others.[3] These commentaries and those of other calculatores would become standard textbooks in many European universities,[4] helping to solidify Paris' role in the 15th-century mathematics book market.[3]/nAlthough there is little administrative evidence of Ciruelo in Paris, Ciruelo and Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples are considered to be responsible for the expansion of mathematical teaching in Paris in the late 1400s.[5]  At the time there was no standardized curriculum for mathematics at the University of Paris.[5] In the late 1400s Ciruelo and Lef\u00e8vre each had their own advanced mathematical programs for the university. Ciruelo's program used 5 different mathematical texts on \"theoretical arithmetic, practical arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy\".[5]/nAlthough Ciruelo was called a \"lecturer of mathematics\" in Thomas Bradwardine's Arithmetic speculativa, it is unclear whether Ciruelo actually taught at the University of Paris because there was no position with that title during the time.[5]  During his time in Paris, Ciruelo wrote 4 mathematical books: two of them being new editions of Thomas Bradwardine's texts, 1 being an original publication, and finally a commentary of Sacrobosco's Sphaera.[5]  Ciruelo's works were not as well developed as his contemporaries. His works often did not follow standard mathematical programs, and his books were published in different formats. Ciruelo published his works from Guy Marchant\u2019s workshop.[5]  Marchant was particularly interested in Ciruelo works because of his academic background and appreciation for illustrated works.[5]  Printing Ciruelo\u2019s works soon became a problem because of the technical limitations at the time. Printers would have to obtain special printing equipment to reproduce a variety of mathematical figures and Arabic numbers.[5]/nIn Ciruelo's work the Cursus quattuor mathematicarum artium liberalium, he examines why the adjectives \"arithmetical\" and \"geometrical\" to are used to describe and name progressions, sequences, and proportions.[6] Ciruelo is one of few known sources discussing this history.[6] Although one might assume that arithmetic progressions or geometric sequences are named so because of the respective branch of mathematics they are used in, Ciruelo argued differently.[6] He believed that these terms were used to emphasize the process of measurement inherent to such mathematics.[6] This view is supported by Aristotle's use of the term \"geometrical proportion\" to refer to the metric information contained in mathematical ratios.[6]/nOn the topic of proportions, Ciruelo's four part Cursus also contains a treatise on music theory.[7] These writings were exemplary of the \"arithmetization of geometry\" taking place in mathematics during the 16th century.[7] That is, they represent a shift towards proving geometric theorems solely algebraically, choosing to treat geometric objects as abstract algebraic symbols, rather than physical items in space. The subtle emphasis on the algebra being a \"symbol\" is dropped in this time period, such that the symbol and the geometric object represented by it are viewed as one in the same. This was of great relevance to music theory, as it is by nature intrinsically geometric, involving the division of strings into intervals.[7] Ciruelo's work is able to explain such concepts without reference to physical, geometric strings. For example, he describes a method with which to break compound intervals down into the sum of smaller intervals solely using numeric ratios.[7] This level of abstraction outlined by Ciruelo and other 16th-century scholars is credited with providing a \"better approach to equal temperament [tuning]\" within this time period.[7]/nHis main astrological work Apotelesmata astrologiae Christianae was published in 1521, in which he argued that only those equally versed in theology and astrology, like himself, were qualified to pass judgement on the subject.[8] Ciruelo believed that knowing the cosmos was a way of admiring God's creation,[9] but was also opposed to certain beliefs, and in his 1538 book Reprobaci\u00f3n de supersticiones y hechizer\u00edas he defined a metric to determine which kinds of astrological practices were legitimate and which were superstitious.[8] He condemned the belief in the evil eye, dream divination,[10] and the use of amulets, horoscopes and rain making, but considered the flights of witches to be real.[9] To him, any practice claiming to change future events was illegitimate.[8] Ciruelo also considered most Arabic astrological traditions to be blasphemous, accusing such practices of \"corrupting\" Ptolemy's ancient astrological treatise Tetrabiblos.[8] He advocated for a restoration of Ptolemaic astrology. [8]/nMany of Ciruelo's astrological arguments were justified by his religious beliefs, which are detailed in the Reprobaci\u00f3n de supersticiones y hechizer\u00edas. This was deliberate, as the study of astrology was at the center of a theological debate in the 16th century.[8] Any astrological practice trying to achieve supernatural feats was seen as infringing on the domain of the divine, constituting heresy. Thus, the question of what feats were humanly possible and what were divine was critical to astrologists at the time, so that the field could be reformed and redeemed in the eyes of Inquisitors.[8]/nDuring the 16th century, followers of Christianity believed in three different explanations for the possible. These were the natural, preternatural, and supernatural orders. Ciruelo summarizes these orders from a cosmological standpoint.[9]/nCiruelo believed that these three orders were the only categories needed to explain events on earth.[9] The natural and supernatural orders were originally proposed by Anselm of Canterbury, but Ciruelo eventually added the preternatural order, seeing it to be a natural consequence of the other two.[9] This extra distinction between the natural and the supernatural outlined the futility of superstitious rituals, in Ciruelo's view.[9] Rituals seeking to accomplish preternatural feats would, by nature of being an invented by humanity, never be able to come to fruition without the help of some preternatural or supernatural power./nIt is for these reasons that the only astrology Ciruelo considered to be \"legitimate\" was \"natural astrology;\" that is, the astrological practices that respected the boundary between the natural and the preternatural.[8]", "59485868": "Ei\u017eens Leimanis (April 10, 1905 \u2013 December 4, 1992) was a Latvian mathematician who worked on the three-body problem.\nHe taught for many years at the University of British Columbia in Canada./nLeimanis was born in Koceni parish, Valmiera county, Vidzeme province, Russian empire now Koc\u0113ni Parish in Latvia.

Iamblichus was also the biographer of the Greek mystic, philosopher, and mathematician Pythagoras.[7][8] In addition to his philosophical contributions, his Protrepticus is important for the study of the sophists because it preserved about ten pages of an otherwise unknown sophist known as the Anonymus Iamblichi.[9]/nAccording to the Suda and Iamblichus' biographer, Eunapius, Iamblichus was born in Chalcis (later called Qinna\u0161r\u012bn) in Coele, now in northwest Syria.[10][11] Iamblichus was descended from the Emesene dynasty. He initially studied under Anatolius of Laodicea and later studied under Porphyry, a pupil of Plotinus (the founder of neoplatonism). Iamblichus disagreed with Porphyry about theurgy, reportedly responding to Porphyry's criticism of the practice in On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians./nHe returned to Coele Syria around 304 to found a school in Apamea (near Antioch), a city known for its neoplatonic philosophers. Iamblichus designed a curriculum for studying Plato and Aristotle, and wrote commentaries on the two which survive only in fragments. Pythagoras was his supreme authority, and he wrote the ten-volume Collection of Pythagorean Doctrines with extracts from several ancient philosophers; only the first four volumes and fragments of the fifth survive.[12]/nIamblichus wrote the Exhortation to Philosophy in Apamea during the early fourth century.[13] Considered a man of great culture and learning, he was renowned for his charity and self-denial and had a number of students. According to Johann Albert Fabricius, he died sometime before 333 during the reign of Constantine the Great.[11]/nIamblichus detailed Plotinus' neoplatonic formal divisions, applied Pythagorean number symbolism more systematically, and (influenced by other Asian systems) interpreted neoplatonic concepts mythically.[14][11] Unlike Plotinus, who broke from platonic tradition by positing a separate soul, Iamblichus re-affirmed the soul's embodiment in matter and believed that matter was as divine as the rest of the cosmos.[14]/nIamblichus placed the Monad at the head of his system, from which emanates the Nous (intellect, or demiurge) and the psyche. Plotinus represented the Nous as three stages: objective being, subjective life, and realized intellect. Iamblichus divided them into two spheres: intelligible (the objects of thought) and intellective (the domain of thought).[15]/nIamblichus and Proclus may have introduced a third sphere between the two worlds, separating and uniting them.[16] The identification of nous with the demiurge in the neoplatonic tradition was adopted and developed in Christian gnosticism. Augustine of Hippo follows Plotinus, identifying the nous with logos (the creative principle) as part of the Trinity.[17][18]/nIamblichus multiplied the number of divine entities according to universal mathematical theorems. He conceived of gods, angels, demons and heroes: twelve heavenly gods (whose number increases to 36 or 360), 72 other gods proceeding from them, 21 chiefs and 42 nature-gods. His divine realm extends from the Monad to material nature, where the soul descends into matter and becomes embodied in human form. These superhuman beings influence natural events and communicate knowledge about the future, and are accessible with prayers and offerings. Iamblichus posited that numbers are independent, occupying a middle realm between the limited and unlimited.[18] He believed that nature was bound by fate, differing from divine things which are not subject to fate and turn evil and imperfection to good ends; evil was generated accidentally in the conflict between the finite and the infinite.[18]/nOnly a fraction of Iamblichus' books have survived; knowledge of his system is preserved in fragments of writings preserved by Stobaeus and others: notes by his successors (especially Proclus), his five extant books and sections of his work on Pythagoreanism. In addition to these, Proclus attributed to him the On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians, also known as The Theurgia. Although stylistic and doctrinal differences exist between this book and Iamblichus' other works, it originated from his school at least.[11]/nIamblichus was praised by his followers, and contemporaries credited him with miraculous powers. The Roman emperor Julian, not content with Eunapius' modest eulogy that Iamblichus was inferior to Porphyry only in style, regarded him as second only to Plato and said that he would give all the gold in Lydia for one of his letters. During the 15th- and 16th-century revival of interest in his philosophy, Iamblichus' name was rarely mentioned without the epithet \"divine\" or \"most divine\".[11]/nThis article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Sorley, William Ritchie (1911). \"Iamblichus, the chief representative of Syrian Neoplatonism\".

With Ben Elias, he gave a new proof and a simplification of the theory of the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig conjectures (previously proved in 1981 by both Beilinson\u2013Bernstein and Brylinski\u2013Kashiwara). For this purpose, they built on works by Wolfgang Soergel and developed a purely algebraic Hodge theory of Soergel bimodules about polynomial rings, In this context, they also succeeded in proving the long-standing positive presumption of positivity for the coefficients of the Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomials for Coxeter groups. For Weyl groups (special Coxeter groups, which are connected to Lie groups), David Kazhdan and George Lusztig succeeded in doing so by identifying the polynomials with certain invariants (local intersection cohomology) of Schubert varieties. Elias and Williamson were able to follow this path of proof also for more general groups of reflection (Coxeter groups), although there is no geometrical interpretation in contrast to the case of the Weyl groups./nHe is also known for several counterexamples. In 1980, Lusztig suggested a character formula for simple modules of reductive groups over fields of finite characteristic p. The conjecture was proved in 1994-95 by a combination of three papers, one by Henning Haahr Andersen, Jens Carsten Jantzen, and Wolfgang Soergel, one by David Kazhdan and George Lusztig and one by Masaki Kashiwara and Toshiyuki Tanisaki for sufficiently large group-specific characteristics (without explicit bound) and later by Peter Fiebig for a very high explicitly stated bound. Williamson found several infinite families of counterexamples to the generally suspected validity limits of Lusztig's conjecture. He also found counterexamples to a 1990 conjecture of Gordon James on  symmetric groups. His work also provided new perspectives on the respective conjectures.

The mod p cohomology of the classifying spaces of certain finite groups (elementary Abelian p-groups, for which the generalized Sullivan conjecture was formulated) played an important role in the proof. The connection between the cohomology theory of these finite groups and the classifying spaces of groups is illuminated by the work of Lannes.

After attending King Edward VII School he won a scholarship to Balliol College at the University of Oxford./nDuring his time at Oxford he met the number theorist G. H. Hardy, and after graduating in 1926, Linfoot completed a D.Phil under the supervision of Hardy with a thesis entitled Applications of the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable./nAfter brief stints at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Princeton University, and Balliol College, Linfoot took a job in 1932 as assistant lecturer, and later lecturer, at the University of Bristol.  During the 1930s Linfoot's interests slowly made the transition from pure mathematics to the application of mathematics to the study of optics, but not before proving an important result in number theory with Hans Heilbronn, that there are at most ten imaginary quadratic number fields with class number 1.[1]/nThe exact reasons that Linfoot chose to switch his research from pure mathematics to optics are complex and there is probably no single most important reason.  John Bell has highlighted the role played by Linfoot's political awareness, in particular his relationship with Heilbronn who had been forced to flee Nazi Germany.[2] Suspecting a second world war was imminent, and knowing his delicate constitution would not make it through military physical examinations, Linfoot decided to contribute to the future war with scientific advancements in the field of optics.  Other contributing factors to this change in focus were his lifelong fondness for astronomy and, by Linfoot's own testimony, a feeling that he had reached the limits of his pure mathematical creativity.[3]/nThis shift was facilitated by C. R. Burch of the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory in Bristol who led the University's optics group.  Burch was a physical thinker but recognised the benefits of strong mathematical ability in understanding physics, and so encouraged Linfoot in his transition.  Linfoot availed himself of the laboratory's facilities to first construct his own telescope and later to apply the theory of aspheric lenses to create a new microscope which he exhibited at the 1939 Annual Exhibition of the Physical Society./nIt was also during this time, in 1935, that Linfoot married fellow mathematician Joyce Dancer, with whom he had three children, Roger in 1941, Margaret in 1945 and Sebastian in 1947./nDuring World War II Linfoot put his skills to use for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, producing optical systems for air reconnaissance./nFollowing the war, Linfoot was awarded an ScD by the University of Oxford for his work in mathematics.  A few months after this, Linfoot moved to the University of Cambridge, being appointed Assistant Director of the Cambridge Observatory.  He remained at Cambridge until his retirement in 1970, eventually succeeding H. A. Br\u00fcck as John Couch Adams Astronomer./nDuring this time Linfoot took a great interest in Claude Shannon's new field of information theory and also in computers, writing several programs for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator at Cambridge.  He also wrote two books on optics, and seems to have planned a third./nHis demonstrable skill at crafting optics was in demand, leading him to positions as a consultant for various groups and projects, including the construction of three large telescopes\u2014the Schmidt\u2013Cassegrain telescope, the Isaac Newton Telescope, and the Anglo-Australian Telescope\u2014and for NASA./nLinfoot died in Cambridge in 1982 at the age of 77, and is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge./nLinfoot's mathematical papers cover the period 1926\u20131939, all his subsequent work being on optics.

He is the author of a number of classic results on synthesis, reliability, and classification of control systems (Russian: \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u044b), the term used in the USSR and Russia for a generalization of finite state automata, Boolean circuits and multi-valued logic circuits./nYablonsky is credited for helping to overcome the pressure from Soviet ideologists against the term and the discipline of cybernetics and establishing what in the Soviet Union was called mathematical cybernetics as a separate field of mathematics. Yablonsky and his students were ones of the first in the world to raise the issues of potentially inherent unavoidability of the brute force search for some problems, the precursor of the P = NP problem, though G\u00f6del's letter to von Neumann, dated 20 March 1956 and discovered in 1988, may have preceded them.[1]/nIn Russia, a group led by Yablonsky had the idea that combinatorial problems are hard in proportion to the amount of brute-force search required to find a solution. In particular, they noticed that for many problems they could not find a useful way to organize the space of potential solutions so as to avoid brute force search. They began to suspect that these problems had an inherently unorganized solution space, and the best method for solving them would require enumerating an exponential (in the size of the problem instance) number of potential solutions. That is, the problems seem to require \n\n\n\n\nc\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c^{n}}\n\n \"shots in the dark\" (for some constant \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n) when the length of the problem description is \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n. However, despite their \"leading-edge\" taste in mathematics, Yablonsky's group never quite formulated this idea precisely.[2]/nYablonsky was born in Moscow, to the family of a professor of mechanics. His mathematical talents became apparent in early age. In 1940 he became the winner of the sixth Moscow secondary school mathematical olympiad.[3]/nIn August 1942, after completing his first year at Moscow State University's Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Yablonsky, then 17, went to serve in the Soviet Army, fighting in the second world war as a member of the tank brigade 242. For his service he was awarded two Orders of the Patriotic War, two Orders of the Red Star, Order of Glory of the 3rd class, and numerous medals. He returned to his study after the war has ended in 1945 and went on to graduate with distinction./nYablonsky graduated the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University in 1950. During his student years he worked under supervision of Nina Bari. This collaboration resulted in his first research paper, \"On the converging sequences of continuous functions\" (1950)./nHe joined the graduate program of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics in 1950 where his advisor was Pyotr Novikov. There Yablonsky's research was on the issues of the expressibility in mathematical logic. He approached this problem in terms of the theory of k-valued discrete functions. Among the problems that were addressed in his PhD thesis titled \"Issues of functional completeness in k-valued calculus\" (1953) is the definitive answer to the question of completeness in 3-valued logic./nStarting from 1953, Yablonsky worked at the Department of Applied Mathematics of Steklov Institute of Mathematics, that in 1966 became the separate Institute of Applied Mathematics. Over the period of the 1950s and 1960s, together with Alexey Lyapunov, Yablonsky organized the seminar on cybernetics, showing his support to the new field of mathematics that had been a subject of a significant controversy fueled by Soviet ideologists. He actively participated in the creation of the periodical publication Problems of Cybernetics, with Lyapunov as its first editor-in-chief. Yablonsky succeeded Lyapunov as the editor-in-chief of Problems of Cybernetics in 1974 (the publication changed its name to Mathematical Issues of Cybernetics in 1989). In 1966 Yablonsky (together with Yuri Zhuravlyov and Oleg Lupanov) was awarded Lenin Prize for their work on the theory of control systems (in the discrete-mathematical sense, as explained above).

These brothers included Robert, who fled after fighting for King James VII in 1689 and became a banker in Rouen and half-brother George, who fled to France and became a wine merchant.  However, when William and Mary came to the throne and the Scottish and English parliaments required all ministers to swear allegiance to them as king and queen, Arbuthnot's father did not comply. As a non-juror, he was removed from his church, and John was there to take care of affairs when, in 1691, his father died./nArbuthnot went to London in 1691, where he is supposed to have supported himself by teaching mathematics (which had been his formal course of study).  He lodged with William Pate, whom Swift knew and called a \"bel esprit\".  He published Of the Laws of Chance in 1692, translated from Christiaan Huygens's De ratiociniis in ludo aleae.  This was the first work on probability published in English.  The work, which applied the field of probability to common games, was a success, and Arbuthnot became the private tutor of one Edward Jeffreys, son of Jeffrey Jeffreys, an MP.  He remained Jeffreys's tutor when the latter attended University College, Oxford in 1694, and he there met the variety of scholars then teaching mathematics and medicine, including Dr John Radcliffe, Isaac Newton, and Samuel Pepys.  However, Arbuthnot lacked the money to be a full-time student and was already well educated, although informally.  He went to the University of St Andrews and enrolled as a doctoral student in medicine on 11 September 1696.  The very same day he defended seven theses on medicine and was awarded the doctorate./nHe first wrote satire in 1697, when he answered Dr John Woodward's An essay towards a natural history of the earth and terrestrial bodies, especially minerals... with An Examination of Dr Woodward's Account &c.  He poked fun at the arrogance of the work and Woodward's misguided, Aristotelian insistence that what is theoretically attractive must be actually true.  In 1701, Arbuthnot wrote another mathematical work, An essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning, in a letter from a gentleman in the city to his friend in Oxford.  The work was moderately successful, and Arbuthnot praises mathematics as a method of freeing the mind from superstition./nIn 1702, he was at Epsom when Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne fell ill.  According to tradition, Arbuthnot treated the prince successfully.  According to tradition again, this treatment earned him an invitation to court.  Also around 1702, he married Margaret, whose maiden name is possibly Wemyss.  Although there are no baptismal records, it seems that his first son, George (named in honour of the prince), was born in 1703.  He was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1704.  Also thanks to the Queen's presence, he was made an MD at Cambridge University on 16 April 1705./nArbuthnot was an amiable individual, and Swift said that the only fault an enemy could lay upon him was a slight waddle in his walk.  His conviviality and his royal connections made him an important figure in the Royal Society.  In 1705, Arbuthnot became physician extraordinary to Queen Anne, and at the same time was put on the board trying to publish the Historia coelestius. Newton and Edmund Halley wanted it published immediately, to support their work on orbits, while John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer whose observations they were, wanted to keep the data secret until he had perfected it.  The result was that Arbuthnot used his leverage as friend and physician to Prince George, whose money was paying for the publication, to force Flamsteed to allow it out, albeit with serious errors, in 1712.  Also as a scholar, Arbuthnot took up an interest in antiquities and published Tables of Grecian, Roman, and Jewish measures, weights and coins; reduced to the English standard in 1705, 1707, 1709, and, expanded with a preface (which indicated that his second son, Charles, was born in 1705), in 1727 and 1747./nAlthough Arbuthnot was not a Jacobite after the fashion of his brothers, he was a Tory, for national and familial reasons.  Anne was advised (and many said controlled) by Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who was a champion of Whig causes.  In 1706, the Duchess of Marlborough fell out with Anne\u2014a schism which the Tories were pleased to encourage.  The marriage of lady-in-waiting Abigail Hill to Samuel Masham, which was the first overt sign of Anne's displeasure with Sarah Churchill, took place in Arbuthnot's apartments at St. James's Palace.  The reasons for the choice of apartment and the degree of involvement of Arbuthnot in either the love match or Anne's estrangement, are not clear.  As a Scotsman, Arbuthnot served the crown by writing A sermon preach'd to the people at the Mercat Cross of Edinborough on the subject of the union.  Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10, Verse 27.  The work was designed to persuade Scots to accept the Act of Union.  When the Act passed, Arbuthnot was made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.  He was also made a physician in ordinary to the Queen, which made him part of the royal household./nArbuthnot returned to mathematics in 1710 with An argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the births of both sexes (linked below) in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions. In this paper, Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710 and the human sex ratio at birth: in every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. If the probability of male and female birth were equal, the probability of the observed outcome would be 1/282. This vanishingly small number led Arbuthnot to believe that this phenomenon was not due to chance, but to divine providence: \"From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.\" This paper was a landmark in the history of statistics; in modern terms he performed statistical hypothesis testing, computing the p-value (via a sign test), interpreted it as statistical significance, and rejected the null hypothesis. This is credited as \"\u2026 the first use of significance tests \u2026\",[3] the first example of reasoning about statistical significance and moral certainty,[4] and \"\u2026 perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test \u2026\".[5]/nIn 1710, Jonathan Swift moved to London.  With Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (who was then the secretary of the treasury and not a peer), he produced the Tory Examiner, and Arbuthnot made their acquaintance and began to provide \"hints\" to them.  These \"hints\" were ideas for essays, satirical gambits, and facts, rather than secrets of any sort.  From 1711 to 1713, Arbuthnot and Swift formed \"The Brothers' Club,\" though Arbuthnot characteristically gave away his ideas and even his writings, never seeking credit for them./nIn 1712, Arbuthnot and Swift both attempted to aid the Tory government of Harley and Henry St. John in their efforts to end the War of the Spanish Succession.  The war had profited John and Sarah Churchill, and the Tory ministry sought to end it by withdrawing from all England's alliances and negotiating directly with France.  Swift wrote The Conduct of the Allies, and Arbuthnot wrote a series of five pamphlets featuring John Bull.  The first of these, Law Is a Bottomless Pit (1712), introduced a simple allegory to explain the war.  John Bull (England) is suing Louis Baboon (i.e. Louis Bourbon, or Louis XIV of France) over the estate of the dead Lord Strutt (Charles II of Spain).  Bull's lawyer is the one who really enjoys the suit, and he is Humphrey Hocus (Marlborough).  Bull has a sister named Peg (Scotland).  The pamphlets are Swiftian in their satire, in that they make all of the characters hopelessly flawed and comic and none of their endeavour worth pursuing (which was Arbuthnot's intent, as he sought to make the war an object of scorn), but it is filled with homespun humour, a common touch, and a sympathy for the figures that is distinctly non-Swiftian./nIn 1713, Arbuthnot continued his political satire with Proposals for printing a very curious discourse... a treatise of the art of political lying, with an abstract of the first volume.  As with other works that Arbuthnot encouraged, this systemizes a rhetoric of bad thinking and writing.  He proposes to teach people to lie well.  Similar lists and systems are in Alexander Pope's Peri Bathos and John Gay and Pope's Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus.  Also in 1713, Arbuthnot was made a physician of Chelsea Hospital, which provided him with a house.  It was this house that hosted the meetings of the Scriblerus Club, which had as its members Harley (now Earl of Oxford), St. John (now Viscount Bolingbroke), Pope, Gay, Swift, and Thomas Parnell.  According to all the members of the club, Arbuthnot was the one who contributed the most in ideas, and he was the only source they could draw upon when satirizing the sciences, and his was the idea for the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, a pedantic man who, like Arbuthnot's earlier opponent, Dr Woodward, would read three or four lines of Classical literature and deduce a universal (and absurd) truth from them./nThe club met for only a year, as Queen Anne died in July 1714, and the club met for the last time in November of that year.  When Anne died, she had no will.  Consequently, all her servants were left without positions and entirely at the mercy of the next administration \u2013 an administration that was chosen by the enemies of Arbuthnot and the other Scriblerans.  When George I came to the throne, Arbuthnot lost all of his royal appointments and houses, but he still had a vigorous medical practice.  He lived at \"the second door from the left in Dover Street\" in Piccadilly./nIn 1717, Arbuthnot contributed somewhat to Pope and Gay's play, Three Hours after Marriage, which ran for seven nights. He was a friend to George Frederic Handel and appointed director to the Royal Academy of Music (1719) from the start in 1719 till 1729./nIn 1719 he took part in a pamphlet war over the treatment of smallpox. In particular, he attacked Dr Woodward, who had again presented a dogmatic and, Arbuthnot thought, irrational opinion. In 1723, Arbuthnot was made one of the censors of the Royal College of Physicians, and as such he was one of the campaigners to inspect and improve the drugs sold by apothecaries in London. In 1723, the apothecaries sued the RCP, and Arbuthnot wrote Reasons humbly offered by the ... upholders (undertakers) against part of the bill for the better viewing, searching, and examining of drugs. The pamphlet suggested that the funeral directors of London might wish to sue the Royal College of Physicians as well to ensure that drug safety remained poor. In 1727, he was made an elect of the Royal College of Physicians./nIn 1726 and 1727, Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope reunited at Arbuthnot's house during visits, and Swift showed Arbuthnot the manuscript of Gulliver's Travels ahead of time. The detailed parody of on-going Royal Society projects in book III of Gulliver's Travels likely came from \"hints\" from Arbuthnot. The visit also bore fruit in Pope's The Dunciad of 1729 (the second edition), where Arbuthnot probably wrote the \"Virgilius restauratus\" satirizing Richard Bentley./nArbuthnot was guardian to Peter the Wild Boy on his first arrival in London./nIn 1730, Arbuthnot's wife died. The next year, he produced a work of popular medicine, An essay concerning the nature of aliments, and the choice of them, according to the different constitutions of human bodies. The book was quite popular, and a second edition, with advice on diet, came out the next year. It had four more full editions and translations into French and German. In 1733 he wrote another very popular work of medicine called An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies. As with the former work, it went through multiple editions and translations. He argued that the air itself had to have enormous effects on the personality and persons of humanity, and he believed that the air of locations resulted in the characteristics of the people, as well as particular maladies. He advised his readers to ventilate sickrooms and to seek fresh air in cities. Although the idea that airs carried sickness was incorrect, the practical upshot of Arbuthnot's advice was efficacious, as crowded, poorly sanitized Augustan era cities had bad air and infectious air./nHis son Charles, studying to be a divine at Christ Church, Oxford, died in 1731, the same year that the Swift and Pope Miscellanies, Volume the Third (which was the first volume) appeared. He contributed \"An Essay of the Learned Martinus Scriblerus Concerning the Origine of the Sciences\" to the volume./nIn 1734, his health began to decline. He had kidney stones and asthma, and he was also overweight. On 17 July 1734, Arbuthnot wrote to Pope to tell him that he had a terminal illness. In a response dated 2 August, Pope indicates that he planned to write more satire, and on 25 August told Arbuthnot that he was going to address one of his epistles to him, later characterizing it as a memorial to their friendship. Arbuthnot died at his house in Cork Street, in London on 27 February 1735, eight weeks after the poem \"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\" was published.[6] He is buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly./nArbuthnot was one of the founding members of the Scriblerus Club, and was regarded by the other wits of the group as the funniest, but he left fewer literary remains than the other members.  His satires are written with an ease, a humanity, and an apparent sympathy.  Swift and Arbuthnot had similar styles in language (both preferred direct sentences and clear vocabulary) with a feigned frenzy of lists and taxonomies, and sometimes their works are attributed to each other.  The treatise on political lying, for example, has been attributed to Swift in the past, although it was definitely Arbuthnot's.  Generally, Arbuthnot's writings are not as vicious or nihilistic as Swift's, but they attack the same targets and both refuse to hold up a set of positive norms for their readers.[original research?]/nBecause of Arbuthnot's own insistence on not being recognized, it is difficult to speak definitively of his literary significance.  Dr. Johnson thought very highly of him as Boswell noted: \"Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne's reign, he observed,'I think Dr. Arbuthnott the first man among them. He was the most universal genius, being an excellent physician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour.'\" [7] Arbuthnot was at the heart of many of the greatest satires of his age. He was a conduit and source for a great many of the finest literary accomplishments for over half a century of writing, but Arbuthnot was zealous that he not receive credit.[original research?]", "10006270": "Simion Stoilow or Stoilov (14 September\u00a0[O.S. 2 September]\u00a01887 \u2013 4 April 1961)[1] was a Romanian mathematician, creator of the Romanian school of complex analysis, and author of over 100 publications./nHe was born in Bucharest, and grew up in Craiova.

Five years later, he and Sierpi\u0144ski proposed the conjecture that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpinski number, and thus the answer to the Sierpinski problem. A distributed computing project called Seventeen or Bust is currently trying to prove this statement, as of April 2017[update] only five of the original seventeen possibilities remain./nIn 1964, Selfridge and Alexander Hurwitz proved that the 14th Fermat number \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2^{2^{14}}+1}\n\n was composite.\n[5]\nHowever, their proof did not provide a factor. It was not until 2010 that the first factor of the 14th Fermat number was found.\n[6]\n[7]/nIn 1975 John Brillhart, Derrick Henry Lehmer, and Selfridge developed a method of proving the primality of p given only partial factorizations of p\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 and p\u00a0+\u00a01.\n[8]\nTogether with Samuel Wagstaff they also all participated in the Cunningham project./nTogether with Paul Erd\u0151s, Selfridge solved a 150-year-old problem, proving that the product of consecutive numbers is never a power.[9] It took them many years to find the proof, and John made extensive use of computers, but the final version of the proof requires only a modest amount of computation, namely evaluating an easily computed function f(n) for 30,000 consecutive values of\u00a0n. Selfridge suffered from writer's block and thanked \"R. B. Eggleton for reorganizing and writing the paper in its final form\".[9]/nSelfridge also developed the Selfridge\u2013Conway discrete procedure for creating an envy-free cake-cutting among three people. Selfridge developed this in 1960,  and John Conway independently discovered it in 1993. Neither of them ever published the result, but Richard Guy told many people Selfridge's solution in the 1960s, and it was eventually attributed to the two of them in a number of books and articles.[citation needed]/nSelfridge made the following conjecture about the Fermat numbers Fn = 22n + 1 . Let g(n) be the number of distinct prime factors of Fn (sequence A046052 in the OEIS). As to 2016, g(n) is known only up to n = 11, and it is monotonic. Selfridge conjectured that contrary to appearances, g(n) is NOT monotonic. In support of his conjecture he showed: a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for its truth is the existence of another Fermat prime beyond the five known (3, 5, 17, 257, 65537).[10]/nThis conjecture is also called the PSW conjecture, after Selfridge, Carl Pomerance, and Samuel Wagstaff./nLet p be an odd number, with p \u2261 \u00b1 2 (mod 5). Selfridge conjectured that if/nwhere fk is the kth Fibonacci number, then p is a prime number, and he offered $500 for an example disproving this. He also offered $20 for a proof that the conjecture was true. The Number Theory Foundation will now cover this prize. An example will actually yield you $620 because Samuel Wagstaff offers $100 for an example or a proof, and Carl Pomerance offers $20 for an example and $500 for a proof. Selfridge requires that a factorization be supplied, but Pomerance does not. The related test that fp\u22121 \u2261 0 (mod p) for p \u2261 \u00b11 (mod 5) is false and has e.g. a 6-digit counterexample.[11][12] The smallest counterexample for +1 (mod 5) is 6601 = 7 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 41 and the smallest for \u22121 (mod 5) is 30889 = 17 \u00d7 23 \u00d7 79.

She then appealed to Columbia University for permission to use their telescope. On February 4, 1884 the members of the board of trustees agreed, considering her an \"exceptional case\" and cautioning her \"not to disturb the male students.\"  She was required to work as a laboratory assistant to the director of the observatory.[4]/nShe studied math and astronomy at Columbia which at the time was an all-male institution.[4] Her teachers included Professor John Krom Rees, Professor J.

He was born in Pittem near Tielt in the County of Flanders (now part of Belgium).[1] He is known as Nan Huairen (\u5357\u61f7\u4ec1) in Chinese. He was an accomplished mathematician and astronomer and proved to the court of the Kangxi Emperor that European astronomy was more accurate than Chinese astronomy. He then corrected the Chinese calendar and was later asked to rebuild and re-equip the Beijing Ancient Observatory, being given the roles of Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory./nHe became close friends with the Kangxi Emperor, who frequently requested his instruction in geometry, philosophy and music./nVerbiest worked as a diplomat, cartographer, and translator; he spoke Latin, German, Dutch, Spanish, Hebrew, Italian and Manchu. He wrote more than thirty books./nDuring the 1670s, Verbiest designed what some claim to be the first ever self-propelled vehicle \u2013 many[who?] claim this as the world's first automobile, in spite of its small size and the lack of evidence that it was actually built./nFerdinand Verbiest was the eldest child of Joos Verbiest, a bailiff and tax collector of Pittem near Kortrijk, Belgium.[2] Verbiest studied humanities with the Jesuits, in Bruges and Kortrijk, and next went to the Lelie College in Leuven for a year to study philosophy and mathematics.[2] He joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) on 2 September 1641.[1] Verbiest continued studying theology in  Seville, where he was ordained as a priest in 1655.[1] He completed his studies in astronomy and theology in Rome.[2] His intention had been to become a missionary in the Spanish missions to Central America, but this was not to be. His call was to the Far East, where the Roman Catholic Church was 'on a mission' to compensate for the loss of (Catholic) believers to the emerging Protestantism in Europe.[2]/nOn 4 April 1657, Verbiest left for China from Lisbon, accompanied by Father Martino Martini, thirty-five other missionaries, the Portuguese Viceroy of the Indies and some other passengers. Their boat reached Macau on 17 July 1658, by which time all but ten of the passengers, including the Viceroy and most of the missionaries, had died.[3] Verbiest took up his first posting in Shaanxi, leading the mission until 1660 when he was called to assist \u2013 and later replace \u2013 Father Johann Adam Schall von Bell, the Jesuit Director of the Beijing Observatory and Head of the Mathematical Board, in his work in astronomy. Unfortunately for them, the political situation shifted dramatically in 1661, after the death of the young Shunzhi Emperor aged 23. His son and successor, Xuanye (the Kangxi Emperor), was only 7, so the government was placed in the hands of four regents. Unlike Shunzhi, the regents were not in favour of the Jesuits,[3] who suffered increased persecution as a result./nIn 1664, the Chinese astronomer Yang Guangxian (1597\u20131669), who had published a pamphlet against the Jesuits, challenged Schall von Bell to a public astronomy competition. Yang won and took Schall von Bell's place as Head of Mathematics. Having lost the competition, Schall von Bell and the other Jesuits were chained and thrown into a filthy prison, accused of teaching a false religion. They were bound to wooden pegs in such a way that they could neither stand nor sit and remained there for almost two months until a sentence of strangulation was imposed. A high court found the sentence too light and ordered them to be cut up into bits while still alive.[5] Fortunately for them, on 16 April 1665,[6] a violent earthquake destroyed[citation needed] the part of the prison chosen for the execution. An extraordinary meteor was seen in the sky, and a fire destroyed the part of the imperial palace where the condemnation was pronounced.[7] This was seen as an omen and all the prisoners were released. However, they still had to stand trial, and all the Jesuits but Verbiest, Schall von Bell and two others were exiled to Canton. Schall von Bell died within a year, due to the conditions of his confinement.[3]/nIn 1669, the Kangxi Emperor managed to take power by having the last remaining corrupt regent Oboi arrested. In the same year, the emperor was informed that serious errors had been found in the calendar for 1670, which had been drawn up by Yang Guangxian.  Kangxi commanded a public test to compare the merits of European and Chinese astronomy. The test was to predict three things: the length of the shadow thrown by a gnomon of a given height at noon of a certain day; the absolute and relative positions of the Sun and the planets on a given date; and the exact time of an anticipated lunar eclipse. It was decided that Yang and Verbiest should each use their mathematical skills to determine the answers and that \"The Heavens would be the judge\". The contest was held at the Bureau of Astronomy in the presence of senior-ranking government ministers and officials from the observatory. Unlike Yang, Verbiest had access to the latest updates on the Rudolphine Tables, and was assisted by telescopes for observation. He succeeded in all three tests and was immediately installed as the Head of the Mathematical Board and Director of the Observatory. Out of consideration for him, the exiled Jesuits were authorized to return to their missions. Meanwhile, Yang was sentenced to the same death he had planned for his Jesuit rival, but the sentence was reduced to exile and he died en route to his native home.[1][3][5][8]/nThe 1670 calendar included an extra month unnecessarily added to hide other errors and to bring the lunar months in line with the solar year. Verbiest suggested the errors should be corrected, including removing the extra month. This was an audacious move, as the calendar had been approved by the emperor himself. Fearing the emperor's response, the observatory officials begged him to withdraw this request, but he responded: \"It is not within my power to make the heavens agree with your calendar. The extra month must be taken out.\" Much to their surprise, the emperor after studying the research agreed, and it was done.[5]/nAfter this, Verbiest and the emperor formed a real friendship, with the Jesuit teaching him geometry, philosophy and music. He was frequently invited to the palace and to accompany the Emperor on his expeditions throughout the empire. He translated the first six books of Euclid into Manchu and took every opportunity to introduce Christianity. In response, the Emperor elevated him to the highest grade of the mandarinate and granted permission for him to preach Christianity anywhere in the empire.[5]/nVerbiest undertook many projects, including the construction of an aqueduct, the casting of 132 cannons for the imperial army \u2013 far superior to any previous Chinese weapons \u2013 and the design of a new gun carriage. He created star charts for the Kangxi Emperor in order to tell the time at night.[9] Other inventions included a steam engine to propel ships./nHaving resolved the issues surrounding the calendar, Verbiest went on to compose a table of all solar and lunar eclipses for the next 2000 years. Delighted with this, the emperor awarded him complete charge of the imperial astronomy observatory, which he rebuilt in 1673. The existing equipment was obsolete, so Verbiest consigned it to a museum and set about designing six new instruments:[5]/nThese instruments were all very large, made of brass and highly decorated, with bronze dragons forming the supports. Despite their weight, they were very easy to manipulate, demonstrating Verbiest's aptitude for mechanical design./nVerbiest died in Beijing shortly after receiving a wound from falling off a bolting horse.[16] He was succeeded as the chief mathematician and astronomer of the Chinese empire by another Belgian Jesuit, Antoine Thomas (1644\u20131709). He was buried in the Jesuits' Zhalan Cemetery in Beijing, near those of other Jesuits including Matteo Ricci and Johann Adam Schall von Bell, on 11 March 1688.[5]/nVerbiest was the only Westerner in Chinese history to ever receive the honour of a posthumous name by the Emperor./nBesides his work in astronomy, Verbiest also experimented with steam. Around 1672 he designed \u2013 as a toy for the Kangxi Emperor \u2013 a steam-propelled trolley which was, quite possibly, the first working steam-powered vehicle ('auto-mobile').[17] Verbiest describes it in his manuscript Astronomia Europea[18] that was finished in 1681. A friar brought it to Europe and it was then printed in 1687 in Germany. In this work, Verbiest first mentioned the (latin) term motor in its present meaning. With one filling of coal, he wrote that the vehicle was able to move more than one hour.[19] As it was only 65\u00a0cm (25.6\u00a0in) long, and therefore effectively a scale model, not designed to carry human passengers, nor a driver or goods, it is not strictly accurate to call it a 'car'.[20] Despite this, it was the first vehicle that was able to move by 'self-made' engine power./nSince the steam engine was still not known at that time, Verbiest used the principle of an impulse turbine. Steam was generated in a ball-shaped boiler, emerging through a pipe at the top, from where it was directed at a simple, open \"steam turbine\" (rather like a water wheel) that drove the rear wheels./nIt is not verified by other known sources if Verbiest's model was ever built at the time and no authentic drawing of it exists, although he had access to China's finest metal-working craftsmen who were constructing precision astronomical instruments for him./nThe Italian model manufacturer Brumm produced a non-working 1:43 scale model of the Veicolo a turbina de Verbiest (1681) [sic],[21] in their \"Old Fire\" range of 2002. This model was 9\u00a0cm (3.54\u00a0in) long, which, when scaled-up, would have suggested that Verbiest's original would have been nearly 4 metres (13\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) in length./nHowever, comparison with drawings in Hardenberg's study shows that this model is not the same as Verbiest's. It is actually modelled on a small steam turbine car built in the late 18th century (presumably 1775) by a German mechanic that was inspired by Verbiests vehicle but different, for example, only with three wheels.[19] Unfortunately, the original was probably destroyed during a bombing raid on the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe during World War II. However, a photo of the original car can be seen at the Deutsches Museum. Hardenberg notes that this steam turbine car operated on the same principle as Verbiest's carriage (the impulse turbine), but employed a more modern arrangement of the drive train.[22]/nVerbiest is commemorated on several postage stamps. One, featuring his face, was issued in Belgium on 24 October 1988, to mark the tri-centenary of his death,[23] with a matching pictorial cancellation postmark.[24] Several more stamps were issued in Macau, in 1989 and 1999, featuring a sketch by Verbiest of the Observatory in Peking, where he worked.[23] The Chevalier Medal for Oriental Art was instituted in his memory to reward exceptional contributions to the sciences and arts./nMedia related to Ferdinand Verbiest at Wikimedia Commons", "34287470": "Michelangelo Ricci (1619\u20131682) was an Italian mathematician and a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church./nMichelangelo Ricci was born on 30 January 1619 in Rome, then capital of the Papal States, to a family of low social standing that originated in Bergamo./nHe studied theology and law in Rome, where he was a contemporary of Ren\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois de Sluse.

He was a friend of Evangelista Torricelli, kept close links with contemporary scientific culture, and played an important role in the development of the Galilean school./nLike de Sluze, he spent his entire career in the Roman Catholic Church and served the pope in various roles on several occasions.  A trained theologian, he acted as consultant to various Congregations of the Roman Curia.  Having suffered from epilepsy since his birth, he was (according to canon law of the time) disqualified from ordination.  Nonetheless, he was created a Cardinal-Deacon in the Consistory of 1 September 1681 by Pope Innocent XI, with the title 'Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Aquiro'.  His position in the church was very useful for protecting his friends and fellow scientists in their controversies with the opposing scholastic school./nHe played a significant part in the theoretical debates and experiments that led up to Torricelli's discovery of atmospheric pressure and invention of the mercury barometer.  In particular he followed the experiments in this field by Gasparo Berti, in Rome./nThere is an unpublished manuscript by Ricci, devoted to algebra, in the library of the Mathematical Institute of Genoa.  It shows that by 1640 he was familiar with the 'New Algebra' of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te.  In this book he provides a critique of the solutions given by the geometer Marino Ghetaldi of Ragusa in his De Resolutione et Compositione Matematica to the problems posed by Apollonius of Perga.[1]/nHis published mathematical work is summarised in a treatise of nineteen pages, Exercitatio geometrica, de maximis et minimis (1666) in which he studies the maxima of functions of the form \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nm\n\n\n(\na\n\u2212\nx\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{m}(a-x)^{n}}\n\n and tangents to curves with equation \n\n\n\n\ny\n\nm\n\n\n=\nk\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y^{m}=kx^{n}}\n\n, using methods that are an early form of induction.  This treatise was much admired by his contemporaries and has recently been republished as an appendix to Mercator's 'Logarithmo-Technia' (1688).  He also studied spirals (1644) and cycloids (1674) and recognised that the study of tangents and the calculation of areas are reciprocal operations./nRicci is also known for his correspondence with Torricelli, Vincenzo Viviani, Ren\u00e9 de Sluze and Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, founder of the Accademia del Cimento. These letters give his thoughts on paraboloids and hyperboloids when cut by parallel planes, on the surface of a ring, and on the properties of the vacuum.  It was Ricci who welcomed Marin Mersenne, when he came to Italy to present the work of Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In optics he studied the magnifying effect of lenses. With Giovanni Battista Baliani he discussed the Galilean revolution. Ricci was also a close associate of Antonio Nardi, another mathematician in Rome. He collaborated with Nardi on his Scene, an unpublished manuscript that circulated among Torricelli and others, in which Ricci included some of the material that would later appear in his 1666 Geometrica Exercitatio./nFollowing the death of Torricelli and the disappearance of Bonaventura Cavalieri, he was requested to collate and publish his correspondence with these two men.

The \u201cAbsorption Co\u00ebfficient\u201d that Beer defined is actually the transmittance (or transmission ratio), T = I / I0.[5] In Beer's formulation: \"the transmittance of a concentrated solution can be derived from a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution.\"[6]/nThe transmittance measured for any concentration and path length can be normalized to the corresponding transmittance for a standard concentration and path length.

At the age of 14 he was already corresponding with Michael Faraday and Professor John Tyndall. \nWhitmell was educated at Leeds Grammar School, London University and Trinity College, Cambridge (where he studied under James Clerk Maxwell at the Cavendish Laboratory). His experimental work was on the subject of highly refractive liquids.[4]\nAfter leaving Trinity College he earned his living by giving Cambridge University Extension lectures, most notably on 'Light & Spectrum Analysis' (Jan\u2013Apr 1875). From 1877 to 1879 he was employed as an Assistant Master at Tonbridge School, near Sevenoaks, Kent./nIn July 1879 Whitmell was appointed as one of Her Majesty's Assistant Inspectors of Schools, at first working in the area around Sheffield, and in September 1883 was promoted to Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools (HMI) for the South Wales region, centred on Cardiff. He was associated with a number of reform campaigns, such as those for free education, co-education for boys and girls, recreative night-classes, and changes of the law to allow libraries, museums and other cultural facilities to open on Sundays. He also appeared on the platform at rallies demanding votes for women. After more than 13 years in Wales, he was posted to Leeds in the north of England in early 1897 to take over as HMI there.[5]/nIn both Cardiff and Leeds Charles Whitmell played a leading role in the burgeoning scientific societies. In Cardiff he was an active member of the Chemical and Geological Societies and was a President of the Cardiff Naturalists' Society. Just before leaving Wales he was nominated as the President of the Astronomical Society of Wales.\nUpon taking up residence in Leeds he was elected President of the Leeds Geological Society and within a year was chosen unanimously as the President of Leeds Astronomical Society. He was also active at a national level, becoming an elected Council member (and later vice-President) of the British Astronomical Association (BAA, elected 27 November 1895[6]), a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (elected 9 December 1898[7]) and a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France (Astronomical Society of France). Whitmell had a flair for mathematical analysis of curious and unusual scientific problems and it was this characteristic which dominated his published work. Such titles as 'The Maximum Possible Duration for a Total Solar Eclipse', the 'Transit of the Moon across the Earth's disc as seen from Mars', 'Saturn visible through the Cassini Division', and 'a Martian Sundial' became his 'stock in trade'. He also relished the observation and analysis of rare or extreme events such as the green flash at sunset, halos, rainbows and mock suns. \nHe was a regular correspondent of the popular journal, the English Mechanic, wherein he provided detailed answers to a wide variety of queries on physics, astronomy and mathematics, posed by its readers. He also wrote hundreds of papers on astronomy for journals such as the Journal of the BAA, the Observatory Magazine, the Monthly Notices of the RAS, and the journals of the local scientific societies of which he was a member. For a time he was the editor of the Journal & Transactions of Leeds Astronomical Society and ensured that copies of the Journal were seen by amateur and professional astronomers around the world./nDuring a BAA expedition to Navalmoral in Spain to observe the total solar eclipse of 28 May 1900, Whitmell met Lucy Foster (the daughter of Sir William Foster, Bart. (1825-1911)), who was also a member of the expedition.[8] Lucy shared not only a passionate interest in astronomy, but also Whitmell's love of poetry. Lucy was elected to the BAA on 26 February 1902.[9] Charles and Lucy were married on 26 May 1903.[2] Whitmell retired from his job as HMI in 1910. During World War I, Lucy Whitmell gained fame in her own right as the author of the poem Christ in Flanders, which was published by The Spectator magazine in September 1915.[10] It became very popular amongst the troops \u2013 eliciting several poetic responses \u2013 and was set to music by a number of different composers. Lucy died after a protracted illness on 7 May 1917 and Charles Thomas Whitmell died unexpectedly, after a very brief bout of pneumonia, on 10 December 1919.[11] Whitmell is buried with his wife at Lawnswood Cemetery in north Leeds.

The only first-hand accounts of him that survive are in three of Plato's dialogues: the Theaetetus, the Sophist, and the Statesman. In the former dialogue, he posits a mathematical construction now known as the Spiral of Theodorus./nLittle is known as Theodorus' biography beyond what can be inferred from Plato's dialogues. He was born in the northern African colony of Cyrene, and apparently taught both there and in Athens.[1] He complains of old age in the Theaetetus, the dramatic date of 399 BC of which suggests his period of flourishing to have occurred in the mid-5th century. The text also associates him with the sophist Protagoras, with whom he claims to have studied before turning to geometry.[2] A dubious tradition repeated among ancient biographers like Diogenes La\u00ebrtius[3] held that Plato later studied with him in Cyrene, Libya.[1]\nThis eminent mathematician Theodorus was, along with Alcibiades and many other of Socrates' companions (many of whom would be associated with the Thirty Tyrants), accused of distributing the mysteries at a symposium, according to Plutarch, who himself was priest of the temple at Delphi./nTheodorus' work is known through a sole theorem, which is delivered in the literary context of the Theaetetus and has been argued alternately to be historically accurate or fictional.[1] In the text, his student Theaetetus attributes to him the theorem that the square roots of the non-square numbers up to 17 are irrational:/nTheodorus here was drawing some figures for us in illustration of roots, showing that squares containing three square feet and five square feet are not commensurable in length with the unit of the foot, and so, selecting each one in its turn up to the square containing seventeen square feet and at that he stopped.[4]/nThe square containing two square units is not mentioned, perhaps because the incommensurability of its side with the unit was already known.) Theodorus's method of proof is not known. It is not even known whether, in the quoted passage, \"up to\" (\u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9) means that seventeen is included. If seventeen is excluded, then Theodorus's proof may have relied merely on considering whether numbers are even or odd.  Indeed, Hardy and Wright[5]\nand Knorr[6] suggest proofs that rely ultimately on the following theorem:  If \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n=\nn\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}=ny^{2}}\n\n is soluble in integers, and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is odd, then \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n must be congruent to 1 modulo 8 (since \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n can be assumed odd, so their squares are congruent to 1 modulo 8./nThat one cannot prove the irrationality the square root of 17 by considerations restricted to the arithmetic of the even  and the odd has been shown in one system of the arithmetic of the even and the odd in [7] and,[8] but it is an open problem in a stronger natural axiom system for the arithmetic of the even and the odd [9]/nA possibility suggested earlier by Zeuthen[10] is that Theodorus applied the so-called Euclidean algorithm, formulated in Proposition X.2 of the Elements as a test for incommensurability. In modern terms, the theorem is that a real number with an infinite continued fraction expansion is irrational. Irrational square roots have periodic expansions. The period of the square root of 19 has length 6, which is greater than the period of the square root of any smaller number. The period of \u221a17 has length one (so does \u221a18; but the irrationality of \u221a18 follows from that of \u221a2)./nThe so-called Spiral of Theodorus is composed of contiguous right triangles with hypotenuse lengths equal \u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a4, \u2026, \u221a17; additional triangles cause the diagram to overlap. Philip J. Davis interpolated the vertices of the spiral to get a continuous curve. He discusses the history of attempts to determine Theodorus' method in his book Spirals: From Theodorus to Chaos, and makes brief references to the matter in his fictional Thomas Gray series./nThat Theaetetus established a more general theory of irrationals, whereby square roots of non-square numbers are irrational, is suggested in the eponymous Platonic dialogue as well as commentary on, and scholia to, the Elements.[11]", "22589337": "Fritz Joachim Weyl (February 19, 1915 \u2013 July 20, 1977) was a mathematician born in Zurich, Switzerland.[1] He significantly contributed to research in mathematics. He taught mathematics at many universities, most notably at the George Washington University (GW or GWU), in Washington, D.C./nFritz was the son of famous mathematician Hermann Weyl and writer and translator Helene Weyl. Fritz received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, in 1935. Weyl then went on to obtain a Master's degree in 1937 from Princeton University, in New Jersey.  Finally Weyl was awarded a PhD, also by Princeton University in 1939 for his work in the field of mathematics. His PhD dissertation at Princeton was entitled \"Analytic Curves\" and is twenty-five pages in length.[2] Salomon Bochner served as his dissertation advisor and oversaw his research in the area while Weyl was studying at Princeton. Bochner too is well known in the math world. He is a native of Germany and received his PhD in 1921 from the University of Berlin.  His dissertation advisor was Erhard Schmidt. While at Princeton, Bochner advised many students who went on to achieve much academic success in their own right./nProfessor Weyl taught at a number of different universities during his life.  These include a stay at the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, College Park, Indiana University, and the George Washington University.  In addition to teaching, Weyl was employed as a research analyst by the U.S. government for a period of time.  After his stay there he went on to serve as the Dean of Science and Mathematics at Hunter College in New York City./nWeyl served as the President of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 1960-1961.[3]/nWeyl joined the department of mathematics at GW around 1946.[2] During this time, GW is described as having been particularly vibrant in student life. As of 1945, the university offered 387 courses to almost 13,000 wartime students. These programs were primarily conducted under a contract between GW and the U.S Office of Education for Engineering, Science and Management War Training. The establishment of this program was seen as necessary and was inherently due to the U.S.'s heavy involvement in World War II at the time. Given GW's strategic location in metropolitan D.C., it would be appropriate to conclude that more emphasis was paid to developing programs here than in less vital locations in other parts of the country. An estimated 7,000 GW graduates served in the armed forces.[4]/nThe math department at GW has a long history and tradition. In 1935 the department of statistics was the first of its kind in a college of arts and sciences in the U.S. In 1946, during Professor Weyl's time here, a theoretical physics conference was held at GW. It was put on in a joint effort by the university and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. At the conference theoretical physicists met with biologists to conduct a study of living processes, Dr. Weyl was in attendance. The conference held in 1946 served as the postwar resumption of a conference series held annually which began in 1934. Sources state that these meetings were not standard academic gatherings, in the sense that a small number of active researchers gathered for a discussion of problems, and to pose questions to spark continued work and activity in the immediate years to come.  Conversely standard conferences, the bulletin reported, would merely recycle results previously obtained./nJames Henry Taylor was a mathematics professor at GW from 1929 to 1958 and then professor emeritus until his death in 1972.  During Dr. Weyl's time here, he and Dr. Taylor worked together in the GW math department.  During 1946 the department is noted as having taught advanced analytics, geometry, and tensor analysis. Some time shortly after 1946 however the department developed thirty-four additional courses in everything from collegiate algebra to analytic geometry and plane trigonometry. Today the university awards a \"grand math prize\" in Taylor's honor. Another famous professor in the GW math department with Weyl in 1946 was Florence Marie Mears, who taught at GW from 1929 to 1955. The year of 1946 was particularly renowned in the GW mathematics department for having so many famous mathematicians there at once./nBoth Fritz and his father Hermann published much work on mathematical research.[5]  Most of Hermann's published work is not in English however.  In 1970s, Constance Reid wrote books about David Hilbert and Richard Courant where Hermann Weyl is mentioned many times and his son once, on p.\u00a0381 in the volume about Courant. In 1949, Hermann published a book entitled Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural Science.  This work was originally published by Princeton University Press.  Fritz and Hermann published a book together called Meromorphic Functions and Analytic Curves.[6][7]  This work is believed to be based on notes from a course given at the Institute for Advanced Study during the first term of 1942\u20131943. While Fritz was working for the U.S. government he complied what is known as Research in the service of national purpose; proceedings of the Office of Naval Research Vicennial Convocation, in 1966. This work is available at the National Museum of American History located at the Smithsonian.  Also many researchers have cited Weyl's work when conducting their own.  For example his work is cited as a reference in the publication The Philosophical Review./nWhen Weyl died on July 20, 1977, the mathematics community considered the loss to be devastating. On October 8, 1977, the Board of Trustees for the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) issued a memoriam.

He attended Samuel J. Tilden High School, in Brooklyn, New York, and the City College of New York.  In 1964, he began his graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Enrolling for graduate study in electrical engineering, he changed his area of study to physics.

Low.[2]/nAfter short positions at Cornell University (1970\u20131972) and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (1972\u20131974), he was offered a longer-term post at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to study turbulence in fluids. He was at Cornell from 1982 to 1986 and then joined Rockefeller University as Toyota Professor in 1987. Although a complete theory of turbulent fluids remains to be established, Feigenbaum's research paved the way for what is now known as chaos theory, providing groundbreaking insight into the many dynamical systems in which scientists and mathematicians find chaotic maps.[2]/nIn 1983, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, and in 1986, alongside Rockefeller University colleague Albert Libchaber, he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics \"for his pioneering theoretical studies demonstrating the universal character of non-linear systems, which has made possible the systematic study of chaos\". He was a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at the Scripps Research Institute. He remained at Rockefeller University as Toyota Professor from 1987 until his death.[2]/nSome mathematical mappings involving a single linear parameter exhibit the apparently random behavior known as chaos when the parameter lies within certain ranges.  As the parameter is increased towards this region, the mapping undergoes bifurcations at precise values of the parameter.  At first, one stable point occurs, then bifurcates to an oscillation between two values, then bifurcating again to oscillate between four values and so on.  In 1975, Dr. Feigenbaum, using the small HP-65 calculator he had been issued, discovered that the ratio of the difference between the values at which such successive period-doubling bifurcations occur tends to a constant of around 4.6692...[3]  He was able to provide a mathematical argument of that fact, and he then showed that the same behavior, with the same mathematical constant, would occur within a wide class of mathematical functions, prior to the onset of chaos.[4] This universal result enabled mathematicians to take their first steps to unraveling the apparently intractable \"random\" behavior of chaotic systems.  The \"ratio of convergence\" measured in this study is now known as the first Feigenbaum constant.[2]/nThe logistic map is a prominent example of the mappings that Feigenbaum studied in his noted 1978 article: \"Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations\".[5]/nFeigenbaum's other contributions include the development of important new fractal methods in cartography, starting when he was hired by Hammond to develop techniques to allow computers to assist in drawing maps.

Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers. Cantor's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an infinity of infinities. He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic. Cantor's work is of great philosophical interest, a fact he was well aware of.[2]/nOriginally, Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers was regarded as counter-intuitive\u00a0\u2013 even shocking. This caused it to encounter resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincar\u00e9[3] and later from Hermann Weyl and L.\u00a0E.\u00a0J. Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections; see Controversy over Cantor's theory. Cantor, a devout Lutheran Christian,[4] believed the theory had been communicated to him by God.[5] Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God[6]\u00a0\u2013 on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism[7]\u00a0\u2013 a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected. Not all theologians were against Cantor's theory; prominent neo-scholastic philosopher Constantin Gutberlet was in favor of it and Cardinal Johann Baptist Franzelin accepted it as a valid theory (after Cantor made some important clarifications).[8]/nThe objections to Cantor's work were occasionally fierce: Leopold Kronecker's public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a \"scientific charlatan\", a \"renegade\" and a \"corrupter of youth\".[9] Kronecker objected to Cantor's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable, and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable, results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum. Writing decades after Cantor's death, Wittgenstein lamented that mathematics is \"ridden through and through with the pernicious idioms of set theory\", which he dismissed as \"utter nonsense\" that is \"laughable\" and \"wrong\".[10] Cantor's recurring bouts of depression from 1884 to the end of his life have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries,[11] though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a bipolar disorder.[12]/nThe harsh criticism has been matched by later accolades. In 1904, the Royal Society awarded Cantor its Sylvester Medal, the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics.[13] David Hilbert defended it from its critics by declaring, \"No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created.\"[14][15]/nGeorg Cantor, born in 1845 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, was brought up in that city until the age of eleven. The oldest of six children, he was regarded as an outstanding violinist. His grandfather Franz B\u00f6hm (1788\u20131846) (the violinist Joseph B\u00f6hm's brother) was a well-known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra.[16] Cantor's father had been a member of the Saint Petersburg stock exchange; when he became ill, the family moved to Germany in 1856, first to Wiesbaden, then to Frankfurt, seeking milder  winters than those of Saint Petersburg. In 1860, Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in Darmstadt; his exceptional skills in mathematics, trigonometry in particular, were noted. In August 1862, he then graduated from the \"H\u00f6here Gewerbeschule Darmstadt\", now the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.[17][18] In 1862 Cantor entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich. After receiving a substantial inheritance upon his father's death in June 1863,[19] Cantor transferred to the University of Berlin, attending lectures by Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer. He spent the summer of 1866 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then and later a center for mathematical research. Cantor was a good student, and he received his doctoral degree in 1867.[19][20]/nCantor submitted his dissertation on number theory at the University of Berlin in 1867. After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls' school, he took up a position at the University of Halle, where he spent his entire career. He was awarded the requisite habilitation for his thesis, also on number theory, which he presented in 1869 upon his appointment at Halle University.[20][21]/nIn 1874, Cantor married Vally Guttmann. They had six children, the last (Rudolph) born in 1886. Cantor was able to support a family despite his modest academic pay, thanks to his inheritance from his father. During his honeymoon in the  Harz mountains, Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with Richard Dedekind, whom he had met at Interlaken in Switzerland\ntwo years earlier while on holiday./nCantor was promoted to extraordinary professor in 1872 and made full professor in 1879.[20][19] To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a chair at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible.[22] Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague,[23] perceiving him as a \"corrupter of youth\" for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians.[24] Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he had intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874.[20] Kronecker, now seen as one of the founders of the constructive viewpoint in mathematics, disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and the process usually involved Kronecker,[20] so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle./nIn 1881, Cantor's Halle colleague Eduard Heine died. Halle accepted Cantor's suggestion that Heine's vacant chair be offered to Dedekind, Heinrich M. Weber and Franz Mertens, in that order, but each declined the chair after being offered it. Friedrich Wangerin was eventually appointed, but he was never close to Cantor./nIn 1882, the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and Dedekind came to an end, apparently as a result of Dedekind's declining the chair at Halle.[25] Cantor also began another important correspondence, with G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler in Sweden, and soon began to publish in Mittag-Leffler's journal Acta Mathematica. But in 1885, Mittag-Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to Acta.[26] He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from Acta while it was in proof, writing that it was \"...\u00a0about one hundred years too soon.\" Cantor complied, but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag-Leffler, writing to a third party, \"Had Mittag-Leffler had his way, I should have to wait until the year 1984, which to me seemed too great a demand! ... But of course I never want to know anything again about Acta Mathematica.\"[27]/nCantor suffered his first known bout of depression in May 1884.[19][28] Criticism of his work weighed on his mind: every one of the fifty-two letters he wrote to Mittag-Leffler in 1884 mentioned Kronecker. A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor's self-confidence:/n... I don't know when I shall return to the continuation of my scientific work. At the moment I can do absolutely nothing with it, and limit myself to the most necessary duty of my lectures; how much happier I would be to be scientifically active, if only I had the necessary mental freshness.[29]/nThis crisis led him to apply to lecture on philosophy rather than on mathematics. He also began an intense study of Elizabethan literature, thinking there might be evidence that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare (see Shakespearean authorship question); this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets, published in 1896 and 1897.[30]/nCantor recovered soon thereafter, and subsequently made further important contributions, including his diagonal argument and theorem. However, he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874\u201384, even after Kronecker's death on December 29, 1891.[20] He eventually sought, and achieved, a reconciliation with Kronecker. Nevertheless, the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted./nIn 1889, Cantor was instrumental in founding the German Mathematical Society,[20] and he chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891, where he first introduced his diagonal argument; his reputation was strong enough, despite Kronecker's opposition to his work, to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society. Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him, Cantor invited him to address the meeting, but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time. Georg Cantor was also instrumental in the establishment of the first International Congress of Mathematicians, which took place in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 1897.[20]/nAfter Cantor's 1884 hospitalization there is no record that he was in any sanatorium again until 1899.[28] Soon after that second hospitalization, Cantor's youngest son Rudolph died suddenly on December 16 (Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on Baconian theory and William Shakespeare), and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics.[31] Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903. One year later, he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by Julius K\u00f6nig at the Third International Congress of Mathematicians. The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false.  Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues, Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated.[32] Although Ernst Zermelo demonstrated less than a day later that K\u00f6nig's proof had failed, Cantor remained shaken, and momentarily questioning God.[13] Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life, for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined to various sanatoria. The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years.[33] He did not abandon mathematics completely, however, lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory (Burali-Forti paradox, Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox) to a meeting of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1903, and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in 1904./nIn 1911, Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to the 500th anniversary of the founding of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet Bertrand Russell, whose newly published Principia Mathematica repeatedly cited Cantor's work, but the encounter did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person./nCantor retired in 1913, and lived in poverty and suffering from malnourishment during World War I.[34] The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium for the last time and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. Georg Cantor had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent the last year of his life.[19]/nCantor's work between 1874 and 1884 is the origin of set theory.[35] Prior to this work, the concept of a set was a rather elementary one that had been used implicitly since the beginning of mathematics, dating back to the ideas of Aristotle. No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content. Before Cantor, there were only finite sets (which are easy to understand) and \"the infinite\" (which was considered a topic for philosophical, rather than mathematical, discussion). By proving that there are (infinitely) many possible sizes for infinite sets, Cantor established that set theory was not trivial, and it needed to be studied. Set theory has come to play the role of a foundational theory in modern mathematics, in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects (for example, numbers and functions) from all the traditional areas of mathematics (such as algebra, analysis, and topology) in a single theory, and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them. The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics.[36]/nIn one of his earliest papers,[37] Cantor proved that the set of real numbers is \"more numerous\" than the set of natural numbers; this showed, for the first time, that there exist infinite sets of different sizes. He was also the first to appreciate the importance of one-to-one correspondences (hereinafter denoted \"1-to-1 correspondence\") in set theory. He used this concept to define finite and infinite sets, subdividing the latter into denumerable (or countably infinite) sets and nondenumerable sets (uncountably infinite sets).[38]/nCantor developed important concepts in topology and their relation to cardinality. For example, he showed that the Cantor set, discovered by Henry John Stephen Smith in 1875,[39] is nowhere dense, but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers, whereas the rationals are everywhere dense, but countable. He also showed that all countable dense linear orders without end points are order-isomorphic to the rational numbers./nCantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory, such as the power set of a set A, which is the set of all possible subsets of A. He later proved that the size of the power set of A is strictly larger than the size of A, even when A is an infinite set; this result soon became known as Cantor's theorem. Cantor developed an entire theory and arithmetic of infinite sets, called cardinals and ordinals, which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter \n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph }\n\n (aleph) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter \u03c9 (omega). This notation is still in use today./nThe Continuum hypothesis, introduced by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert as the first of his twenty-three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium.[15] The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor's set theory and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Z\u00fcrich in 1897, Adolf Hurwitz and Jacques Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works./nCantor's first ten papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the suggestion of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: the uniqueness of the representation of a function by trigonometric series. Cantor solved this problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set Sn of a set S of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with S as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had S1 as its set of zeros, where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If Sk+1 is the set of limit points of Sk, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are Sk+1. Because the sets Sk were closed, they contained their limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S, S1, S2, S3,... formed a limit set, which we would now call S\u03c9, and then he noticed that S\u03c9 would also have to have a set of limit points S\u03c9+1, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers \u03c9, \u03c9\u00a0+\u00a01, \u03c9\u00a0+\u00a02, ...[40]/nBetween 1870 and 1872, Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series, and also a paper defining irrational numbers as convergent sequences of rational numbers. Dedekind, whom Cantor befriended in 1872, cited this paper later that year, in the paper where he first set out his celebrated definition of real numbers by Dedekind cuts.  While extending the notion of number by means of his revolutionary concept of infinite cardinality, Cantor was paradoxically opposed to theories of infinitesimals of his contemporaries Otto Stolz and Paul du Bois-Reymond, describing them as both \"an abomination\" and \"a cholera bacillus of mathematics\".[41] Cantor also published an erroneous \"proof\" of the inconsistency of infinitesimals.[42]/nThe beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor's 1874 paper,[35] \"Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen\" (\"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\").[44] This paper was the first to provide a rigorous proof that there was more than one kind of infinity. Previously, all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be equinumerous (that is, of \"the same size\" or having the same number of elements).[45] Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not equinumerous. In other words, the real numbers are not countable. His proof differs from the diagonal argument that he gave in 1891.[46] Cantor's article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers. Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844.[47]/nCantor established these results using two constructions. His first construction shows how to write the real algebraic numbers[48] as a sequence a1, a2, a3,\u00a0.... In other words, the real algebraic numbers are countable. Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers. Using this sequence, he constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains a real number not in the sequence. Since every sequence of real numbers can be used to construct a real not in the sequence, the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence\u00a0\u2013 that is, the real numbers are not countable.  By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers, Cantor produces a transcendental number. Cantor points out that his constructions prove more\u00a0\u2013 namely, they provide a new proof of Liouville's theorem: Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers.[49] Cantor's next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same \"power\" (see below) as the set of real numbers.[50]/nBetween 1879 and 1884, Cantor published a series of six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Leopold Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole.[51] Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period./nThe fifth paper in this series, \"Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre\" (\"Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates\"), published in 1883,[52] was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate monograph. It contained Cantor's reply to his critics and showed how the transfinite numbers were a systematic extension of the natural numbers. It begins by defining well-ordered sets. Ordinal numbers are then introduced as the order types of well-ordered sets. Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the cardinal and ordinal numbers. In 1885, Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types./nIn 1891, he published a paper containing his elegant \"diagonal argument\" for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove Cantor's theorem: the cardinality of the power set of a set A is strictly larger than the cardinality of A. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets, and of the cardinal and ordinal arithmetic that Cantor had defined. His argument is fundamental in the solution of the Halting problem and the proof of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. Cantor wrote on the Goldbach conjecture in 1894./nIn 1895 and 1897, Cantor published a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory.[53] The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., in ways that would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schr\u00f6der had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem./nCantor's 1874 Crelle paper was the first to invoke the notion of a 1-to-1 correspondence, though he did not use that phrase. He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the unit square and the points of a unit line segment. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far stronger result: for any positive integer n, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an n-dimensional space. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: \"Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!\" (\"I see it, but I don't believe it!\")[54] The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of dimension./nIn 1878, Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle's Journal, in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1-to-1 correspondence and introduced the notion of \"power\" (a term he took from Jakob Steiner) or \"equivalence\" of sets: two sets are equivalent (have the same power) if there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between them. Cantor defined countable sets (or denumerable sets) as sets which can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with the natural numbers, and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable. He also proved that n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn has the same power as the real numbers R, as does a countably infinite product of copies of R. While he made free use of countability as a concept, he did not write the word \"countable\" until 1883. Cantor also discussed his thinking about dimension, stressing that his mapping between the unit interval and the unit square was not a continuous one./nThis paper displeased Kronecker and Cantor wanted to withdraw it; however, Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and Karl Weierstrass supported its publication.[55] Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle./nCantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.[11]/nThe difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics: a 1940 result by Kurt G\u00f6del and a 1963 one by Paul Cohen together imply that the continuum hypothesis can be neither proved nor disproved using standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice (the combination referred to as \"ZFC\").[56]/nIn 1883, Cantor divided the infinite into the transfinite and the absolute.[57]/nThe transfinite is increasable in magnitude, while the absolute is unincreasable. For example, an ordinal \u03b1 is transfinite because it can be increased to \u03b1\u00a0+\u00a01. On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to add to it.[58] In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle \"every set can be well-ordered\" and stated that it is a \"law of thought\".[59]/nCantor extended his work on the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph.[60] First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem.[61] In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.[62]/nCantor avoided paradoxes by recognizing that there are two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction implies only that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. In contrast, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox.[63] Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.[64]/nIn 1908, Zermelo published his axiom system for set theory. He had two motivations for developing the axiom system: eliminating the paradoxes and securing his proof of the well-ordering theorem.[65] Zermelo had proved this theorem in 1904 using the axiom of choice, but his proof was criticized for a variety of reasons.[66] His response to the criticism included his axiom system and a new proof of the well-ordering theorem. His axioms support this new proof, and they eliminate the paradoxes by restricting the formation of sets.[67]/nIn 1923, John von Neumann developed an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes by using an approach similar to Cantor's\u2014namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set if it can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class.[68] Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem.[69] In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.[70]/nThe concept of the existence of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's.[71] He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one.[72] To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications\u00a0\u2013 he identified the Absolute Infinite with God,[73] and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.[5] He was a devout Lutheran whose explicit Christian beliefs shaped his philosophy of science.[74] Joseph Dauben has traced the effect Cantor's Christian convictions had on the development of transfinite set theory.[75][76]/nDebate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the philosophy of mathematics regarding the nature of actual infinity. Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate, and denied its existence.[77] Mathematicians from three major schools of thought (constructivism and its two offshoots, intuitionism and finitism) opposed Cantor's theories in this matter. For constructivists such as Kronecker, this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that nonconstructive proofs such as Cantor's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists, holding instead that constructive proofs are required. Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality, but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism. Firstly, Cantor's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity, whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions, originating instead in the intuitions of the mind.[78] Secondly, the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism, since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set.[79] Mathematicians such as L.\u00a0E.\u00a0J. Brouwer and especially Henri Poincar\u00e9 adopted an intuitionist stance against Cantor's work.  Finally, Wittgenstein's attacks were finitist: he believed that Cantor's diagonal argument conflated the intension of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its extension, thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set.[10]/nSome Christian theologians saw Cantor's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God.[6] In particular, neo-Thomist thinkers saw the existence of an actual infinity that consisted of something other than God as jeopardizing \"God's exclusive claim to supreme infinity\".[80] Cantor strongly believed that this view was a misinterpretation of infinity, and was convinced that set theory could help correct this mistake:[81] \"... the transfinite species are just as much at the disposal of the intentions of the Creator and His absolute boundless will as are the finite numbers.\".[82] Prominent neo-scholastic German philosopher Constantin Gutberlet was in favor of such theory, holding that it didn't oppose the nature of God.[8]/nCantor also believed that his theory of transfinite numbers ran counter to both materialism and determinism\u00a0\u2013 and was shocked when he realized that he was the only faculty member at Halle who did not hold to deterministic philosophical beliefs.[83]/nIt was important to Cantor that his philosophy provided an \"organic explanation\" of nature, and in his 1883 Grundlagen, he said that such an explanation could only come about by drawing on the resources of the philosophy of Spinoza and Leibniz.[84] In making these claims, Cantor may have been influenced by FA Trendelenburg, whose lecture courses he attended at Berlin, and in turn Cantor produced a Latin commentary on Book 1 of Spinoza's Ethica. FA Trendelenburg was also the examiner of Cantor's Habilitationsschrift.[85][86]/nIn 1888, Cantor published his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his set theory. In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph Hontheim,[87] as well as theologians such as Cardinal Johann Baptist Franzelin, who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism.[7] Although later this Cardinal accepted the theory as valid, due to some clarifications from Cantor's.[8] Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.[81]/nCantor's philosophy on the nature of numbers led him to affirm a belief in the freedom of mathematics to posit and prove concepts apart from the realm of physical phenomena, as expressions within an internal reality. The only restrictions on this metaphysical system are that all mathematical concepts must be devoid of internal contradiction, and that they follow from existing definitions, axioms, and theorems. This belief is summarized in his assertion that \"the essence of mathematics is its freedom.\"[88] These ideas parallel those of Edmund Husserl, whom Cantor had met in Halle.[89]/nMeanwhile, Cantor himself was fiercely opposed to infinitesimals, describing them as both an \"abomination\" and \"the cholera bacillus of mathematics\".[41]/nCantor's 1883 paper reveals that he was well aware of the opposition his ideas were encountering: \"... I realize that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers.\"[90]/nHence he devotes much space to justifying his earlier work, asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced as long as they are free of contradiction and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. He also cites Aristotle, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, George Berkeley, Gottfried Leibniz, and Bernard Bolzano on infinity. Instead, he always strongly rejected Immanuel Kant's philosophy, in the realms of both the philosophy of mathematics and metaphysics. He shared B. Russell's motto \"Kant or Cantor\", and defined Kant \"yonder sophistical Philistine who knew so little mathematics.\"[91]/nCantor's paternal grandparents were from Copenhagen and fled to Russia from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars. There is very little direct information on them.[92] Cantor's father, Georg Waldemar Cantor, was educated in the Lutheran mission in Saint Petersburg, and his correspondence with his son shows both of them as devout Lutherans. Very little is known for sure about Georg Waldemar's origin or education.[93] Cantor's mother, Maria Anna B\u00f6hm, was an Austro-Hungarian born in Saint Petersburg and baptized Roman Catholic; she converted to Protestantism upon marriage. However, there is a letter from Cantor's brother Louis to their mother, stating:/nM\u00f6gen wir zehnmal von Juden abstammen und ich im Princip noch so sehr f\u00fcr Gleichberechtigung der Hebr\u00e4er sein, im socialen Leben sind mir Christen lieber ...[93]/n(\"Even if we were descended from Jews ten times over, and even though I may be, in principle, completely in favour of equal rights for Hebrews, in social life I prefer Christians...\") which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry.[94]/nAccording to biographers Eric Temple Bell, Cantor was of Jewish descent, although both parents were baptized.[95] In a 1971 article entitled \"Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor\", the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan-Guinness mentions (Annals of Science 27, pp.\u00a0345\u2013391, 1971) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry. (He also states that Cantor's wife, Vally Guttmann, was Jewish)./nIn a letter written to Paul Tannery in 1896 (Paul Tannery, Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1934, p.\u00a0306), Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen. Specifically, Cantor states in describing his father: \"Er ist aber in Kopenhagen geboren, von israelitischen Eltern, die der dortigen portugisischen Judengemeinde....\"  (\"He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish (lit: 'Israelite') parents from the local Portuguese-Jewish community.\")[96]\nIn addition, Cantor's maternal great uncle,[97] a Hungarian violinist Josef B\u00f6hm, has been described as Jewish,[98] which may imply that Cantor's mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community.[99]/nIn a letter to Bertrand Russell, Cantor described his ancestry and self-perception as follows:/nNeither my father nor my mother were of German blood, the first being a Dane, borne in Kopenhagen, my mother of Austrian Hungar descension. You must know, Sir, that I am not a regular just Germain, for I am born 3 March 1845 at Saint Peterborough, Capital of Russia, but I went with my father and mother and brothers and sister, eleven years old in the year 1856, into Germany.[100]/nThere were documented statements, during the 1930s, that called this Jewish ancestry into question:/nMore often [i.e., than the ancestry of the mother] the question has been discussed of whether Georg Cantor was of Jewish origin. About this it is reported in a notice of the Danish genealogical Institute in Copenhagen from the year 1937 concerning his father: \"It is hereby testified that Georg Woldemar Cantor, born 1809 or 1814, is not present in the registers of the Jewish community, and that he completely without doubt was not a Jew\u00a0...\"[93]/nUntil the 1970s, the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by Arthur Moritz Sch\u00f6nflies (1927)\u00a0\u2013 largely the correspondence with Mittag-Leffler\u00a0\u2013 and Fraenkel (1930). Both were at second and third hand; neither had much on his personal life. The gap was largely filled by Eric Temple Bell's Men of Mathematics (1937), which one of Cantor's modern biographers describes as \"perhaps the most widely read modern book on the history of mathematics\"; and as \"one of the worst\".[101] Bell presents Cantor's relationship with his father as Oedipal, Cantor's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews, and Cantor's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics. Grattan-Guinness (1971) found that none of these claims were true, but they may be found in many books of the intervening period, owing to the absence of any other narrative. There are other legends, independent of Bell\u00a0\u2013 including one that labels Cantor's father a foundling, shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents.[102] A critique of Bell's book is contained in Joseph Dauben's biography.[103] Writes Dauben:/nCantor devoted some of his most vituperative correspondence, as well as a portion of the Beitr\u00e4ge, to attacking what he described at one point as the 'infinitesimal Cholera bacillus of mathematics', which had spread from Germany through the work of Thomae, du Bois Reymond and Stolz, to infect Italian mathematics ... Any acceptance of infinitesimals necessarily meant that his own theory of number was incomplete. Thus to accept the work of Thomae, du Bois-Reymond, Stolz and Veronese was to deny the perfection of Cantor's own creation. Understandably, Cantor launched a thorough campaign to discredit Veronese's work in every way possible.[104]", "74461112": "Yadollah Ordokhani is an Iranian mathematician and Professor of Mathematics at Alzahra University.\nHe is among the most-cited Iranian researchers and is known for his works on fractional wavelet, optimal control problem, numerical analysis, integral equations and time-delay systems.[1]\nHe is a former head of Iran's National Elites Foundation-Tehran Branch and a former Deputy Head of Research at Alzahra University.[2][3]/n/nThis Iranian academic-related biographical article is a stub.

His name is associated with the geometric curve called the Cissoid of Diocles, which was used by Diocles to solve the problem of doubling the cube.

The treatise contains sixteen propositions that are proved by conic sections. One of the fragments contains propositions seven and eight, which is a solution to the problem of dividing a sphere by a plane so that the resulting two volumes are in a given ratio. Proposition ten gives a solution to the problem of doubling the cube. This is equivalent to solving a certain cubic equation. Another fragment contains propositions eleven and twelve, which use the cissoid to solve the problem of finding two mean proportionals in between two magnitudes. Since this treatise covers more topics than just burning mirrors, it may be the case that On burning mirrors is the aggregate of three shorter works by Diocles.[4] In the same work, Diocles, just after demonstrating that the parabolic mirror could focus the rays in a single point, he mentioned that It is possible to obtain a lens with the same property.[5]", "1421250": "Roger Ap\u00e9ry (French: [ape\u0281i]; 14 November 1916, Rouen \u2013 18 December 1994, Caen) was a French mathematician most remembered for Ap\u00e9ry's theorem, which states that \u03b6(3) is an irrational number.

His father was G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Bolyai and his mother Krisztina Vajna. Farkas was taught at home by his father until the age of six when he was sent to the Calvinist school in Nagyszeben. His teachers recognized his talents in arithmetics and in learning languages. He learned Latin, Greek, Romanian, Hebrew and later also French, Italian and English. He easily multiplied, divided 13- or 14-digit numbers in his head, and was able to draw square and cubic roots from them.[1] At the age of 12 he left school and was appointed as a tutor to the eight-year-old son of the count Kem\u00e9ny. This meant that Bolyai was now treated as a member of one of the leading families in the country, and he became not only a tutor but a real friend to the count's son.

In this work, he gave iterative procedures to solve equations which he then proved convergent by showing them to be monotonically increasing and bounded above. His study of the convergence of series includes a test equivalent to Raabe's test, which he discovered independently and at about the same time as Raabe. Other important ideas in the work include a general definition of a function and a definition of an equality between two plane figures if they can both be divided into a finite equal number of pairwise congruent pieces./nHe first dissuaded his son from the study of non-Euclidean geometry, but by 1832 he became enthusiastic enough to persuade his son to publish his path-breaking thoughts.

He also discovered the helicoid. He worked with Lavoisier on the decomposition of water and the evolution of hydrogen./nMeusnier is sometimes portrayed as the inventor of the dirigible, because of an uncompleted project he conceived in 1784, not long after the first balloon flights of the Montgolfiers, and presented to the French Academy of Sciences.  This concerned an elliptical balloon (ballonet) 84 metres long, with a capacity of 1,700 cubic metres, powered by three propellers driven by 80 men. The basket, in the form of a boat, was suspended from the canopy on a system of three ropes./nAfter their successful hydrogen balloon flights in 1783, professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers built an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals. Their design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cell), a rudder, and a method of propulsion.[1]/nOn 15 July 1784 the brothers flew for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon with M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres in their elongated balloon. Rather than 80 men it was fitted with oars for propulsion and direction, but these proved useless. The absence of a gas release valve also meant that the duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500\u00a0metres (15,000\u00a0ft).[2][3]/nOn 19 September 1784 the brothers and M.

He obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1951 under the supervision of Salomon Bochner.[1][2]/nIn 1964, Sampson and James Eells introduced harmonic maps, which are mappings between Riemannian manifolds which solve a geometrically-defined system of partial differential equations. They can also be defined via the calculus of variations. Generalizing Bochner's work on harmonic functions, Eells and Sampson derived the Bochner identity, and used it to prove the triviality of harmonic maps under certain curvature conditions./nEells and Sampson established the existence of harmonic maps whenever the domain manifold is closed and the target has nonpositive sectional curvature. Their proof analyzed the harmonic map heat flow, which is a geometrically-defined heat equation. By establishing a priori estimates for the flow, they were able to prove its convergence under the indicated curvature assumption. The use of the Bochner identity in deriving estimates is where the assumption on sectional curvature plays a crucial role. As a result of Eells and Sampson's (subsequential) convergence theorem, they were able to prove the existence of harmonic maps in any homotopy class. As such, harmonic maps may be regarded as canonically-defined representatives of topological spaces of mappings. This perspective has enabled the application of harmonic maps to many problems in geometry and topology./nEells and Sampson's work is one of the most famous papers in the field of differential geometry, and was a direct inspiration for Richard Hamilton's epochal work on the Ricci flow. In addition to Eells and Sampson's heat flow, their main results on existence of harmonic maps can also be derived via the calculus of variations, using the regularity theory developed in the 1980s by Richard Schoen and Karen Uhlenbeck./nLater, in 1978, Sampson developed unique continuation, maximum principles, further rigidity theorems, and deformability results for harmonic maps. He also proved that a harmonic map of degree one between compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces must be a diffeomorphism.

Initially a teacher, he was appointed assistant to Sir Nevil Maskelyne, the fifth Astronomer Royal, at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and was involved in the Schiehallion experiment. He later conducted research in India, teaching himself Sanskrit and becoming one of the first members of the Asiatic Society. He was the first to measure the length of a degree of an arc of longitude along the Tropic of Cancer. His other major achievements included a study of Indian mathematics, although he earned a reputation for being rude and unpolished amid the leading figures in science who came mostly from the upper-class. One commentator called him \"an able mathematician but a most vulgar and scurrilous dog.\"/nBurrow was born at Hoberley, near Shadwell, Leeds. His father, a small tenant farmer, gave him some schooling, occasionally interrupted by labour on the farm. He showed an ability and keenness for mathematics early on, and after some instruction from a schoolmaster named Crooks at Leeds. At the age of 18 he walked for four days, all the way from Leeds to London, to seek a job and obtained a clerkship in the office of a London merchant. A year later he became usher in a school of Benjamin Webb, the \u2018celebrated writing-master.\u2019 He next set up as schoolmaster on his own account at Portsmouth. Here he taught mathematics for navigation to aspiring midshipmen. His reputation in mathematics reached Nevil Maskelyne and he received an offer for a position of \"labourer\" at the Greenwich Observatory. Burrow, an argumentative man, was however unable to work with the genteel and refined astronomer-royal and he soon left. In 1772 he married Anne Purvis, daughter of a poulterer in Leadenhall Street, and started a school at Greenwich.[1]/nIn 1774, Burrow and William Menzies aided Maskelyne in his observations in the Schiehallion experiment, to examine the deflection by gravity of the plumbline towards the mountain. He complained later that his services were insufficiently recognised. Burrow was liable to use words of abuse at anyone and he did not think Maskelyne deserved his position. Soon afterwards, however, he was appointed \u2018mathematical teacher in the drawing-room at the Tower,\u2019 where there was then a training school for artillery officers, afterwards merged into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. His salary was \u00a3100 a year. Here he became editor of the Ladies and Gentlemen's Diary, or Royal Almanack. It was started by Thomas Carnan, in opposition to the Ladies' Diary, published by the Stationers' Company and edited by Charles Hutton and like it included mathematical puzzles. The company claimed a monopoly of almanacs, but their claim was disallowed by the court of common pleas, on their bringing an action against Carnan, who published the first number of his diary in December 1775. It continued till 1786, the word 'Gentlemen' being dropped after 1780. Part of it was devoted to mathematical problems by Burrow and various contributors. Burrow quarrelled with his rival, Charles Hutton. Falling out with Maskelyne and others, he eked out his living by taking private pupils, and did a little work for publishers; a bit of work at London brought him in contact with Colonel Henry Watson, for many years chief engineer in Bengal under Lord Clive. Watson recommended him to Lord Townsend as a good candidate \"to teach mathematics\nto the Cadets of the drawing room\" of the tower. In 1777 he worked on a survey of the coast \"from Naze in Essex to Hollseby bay in Sussex\" (actually Suffolk) to assess vulnerabilities to attack by the French. He was joined by a party of pupils and the fleet was commanded by Admiral Howe. He later complained to master-general of the ordnance, the duke of Richmond, that he was not paid \"a farthing\". Henry Watson in the meantime was recalled to Bengal and offered to take Burrow along. Burrow resigned on 30 April 1782 \"in order to go to the East Indies.\"/nBurrow left his wife and growing family behind and boarded the east indiaman General Coote. The journey included fights with others including the first mate who Burrow suspected of plotting a mutiny. Soon after reaching India he wrote to the Governor-General Warren Hastings, a school friend of Maskelyne, stating his desire to generate more money in order to conduct further research. For a while he earned a living by teaching in Calcutta and it was reported that one of his Kashmiri students, Tafazzul Husain Khan Kashmiri (studied under James Dinwiddie and died in 1800[2]), was translating Newton's Principia into Persian.[3] He was also interested in ancient geometry, as shown by his book on Apollonius: A Restitution of the Geometrical Treatise of Apollonius Perg\u00e6us on Inclinations (1779), and was curious to investigate the mathematical treatises in ancient Hindu and other Oriental literature. He later published Hindoo Knowledge of the Binomial Theorem. He asked for Hastings's encouragement; and other letters and papers show that he pursued these inquiries, having learnt Sanskrit on his own for the purpose (he already knew Latin, French and Italian and had picked up some Arabic and Persian), and collected many Sanskrit and Persian manuscripts. He was appointed mathematical teacher of the engineers' corps, and afterwards had some employment in connection with a proposed trigonometrical survey of Bengal.[4]/nBurrow was one of the first members of The Asiatic Society founded by fellow orientalist William Jones and contributed to their research. In 1788, William Roy suggested that Burrow would be ideally qualified to conduct experiments in Bengal to examine trigonometrically to measure a meridian of the arc. In 1790 Burrow wrote to the directors of the East India Company to set up an \"Indian Greenwich\". It was turned down as the Madras Observatory was being considered around the same time. Burrow had obtained instruments used by the late Colonel Thomas Dean Pearse (1741\u20131789) and began his measurement of a baseline near Calcutta in 1791. Burrow measured both along the latitude and along the longitude somewhere near Cawksally near Krishnagar in Nadia District. His equipment was not standard and there were a lot of errors arising from methodology.  From his observations a length of a meridian arc along the Tropic of Cancer was later determined by Isaac Dalby as 362,742 feet, or 68.70 miles (105.64\u00a0km). Weakened by malaria, Burrow died at Buxar in India on 7 June 1792. His wife, with his son and his three daughters who had joined him in India in 1790 returned after his death. His son died as an officer in the service of the East India Company. A Short Account of the late Mr. Burrow's Measurement of a Degree of Longitude and another of Latitude near the tropic in Bengal was published posthumously by his friend Isaac Dalby in 1796.[5] Burrow wrote crude poems and a few written pseudonymously lampooned Maskelyne and nearly all his mathematical peers other than William Emerson who had taught him briefly.[3] He earned a reputation for drinking, pugilism and came to be characterized by a contemporary as \"an able mathematician but a most vulgar and scurrilous dog.\"[4][6]/nMost of Burrow's writings were in the Asiatick Researchers.

Leibniz has been called the \"last universal genius\" due to his knowledge and skills in different fields and because such people became less common during the Industrial Revolution and spread of specialized labor after his lifetime.[15] He is a prominent figure in both the history of philosophy and the history of mathematics. He wrote works on philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, law, history, philology, games, music, and other studies. Leibniz also made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, biology, medicine, geology, psychology, linguistics and computer science. In addition, he contributed to the field of library science by devising a cataloguing system whilst working at Wolfenb\u00fcttel library in Germany that would have served as a guide for many of Europe's largest libraries.[16] Leibniz's contributions to a wide range of subjects were scattered in various learned journals, in tens of thousands of letters and in unpublished manuscripts. He wrote in several languages, primarily in Latin, French and German.[17][b]/nAs a philosopher, he was a leading representative of 17th-century rationalism and idealism. As a mathematician, his major achievement was the development of the main ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments.[19] Mathematicians have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional and more exact expression of calculus.[20][21][22]/nIn the 20th century, Leibniz's notions of the law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found a consistent mathematical formulation by means of non-standard analysis. He was also a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685[23] and invented the Leibniz wheel, later used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator./nIn philosophy and theology, Leibniz is most noted for his optimism, i.e. his conclusion that our world is, in a qualified sense, the best possible world that God could have created, a view sometimes lampooned by other thinkers, such as Voltaire in his satirical novella Candide. Leibniz, along with Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three influential early modern rationalists. His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and still influences contemporary analytic philosophy, such as its adopted use of the term \"possible world\" to define modal notions./nGottfried Leibniz was born on July 1 [OS: June 21], 1646, in Leipzig, Saxony, to Friedrich Leibniz and Catharina Schmuck.[24]\nHe was baptized two days later at St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig; his godfather was the Lutheran theologian Martin Geier\u00a0[de].[25] His father died when he was six years old, and from that point on, Leibniz was raised by his mother.[26]/nLeibniz's father had been a Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Leipzig, where he also served as dean of philosophy. The boy inherited his father's personal library. He was given free access to it from the age of seven. While Leibniz's schoolwork was largely confined to the study of a small canon of authorities, his father's library enabled him to study a wide variety of advanced philosophical and theological works\u2014ones that he would not have otherwise been able to read until his college years.[27] Access to his father's library, largely written in Latin, also led to his proficiency in the Latin language, which he achieved by the age of 12. At the age of 13 he composed 300 hexameters of Latin verse in a single morning for a special event at school.[28]/nIn April 1661 he enrolled in his father's former university at age 14.[29][8][30] There he was guided, among others, by Jakob Thomasius, previously a student of Friedrich. Leibniz completed his bachelor's degree in Philosophy in December 1662. He defended his Disputatio Metaphysica de Principio Individui (Metaphysical Disputation on the Principle of Individuation),[31] which addressed the principle of individuation, on 9 June 1663 [O.S. 30 May], presenting an early version of monadic substance theory. Leibniz earned his master's degree in Philosophy on 7 February 1664. In December 1664 he published and defended a dissertation Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum (An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right),[31] arguing for both a theoretical and a pedagogical relationship between philosophy and law. After one year of legal studies, he was awarded his bachelor's degree in Law on 28 September 1665.[32] His dissertation was titled De conditionibus (On Conditions).[31]/nIn early 1666, at age 19, Leibniz wrote his first book, De Arte Combinatoria (On the Combinatorial Art), the first part of which was also his habilitation thesis in Philosophy, which he defended in March 1666.[31][33] De Arte Combinatoria was inspired by Ramon Llull's Ars Magna and contained a proof of the existence of God, cast in geometrical form, and based on the argument from motion./nHis next goal was to earn his license and Doctorate in Law, which normally required three years of study. In 1666, the University of Leipzig turned down Leibniz's doctoral application and refused to grant him a Doctorate in Law, most likely due to his relative youth.[34][35] Leibniz subsequently left Leipzig.[36]/nLeibniz then enrolled in the University of Altdorf and quickly submitted a thesis, which he had probably been working on earlier in Leipzig.[37] The title of his thesis was Disputatio Inauguralis de Casibus Perplexis in Jure (Inaugural Disputation on Ambiguous Legal Cases).[31] Leibniz earned his license to practice law and his Doctorate in Law in November 1666. He next declined the offer of an academic appointment at Altdorf, saying that \"my thoughts were turned in an entirely different direction\".[38]/nAs an adult, Leibniz often introduced himself as \"Gottfried von Leibniz\". Many posthumously published editions of his writings presented his name on the title page as \"Freiherr G. W. von Leibniz.\" However, no document has ever been found from any contemporary government that stated his appointment to any form of nobility.[39]/nLeibniz's first position was as a salaried secretary to an alchemical society in Nuremberg.[40] He knew fairly little about the subject at that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met Johann Christian von Boyneburg (1622\u20131672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of Mainz, Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn.[41] Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector in the hope of obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate.[42] In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.[43]/nVon Boyneburg did much to promote Leibniz's reputation, and the latter's memoranda and letters began to attract favorable notice. After Leibniz's service to the Elector there soon followed a diplomatic role. He published an essay, under the pseudonym of a fictitious Polish nobleman, arguing (unsuccessfully) for the German candidate for the Polish crown. The main force in European geopolitics during Leibniz's adult life was the ambition of Louis XIV of France, backed by French military and economic might. Meanwhile, the Thirty Years' War had left German-speaking Europe exhausted, fragmented, and economically backward. Leibniz proposed to protect German-speaking Europe by distracting Louis as follows: France would be invited to take Egypt as a stepping stone towards an eventual conquest of the Dutch East Indies. In return, France would agree to leave Germany and the Netherlands undisturbed. This plan obtained the Elector's cautious support. In 1672, the French government invited Leibniz to Paris for discussion,[44] but the plan was soon overtaken by the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War and became irrelevant. Napoleon's failed invasion of Egypt in 1798 can be seen as an unwitting, late implementation of Leibniz's plan, after the Eastern hemisphere colonial supremacy in Europe had already passed from the Dutch to the British./nThus Leibniz went to Paris in 1672. Soon after arriving, he met Dutch physicist and mathematician Christiaan Huygens and realised that his own knowledge of mathematics and physics was patchy. With Huygens as his mentor, he began a program of self-study that soon pushed him to making major contributions to both subjects, including discovering his version of the differential and integral calculus. He met Nicolas Malebranche and Antoine Arnauld, the leading French philosophers of the day, and studied the writings of Descartes and Pascal, unpublished as well as published.[45] He befriended a German mathematician, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus; they corresponded for the rest of their lives./nWhen it became clear that France would not implement its part of Leibniz's Egyptian plan, the Elector sent his nephew, escorted by Leibniz, on a related mission to the English government in London, early in 1673.[46] There Leibniz came into acquaintance of Henry Oldenburg and John Collins. He met with the Royal Society where he demonstrated a calculating machine that he had designed and had been building since 1670. The machine was able to execute all four basic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing), and the society quickly made him an external member./nThe mission ended abruptly when news of the Elector's death (12 February 1673) reached them. Leibniz promptly returned to Paris and not, as had been planned, to Mainz.[47] The sudden deaths of his two patrons in the same winter meant that Leibniz had to find a new basis for his career./nIn this regard, a 1669 invitation from Duke John Frederick of Brunswick to visit Hanover proved to have been fateful. Leibniz had declined the invitation, but had begun corresponding with the duke in 1671. In 1673, the duke offered Leibniz the post of counsellor. Leibniz very reluctantly accepted the position two years later, only after it became clear that no employment was forthcoming in Paris, whose intellectual stimulation he relished, or with the Habsburg imperial court.[48]/nIn 1675 he tried to get admitted to the French Academy of Sciences as a foreign honorary member, but it was considered that there were already enough foreigners there and so no invitation came. He left Paris in October 1676./nLeibniz managed to delay his arrival in Hanover until the end of 1676 after making one more short journey to London, where Newton accused him of having seen his unpublished work on calculus in advance.[49] This was alleged to be evidence supporting the accusation, made decades later, that he had stolen calculus from Newton. On the journey from London to Hanover, Leibniz stopped in The Hague where he met van Leeuwenhoek, the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with Spinoza, who had just completed his masterwork, the Ethics.[50]/nIn 1677, he was promoted, at his request, to Privy Counselor of Justice, a post he held for the rest of his life. Leibniz served three consecutive rulers of the House of Brunswick as historian, political adviser, and most consequentially, as librarian of the ducal library. He thenceforth employed his pen on all the various political, historical, and theological matters involving the House of Brunswick; the resulting documents form a valuable part of the historical record for the period./nLeibniz began promoting a project to use windmills to improve the mining operations in the Harz Mountains. This project did little to improve mining operations and was shut down by Duke Ernst August in 1685.[48]/nAmong the few people in north Germany to accept Leibniz were the Electress Sophia of Hanover (1630\u20131714), her daughter Sophia Charlotte of Hanover (1668\u20131705), the Queen of Prussia and his avowed disciple, and Caroline of Ansbach, the consort of her grandson, the future George II. To each of these women he was correspondent, adviser, and friend. In turn, they all approved of Leibniz more than did their spouses and the future king George I of Great Britain.[51]/nThe population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of Brunswick was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it. In 1692, the Duke of Brunswick became a hereditary Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. The British Act of Settlement 1701 designated the Electress Sophia and her descent as the royal family of England, once both King William III and his sister-in-law and successor, Queen Anne, were dead. Leibniz played a role in the initiatives and negotiations leading up to that Act, but not always an effective one. For example, something he published anonymously in England, thinking to promote the Brunswick cause, was formally censured by the British Parliament./nThe Brunswicks tolerated the enormous effort Leibniz devoted to intellectual pursuits unrelated to his duties as a courtier, pursuits such as perfecting calculus, writing about other mathematics, logic, physics, and philosophy, and keeping up a vast correspondence. He began working on calculus in 1674; the earliest evidence of its use in his surviving notebooks is 1675. By 1677 he had a coherent system in hand, but did not publish it until 1684. Leibniz's most important mathematical papers were published between 1682 and 1692, usually in a journal which he and Otto Mencke founded in 1682, the Acta Eruditorum. That journal played a key role in advancing his mathematical and scientific reputation, which in turn enhanced his eminence in diplomacy, history, theology, and philosophy./nThe Elector Ernest Augustus commissioned Leibniz to write a history of the House of Brunswick, going back to the time of Charlemagne or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been quite happy with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a genealogy with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes./nLeibniz was appointed Librarian of the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Lower Saxony, in 1691./nIn 1708, John Keill, writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus.[52] Thus began the calculus priority dispute which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life. A formal investigation by the Royal Society (in which Newton was an unacknowledged participant), undertaken in response to Leibniz's demand for a retraction, upheld Keill's charge. Historians of mathematics writing since 1900 or so have tended to acquit Leibniz, pointing to important differences between Leibniz's and Newton's versions of calculus./nIn 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz, who then took some interest in Russian matters for the rest of his life. In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in Vienna, where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the Habsburgs. On the death of Queen Anne in 1714, Elector George Louis became King George I of Great Britain, under the terms of the 1701 Act of Settlement. Even though Leibniz had done much to bring about this happy event, it was not to be his hour of glory. Despite the intercession of the Princess of Wales, Caroline of Ansbach, George I forbade Leibniz to join him in London until he completed at least one volume of the history of the Brunswick family his father had commissioned nearly 30 years earlier. Moreover, for George I to include Leibniz in his London court would have been deemed insulting to Newton, who was seen as having won the calculus priority dispute and whose standing in British official circles could not have been higher. Finally, his dear friend and defender, the Dowager Electress Sophia, died in 1714./nLeibniz died in Hanover in 1716. At the time, he was so out of favor that neither George I (who happened to be near Hanover at that time) nor any fellow courtier other than his personal secretary attended the funeral. Even though Leibniz was a life member of the Royal Society and the Berlin Academy of Sciences, neither organization saw fit to honor his death. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years. He was, however, eulogized by Fontenelle, before the French Academy of Sciences in Paris, which had admitted him as a foreign member in 1700. The eulogy was composed at the behest of the Duchess of Orleans, a niece of the Electress Sophia./nLeibniz never married. He proposed to an unknown woman at age 50, but changed his mind when she took too long to decide.[53] He complained on occasion about money, but the fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had, by and large, paid him well. In his diplomatic endeavors, he at times verged on the unscrupulous, as was all too often the case with professional diplomats of his day. On several occasions, Leibniz backdated and altered personal manuscripts, actions which put him in a bad light during the calculus controversy.[54]/nHe was charming, well-mannered, and not without humor and imagination.[55] He had many friends and admirers all over Europe. He was identified as a Protestant and a philosophical theist.[56][57][58][59] Leibniz remained committed to Trinitarian Christianity throughout his life.[60]/nLeibniz's philosophical thinking appears fragmented, because his philosophical writings consist mainly of a multitude of short pieces: journal articles, manuscripts published long after his death, and many letters to many correspondents. He wrote only two book-length philosophical treatises, of which only the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e of 1710 was published in his lifetime./nLeibniz dated his beginning as a philosopher to his Discourse on Metaphysics, which he composed in 1686 as a commentary on a running dispute between Nicolas Malebranche and Antoine Arnauld. This led to an extensive and valuable correspondence with Arnauld;[61] it and the Discourse were not published until the 19th century. In 1695, Leibniz made his public entr\u00e9e into European philosophy with a journal article titled \"New System of the Nature and Communication of Substances\".[62] Between 1695 and 1705, he composed his New Essays on Human Understanding, a lengthy commentary on John Locke's 1690 An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, but upon learning of Locke's 1704 death, lost the desire to publish it, so that the New Essays were not published until 1765. The Monadologie, composed in 1714 and published posthumously, consists of 90 aphorisms./nLeibniz also wrote a short paper, \"Primae veritates\" (\"First Truths\"), first published by Louis Couturat in 1903 (pp.\u00a0518\u2013523)[63] summarizing his views on metaphysics. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677\u201390.[64] Couturat's reading of this paper was the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688\u2014a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible\u2014Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out./nLeibniz met Spinoza in 1676, read some of his unpublished writings, and had since been influenced by some of Spinoza's ideas. While Leibniz befriended him and admired Spinoza's powerful intellect, he was also forthrightly dismayed by Spinoza's conclusions,[65] especially when these were inconsistent with Christian orthodoxy./nUnlike Descartes and Spinoza, Leibniz had a thorough university education in philosophy. He was influenced by his Leipzig professor Jakob Thomasius, who also supervised his BA thesis in philosophy.[9] Leibniz also eagerly read Francisco Su\u00e1rez, a Spanish Jesuit respected even in Lutheran universities. Leibniz was deeply interested in the new methods and conclusions of Descartes, Huygens, Newton, and Boyle, but viewed their work through a lens heavily tinted by scholastic notions. Yet it remains the case that Leibniz's methods and concerns often anticipate the logic, and analytic and linguistic philosophy of the 20th century./nLeibniz variously invoked one or another of seven fundamental philosophical Principles:[66]/nLeibniz would on occasion give a rational defense of a specific principle, but more often took them for granted.[72]/nLeibniz's best known contribution to metaphysics is his theory of monads, as exposited in Monadologie. He proposes his theory that the universe is made of an infinite number of simple substances known as monads.[73] Monads can also be compared to the corpuscles of the mechanical philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and others. These simple substances or monads are the \"ultimate units of existence in nature\". Monads have no parts but still exist by the qualities that they have. These qualities are continuously changing over time, and each monad is unique. They are also not affected by time and are subject to only creation and annihilation.[74] Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal. It is said that he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time, and motion are completely relative as he quipped,[75] \"As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.\"[76] Einstein, who called himself a \"Leibnizian\" even wrote in the introduction to Max Jammer's book Concepts of Space that Leibnizianism was superior to Newtonianism, and his ideas would have dominated over Newton's had it not been for the poor technological tools of the time; it has been argued that Leibniz paved the way for Einstein's theory of relativity.[77]/nLeibniz's proof of God can be summarized in the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e.[78] Reason is governed by the principle of contradiction and the principle of sufficient reason. Using the principle of reasoning, Leibniz concluded that the first reason of all things is God.[78] All that we see and experience is subject to change, and the fact that this world is contingent can be explained by the possibility of the world being arranged differently in space and time. The contingent world must have some necessary reason for its existence. Leibniz uses a geometry book as an example to explain his reasoning. If this book was copied from an infinite chain of copies, there must be some reason for the content of the book.[79] Leibniz concluded that there must be the \"monas monadum\" or God./nThe ontological essence of a monad is its irreducible simplicity. Unlike atoms, monads possess no material or spatial character. They also differ from atoms by their complete mutual independence, so that interactions among monads are only apparent. Instead, by virtue of the principle of pre-established harmony, each monad follows a pre-programmed set of \"instructions\" peculiar to itself, so that a monad \"knows\" what to do at each moment. By virtue of these intrinsic instructions, each monad is like a little mirror of the universe. Monads need not be \"small\"; e.g., each human being constitutes a monad, in which case free will is problematic./nMonads are purported to have gotten rid of the problematic:/nThe Theodicy[80] tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.[81]/nLeibniz asserted that the truths of theology (religion) and philosophy cannot contradict each other, since reason and faith are both \"gifts of God\" so that their conflict would imply God contending against himself. The Theodicy is Leibniz's attempt to reconcile his personal philosophical system with his interpretation of the tenets of Christianity.[82] This project was motivated in part by Leibniz's belief, shared by many philosophers and theologians during the Enlightenment, in the rational and enlightened nature of the Christian religion. It was also shaped by Leibniz's belief in the perfectibility of human nature (if humanity relied on correct philosophy and religion as a guide), and by his belief that metaphysical necessity must have a rational or logical foundation, even if this metaphysical causality seemed inexplicable in terms of physical necessity (the natural laws identified by science)./nBecause reason and faith must be entirely reconciled, any tenet of faith which could not be defended by reason must be rejected. Leibniz then approached one of the central criticisms of Christian theism:[83] if God is all good, all wise, and all powerful, then how did evil come into the world? The answer (according to Leibniz) is that, while God is indeed unlimited in wisdom and power, his human creations, as creations, are limited both in their wisdom and in their will (power to act). This predisposes humans to false beliefs, wrong decisions, and ineffective actions in the exercise of their free will. God does not arbitrarily inflict pain and suffering on humans; rather he permits both moral evil (sin) and physical evil (pain and suffering) as the necessary consequences of metaphysical evil (imperfection), as a means by which humans can identify and correct their erroneous decisions, and as a contrast to true good.[84]/nFurther, although human actions flow from prior causes that ultimately arise in God and therefore are known to God as metaphysical certainties, an individual's free will is exercised within natural laws, where choices are merely contingently necessary and to be decided in the event by a \"wonderful spontaneity\" that provides individuals with an escape from rigorous predestination./nFor Leibniz, \"God is an absolutely perfect being\". He describes this perfection later in section VI as the simplest form of something with the most substantial outcome (VI). Along these lines, he declares that every type of perfection \"pertains to him (God) in the highest degree\" (I). Even though his types of perfections are not specifically drawn out, Leibniz highlights the one thing that, to him, does certify imperfections and proves that God is perfect: \"that one acts imperfectly if he acts with less perfection than he is capable of\", and since God is a perfect being, he cannot act imperfectly (III). Because God cannot act imperfectly, the decisions he makes pertaining to the world must be perfect. Leibniz also comforts readers, stating that because he has done everything to the most perfect degree; those who love him cannot be injured. However, to love God is a subject of difficulty as Leibniz believes that we are \"not disposed to wish for that which God desires\" because we have the ability to alter our disposition (IV). In accordance with this, many act as rebels, but Leibniz says that the only way we can truly love God is by being content \"with all that comes to us according to his will\" (IV)./nBecause God is \"an absolutely perfect being\" (I), Leibniz argues that God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection than what he is able of (III). His syllogism then ends with the statement that God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also affects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God's will, we have to understand that God \"is the best of all masters\" and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will\u2014or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.[85]/nLeibniz wrote: \"Why is there something rather than nothing? The sufficient reason ... is found in a substance which ... is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself.\"[86] Martin Heidegger called this question \"the fundamental question of metaphysics\".[87][88]/nLeibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations of a sort, and that such calculations could resolve many differences of opinion:/nThe only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right.[89][90][91]/nLeibniz's calculus ratiocinator, which resembles symbolic logic, can be viewed as a way of making such calculations feasible. Leibniz wrote memoranda[92] that can now be read as groping attempts to get symbolic logic\u2014and thus his calculus\u2014off the ground. These writings remained unpublished until the appearance of a selection edited by Carl Immanuel Gerhardt (1859). Louis Couturat published a selection in 1901; by this time the main developments of modern logic had been created by Charles Sanders Peirce and by Gottlob Frege./nLeibniz thought symbols were important for human understanding. He attached so much importance to the development of good notations that he attributed all his discoveries in mathematics to this. His notation for calculus is an example of his skill in this regard. Leibniz's passion for symbols and notation, as well as his belief that these are essential to a well-running logic and mathematics, made him a precursor of semiotics.[93]/nBut Leibniz took his speculations much further. Defining a character as any written sign, he then defined a \"real\" character as one that represents an idea directly and not simply as the word embodying the idea. Some real characters, such as the notation of logic, serve only to facilitate reasoning. Many characters well known in his day, including Egyptian hieroglyphics, Chinese characters, and the symbols of astronomy and chemistry, he deemed not real.[94] Instead, he proposed the creation of a characteristica universalis or \"universal characteristic\", built on an alphabet of human thought in which each fundamental concept would be represented by a unique \"real\" character:/nIt is obvious that if we could find characters or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, we could do in all matters insofar as they are subject to reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.[95]/nComplex thoughts would be represented by combining characters for simpler thoughts. Leibniz saw that the uniqueness of prime factorization suggests a central role for prime numbers in the universal characteristic, a striking anticipation of G\u00f6del numbering. Granted, there is no intuitive or mnemonic way to number any set of elementary concepts using the prime numbers./nBecause Leibniz was a mathematical novice when he first wrote about the characteristic, at first he did not conceive it as an algebra but rather as a universal language or script. Only in 1676 did he conceive of a kind of \"algebra of thought\", modeled on and including conventional algebra and its notation. The resulting characteristic included a logical calculus, some combinatorics, algebra, his analysis situs (geometry of situation), a universal concept language, and more. What Leibniz actually intended by his characteristica universalis and calculus ratiocinator, and the extent to which modern formal logic does justice to calculus, may never be established.[96] Leibniz's idea of reasoning through a universal language of symbols and calculations remarkably foreshadows great 20th-century developments in formal systems, such as Turing completeness, where computation was used to define equivalent universal languages (see Turing degree)./nLeibniz has been noted as one of the most important logicians between the times of Aristotle and Gottlob Frege.[97] Leibniz enunciated the principal properties of what we now call conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, set inclusion, and the empty set. The principles of Leibniz's logic and, arguably, of his whole philosophy, reduce to two:/nThe formal logic that emerged early in the 20th century also requires, at minimum, unary negation and quantified variables ranging over some universe of discourse./nLeibniz published nothing on formal logic in his lifetime; most of what he wrote on the subject consists of working drafts. In his History of Western Philosophy, Bertrand Russell went so far as to claim that Leibniz had developed logic in his unpublished writings to a level which was reached only 200 years later./nRussell's principal work on Leibniz found that many of Leibniz's most startling philosophical ideas and claims (e.g., that each of the fundamental monads mirrors the whole universe) follow logically from Leibniz's conscious choice to reject relations between things as unreal. He regarded such relations as (real) qualities of things (Leibniz admitted unary predicates only): For him, \"Mary is the mother of John\" describes separate qualities of Mary and of John. This view contrasts with the relational logic of De Morgan, Peirce, Schr\u00f6der and Russell himself, now standard in predicate logic. Notably, Leibniz also declared space and time to be inherently relational.[98]/nLeibniz's 1690 discovery of his algebra of concepts[99][100] (deductively equivalent to the Boolean algebra)[101] and the associated metaphysics, are of interest in present-day computational metaphysics.[102]/nAlthough the mathematical notion of function was implicit in trigonometric and logarithmic tables, which existed in his day, Leibniz was the first, in 1692 and 1694, to employ it explicitly, to denote any of several geometric concepts derived from a curve, such as abscissa, ordinate, tangent, chord, and the perpendicular (see History of the function concept).[103] In the 18th century, \"function\" lost these geometrical associations. Leibniz also believed that the sum of an infinite number of zeros would be equal to one half using the analogy of the creation of the world from nothing.[104] Leibniz was also one of the pioneers in actuarial science, calculating the purchase price of life annuities and the liquidation of a state's debt.[105]/nLeibniz's research into formal logic, also relevant to mathematics, is discussed in the preceding section. The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).[106]/nLeibniz, who invented one of the earliest mechanical calculators, said of calculation: \"For it is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\"[107]/nLeibniz arranged the coefficients of a system of linear equations into an array, now called a matrix, in order to find a solution to the system if it existed.[108] This method was later called Gaussian elimination. Leibniz laid down the foundations and theory of determinants, although the Japanese mathematician Seki Takakazu also discovered determinants independently of Leibniz.[109][110] His works show calculating the determinants using cofactors.[111] Calculating the determinant using cofactors is named the Leibniz formula. Finding the determinant of a matrix using this method proves impractical with large n, requiring to calculate n! products and the number of n-permutations.[112] He also solved systems of linear equations using determinants, which is now called Cramer's rule. This method for solving systems of linear equations based on determinants was found in 1684 by Leibniz (Cramer published his findings in 1750).[110] Although Gaussian elimination requires \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\nn\n\n3\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(n^{3})}\n\n arithmetic operations, linear algebra textbooks still teach cofactor expansion before LU factorization.[113][114]/nThe Leibniz formula for \u03c0 states that/nLeibniz wrote that circles \"can most simply be expressed by this series, that is, the aggregate of fractions alternately added and subtracted\".[115] However this formula is only accurate with a large number of terms, using 10,000,000 terms to obtain the correct value of \u03c0/4 to 8 decimal places.[116] Leibniz attempted to create a definition for a straight line while attempting to prove the parallel postulate.[117] While most mathematicians defined a straight line as the shortest line between two points, Leibniz believed that this was merely a property of a straight line rather than the definition.[118]/nLeibniz is credited, along with Isaac Newton, with the discovery of calculus (differential and integral calculus). According to Leibniz's notebooks, a critical breakthrough occurred on 11 November 1675, when he employed integral calculus for the first time to find the area under the graph of a function y = f(x).[119] He introduced several notations used to this day, for instance the integral sign \u222b (\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\int f(x)\\,dx}\n\n), representing an elongated S, from the Latin word summa, and the d used for differentials (\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\ny\n\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}}\n\n), from the Latin word differentia. Leibniz did not publish anything about his calculus until 1684.[120] Leibniz expressed the inverse relation of integration and differentiation, later called the fundamental theorem of calculus, by means of a figure[121] in his 1693 paper Supplementum geometriae dimensoriae....[122] However, James Gregory is credited for the theorem's discovery in geometric form, Isaac Barrow proved a more generalized geometric version, and Newton developed supporting theory. The concept became more transparent as developed through Leibniz's formalism and new notation.[123] The product rule of differential calculus is still called \"Leibniz's law\". In addition, the theorem that tells how and when to differentiate under the integral sign is called the Leibniz integral rule./nLeibniz exploited infinitesimals in developing calculus, manipulating them in ways suggesting that they had paradoxical algebraic properties. George Berkeley, in a tract called The Analyst and also in De Motu, criticized these. A recent study argues that Leibnizian calculus was free of contradictions, and was better grounded than Berkeley's empiricist criticisms.[124]/nFrom 1711 until his death, Leibniz was engaged in a dispute with John Keill, Newton and others, over whether Leibniz had invented calculus independently of Newton./nThe use of infinitesimals in mathematics was frowned upon by followers of Karl Weierstrass,[125][126] but survived in science and engineering, and even in rigorous mathematics, via the fundamental computational device known as the differential. Beginning in 1960, Abraham Robinson worked out a rigorous foundation for Leibniz's infinitesimals, using model theory, in the context of a field of hyperreal numbers. The resulting non-standard analysis can be seen as a belated vindication of Leibniz's mathematical reasoning. Robinson's transfer principle is a mathematical implementation of Leibniz's heuristic law of continuity, while the standard part function implements the Leibnizian transcendental law of homogeneity./nLeibniz was the first to use the term analysis situs,[127] later used in the 19th century to refer to what is now known as topology. There are two takes on this situation. On the one hand, Mates, citing a 1954 paper in German by Jacob Freudenthal, argues:/nAlthough for Leibniz the situs of a sequence of points is completely determined by the distance between them and is altered if those distances are altered, his admirer Euler, in the famous 1736 paper solving the K\u00f6nigsberg Bridge Problem and its generalizations, used the term geometria situs in such a sense that the situs remains unchanged under topological deformations. He mistakenly credits Leibniz with originating this concept. ... [It] is sometimes not realized that Leibniz used the term in an entirely different sense and hence can hardly be considered the founder of that part of mathematics.[128]/nBut Hideaki Hirano argues differently, quoting Mandelbrot:[129]/nTo sample Leibniz' scientific works is a sobering experience. Next to calculus, and to other thoughts that have been carried out to completion, the number and variety of premonitory thrusts is overwhelming. We saw examples in \"packing\",\u00a0... My Leibniz mania is further reinforced by finding that for one moment its hero attached importance to geometric scaling. In Euclidis Prota\u00a0..., which is an attempt to tighten Euclid's axioms, he states\u00a0...: \"I have diverse definitions for the straight line. The straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole, and it alone has this property, not only among curves but among sets.\" This claim can be proved today.[130]/nThus the fractal geometry promoted by Mandelbrot drew on Leibniz's notions of self-similarity and the principle of continuity: Natura non facit saltus.[69] We also see that when Leibniz wrote, in a metaphysical vein, that \"the straight line is a curve, any part of which is similar to the whole\", he was anticipating topology by more than two centuries. As for \"packing\", Leibniz told his friend and correspondent Des Bosses to imagine a circle, then to inscribe within it three congruent circles with maximum radius; the latter smaller circles could be filled with three even smaller circles by the same procedure. This process can be continued infinitely, from which arises a good idea of self-similarity. Leibniz's improvement of Euclid's axiom contains the same concept./nLeibniz's writings are currently discussed, not only for their anticipations and possible discoveries not yet recognized, but as ways of advancing present knowledge. Much of his writing on physics is included in Gerhardt's Mathematical Writings./nLeibniz contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with Descartes and Newton. He devised a new theory of motion (dynamics) based on kinetic energy and potential energy, which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his Specimen Dynamicum of 1695.[131]/nUntil the discovery of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time and motion are relative, not absolute: \"As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.\"[76]/nLeibniz held a relationist notion of space and time, against Newton's substantivalist views.[132][133][134] According to Newton's substantivalism, space and time are entities in their own right, existing independently of things. Leibniz's relationism, in contrast, describes space and time as systems of relations that exist between objects. The rise of general relativity and subsequent work in the history of physics has put Leibniz's stance in a more favorable light./nOne of Leibniz's projects was to recast Newton's theory as a vortex theory.[135] However, his project went beyond vortex theory, since at its heart there was an attempt to explain one of the most difficult problems in physics, that of the origin of the cohesion of matter.[135]/nThe principle of sufficient reason has been invoked in recent cosmology, and his identity of indiscernibles in quantum mechanics, a field some even credit him with having anticipated in some sense. In addition to his theories about the nature of reality, Leibniz's contributions to the development of calculus have also had a major impact on physics./nLeibniz's vis viva (Latin for \"living force\") is mv2, twice the modern kinetic energy. He realized that the total energy would be conserved in certain mechanical systems, so he considered it an innate motive characteristic of matter.[136] Here too his thinking gave rise to another regrettable nationalistic dispute. His vis viva was seen as rivaling the conservation of momentum championed by Newton in England and by Descartes and Voltaire in France; hence academics in those countries tended to neglect Leibniz's idea. Leibniz knew of the validity of conservation of momentum. In reality, both energy and momentum are conserved (in closed systems), so both approaches are valid./nBy proposing that the earth has a molten core, he anticipated modern geology. In embryology, he was a preformationist, but also proposed that organisms are the outcome of a combination of an infinite number of possible microstructures and of their powers. In the life sciences and paleontology, he revealed an amazing transformist intuition, fueled by his study of comparative anatomy and fossils. One of his principal works on this subject, Protogaea, unpublished in his lifetime, has recently been published in English for the first time. He worked out a primal organismic theory.[137] In medicine, he exhorted the physicians of his time\u2014with some results\u2014to ground their theories in detailed comparative observations and verified experiments, and to distinguish firmly scientific and metaphysical points of view./nPsychology had been a central interest of Leibniz.[138][139] He appears to be an \"underappreciated pioneer of psychology\"[140] He wrote on topics which are now regarded as fields of psychology: attention and consciousness, memory, learning (association), motivation (the act of \"striving\"), emergent individuality, the general dynamics of development (evolutionary psychology). His discussions in the New Essays and Monadology often rely on everyday observations such as the behaviour of a dog or the noise of the sea, and he develops intuitive analogies (the synchronous running of clocks or the balance spring of a clock). He also devised postulates and principles that apply to psychology: the continuum of the unnoticed petites perceptions to the distinct, self-aware apperception, and psychophysical parallelism from the point of view of causality and of purpose: \"Souls act according to the laws of final causes, through aspirations, ends and means. Bodies act according to the laws of efficient causes, i.e. the laws of motion. And these two realms, that of efficient causes and that of final causes, harmonize with one another.\"[141] This idea refers to the mind-body problem, stating that the mind and brain do not act upon each other, but act alongside each other separately but in harmony.[142] Leibniz, however, did not use the term psychologia.[143]\nLeibniz's epistemological position\u2014against John Locke and English empiricism (sensualism)\u2014was made clear: \"Nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectu ipse.\" \u2013 \"Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses, except the intellect itself.\"[144] Principles that are not present in sensory impressions can be recognised in human perception and consciousness: logical inferences, categories of thought, the principle of causality and the principle of purpose (teleology)./nLeibniz found his most important interpreter in Wilhelm Wundt, founder of psychology as a discipline. Wundt used the \"\u2026 nisi intellectu ipse\" quotation 1862 on the title page of his Beitr\u00e4ge zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung (Contributions on the Theory of Sensory Perception) and published a detailed and aspiring monograph on Leibniz.[145] Wundt shaped the term apperception, introduced by Leibniz, into an experimental psychologically based apperception psychology that included neuropsychological modelling \u2013 an excellent example of how a concept created by a great philosopher could stimulate a psychological research program. One principle in the thinking of Leibniz played a fundamental role: \"the principle of equality of separate but corresponding viewpoints.\" Wundt characterized this style of thought (perspectivism) in a way that also applied for him\u2014viewpoints that \"supplement one another, while also being able to appear as opposites that only resolve themselves when considered more deeply.\"[146][147]\nMuch of Leibniz's work went on to have a great impact on the field of psychology.[148] Leibniz thought that there are many petites perceptions, or small perceptions of which we perceive but of which we are unaware. He believed that by the principle that phenomena found in nature were continuous by default, it was likely that the transition between conscious and unconscious states had intermediary steps.[149] For this to be true, there must also be a portion of the mind of which we are unaware at any given time. His theory regarding consciousness in relation to the principle of continuity can be seen as an early theory regarding the stages of sleep. In this way, Leibniz's theory of perception can be viewed as one of many theories leading up to the idea of the unconscious. Leibniz was a direct influence on Ernst Platner, who is credited with originally coining the term Unbewu\u00dftseyn (unconscious).[150] Additionally, the idea of subliminal stimuli can be traced back to his theory of small perceptions.[151] Leibniz's ideas regarding music and tonal perception went on to influence the laboratory studies of Wilhelm Wundt.[152]/nIn public health, he advocated establishing a medical administrative authority, with powers over epidemiology and veterinary medicine. He worked to set up a coherent medical training program, oriented towards public health and preventive measures. In economic policy, he proposed tax reforms and a national insurance program, and discussed the balance of trade. He even proposed something akin to what much later emerged as game theory. In sociology he laid the ground for communication theory./nIn 1906, Garland published a volume of Leibniz's writings bearing on his many practical inventions and engineering work. To date, few of these writings have been translated into English. Nevertheless, it is well understood that Leibniz was a serious inventor, engineer, and applied scientist, with great respect for practical life. Following the motto theoria cum praxi, he urged that theory be combined with practical application, and thus has been claimed as the father of applied science. He designed wind-driven propellers and water pumps, mining machines to extract ore, hydraulic presses, lamps, submarines, clocks, etc. With Denis Papin, he created a steam engine. He even proposed a method for desalinating water. From 1680 to 1685, he struggled to overcome the chronic flooding that afflicted the ducal silver mines in the Harz Mountains, but did not succeed.[153]/nLeibniz may have been the first computer scientist and information theorist.[154] Early in life, he documented the binary numeral system (base 2), then revisited that system throughout his career.[155] While Leibniz was examining other cultures to compare his metaphysical views, he encountered an ancient Chinese book I Ching. Leibniz interpreted a diagram which showed yin and yang and corresponded it to a zero and one.[156] More information can be found in the Sinophile section. Leibniz had similarities with Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz and Thomas Harriot, who independently developed the binary system, as he was familiar with their works on the binary system.[157] Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz worked extensively on logarithms including logarithms with base 2.[158] Thomas Harriot's manuscripts contained a table of binary numbers and their notation, which demonstrated that any number could be written on a base 2 system.[159] Regardless, Leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and the empty set.[160] He anticipated Lagrangian interpolation and algorithmic information theory. His calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal Turing machine. In 1961, Norbert Wiener suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics.[161] Wiener is quoted with \"Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's Calculus Ratiocinator.\"[162]/nIn 1671, Leibniz began to invent a machine that could execute all four arithmetic operations, gradually improving it over a number of years. This \"stepped reckoner\" attracted fair attention and was the basis of his election to the Royal Society in 1673. A number of such machines were made during his years in Hanover by a craftsman working under his supervision. They were not an unambiguous success because they did not fully mechanize the carry operation. Couturat reported finding an unpublished note by Leibniz, dated 1674, describing a machine capable of performing some algebraic operations.[163] Leibniz also devised a (now reproduced) cipher machine, recovered by Nicholas Rescher in 2010.[164] In 1693, Leibniz described a design of a machine which could, in theory, integrate differential equations, which he called \"integraph\".[165]/nLeibniz was groping towards hardware and software concepts worked out much later by Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. In 1679, while mulling over his binary arithmetic, Leibniz imagined a machine in which binary numbers were represented by marbles, governed by a rudimentary sort of punched cards.[166][167] Modern electronic digital computers replace Leibniz's marbles moving by gravity with shift registers, voltage gradients, and pulses of electrons, but otherwise they run roughly as Leibniz envisioned in 1679./nLater in Leibniz's career (after the death of von Boyneburg), Leibniz moved to Paris and accepted a position as a librarian in the Hanoverian court of Johann Friedrich, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg.[168] Leibniz's predecessor, Tobias Fleischer, had already created a cataloging system for the Duke's library but it was a clumsy attempt. At this library, Leibniz focused more on advancing the library than on the cataloging. For instance, within a month of taking the new position, he developed a comprehensive plan to expand the library. He was one of the first to consider developing a core collection for a library and felt \"that a library for display and ostentation is a luxury and indeed superfluous, but a well-stocked and organized library is important and useful for all areas of human endeavor and is to be regarded on the same level as schools and churches\".[169] Leibniz lacked the funds to develop the library in this manner. After working at this library, by the end of 1690 Leibniz was appointed as privy-councilor and librarian of the Bibliotheca Augusta at Wolfenb\u00fcttel. It was an extensive library with at least 25,946 printed volumes.[169] At this library, Leibniz sought to improve the catalog. He was not allowed to make complete changes to the existing closed catalog, but was allowed to improve upon it so he started on that task immediately. He created an alphabetical author catalog and had also created other cataloging methods that were not implemented. While serving as librarian of the ducal libraries in Hanover and Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Leibniz effectively became one of the founders of library science. Seemingly, Leibniz paid a good deal of attention to the classification of subject matter, favoring a well-balance library covering a host of numerous subjects and interests.[170] Leibniz, for example, proposed the following classification system in the Otivm Hanoveranvm Sive Miscellanea (1737).[170][171]/nLeibniz's Idea of Arranging a Narrower Library/nHe also designed a book indexing system in ignorance of the only other such system then extant, that of the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. He also called on publishers to distribute abstracts of all new titles they produced each year, in a standard form that would facilitate indexing. He hoped that this abstracting project would eventually include everything printed from his day back to Gutenberg. Neither proposal met with success at the time, but something like them became standard practice among English language publishers during the 20th century, under the aegis of the Library of Congress and the British Library./nHe called for the creation of an empirical database as a way to further all sciences. His characteristica universalis, calculus ratiocinator, and a \"community of minds\"\u2014intended, among other things, to bring political and religious unity to Europe\u2014can be seen as distant unwitting anticipations of artificial languages (e.g., Esperanto and its rivals), symbolic logic, even the World Wide Web./nLeibniz emphasized that research was a collaborative endeavor. Hence he warmly advocated the formation of national scientific societies along the lines of the British Royal Society and the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences. More specifically, in his correspondence and travels he urged the creation of such societies in Dresden, Saint Petersburg, Vienna, and Berlin. Only one such project came to fruition; in 1700, the Berlin Academy of Sciences was created. Leibniz drew up its first statutes, and served as its first President for the remainder of his life. That Academy evolved into the German Academy of Sciences, the publisher of the ongoing critical edition of his works.[172]/nLeibniz's writings on law, ethics, and politics[173] were long overlooked by English-speaking scholars, but this has changed of late.[174]/nWhile Leibniz was no apologist for absolute monarchy like Hobbes, or for tyranny in any form, neither did he echo the political and constitutional views of his contemporary John Locke, views invoked in support of liberalism, in 18th-century America and later elsewhere. The following excerpt from a 1695 letter to Baron J. C. Boyneburg's son Philipp is very revealing of Leibniz's political sentiments:/nAs for\u00a0... the great question of the power of sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that it would be good for princes to be persuaded that their people have the right to resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.[175]/nIn 1677, Leibniz called for a European confederation, governed by a council or senate, whose members would represent entire nations and would be free to vote their consciences;[176] this is sometimes considered an anticipation of the European Union. He believed that Europe would adopt a uniform religion. He reiterated these proposals in 1715./nBut at the same time, he arrived to propose an interreligious and multicultural project to create a universal system of justice, which required from him a broad interdisciplinary perspective. In order to propose it, he combined linguistics (especially sinology), moral and legal philosophy, management, economics, and politics.[177]/nLeibniz trained as a legal academic, but under the tutelage of Cartesian-sympathiser Erhard Weigel we already see an attempt to solve legal problems by rationalist mathematical methods (Weigel's influence being most explicit in the Specimen Quaestionum Philosophicarum ex Jure collectarum (An Essay of Collected Philosophical Problems of Right)). For example, the Inaugural Disputation on Perplexing Cases[178] uses early combinatorics to solve some legal disputes, while the 1666 Dissertation on the Combinatorial Art[179] includes simple legal problems by way of illustration./nThe use of combinatorial methods to solve legal and moral problems seems, via Athanasius Kircher and Daniel Schwenter to be of Llullist inspiration: Ram\u00f3n Llull attempted to solve ecumenical disputes through recourse to a combinatorial mode of reasoning he regarded as universal (a mathesis universalis).[180]/nIn the late 1660s the enlightened Prince-Bishop of Mainz Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn announced a review of the legal system and made available a position to support his current law commissioner. Leibniz left Franconia and made for Mainz before even winning the role. On reaching Frankfurt am Main Leibniz penned The New Method of Teaching and Learning the Law, by way of application.[181] The text proposed a reform of legal education and is characteristically syncretic, integrating aspects of Thomism, Hobbesianism, Cartesianism and traditional jurisprudence. Leibniz's argument that the function of legal teaching was not to impress rules as one might train a dog, but to aid the student in discovering their own public reason, evidently impressed von Sch\u00f6nborn as he secured the job./nLeibniz's next major attempt to find a universal rational core to law and so found a legal \"science of right\",[182] came when Leibniz worked in Mainz from 1667\u201372. Starting initially from Hobbes' mechanistic doctrine of power, Leibniz reverted to logico-combinatorial methods in an attempt to define justice.[183] As Leibniz's so-called Elementa Juris Naturalis advanced, he built in modal notions of right (possibility) and obligation (necessity) in which we see perhaps the earliest elaboration of his possible worlds doctrine within a deontic frame.[184] While ultimately the Elementa remained unpublished, Leibniz continued to work on his drafts and promote their ideas to correspondents up until his death./nLeibniz devoted considerable intellectual and diplomatic effort to what would now be called an ecumenical endeavor, seeking to reconcile the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. In this respect, he followed the example of his early patrons, Baron von Boyneburg and the Duke John Frederick\u2014both cradle Lutherans who converted to Catholicism as adults\u2014who did what they could to encourage the reunion of the two faiths, and who warmly welcomed such endeavors by others. (The House of Brunswick remained Lutheran, because the Duke's children did not follow their father.) These efforts included corresponding with French bishop Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet, and involved Leibniz in some theological controversy. He evidently thought that the thoroughgoing application of reason would suffice to heal the breach caused by the Reformation./nLeibniz the philologist was an avid student of languages, eagerly latching on to any information about vocabulary and grammar that came his way. In 1710, he applied ideas of gradualism and uniformitarianism to linguistics in a short essay.[185] He refuted the belief, widely held by Christian scholars of the time, that Hebrew was the primeval language of the human race. At the same time, he rejected the idea of unrelated language groups and considered them all to have a common source.[186] He also refuted the argument, advanced by Swedish scholars in his day, that a form of proto-Swedish was the ancestor of the Germanic languages. He puzzled over the origins of the Slavic languages and was fascinated by classical Chinese. Leibniz was also an expert in the Sanskrit language.[104]/nHe published the princeps editio (first modern edition) of the late medieval Chronicon Holtzatiae, a Latin chronicle of the County of Holstein./nLeibniz was perhaps the first major European intellectual to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. He apparently read Confucius Sinarum Philosophus in the first year of its publication.[188] He came to the conclusion that Europeans could learn much from the Confucian ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the Chinese characters were an unwitting form of his universal characteristic. He noted how the I Ching hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.[189] Leibniz communicated his ideas of the binary system representing Christianity to the Emperor of China, hoping it would convert him.[104] Leibniz was  one of the western philosophers of the time who attempted to accommodate Confucian ideas to prevailing European beliefs.[190]/nLeibniz's attraction to Chinese philosophy originates from his perception that Chinese philosophy was similar to his own.[188] The historian E.R. Hughes suggests that Leibniz's ideas of \"simple substance\" and \"pre-established harmony\" were directly influenced by Confucianism, pointing to the fact that they were conceived during the period when he was reading Confucius Sinarum Philosophus.[188]/nWhile making his grand tour of European archives to research the Brunswick family history that he never completed, Leibniz stopped in Vienna between May 1688 and February 1689, where he did much legal and diplomatic work for the Brunswicks. He visited mines, talked with mine engineers, and tried to negotiate export contracts for lead from the ducal mines in the Harz mountains. His proposal that the streets of Vienna be lit with lamps burning rapeseed oil was implemented. During a formal audience with the Austrian Emperor and in subsequent memoranda, he advocated reorganizing the Austrian economy, reforming the coinage of much of central Europe, negotiating a Concordat between the Habsburgs and the Vatican, and creating an imperial research library, official archive, and public insurance fund. He wrote and published an important paper on mechanics./nWhen Leibniz died, his reputation was in decline. He was remembered for only one book, the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e,[191] whose supposed central argument Voltaire lampooned in his popular book Candide, which concludes with the character Candide saying, \"Non liquet\" (it is not clear), a term that was applied during the Roman Republic to a legal verdict of \"not proven\". Voltaire's depiction of Leibniz's ideas was so influential that many believed it to be an accurate description. Thus Voltaire and his Candide bear some of the blame for the lingering failure to appreciate and understand Leibniz's ideas. Leibniz had an ardent disciple, Christian Wolff, whose dogmatic and facile outlook did Leibniz's reputation much harm. He also influenced David Hume, who read his Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e and used some of his ideas.[192] In any event, philosophical fashion was moving away from the rationalism and system building of the 17th century, of which Leibniz had been such an ardent proponent. His work on law, diplomacy, and history was seen as of ephemeral interest. The vastness and richness of his correspondence went unrecognized./nLeibniz's reputation began to recover with the 1765 publication of the Nouveaux Essais. In 1768, Louis Dutens edited the first multi-volume edition of Leibniz's writings, followed in the 19th century by a number of editions, including those edited by Erdmann, Foucher de Careil, Gerhardt, Gerland, Klopp, and Mollat. Publication of Leibniz's correspondence with notables such as Antoine Arnauld, Samuel Clarke, Sophia of Hanover, and her daughter Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, began./nIn 1900, Bertrand Russell published a critical study of Leibniz's metaphysics.[193] Shortly thereafter, Louis Couturat published an important study of Leibniz, and edited a volume of Leibniz's heretofore unpublished writings, mainly on logic. They made Leibniz somewhat respectable among 20th-century analytical and linguistic philosophers in the English-speaking world (Leibniz had already been of great influence to many Germans such as Bernhard Riemann). For example, Leibniz's phrase salva veritate, meaning interchangeability without loss of or compromising the truth, recurs in Willard Quine's writings. Nevertheless, the secondary literature on Leibniz did not really blossom until after World War II. This is especially true of English speaking countries; in Gregory Brown's bibliography fewer than 30 of the English language entries were published before 1946. American Leibniz studies owe much to Leroy Loemker (1904\u20131985) through his translations and his interpretive essays in LeClerc (1973)./nNicholas Jolley has surmised that Leibniz's reputation as a philosopher is now perhaps higher than at any time since he was alive.[194] Analytic and contemporary philosophy continue to invoke his notions of identity, individuation, and possible worlds. Work in the history of 17th- and 18th-century ideas has revealed more clearly the 17th-century \"Intellectual Revolution\" that preceded the better-known Industrial and commercial revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries./nIn Germany, various important institutions were named after Leibniz. In Hanover in particular, he is the namesake for some of the most important institutions in the town:/noutside of Hanover:/nAwards:/nIn 1985, the German government created the Leibniz Prize, offering an annual award of 1.55\u00a0million euros for experimental results and 770,000 euros for theoretical ones. It was the world's largest prize for scientific achievement prior to the Fundamental Physics Prize./nThe collection of manuscript papers of Leibniz at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Bibliothek \u2013 Nieders\u00e4chische Landesbibliothek was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2007.[195]/nLeibniz still receives popular attention. The Google Doodle for 1 July 2018 celebrated Leibniz's 372nd birthday.[196][197][198] Using a quill, his hand is shown writing \"Google\" in binary ASCII code./nOne of the earliest popular but indirect expositions of Leibniz was Voltaire's satire Candide, published in 1759. Leibniz was lampooned as Professor Pangloss, described as \"the greatest philosopher of the Holy Roman Empire\"./nLeibniz also appears as one of the main historical figures in Neal Stephenson's series of novels The Baroque Cycle. Stephenson credits readings and discussions concerning Leibniz for inspiring him to write the series.[199]/nLeibniz also stars in Adam Ehrlich Sachs's novel The Organs of Sense./nThe German biscuit Choco Leibniz is named after Leibniz, a famous resident of Hanover where the manufacturer Bahlsen is based./nLeibniz mainly wrote in three languages: scholastic Latin, French and German. During his lifetime, he published many pamphlets and scholarly articles, but only two \"philosophical\" books, the Combinatorial Art and the Th\u00e9odic\u00e9e. (He published numerous pamphlets, often anonymous, on behalf of the House of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, most notably the \"De jure suprematum\" a major consideration of the nature of sovereignty.) One substantial book appeared posthumously, his Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain, which Leibniz had withheld from publication after the death of John Locke. Only in 1895, when Bodemann completed his catalogue of Leibniz's manuscripts and correspondence, did the enormous extent of Leibniz's Nachlass become clear: about 15,000 letters to more than 1000 recipients plus more than 40,000 other items. Moreover, quite a few of these letters are of essay length. Much of his vast correspondence, especially the letters dated after 1700, remains unpublished, and much of what is published has appeared only in recent decades. The more than 67,000 records of the Leibniz Edition's Catalogue cover almost all of his known writings and the letters from him and to him. The amount, variety, and disorder of Leibniz's writings are a predictable result of a situation he described in a letter as follows:/nI cannot tell you how extraordinarily distracted and spread out I am. I am trying to find various things in the archives; I look at old papers and hunt up unpublished documents. From these I hope to shed some light on the history of the [House of] Brunswick. I receive and answer a huge number of letters. At the same time, I have so many mathematical results, philosophical thoughts, and other literary innovations that should not be allowed to vanish that I often do not know where to begin.[200]/nThe extant parts of the critical edition[201] of Leibniz's writings are organized as follows:/nThe systematic cataloguing of all of Leibniz's Nachlass began in 1901. It was hampered by two world wars and then by decades of German division into two states with the Cold War's \"iron curtain\" in between, separating scholars, and also scattering portions of his literary estates. The ambitious project has had to deal with writings in seven languages, contained in some 200,000 written and printed pages. In 1985 it was reorganized and included in a joint program of German federal and state (L\u00e4nder) academies. Since then the branches in Potsdam, M\u00fcnster, Hanover and Berlin have jointly published 57 volumes of the critical edition, with an average of 870 pages, and prepared index and concordance works./nThe year given is usually that in which the work was completed, not of its eventual publication./nSix important collections of English translations are Wiener (1951), Parkinson (1966), Loemker (1969), Ariew and Garber (1989), Woolhouse and Francks (1998), and Strickland (2006).

He attended Trinity College, Cambridge and graduated Bachelor of Arts as the Senior Wrangler and first Smith's Prizeman of his year. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College, ordained as a minister, and received his Master of Arts. Lax was granted the livings of vicar of Marsworth, Buckinghamshire and of St Ippolyts near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, where he erected an observatory./nLax was best known for his Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid (1807) and his work regarding the Nautical Almanac, which was an important reference for navigation in the period. An obituary claimed that \"To whatever Professor Lax applied, he made himself completely master of it\". His daughter married Andrew Amos and through that line Lax is the grandfather of Sheldon Amos and the great grandfather of Maurice Amos, a notable legal dynasty./nLax was born in the village of Ravensworth, near Richmond in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, the son of William (1731 \u2013 19 August 1812) also born in Ravensworth, and Hannah Lax (1738 \u2013 10 June 1811).[1] He was christened on 27 October 1761 in Burneston. He was educated at the Kirby Ravensworth Free Grammar School, where he learned Latin (in which he became fluent) and Greek as well as English language, arithmetic and mathematics.[1][2] Although the school was subsidised by a charitable trust, \"Free\" in the context of the school's name meant free from all authority save for the Crown./nLax was admitted as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 at the age of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge.[3] Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges.[4] By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants.[4] They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.[4]/nLax matriculated in the Michaelmas term of 1781 and became a private tutor to John Pond, later Astronomer Royal.[5][6] Lax was elected a scholar (i.e. one on a scholarship) of Trinity in 1784; John Cranke and Henry Therond were his tutors, a role which would have seen them not only teaching Lax, but also acting in the role of in loco parentis.[7] Lax was conferred a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1785 and graduated as the Senior Wrangler and was awarded the first Smith's Prize of his year.[1] Until 1790, all examinations at Trinity were written in Latin.[8]/nIn 1785 Lax was appointed curate of Tideswell in the Peak District of Derbyshire with an annual stipend of \u00a335.[9] In 1786, as was essentially the due of Senior Wranglers, he was elected a fellow of Trinity College.[10] According to Peter Linehan, fellows at this time, \"were becoming richer, living and behaving more like gentlemen\".[3] He was ordained as a minister in 1787 at Peterborough and received his Master of Arts (M.A.) in 1788.[11] He was a moderator from 1789 to 1791 which entailed him presiding over oral examinations which were then necessary for the B.A. to be awarded. As a moderator Lax was responsible for the introduction of \"very high flown compliments, and at the same time extending the disputations to double the usual length, which was around one hour and ten minutes\" which \"sent a ripple through tradition\" according to Greg Dening.[12][13] Dening argues that this was, \"Lax's way of getting into the act and making Acts flourish\".[13] In 1791 he was appointed as a taxor by the University.[14] Lax was an assistant tutor from 1797 until 1801, but resigned when he married Margaret Cradock, as College fellows were not permitted to marry.[7][15]/nIn 1795 Lax was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry in succession to John Smith. The position was a sinecure with an annual salary initially of around \u00a3300, later rising to around \u00a3500 per annum by 1821.[16][17] Cambridge had two astronomical chairs, and the Lowndean was seen as the more theoretical and less experimental of the two. During Lax's tenure a mathematical chair was seen as \"a prize or a means of securing leisure, and at best, merely as offering a position where a man could pursue his own researches undisturbed by other duties\".[18] In 1816 Lax was described as holding the professorship with \"great reputation\".[19] The sole duty of Lax's professorship was that he was required to examine students annually for the Smith's Prize, including John Herschel, Adam Sedgwick, George Biddell Airy and William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire.[20][21]/nDuring Lax's time at Cambridge: \"the mathematicians were in the saddle, and it would be difficult to dispute the judgement that they controlled Cambridge studies almost as completely as the logicians had done in the Middle Ages.\"[22] In early nineteenth century Cambridge \"the discipline of mathematics was at the very heart\".[23] Newtonian mathematics teaching as exemplified by \"Cambridge traditionalists\" such as Lax and his generation began to wane as the Georgian era drew to a close.[24] In 1817 George Peacock successfully introduced the new French mathematics (such as Pierre-Simon Laplace and Joseph Louis Lagrange) into the Senate House Examinations. Peacock reported to Herschel, \"The introduction of d's into the papers excited much remark. Wood, Vince, Lax & Milner were very angry & threatened to protest against [the infiltration of] French mathematics.\"[25] For the traditionalists the struggle was more than one of intellectual difference as for them, \"Newton's rational mechanics, fluxions, and experimental philosophy were an excellent antidote against materialism and atheism.\"[26] However, from 1816 to 1824 Lax continued to sit on the Peacock-led board that established Cambridge Observatory.[27]/nLax did encounter some criticism during his tenure. Whilst at the university he \"never, as far as is known, delivered a single lecture\", despite his chair's bequest that the holder deliver forty lectures each year, although his predecessor had not given any lectures either.[28][29] The excuse was made that there was already an astronomical chair at Cambridge established before the Lowndean that already gave lectures.[16] By the 1820s it was no longer acceptable to consider chairs as sinecures, and Lax received criticism from a living descendant of the original benefactor, Thomas Lowndes, for being remiss in his duties.[16] His successor to the Lowndean chair George Peacock promised \"to do his duty in a less lax manner than his predecessor\", and although he struggled to get anyone to attend his lectures on pure mathematics, his lectures on practical astronomy were well attended.[24] However, Peacock's translation as Dean of Ely three years later meant that he was largely absent from his chair, which he was severely criticised for retaining.[30][31]/nLax was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales.[32] However, due to an enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked.[33] If any of them submitted papers to the Society:/nthey had the honour of having them carefully lodged in the archives of the Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.[34]/nLax delivered two papers to the Royal Society which were published in Philosophical Transactions. In 1799 he delivered A Method of finding the Latitude of a place, by Means of two Altitudes of the Sun and the Time elapsed betwixt the Observations. It was described as \"a very valuable paper\" by Abraham Rees, and apparently contained \"several valuable remarks\", but it was criticised as \"a subject of no great importance\" by the Philosophical Magazine.[35][36][37] In his 1809 work On A Method of Examining the Divisions of Astronomical Instruments Lax wrote that no instrument was to be trusted without \"previous examination\".[38] This argument had an influence on scientists such as Henry Cavendish and was described as an \"ingenious...examination\" in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia.[39][40] However the method described by Lax \"though very ingenious, requires great labour and time, and is inferior in accuracy and efficiency to that which was adopted by Mr. Troughton for tabulating the errors of the primary divisions of circular instruments.\"[37] It was also criticised for \"greatly resembl[ing]\" a method first explicated by the Duke of Chaulnes.[41] In 1807 Lax delivered Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid to the Royal Society, however it was not published in Philosophical Transactions, but was eventually published independently. In it Lax defended the Greek mathematician against a charge levied at him by Georges-Louis Le Sage in 1756. Lax's defence was applauded by the British Critic as 'perfectly sound'.[42] Lax also espoused the worth of Euclid's Elements in the work, which he considered to reflect \"the highest honour upon the human intellect\".[43]/nLax was elected to the Board of Longitude after he was nominated to the Lowndean chair in 1795, and remained on the board until it was dissolved in 1828.[44][45] The Board was a governmental body charged with administering a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea, which was vital for accurate navigation. Lax published a set of tables for use with the Nautical Almanac for finding latitude and longitude; these were published by the Board of Longitude in 1821, and whilst they were not considered to be of much practical use for seamen, they were described by The Nautical Magazine as a \"very meritorious attempt to solve the problems of nautical astronomy by one uniform system.\"[46][47] In 1821, the Board awarded Lax \u00a31050 for his tables, which were intended to replace Nevil Maskelyne's Requisite Tables.[48] However, the extraordinarily accurate chronometers of John Harrison were generally available from the 1820s onwards, rendering the lunar distance method, which Lax had used to create the tables, immaterial. Meanwhile, Edward Sabine criticised errors in Lax's work.[49]/nAs a scientific member of the Board, Lax was one of eighteen men who were, according to Edmund Dews, \"ultimately responsible for the form and contents of the Nautical Almanac. It would have been difficult in these years to select another group equally eminent in their field.\"[50] Lax was notable for his strong attendance record at the quarterly meetings, not missing a single meeting between 1822 \u2013 25, a record equalled by only three other members, although non-attendance of meetings would have resulted in his not being paid his annual salary of \u00a3100.[50] In 1828 Lax appended An easy method of correcting the lunar distance, on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth to the Nautical Almanac. After the Board was dissolved in 1828 Lax unsuccessfully attempted to convince George Biddell Airy to aid in a campaign for its restoration.[51] In 1834 a new edition of his nautical tables was published posthumously.[1] Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor later concluded that all of Lax's works were \"of value to the art of navigation\".[52]/nOn 28 February 1801 Lax was granted the livings as vicar of Marsworth, Buckinghamshire and squarson of Great Wymondley with St Ippolyts near Hitchin, Hertfordshire \"after some years of teaching work\".[53] He lived at St Ippolyts where he erected a private observatory which he had transported from Cambridge and had originally belonged to Isaac Newton.[1][54] Charles Hutton's 1815 list of England's 20 most notable private observatories (excluding the King's private observatory) included Professor Lax's.[55][56] Lax spent the last thirty years of his life occupied with \"studies and pursuits connected with the advancement of astronomy.\"[57]/nWhen he arrived at St Ippolyts Lax had trees planted in the vicarage grounds in the form of his initials \"W L\".[58] That same year he created a park opposite to the vicarage similar to The Backs of Cambridge, built a replica of Trinity College Bridge, dammed the stream and opened springs to form a lake which was used for ice skating in the winter.[58] In September 1801 he married Margaret Cradock (11 June 1776 \u2013 20 January 1854) at the church in Gilling West in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Margaret was the eldest daughter of Sheldon Cradock of Hartforth who was the lord of the manor of Lax's home village of Ravensworth.[59][60][61] Lax was a proposer of Robert Woodhouse, Henry Coddington, Herbert Marsh and John Bell for Royal Society fellowship, the latter being one of Lax's closest friends, and he was a keen supporter of George Biddell Airy throughout Airy's career.[5][62][63][64][65] Lax was a chief supporter of the Whig John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly's parliamentary bid.[66] In 1824 Lax purchased a coat of arms for himself.[67]/nHis brother Thomas Lax (1770 \u2013 1 Apr 1851) lived in Ravensworth. He was a gentleman farmer who became a record holding breeder of shorthorn cattle and at one point was credited with the best shorthorn herd in the country. He was \"unquestionably a great breeder\".[68] He also acted as Chief Constable of the wapentake of Gilling West. The Kirkby Ravensworth parish church has a memorial dedicated to Thomas Lax, as well as a memorial dedicated to the mother of the two brothers./nOn 1 December 1834, Lax reported that he had been \"of late in a very weak state of health\".[69] He died \"suddenly\" on 29 October 1836 at his home in St Ippolyts.[70] His obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine reported that \"his constitution was broken in early life [which] made his last years a period of weakness and suffering, so that his physical strength was unequal to the workings of his active mind. To whatever Professor Lax applied, he made himself completely master of it...[a] most excellent and amiable man.\"[71] He left behind a widow and two daughters, the eldest Margaret and the younger Marian or Marianne (died 21 June 1873).[72][73] In 1826 Margaret was married to Andrew Amos at St Ippolyts Church, and via that line Lax is the grandfather of Sheldon Amos and the great grandfather of Maurice Amos.[74]", "77840": "Gaspard Monge, Comte de P\u00e9luse (9 May 1746[2] \u2013 28 July 1818)[3] was a French mathematician, commonly presented as the inventor of descriptive geometry,[4][5] (the mathematical basis of) technical drawing, and the father of differential geometry.[6] During the French Revolution he served as the Minister of the Marine, and was involved in the reform of the French educational system, helping to found the \u00c9cole Polytechnique./nMonge was born at Beaune, C\u00f4te-d'Or, the son of a merchant.  He was educated at the college of the Oratorians at Beaune.[5] In 1762 he went to the Coll\u00e8ge de la Trinit\u00e9 at Lyon, where, one year after he had begun studying, he was made a teacher of  physics[5] at the age of just seventeen.[7]/nAfter finishing his education in 1764 he returned to Beaune, where he made a large-scale plan of the town, inventing the methods of observation and constructing the necessary instruments; the plan was presented to the town, and is still preserved in their library.[5] An officer of engineers who saw it wrote to the commandant of the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie at M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, recommending Monge to him and he was given a job as a draftsman.[5] L. T. C. Rolt, an engineer and historian of technology, credited Monge with the birth of engineering drawing.[8] When in the Royal School, he became a member of Freemasonry, initiated into \u2033L\u2019Union parfaite\u2033 lodge.[9]/nThose studying at the officer school were exclusively drawn from the aristocracy, so he was not allowed admission to the institution itself. His manual skill was highly regarded, but his mathematical skills were not made use of. Nevertheless, he worked on the development of his ideas in his spare time. At this time he came to contact with Charles Bossut, the professor of mathematics at the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie. \"I was a thousand times tempted,\" he said long afterwards, \"to tear up my drawings in disgust at the esteem in which they were held, as if I had been good for nothing better.\"[5]/nAfter a year at the \u00c9cole Royale, Monge was asked to produce a plan for a fortification in such a way as to optimise its defensive arrangement. There was an established method for doing this which involved lengthy calculations but Monge devised a way of solving the problems by using drawings. At first his solution was not accepted, since it had not taken the time judged to be necessary, but upon examination the value of the work was recognised,[5] and Monge's exceptional abilities were recognised./nAfter Bossut left the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie, Monge took his place in January 1769, and in 1770 he was also appointed instructor in experimental physics.[7]/nIn 1777, Monge married Cath\u00e9rine Huart, who owned a forge. This led Monge to develop an interest in metallurgy. In 1780 he became a member of the French Academy of Sciences; his friendship with chemist C. L. Berthollet began at this time.[5] In 1783, after leaving M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, he was, on the death of \u00c9. B\u00e9zout, appointed examiner of naval candidates.[5] Although pressed by the minister to prepare a complete course of mathematics, he declined to do so on the grounds that this would deprive Mme B\u00e9zout of her only income, that from the sale of the textbooks written by her late husband.[5] In 1786 he wrote and published his Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de la statique.[5]/nThe French Revolution completely changed the course of Monge's career. He was a strong supporter of the Revolution, and in 1792, on the creation by the Legislative Assembly of an executive council, Monge accepted the office of Minister of the Marine,[5] and held this office from 10 August 1792 to 10 April 1793, when he resigned.[7] When the Committee of Public Safety made an appeal to the academics to assist in the defence of the republic, he applied himself wholly to these operations, and distinguished himself by his energy, writing the Description Le l'art de Fabriquer Les canons and Avis aux ouvriers en fer sur la fabrication de l'acier.[5]/nHe took a very active part in the measures for the establishment of the Ecole Normale (which existed only during the first four months of the year 1795), and of the school for public works, afterwards the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, and was at each of them professor for descriptive geometry.[5] G\u00e9om\u00e9trie descriptive. Le\u00e7ons donn\u00e9es aux \u00e9coles normales was published in 1799 from transcriptions of his lectures given in 1795. He later published Application de l'analyse \u00e0 la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie,[5] which enlarged on the Lectures./nFrom May 1796 to October 1797 Monge was in Italy with C.L. Berthollet and some artists to select the paintings and sculptures being levied from the Italians.[5] While there he became friendly with Napoleon Bonaparte. Upon his return to France, he was appointed as the Director of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, but early in 1798 he was sent to Italy on a mission that ended in the establishment of the short-lived Roman Republic.[5]/nFrom there Monge joined Napoleon's expedition to Egypt, taking part with Berthollet[5] in the scientific work of the Institut d'\u00c9gypte and the Egyptian Institute of Sciences and Arts. They accompanied Bonaparte to Syria, and returned with him in 1798 to France.[5] Monge was appointed president of the Egyptian commission, and he resumed his connection with the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[5] His later mathematical papers are published (1794\u20131816) in the Journal and the Correspondence of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. On the formation of the S\u00e9nat conservateur he was appointed a member of that body, with an ample provision and the title of count of Pelusium[5] (Comte de P\u00e9luse), and he became the Senate conservateur's president during 1806\u20137. Then on the fall of Napoleon he had all of his honours taken away, and he was even excluded from the list of members of the reconstituted Institute.[5]/nNapoleon Bonaparte stated Monge was an atheist.[10][11] His remains were first interred in a mausoleum in Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and later transferred to the Panth\u00e9on in Paris./nA statue portraying him was erected in Beaune in 1849. Monge's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the base of the Eiffel Tower./nSince 4 November 1992 the Marine Nationale operate the MRIS Monge, named after him./nBetween 1770 and 1790 Monge contributed various papers on mathematics and physics to the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin, the M\u00e9moires des savantes \u00e9trangers of the Academy of Paris, the M\u00e9moires of the same Academy, and the Annales de chimie, including \"Sur la th\u00e9orie des d\u00e9blais et des remblais\" (M\u00e9m. de l\u2019acad. de Paris, 1781),[5] which is an elegant investigation of the problem with earthworks referred to in the title and establishes in connection with it his capital discovery of the curves of curvature of a surface.[5] It is also noteworthy to mention that in his M\u00e9moire sur quelques ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de la vision Monge proposed an early implicit explanation of the color constancy phenomenon based on several known observations./nLeonhard Euler, in his 1760 paper on curvature in the Berlin Memoirs, had considered, not the normals of the surface, but the normals of the plane sections through a particular normal, so that the question of the intersection of successive normals of the surface had never presented itself to him.[5] Monge's paper gives the ordinary differential equation of the curves of curvature, and establishes the general theory in a very satisfactory manner; the application to the interesting particular case of the ellipsoid was first made by him in a later paper in 1795.[5]/nMonge's 1781 memoir is also the earliest known anticipation of linear optimization problems, in particular of the transportation problem. Related to that, the Monge soil-transport problem leads to a weak-topology definition of a distance between distributions rediscovered many times since by such as L. V. Kantorovich, Paul L\u00e9vy, Leonid Vaser\u0161te\u012dn, and others; and bearing their names in various combinations in various contexts./nAnother of his papers in the volume for 1783 relates to the production of water by the combustion of hydrogen. Monge's results had been anticipated by Henry Cavendish.[5] It was also in this time, from 1783 - 1784, that Monge worked with (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, Jean-Baptiste-Paul-Antoine, or Abb\u00e9 Pierre-Romain) Clouet to liquefy sulfur dioxide by passing a stream of the gas through a U-tube sunken in a refrigerant mixture of ice and salt.[12] This made them the first to liquefy a pure gas.[13]", "6828050": "Elm\u0101rs Zemgalis (9 September 1923 \u2013 8 December 2014) was a Latvian-American chess master and mathematics professor at Highline College.

As a Displaced Person after World War II, he played in twelve international tournaments. In 1946, he took second place, behind Wolfgang Unzicker, in Augsburg, with 13/16. In 1946, he took second place, behind Fedor Bohatirchuk, in Regensburg (Klaus Junge Memorial), with 6.5/9.[3] In 1947, he took second place, behind L\u016bcijs Endzel\u012bns in Hanau (Hermanis Matisons Memorial).[4] In 1948, he won in Esslingen (W\u00fcrttemberg-ch), with 7/9.[5] In 1949, he won in Rujt\u0101 (W\u00fcrttemberg-ch).

In 1953 and 1959, he won the Washington state championships. His 9\u20130 win in the 1953 Championship and his 6\u20130 win in the 1959 Championship are the only perfect score in the history of the tournament.

She completed a habilitation thesis in 1914 on the theory of integrals, and continued to work on Fourier analysis and Dirichlet series for the next several years.[5]/nNalli served as assistant to Giuseppe Bagnera at the University of Palermo from 1 April 1911 to 16 November 1911. She then taught at a number of secondary schools, first in the girls' school at Avellino, then in Trapani, and from 16 November 1912 in the girls' technical school in Palermo. During this time Nalli continued her research, completing her thesis \"Esposizione e confronto critico delle diverse definizioni proposte per l'integrale definito di una funzione limitata o no\",[2] a study of the theory of the integral based on recent work on the subject by \u00c9mile Borel, Henri Lebesgue Charles de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, Giuseppe Vitali and Arnaud Denjoy.[5]/nIn 1921, Nalli became extraordinary professor at the University of Cagliari. She had been ranked second to Mauro Picone in the competition for the position, possibly in part because she was female, but Picone chose to stay at the University of Catania and become head of mathematics there, so the Cagliari position fell to Nalli. In 1923, she was listed first in a search for a position at the University of Pavia, but not offered the position. Finally, after similar mistreatment from several other universities, she moved to the University of Catania as a full professor in 1927. At around this time, perhaps encouraged by Tullio Levi-Civita, she switched her research focus from functional analysis to tensor calculus.[5]/nShe was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1928.[7]/nNalli died on 27 September 1964, in Catania.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics, in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem.[2] He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as algorithmic (Solomonoff\u2013Kolmogorov\u2013Chaitin, Kolmogorov or program-size) complexity together with Andrei Kolmogorov and Ray Solomonoff. Along with the works of e.g. Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Martin-L\u00f6f, and Leonid Levin, algorithmic information theory became a foundational part of theoretical computer science, information theory, and mathematical logic.[3][4] It is a common subject in several computer science curricula. Besides computer scientists, Chaitin's work draws attention of many philosophers and mathematicians to fundamental problems in mathematical creativity and digital philosophy./nGregory Chaitin is Jewish and he attended the Bronx High School of Science and City College of New York, where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of algorithmic complexity.[5][6]/nChaitin has defined Chaitin's constant \u03a9, a real number whose digits are equidistributed and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt. \u03a9 has the mathematical property that it is definable, with asymptotic approximations from below (but not from above), but not computable./nChaitin is also the originator of using graph coloring to do register allocation in compiling, a process known as Chaitin's algorithm.[7]/nHe was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York. He has written more than 10 books that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of metabiology and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution, and is a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University./nChaitin also writes about philosophy, especially metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that algorithmic information theory is the key to solving problems in the field of biology (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and evolution) and neuroscience (the problem of consciousness and the study of the mind)./nIn recent writings, he defends a position known as digital philosophy. In the epistemology of mathematics, he claims that his findings in mathematical logic and algorithmic information theory show there are \"mathematical facts that are true for no reason, that are true by accident\".[8] Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a quasi-empirical methodology./nIn 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science honoris causa by the University of Maine. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a Leibniz Medal[9] by Wolfram Research. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy honoris causa by the National University of C\u00f3rdoba. He was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J.

In 1880, Farkas moved to Budapest where he acquired a Ph.D. in mathematics and became a privat-docent of mathematics at the University of Budapest due to his publication record./nIn 1886, Farkas was nominated for a professorship of mathematical physics at Franz Joseph University of Kolozsv\u00e1r (Klausenburg). A year later he obtained it as an extraordinarius (professor without tenure) and became an ordinarius professor of physics in 1888. His scientific reputation grew both in Hungary and abroad. In 1893, Farkas represented the university at the Galilei anniversary celebration in Padova where he received a doctor honoris causa from the University of Padova. He wrote ``A virtu\u00e1lis sebess\u00e9gek elve Galilein\u00e9l after the Galilei celebrations. Farkas also served as Dean and Rector of the same university and worked there up to 1915, when he retired from his position at the University due to deteriorating eyesight. Farkas retired to Budapest but continued to work and publish until 1926. He lived alone until moving in with a relative shortly before his death on December 26, 1930./nFarkas had remarried after the death of his first wife. He lived alone after the death of second wife in 1915. He moved in with relatives a few months before his death on December 27, 1930 in Pestszentl\u0151rinc./nHe made a contribution to linear algebra with Farkas' lemma, which is named after him for his derivation of it. In 1894, Farkas gave a mathematical formulation to the mechanical principle of Fourier and developed a theory of linear inequalities to derive the necessary condition for the equilibrium of a mechanical system. This was an extension of Lagrange\u2019s work on the mechanical principle of Courtivron which used equality constraints. Farkas\u2019 work introduced inequality constraints and showed that Lagrange\u2019s theory was a special case. If the forces in a system are conservative, finding the necessary condition for equilibrium is equivalent to minimizing the potential subject to constraints. This led to his formulation of the necessary condition of optimality of nonlinear programming in an analytical mechanical framework./nFarkas was elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1898 and a full member in 1914. Farkas was highly respected for his noble personal qualities and talent in organization. He had significant contributions to applied mathematics, mechanical equilibrium, thermodynamics, and  electrodynamics. His habilitation was about complex functions and quaternions. Farkas gave conditions for the solvability of Schr\u00f6der's functional equation in 1884.[2] His results in hydrodynamics and thermodynamics were discussed in the second volume of the Woldemar Voigt's \u2018Mathematische Physik\u2019, published in 1896. His physics papers were mathematically rigorous and at the same level as other contemporary papers on physics. His best-known mathematical paper was \u2018Theorie der einfachen Ungleichungen\u2019 published in 1901 where he proved his inequality theorem. Farkas was among the first to have a modern approach to entropy and derived the Carnot-Clausius principle mathematically fourteen years before Carath\u00e9odory. He was the first in Hungary to have lectures on the special theory of relativity./nHis principal writings are embodied in the reports of the Academy of Science of Paris (1878\u20131884)/nHis separately published works are:/n/nThis article about a European mathematician is a stub.

He praised her for ability to \"throw herself into her work with such success, in spite of being more than ordinarily handicapped, even for a woman, with insufficiency of preliminary training\".[4][10] However the restrictions of the period did not allow her to receive the bachelor's degree she had earned; Cambridge did not award degrees to women until 1948.[4][6][9][10]/nAnnie, aged 27, married Walter, aged 45, in a Presbyterian church in Greenwich on 28 December 1895.[2][3][6][10][12][11] Walter and Annie had no children together; although, Walter had five children from a previous marriage.[3][4][5][9][10] Annie was 17 years younger than Walter and only nine years older than his oldest son.[2][9][10][12] The oldest of the children was 21 and the youngest was 7.[4][10][12] Annie was described as having an active mind and a \"lively imagination combined with a tireless zeal in seeking evidence and working out details before presenting any conclusions.\u201d[8] Walter died in 1928 at the age of 76.[5][8][10][12][11] Annie died almost two decades later, aged 79, in Wandsworth, London in 1947.[2][3][4][5][8][9][10][11]/nIn January 1890, Annie was told about a position at Greenwich that was available by her good friend Alice Everett.[6][10] In response, Annie wrote many times to the Royal Observatory hoping to be considered for the position. Annie's father submitted a request for her to obtain the job, and a powerful promoter, Sir Robert Ball, wrote her a letter of recommendation.[4][6][10][11] For a year, Annie worked as a mathematics mistress at the Ladies' High School on the island of Jersey until she was offered the position by the Chief Assistant, Herbert Hall Turner.[4][6][10] In 1891, Annie began her work at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, serving as one of the \"lady computers\" assigned to the solar department.[2][3][4][6][8][9][12][11] This was a special department set up in 1873 to photograph the sun.[6][12] Annie was offered \u00a34 a month which she regarded as being barely enough to live on, as a teacher she had made \u00a38 a year and was provided housing.[4][6][8][10]/nAnnie worked under Walter Maunder on the Greenwich photoheliograph program.[2][3][4][10][12] Her duties included using the Dallmeyer photo-heliograph to capture pictures of sunspots, find their location, and determine their properties.[9][10] There, Annie assisted Walter Maunder, and she spent a great deal of time photographing the sun.[4][8][9][10][12][11] She also tracked the movements of a great number of sunspots caused by the solar maximum of 1894.[4][6][9][10] This included the giant sunspot of July 1892 which was caused by a magnetic storm resulting in the largest spot ever record at Greenwich at the time.[4][10] In her first year at Greenwich (1891), the number of recorded observations in the solar department exceeded 7 times the average number of recordings for the past 35 years.[10] While she was not credited for this, Walter Maunder nominated her for the Fellowship of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1892.[4][8][9][10][12] In November 1894, she was made editor of the Journal of the British Astronomical Association (BAA) by her husband who was president at the time. She kept this position for 35 years.[3][4][8][9][10]/nAnnie and Walter were married in 1895, and Annie was required to resign from her job due to restrictions on married women working in public service.[4][8][9][10][11] It is believed that \"the lady computer scheme began as an experiment, was destined to have a time limit and was not repeated\".[10] Forty years passed before another woman astronomer was hired alongside men at the Royal Observatory.[10] However, the two continued to collaborate, and Annie accompanied Walter on solar eclipse expeditions.[3][8][9][11] Walter was in charge of financing and organizing expeditions through the National Eclipse Committee of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. Annie took part in five eclipse expeditions with the BAA, her first in 1896 in Norway.[8][9]  For the Maunders expedition to India in 1898, Walter was not a designated member of the expedition, so he and Annie went on their own.[10]/nIn 1897, Annie received a grant from Girton College to acquire a short-focus camera with a 1.5-inch lens which she took on expeditions.[4][6][8][10] The lens used was made by T.R. Dallmeyer, a famous London optician.[10] She used this camera to photograph the outer solar corona from India in 1898.[2][3][4][8][10][11] With this camera she captured the longest ray, coronal streamer, seen at the time with her own equipment that she operated and designed herself.[2][3][4][6][8][9][10] Her camera was designed with a large field-of-view for photographing the Milky Way, which made it possible to look for faint and distant corona.[4][6][9][10][12] To take photos of the eclipse, Annie took a series of photographs with her camera and ranging exposures during the couple minutes of the totality of the eclipse.[10] Her photographs recorded a stream from the Sun that extended over 10 million kilometres.[10] The Irish science writer Agnes Clerke observed, \"Mrs. Maunder with her tiny lens has beaten all the big instruments.\"[4][10] Annie's description of the direction and motion of the particles in the corona which she observed, describes the now accepted Parker Spiral structure of the solar wind.[9] In 1900 Annie, along with other members of the BAA, travelled to Algiers to observe the total eclipse of the Sun on 28 May of that year.[4][6] The members of the association that accompanied her were Mary Acworth Evershed, Lilian Martin-Leake, and C. O. Stevens.[9][10] She photographed the corona and observed \"plume\" like rays, coining the term which is still used today.[4][8] In May 1901, the Maunders went on a solar expedition in Mauritius in which Annie was not included as an official observer (though her husband Walter was) and had to pay her own way.[4][6][10] Since Annie was not an official observer, she decided to go to a separate location to photograph the eclipse.[10] Of the two Mauritius corona photographs that were published, one was Walter's and one was Annie's.[10][11] The only expedition in which Annie's expenses were paid for was the expedition to Canada where the Maunders were invited and sponsored by the Canadian Government.[10][12]/nIn 1904, Annie and Walter created the butterfly diagram to analyse sunspots, showing the latitude of the sunspots over time.[4][9][10][11][12] The butterfly diagram \"is one of the most powerful representations of the inner workings of the Sun\".[9][10] The paper originally had two desiccated butterflies but a third was added after the 11 to 12-year course.[9][11] Annie was not published as coauthor on her husband's paper over the butterfly diagram.[9] In 1943 Sydney Chapman, President of the Royal Society used the butterfly diagram as the subject of his 1943 presidential address, an honour for something she considered as her \"most cherished pieces of work\".[10] The butterfly diagram is currently in the High Altitude Observatory.[10][11] Annie gave the butterfly diagram to Walter Orr Roberts (the director of the High Altitude Observatory) during the Second World War.[11]/nAnnie co-authored with her husband on some papers.[9] In 1907, she published a paper covering \"an analysis of the formidable sunspot data-set that had been gathered at the ROG, covering 1889\u20131901\"[9] as sole author.[9] This analysis contained data that took 13 years to collect, and 19 tables of results.[9] In this paper she found east\u2013west asymmetries in sunspots, a controversial finding which she could not explain.[8][9] Years later, Arthur Schuster, a famous physicist, confirmed her findings and suggested an explanation for the asymmetry.[9] Modern science and data has also confirmed her observations on the asymmetrical nature of the sunspots.[9] Annie published The Heavens and their Story in 1908, with her husband Walter as co-author.[4][6][9][11] (She was credited by her husband as the primary author.)[4][9] The book was written for the amateur readers, containing her photographs of the sun and the Milky Way, in hopes to draw in more people to the field of astronomy.[6][9] The book discusses the sudden terrestrial magnetic storms coinciding with the sunspots' rotation period which was seen in the 1898 eclipse in India.[4][9] The Maunders thought that the magnetic storms were made of positively and negatively charged electrified particles, an \"insight [that] far predates better-known statements on the same matter, and has much in common with our present-day understanding\".[9]/nShe was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) in November 1916, ten months after the bar on female Fellows was lifted.[2][4][8][9][13][14] She had become a member of the BAA on 25 November 1891, just over a year since Walter participated in its foundation in 1890.[12][14] Annie had two stints as the editor of the BAA Journal initially from 1894 to 1896 and then from 1917 to 1930. Although Walter had been fellow of the RAS since 1875, he wanted an association of people from every class of society who were interested in astronomy, especially open for women.[11] Annie had first been nominated for election to the RAS 24 years earlier due strongly in part to Walter's recommendation.[11][14] Along with her were two additional nominees, Elizabeth Brown and Alice Everett.[9][14] None of the three women received the three-quarters vote at the April 1892 meeting that was required for election.[4][11][14] One Fellow specifically implied that the women would largely serve as a distraction and simply a social element to the meetings without contributing much of worth.[14] Annie did not take lightly to the prejudice against her and other women throughout her field occupied largely by men, and she especially did not agree with the results of the 1892 RAS election.[4][11][14]/nThe crater Maunder on the Moon is jointly named for Walter and Annie Maunder, as is the Maunder Minimum.[9][12]/nIn 2016 the RAS established the Annie Maunder medal for an outstanding contribution to outreach and public engagement in astronomy or geophysics.[9]/nIn June 2018 it was announced that the Royal Observatory, Greenwich had installed a new telescope in its Altazimuth Pavilion, the Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (AMAT), as part of a revival of telescopy in London enabled by cleaner air and advanced technology.

He was the first student of Charles Ehresmann./nHe is known as one of the founders of the theory of fiber bundles. He is the one who first proved that a fiber bundle over a simplex is trivializable and who used this to classify bundles over spheres.[1]/nIn a paper, written together with Ehresmann, he introduced the notion of an associated bundle and proved results known today as the exact homotopy sequence of a fibration.[2]/nDescribed by Mich\u00e8le Audin as \"a handsome young man with a very friendly and likeable personality\"[citation needed] he demonstrated an early interest in mathematics, whilst also being enthusiastic about music and sport. He studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Fustel de Coulanges in Strasbourg, receiving his high school diploma in 1932, and then he started preparatory classes at Lyc\u00e9e Kl\u00e9ber. He applied for the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure but refused to present himself on Saturday (the Jewish sabbath), and so was not allowed to continue. He enrolled at the University of Strasbourg in 1934, where he was librarian of the Institute of Mathematics in 1935. He joined the CNRS and began preparing a PhD under the direction of Charles Ehresmann in 1939. He was also a pianist and swimmer. becoming a university butterfly-stroke champion in 1939. By the age 30, Feldbau was participating in a \"defence group against anti-Semitism.\"/nMobilized in 1939, he became a flying officer in the French Air Force. Demobilized after the armistice of 22 June 1940, he was appointed associate professor at the School of Chateauroux, but was forbidden to teach by the laws of exclusions of 3 October 1940 on the status of Jews, promulgated by the Vichy regime under the P\u00e9tain government. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where the University of Strasbourg had been evacuated to, where he met his supervisor, Charles Ehresmann. In order to earn a living he gave mathematics lessons and continued his research in topology for his doctoral thesis; he also became a member of the Resistance movement. The status of Jews was one of the additional burdens of Nazi occupation; it quickly became impossible for a scientist labelled as \"non- Aryan \" to publish under his name. Mich\u00e8le Audin showed a note to the Proceedings of the Academy of Science, starting with his signature and that of Charles Ehresmann. It was eventually published under the sole name of Ehresmann albeit with mention of the results being obtained \"in collaboration with one of his students\". Jacques Feldbau subsequently published two short notes in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France under the pseudonym \"Jacques Laboureur\" or \"Jacques Ploughman\". (The name \"Feldbau\" in German means \"agriculture\".)/nCloser to the war, a very gifted student, Jacques Feldbau, asked me to suggest a topic in topology. I consulted Ehresmann, who was far better versed in the field than I. Following his advice, I suggested to Feldbau that he study the notion of fiber bundles, which was still quite young. Despite his somewhat clumsy methods (hardly surprising in a beginner) he came up with some interesting results.../nOn the night of 24 to 25 June 1943 the  \"roundup of Gallia\" took place whereby 38 Strasbourg university students were arrested in the Gallia university foyer in retaliation for three attacks against the Germans, following the execution on 24 June of two members of the Gestapo in the house of a resistance member, Professor Jean-Michel Flandin. Feldbau himself was not present in the house, but was arrested on 25 June in the morning, when he went to collect his PhD thesis. He was transferred to Drancy and then deported to Auschwitz, by train No. 60 of 7 October 1943, where he arrived on 10 October. \nThe testimonies of survivors show the moral strength and support he brought to his companions. His mastery of several languages was a great help to him. He would have held seminars in mathematics on Sunday afternoon and a conference on quantum theory. On 16 January 1945, the camp was evacuated by the SS for death marches westward.

That goal was accomplished in 1896 when the University of Illinois Observatory was complete and Myers was named director as well as Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics./nMyers conducted the first theoretical study of the eclipsing binary star Beta Lyrae as part of his dissertation. He used a light curve created by Argelander in 1859 that was based on eye estimated of the brightness of the stars. Using the light curve, he was able to describe the system of two stars almost in contact and elongated. Using A.A. Belopolsky's radial-velocity measurements, he determined the semi-major axis of the orbits and that the two stars were 21 times and 9.5 times the mass of the sun. He went further, noting the strong absorptions lines in the spectrum, to suggest that the two stars orbited within an envelope of gas. Myers first presented the results on October 20, 1897, at the opening conference for Yerkes Observatory, then published the results in the Astrophysical Journal.[2] He identified both Beta Lyrae and Upsilon Pegasi with the piriform equilibrium figure of a rotating fluid mass discovered by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1885, known as the Poincar\u00e9 Pear.[3]/nMyers accepted a position as the head of the mathematics department of the Chicago Institute in 1900.

These patterns turned out to accurately predict the shape and size of the proteins, as well as the structure of packaged genetic material, for many viruses including Nodaviridae.[7]/nThe models turned out to be useful for studying the assembly of RNA viruses, which involves proteins binding to specific parts of the genome that end up in 3-dimensional locations[8] that can be determined mathematically.[9][10][11] More insights were gained using the \"cut and project\" method of generating penrose tilings. Her models can be thought of as squashed-down three dimensional pictures of the 6-demicubic honeycomb tiling, which is a six-dimensional version of the three-dimensional Tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. Different viruses are modelled by different subsets of the vertices of this lattice. The viruses appear to use these patterns because they are the most stable way of connecting multiple interacting layers that all have icosahedral symmetry./nHer work has applications to the study of nanomaterials.[12]", "8761450": "Andrew Blake (born 12 March 1956)[5] FREng,[2] FRS,[1] is a British scientist, former laboratory director of Microsoft Research Cambridge and Microsoft Distinguished Scientist, former director of the Alan Turing Institute, Chair of the Samsung AI Centre in Cambridge, honorary professor at the University of Cambridge, Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge,[6] and a leading researcher in computer vision.[7][8][3]/nBlake was educated at Rugby School[5] and graduated in 1977 from Trinity College, Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and Electrical Sciences.

Dominance solvability is a stronger concept than Nash equilibrium because it does not require ex-ante coordination. Its only requirement is iterated common knowledge of rationality. His work on this concept was mentioned in Eric Maskin's Nobel Prize Lecture.[26]/nOne year later he proved an interesting result concerning the famous Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem,[27] which states that any voting procedure on the universal domain of preferences whose range contains more than two alternatives is either dictatorial or manipulable. Moulin proved that it is possible to define non-dictatorial and non-manipulable social choice functions in the restricted domain of single-peaked preferences, i.e. those in which there is a unique best option, and other options are better as they are closer to the favorite one. Moreover, he provided a characterization of such rules.[28] This paper inspired a whole literature on achieving strategy-proofness and fairness (even in a weak form as non-dictatorial schemes) on restricted domains of preferences.[29][30]/nMoulin is also known for his seminal work in cost sharing[4][31][32] and assignment problems.[33][34] In particular, jointly with Anna Bogomolnaia, he proposed the probabilistic-serial procedure as a solution to the fair random assignment problem, which consists of dividing several goods among a number of persons. Probabilistic serial allows each person to \"eat\" her favorite shares, hence defining a probabilistic outcome. It always produces an outcome which is unambiguously efficient ex-ante, and thus has a strong claim over the popular random priority.

The other side was completed in 1978 by Stegall.[11]/nA special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications was dedicated to Namioka to honor his 80th birthday.[1]\nIn 2012, he became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[12]", "47886466": "Teruhisa Matsusaka (\u677e\u962a \u8f1d\u4e45, Matsusaka Teruhisa) (1926\u20132006) was a Japanese-born American mathematician, who specialized in algebraic geometry./nMatsusaka received his Ph.D. in 1954 at Kyoto University;[1] he was a member of the Brandeis Mathematics Department from 1961 until his retirement in 1994, and was that department's chair from 1984\u20131986.

He is principally known for the Gateaux derivative, used in the calculus of variations and in the theory of optimal control. He died in combat during World War I. Paul L\u00e9vy produced a posthumous edition of his works, extending them considerably, in his Le\u00e7ons d'analyse fonctionnelle of 1922./nGateaux was born on (1889-05-05)5 May 1889 at Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois, Marne, 222 years after another mathematician, Abraham de Moivre, was born there (de Moivre, being of Huguenot ancestry, fled to London after the Edict of Fontainebleau of 1685). His father had a small saddlery and upholstery business,[1] and his mother was a seamstress. He was schooled at Reims, and in 1907 entered the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) on the rue d'Ulm. He was well regarded as one of the most promising mathematicians among his peers. During his time at ENS, Gateaux converted to Roman Catholicism./nIn 1910, he sat the mathematics examination (being placed 11th of 16 in his year, a somewhat unimpressive result perhaps due to his being so young, according to the ENS's deputy head \u00c9mile Borel). He became a teacher at the  lyc\u00e9e in Bar-le-Duc, Meuse in 1912, having completed his two years' military service (the first as a private soldier, and the second as a sub-lieutenant, as was required by a 1905 law concerning the service of students from some Grandes \u00c9coles)./nAt the same time as he took the post at Bar-le-Duc, he started to work on his thesis about functional analysis, following the work of Vito Volterra and Jacques Hadamard, and its applications to potential theory. Even though it is unknown why Gateaux chose this subject, he may have been encouraged by Hadamard himself, who had just completed a course on the subject at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. Among others, in 1911 Paul L\u00e9vy had undertaken a brilliant thesis on this type of question, and in 1912 Joseph P\u00e9r\u00e8s, an alumnus of the ENS in the year before Gateaux, had left for Rome to work under Volterra./nIn 1913, Gateaux asked for, and was awarded, a bursary from the David Weill Foundation to go with him to Rome. Before leaving, he sent a letter to Borel and Volterra, on the subjects they had proposed he work on in Rome. Within it was the theme of integration of real functions in infinite-dimensional space./nHe stayed in Rome from October 1913, following Volterra's course and working hard. He published numerous notes in the Rendiconti dell'Accademia dei Lincei, and presented a seminar at the University of Rome. He returned to France in June 1914, intending to return in the September after being awarded a Commercy bursary for another year./nGateaux was caught off-guard by mobilisation and the August 1914 declaration of war. He was sent to Toul as a lieutenant in the 269th Infantry Regiment with responsibility for the 2nd Machine Guns section.[2] Having helped defend Nancy in the Battle of Grand Couronn\u00e9, his regiment was engaged in the Race to the Sea and sent to Artois. On the morning of 3 October 1914, Gateaux was killed by machine guns at the entrance to the village of Rouvroy, which his regiment was defending. In the confusion of battle, his body was not identified and was quickly interred. Several years later, his remains were exhumed and moved to Neuville-Saint-Vaast National Cemetery, where he was interred in Tomb 76./nIn August 1915, Hadamard started the process of awarding Gateaux a Prix de L'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences posthumously. In a letter to \u00c9mile Picard, he wrote:/nLe jeune homme a laiss\u00e9 des recherches fort avanc\u00e9es en calcul fonctionnel (sa th\u00e8se \u00e9tait en grande partie compos\u00e9e et en partie expos\u00e9e dans des notes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie), recherches pour lesquelles M.

Volterra and myself have greatly valued./nIn 1916, Gateaux was awarded the Prix Francoeur. In 1918, Hadamard talked to Paul L\u00e9vy, who was responsible for a course on functional analysis at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, about drafts Gateaux had left before his departure to the Front. He proposed that L\u00e9vy edit them for publication in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France, in two parts. The most important discovery that L\u00e9vy found in Gateaux' papers was a draft theory for integrating functions in infinite dimensions. This work came to be of great importance to L\u00e9vy in writing his important work Le\u00e7ons d'analyse fonctionnelle (1922). When L\u00e9vy was talking with the American mathematician Norbert Wiener in 1922, Wiener immediately saw that he could use Gateaux' definition to define his \"differential space\" and construct a measure of Brownian motion (later called a \"Wiener measure\"). In the foundation article that he published in 1923, Wiener paid homage to Gateaux and L\u00e9vy for producing les \u00e9tudes les plus profondes sur l'int\u00e9gration en dimension infinie (\"The deepest studies on infinite-dimensional integration\").", "59158683": "Elham Kazemi (born 1970)[1] is a mathematics educator and educational psychologist, the Geda and Phil Condit Professor in Math and Science Education in the College of Education of the University of Washington./nKazemi is originally from Iran, and moved to the US at age 11.[2]\nShe graduated from Duke University in 1992 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, and became an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona.\nReturning to graduate study in educational psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, she earned a master's degree in 1997 and completed her Ph.D. in 1999.

He was the younger brother of the Lutheran theologian and author Alexius Naboth.[5][6] In 1544, Valentin matriculated[3] at the University of Wittenberg. At that time Philipp Melanchthon, Erasmus Reinhold, Johannes Bugenhagen, Paul Eber, and Georg Major taught there. In 1550 he transferred to the University of Erfurt.[4]/nValentin Naboth already held the Baccalaureat when he came from Wittenberg to Erfurt, and certainly had outstanding mathematical abilities. The Faculty council risked turning the courses in Mathematics over to this gifted but troubled Renaissance spirit even though he had not yet completed a Magister degree. That decision was made at the meeting of 16 August 1551, and from then on Naboth taught Mathematics and the beginning astronomy course, the Sphaera materialis. He also taught in the summer semester and winter semester of 1552. There was a plague epidemic, and the courses were shortened;  Liborius Mangold taught only rhetoric and Naboth only the Sphaera. The conscientious Liborius Mangold from Warburg, who was Dean, did not seem to get along with the much favored mathematician Naboth, and when the latter even borrowed money from the University for the Magister's examination, Liborius wrote to the Dean's book, that this was \"never before seen or heard of\" (quod prius nunquam nec visum nec auditum fuit). Valentin Naboth passed the examination. But right after he had received his Magister's degree, he wrote an impertinent letter to the Faculty. Shortly afterwards Liborius Mangold gave up after twelve years as rector of St. Georgsburse and as professor of physics and rhetoric, and accepted an administrative position in his native town of Warburg, and Naboth left as well. Naboth went to the University of Cologne and matriculated there with the ambition to teach mathematics at this major University \u2013 which he did./nFrom 1555 Naboth taught mathematics at the University of Cologne, first privately, and from 1557 to 1564 as the holder of a \"City\" Professorship of mathematics.[7][8] He succeeded Justus Velsius, who in 1556, on account of teachings deemed heretical by the Church, was obliged to leave Cologne. Dutch mathematician Rudolph Snellius was one of his students in Cologne.[2]  In 1556 he published the first book of Euclid (1556), and then his own mathematical commentary on the Arab astrologer Alchabitius (1560), in which he opposed magic and superstition. In his mathematical work he followed Regiomontanus; but later he preferred Ptolemy \u2013 in agreement with Cardanus. He prepared an edition of Ptolemy's Quadripartitum, but that was never published. In his commentary, he thanked the City that they had supported him in the early years, when mathematics was the only discipline not yet integrated into the general University curriculum. If this remark is true, then the official Professorship of Mathematics had in fact only just been established. However, in 1563 Laurentianer Petrus Linner requested that Naboth's lecture be moved to another time, since he himself taught mathematics at his Gymnasium at the very same time. Furthermore, he argued that Naboth lacked a Magister degree from Cologne. And indeed, the Dean decided that henceforth no one could teach a course in the Schola Artium while a lecture was taking place in one of three Gymnasiums. In March 1564 Naboth resigned from his position at the University of Cologne.[9] He visited Paris, where he met Czech humanist \u0160imon Proxenus ze Sudetu (1532\u20131575),[10] who introduced him to Petrus Ramus.[11] Afterwards Naboth traveled to Italy, eventually settling in Padua, the center of the mathematical studies of that time, where he taught astronomy. Among his students there was a nephew of Prince Stephen B\u00e1thory of Transylvania. He had always been an eccentric, and became even more so.[12]/nNaboth was the author of a general textbook on astrology Enarratio elementorum astrologiae. Renowned for calculating the mean annual motion of the Sun, his writings are chiefly devoted to commenting upon Ptolemy and the Arabian astrologers.[8] Naboth teaches the calculation of the movement of the planets according to the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold. He advocated a measure of time, by which 0\u00b0 59' 8+1\u20443\" (the mean daily motion of the Sun in longitude) is equated to 1 year of life in calculating primary directions. This was a refinement of Ptolemy's value of exactly 1 degree per year. This book was banned by the Roman Catholic Church.[13][notes 3]/n/nIn 1573 Naboth published an astronomy textbook for gymnasium students Primarum de coelo et terra, which was dedicated to Stephen B\u00e1thory. There can be no doubt that Naboth was working from De revolutionibus orbium coelestium when he wrote this textbook, since in this book he provides schematics of the conventional model of the solar system, Martianus Capella's geo-heliocentric model, as well as Copernicus' heliocentric model.[15] Tycho Brahe owned an early copy of this book, and since this book contains the first schematic representation of Capella's geo-heliocentric model it is likely that this book provided the inspiration for Tycho's geo-heliocentric model. Wittich may also have been influenced by Naboth's book in adopting the Capellan system to explain the motion of the inferior planets,[16] and Kepler may have used this book as well.

Tommaso Campanella, in a work published in Lyons in 1629,[19] tells the story that Naboth was living in Padua, Italy, when he deduced from his own horoscope that he was about to enter a period of personal danger, so he stockpiled an adequate supply of food and drink, closed his blinds, and locked his doors and windows, intending to stay in hiding until the period of danger had passed. Unfortunately, some robbers, seeing the house closed and the blinds drawn, decided that the resident was absent. They therefore broke into what they thought was an empty house, and, finding Naboth there, murdered him to conceal their identities.

Many of his contributions are now regarded as fundamental to the field, such as his strong maximum principle for second-order parabolic partial differential equations and the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem in complex geometry. He is regarded as a foundational figure in the field of geometric analysis, with many of his works being closely related to the study of complex analysis and differential geometry.[4]/nNirenberg was born in Hamilton, Ontario to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants. He attended Baron Byng High School and McGill University, completing his BS in both mathematics and physics in 1945. Through a summer job at the National Research Council of Canada, he came to know Ernest Courant's wife Sara Paul. She spoke to Courant's father, the eminent mathematician Richard Courant, for advice on where Nirenberg should apply to study theoretical physics. Following their discussion, Nirenberg was invited to enter graduate school at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. In 1949, he obtained his doctorate in mathematics, under the direction of James Stoker. In his doctoral work, he solved the \"Weyl problem\" in differential geometry, which had been a well-known open problem since 1916./nFollowing his doctorate, he became a professor at the Courant Institute, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was the advisor of 45 PhD students, and published over 150 papers with a number of coauthors, including notable collaborations with Henri Berestycki, Ha\u00efm Brezis, Luis Caffarelli, and Yanyan Li, among many others. He continued to carry out mathematical research until the age of 87. On January 26, 2020, Nirenberg died at the age of 94.[5][6][7]/nNirenberg's work was widely recognized, including the following awards and honors:/nNirenberg is especially known for his collaboration with Shmuel Agmon and Avron Douglis in which they extended the Schauder theory, as previously understood for second-order elliptic partial differential equations, to the general setting of elliptic systems. With Basilis Gidas and Wei-Ming Ni he made innovative uses of the maximum principle to prove symmetry of many solutions of differential equations. The study of the BMO function space was initiated by Nirenberg and Fritz John in 1961; while it was originally introduced by John in the study of elastic materials, it has also been applied to games of chance known as martingales.[18] His 1982 work with Luis Caffarelli and Robert Kohn made a seminal contribution to the Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness, in the field of mathematical fluid mechanics./nOther achievements include the resolution of the Minkowski problem in two-dimensions, the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality, the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem in complex geometry, and the development of pseudo-differential operators with Joseph Kohn./nThe Navier-Stokes equations were developed in the early 1800s to model the physics of fluid mechanics. Jean Leray, in a seminal achievement in the 1930s, formulated an influential notion of weak solution for the equations and proved their existence.[19] His work was later put into the setting of a boundary value problem by Eberhard Hopf.[20]/nA breakthrough came with work of Vladimir Scheffer in the 1970s. He showed that if a smooth solution of the Navier\u2212Stokes equations approaches a singular time, then the solution can be extended continuously to the singular time away from, roughly speaking, a curve in space.[21] Without making such a conditional assumption on smoothness, he established the existence of Leray\u2212Hopf solutions which are smooth away from a two-dimensional surface in spacetime.[22] Such results are referred to as \"partial regularity.\" Soon afterwards, Luis Caffarelli, Robert Kohn, and Nirenberg localized and sharpened Scheffer's analysis.[CKN82] The key tool of Scheffer's analysis was an energy inequality providing localized integral control of solutions. It is not automatically satisfied by Leray\u2212Hopf solutions, but Scheffer and Caffarelli\u2212Kohn\u2212Nirenberg established existence theorems for solutions satisfying such inequalities. With such \"a priori\" control as a starting point, Caffarelli\u2212Kohn\u2212Nirenberg were able to prove a purely local result on smoothness away from a curve in spacetime, improving Scheffer's partial regularity./nSimilar results were later found by Michael Struwe, and a simplified version of Caffarelli\u2212Kohn\u2212Nirenberg's analysis was later found by Fang-Hua Lin.[23][24] In 2014, the American Mathematical Society recognized Caffarelli\u2212Kohn\u2212Nirenberg's paper with the Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research, saying that their work was a \"landmark\" providing a \"source of inspiration for a generation of mathematicians.\" The further analysis of the regularity theory of the Navier\u2212Stokes equations is, as of 2021, a well-known open problem./nIn the 1930s, Charles Morrey found the basic regularity theory of quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations for functions on two-dimensional domains.[25] Nirenberg, as part of his Ph.D. thesis, extended Morrey's results to the setting of fully nonlinear elliptic equations.[N53a] The works of Morrey and Nirenberg made extensive use of two-dimensionality, and the understanding of elliptic equations with higher-dimensional domains was an outstanding open problem./nThe Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, in the form of prescribing the determinant of the hessian of a function, is one of the standard examples of a fully nonlinear elliptic equation. In an invited lecture at the 1974 International Congress of Mathematicians, Nirenberg announced results obtained with Eugenio Calabi on the boundary-value problem for the Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation, based upon boundary regularity estimates and a method of continuity.[26] However, they soon realized their proofs to be incomplete.[26] In 1977, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Shing-Tung Yau resolved the existence and interior regularity for the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, showing in particular that if the determinant of the hessian of a function is smooth, then the function itself must be smooth as well.[27] Their work was based upon the relation via the Legendre transform to the Minkowski problem, which they had previously resolved by differential-geometric estimates.[28] In particular, their work did not make use of boundary regularity, and their results left such questions unresolved./nIn collaboration with Luis Caffarelli and Joel Spruck, Nirenberg resolved such questions, directly establishing boundary regularity and using it to build a direct approach to the Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation based upon the method of continuity.[CNS84] Calabi and Nirenberg had successfully demonstrated uniform control of the first two derivatives; the key for the method of continuity is the more powerful uniform H\u00f6lder continuity of the second derivatives. Caffarelli, Nirenberg, and Spruck established a delicate version of this along the boundary,[29] which they were able to establish as sufficient by using Calabi's third-derivative estimates in the interior.[30] With Joseph Kohn, they found analogous results in the setting of the complex Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation.[C+85] In such general situations, the Evans\u2212Krylov theory[29] is a more flexible tool than the computation-based calculations of Calabi./nCaffarelli, Nirenberg, and Spruck were able to extend their methods to more general classes of fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations, in which one studies functions for which certain relations between the hessian's eigenvalues are prescribed.[CNS85] As a particular case of their new class of equations, they were able to partially resolve the boundary-value problem for special Lagrangians./nNirenberg's most renowned work from the 1950s deals with \"elliptic regularity.\" With Avron Douglis, Nirenberg extended the Schauder estimates, as discovered in the 1930s in the context of second-order elliptic equations, to general elliptic systems of arbitrary order.[DN55] In collaboration with Shmuel Agmon and Douglis, Nirenberg proved boundary regularity for elliptic equations of arbitrary order.[ADN59] They later extended their results to elliptic systems of arbitrary order.[ADN64] With Morrey, Nirenberg proved that solutions of elliptic systems with analytic coefficients are themselves analytic, extending to the boundary earlier known work.[MN57] These contributions to elliptic regularity are now considered as part of a \"standard package\" of information, and are covered in many textbooks. The Douglis\u2212Nirenberg and Agmon\u2212Douglis\u2212Nirenberg estimates, in particular, are among the most widely-used tools in elliptic partial differential equations.[31]/nWith Yanyan Li, and motivated by composite materials in elasticity theory, Nirenberg studied linear elliptic systems in which the coefficients are H\u00f6lder continuous in the interior but possibly discontinuous on the boundary. Their result is that the gradient of the solution is H\u00f6lder continuous, with a L\u221e estimate for the gradient which is independent of the distance from the boundary.[LN03]/nIn the case of harmonic functions, the maximum principle was known in the 1800s, and was used by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[32][33] In the early 1900s, complicated extensions to general second-order elliptic partial differential equations were found by Sergei Bernstein, Leon Lichtenstein, and \u00c9mile Picard; it was not until the 1920s that the simple modern proof was found by Eberhard Hopf.[34] In one of his earliest works, Nirenberg adapted Hopf's proof to second-order parabolic partial differential equations, thereby establishing the strong maximum principle in that context.[N53b] As in the earlier work, such a result had various uniqueness and comparison theorems as corollaries. Nirenberg's work is now regarded as one of the foundations of the field of parabolic partial differential equations, and is ubiquitous across the standard textbooks.[35][36][37][38][39][40]/nIn the 1950s, A.D. Alexandrov introduced an elegant \"moving plane\" reflection method, which he used as the context for applying the maximum principle to characterize the standard sphere as the only closed hypersurface of Euclidean space with constant mean curvature. In 1971, James Serrin utilized Alexandrov's technique to prove that highly symmetric solutions of certain second-order elliptic partial differential equations must be supported on symmetric domains. Nirenberg realized that Serrin's work could be reformulated so as to prove that solutions of second-order elliptic partial differential equations inherit symmetries of their domain and of the equation itself. Such results do not hold automatically, and it is nontrivial to identify which special features of a given problem are relevant. For example, there are many harmonic functions on Euclidean space which fail to be rotationally symmetric, despite the rotational symmetry of the Laplacian and of Euclidean space./nNirenberg's first results on this problem were obtained in collaboration with Basilis Gidas and Wei-Ming Ni. They developed a precise form of Alexandrov and Serrin's technique, applicable even to fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations.[GNN79] In a later work, they developed a version of the Hopf lemma applicable on unbounded domains, thereby improving their work in the case of equations on such domains.[GNN81] Their main applications deal with rotational symmetry. Due to such results, in many cases of geometric or physical interest, it is sufficient to study ordinary differential equations rather than partial differential equations./nLater, with Henri Berestycki, Nirenberg used the Alexandrov\u2212Bakelman\u2212Pucci estimate[29] to improve and modify the methods of Gidas\u2212Ni\u2212Nirenberg, significantly reducing the need to assume regularity of the domain.[BN91a] In an important result with Srinivasa Varadhan, Berestycki and Nirenberg continued the study of domains with no assumed regularity. For linear operators, they related the validity of the maximum principle to positivity of a first eigenvalue and existence of a first eigenfunction.[BNV94] With Luis Caffarelli, Berestycki and Nirenberg applied their results to symmetry of functions on cylindrical domains.[BCN96] They obtained in particular a partial resolution of a well-known conjecture of Ennio De Giorgi on translational symmetry, which was later fully resolved in Ovidiu Savin's Ph.D. thesis.[BCN97b][41][42] They further applied their method to obtain qualitative phenomena on general unbounded domains, extending earlier works of Maria Esteban and Pierre-Louis Lions.[BCN97a]/nNirenberg and Emilio Gagliardo independently proved fundamental inequalities for Sobolev spaces, now known as the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg\u2013Sobolev inequality and the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequalities.[N59] They are used ubiquitously throughout the literature on partial differential equations; as such, it has been of great interest to extend and adapt them to various situations. Nirenberg himself would later clarify the possible exponents which can appear in the interpolation inequality.[N66] With Luis Caffarelli and Robert Kohn, Nirenberg would establish corresponding inequalities for certain weighted norms.[CKN84] Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg's norms were later investigated more fully in notable work by Florin Catrina and Zhi-Qiang Wang.[43]/nImmediately following Fritz John's introduction of the bounded mean oscillation (BMO) function space in the theory of elasticity, he and Nirenberg gave a further study of the space, proving in particular the \"John\u2212Nirenberg inequality,\" which constrains the size of the set on which a BMO function is far from its average value.[JN61] Their work, which is an application of the Calderon\u2212Zygmund decomposition, has become a part of the standard mathematical literature. Expositions are contained in standard textbooks on probability,[44] complex analysis,[45] harmonic analysis,[46] Fourier analysis,[47] and partial differential equations.[29] Among other applications, it is particularly fundamental to J\u00fcrgen Moser's Harnack inequality and subsequent work.[48][49][29]/nThe John\u2212Nirenberg inequality and the more general foundations of the BMO theory were worked out by Nirenberg and Ha\u00efm Br\u00e9zis in the context of maps between Riemannian manifolds.[BN95] Among other results, they were able to establish that smooth maps which are close in BMO norm have the same topological degree, and hence that degree can be meaningfully defined for mappings of vanishing mean oscillation (VMO)./nIn the setting of topological vector spaces, Ky Fan developed a minimax theorem with applications in game theory.[50][51] With Ha\u00efm Brezis and Guido Stampacchia, Nirenberg derived results extending both Fan's theory and Stampacchia's generalization of the Lax-Milgram theorem.[BNS72][52] Their work has applications to the subject of variational inequalities.[53]/nBy adapting the Dirichlet energy, it is standard to recognize solutions of certain wave equations as critical points of functionals. With Brezis and Jean-Michel Coron, Nirenberg found a novel functional whose critical points can be directly used to construct solutions of wave equations.[BCN80] They were able to apply the mountain pass theorem to their new functional, thereby establishing the existence of periodic solutions of certain wave equations, extending a result of Paul Rabinowitz.[54] Part of their work involved small extensions of the standard mountain pass theorem and Palais-Smale condition, which have become standard in textbooks.[55][56][57] In 1991, Brezis and Nirenberg showed how Ekeland's variational principle could be applied to extend the mountain pass theorem, with the effect that almost-critical points can be found without requiring the Palais\u2212Smale condition.[BN91b][57]/nA fundamental contribution of Brezis and Nirenberg to critical point theory dealt with local minimizers.[BN93] In principle, the choice of function space is highly relevant, and a function could minimize among smooth functions without minimizing among the broader class of Sobolev functions. Making use of an earlier regularity result of Brezis and Tosio Kato, Brezis and Nirenberg ruled out such phenomena for a certain class of Dirichlet-type functionals.[58] Their work was later extended by Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Azorero, Juan Manfredi, and Ireneo Peral.[59]/nIn one of Nirenberg's most widely cited papers, he and Br\u00e9zis studied the Dirichlet problem for Yamabe-type equations on Euclidean spaces, following part of Thierry Aubin's work on the Yamabe problem.[BN83] With Berestycki and Italo Capuzzo-Dolcetta, Nirenberg studied superlinear equations of Yamabe type, giving various existence and non-existence results.[BCN94]/nAgmon and Nirenberg made an extensive study of ordinary differential equations in Banach spaces, relating asymptotic representations and the behavior at infinity of solutions to/nto the spectral properties of the operator A. Applications include the study of rather general parabolic and elliptic-parabolic problems.[AN63]/nBrezis and Nirenberg gave a study of the perturbation theory of nonlinear perturbations of noninvertible transformations between Hilbert spaces; applications include existence results for periodic solutions of some semilinear wave equations.[BN78a][BN78b]/nIn John Nash's work on the isometric embedding problem, the key step is a small perturbation result, highly reminiscent of an implicit function theorem; his proof used a novel combination of Newton's method (in an infinitesimal form) with smoothing operators.[60] Nirenberg was one of many mathematicians to put Nash's ideas into systematic and abstract frameworks, referred to as Nash-Moser theorems. Nirenberg's formulation is particularly simple, isolating the basic analytic ideas underlying the analysis of most Nash-Moser iteration schemes.[N72] Within a similar framework, he proved an abstract form of the Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem, as a particular case of a theorem on solvability of ordinary differential equations in families of Banach spaces.[N72] His work was later simplified by Takaaki Nishida and used in an analysis of the Boltzmann equation.[61][62]/nMaking use of his work on fully nonlinear elliptic equations[N53a], Nirenberg's Ph.D. thesis provided a resolution of the Weyl problem and Minkowski problem in the field of differential geometry.[N53c] The former asks for the existence of isometric embeddings of positively curved Riemannian metrics on the two-dimensional sphere into three-dimensional Euclidean space, while the latter asks for closed surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space for which the Gauss map prescribes the Gaussian curvature. The key is that the \"Darboux equation\" from surface theory is of Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re type, so that Nirenberg's regularity theory becomes useful in the method of continuity. John Nash's well-known isometric embedding theorems, established soon afterwards, have no apparent relation to the Weyl problem, which deals simultaneously with high-regularity embeddings and low codimension.[63][60] Nirenberg's work on the Minkowski problem was extended to Riemannian settings by Aleksei Pogorelov. In higher dimensions, the Minkowski problem was resolved by Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Shing-Tung Yau.[28] Other approaches to the Minkowski problem have developed from Caffarelli, Nirenberg, and Spruck's fundamental contributions to the theory of nonlinear elliptic equations.[CNS85]/nIn one of his very few articles not centered on analysis, Nirenberg and Philip Hartman characterized the cylinders in Euclidean space as the only complete hypersurfaces which are intrinsically flat.[HN59] This can also be viewed as resolving a question on the isometric embedding of flat manifolds as hypersurfaces. Such questions and natural generalizations were later taken up by Cheng, Yau, and Harold Rosenberg, among others.[64][65]/nAnswering a question posed to Nirenberg by Shiing-Shen Chern and Andr\u00e9 Weil, Nirenberg and his doctoral student August Newlander proved what is now known as the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem, which provides the precise algebraic condition under which an almost complex structure arises from a holomorphic coordinate atlas.[NN57] The Newlander-Nirenberg theorem is now considered as a foundational result in complex geometry, although the result itself is far better known than the proof, which is not usually covered in introductory texts, as it relies on advanced methods in partial differential equations. Nirenberg and Joseph Kohn, following earlier work by Kohn, studied the \u2202-Neumann problem on pseudoconvex domains, and demonstrated the relation of the regularity theory to the existence of subelliptic estimates for the \u2202 operator.[KN65b]/nThe classical Poincar\u00e9 disk model assigns the metric of hyperbolic space to the unit ball. Nirenberg and Charles Loewner studied the more general means of naturally assigning a complete Riemannian metric to bounded open subsets of Euclidean space.[LN74] Geometric calculations show that solutions of certain semilinear Yamabe-type equations can be used to define metrics of constant scalar curvature, and that the metric is complete if the solution diverges to infinity near the boundary. Loewner and Nirenberg established existence of such solutions on certain domains. Similarly, they studied a certain Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation with the property that, for any negative solution extending continuously to zero at the boundary, one can define a complete Riemannian metric via the hessian. These metrics have the special property of projective invariance, so that projective transformation from one given domain to another becomes an isometry of the corresponding metrics./nJoseph Kohn and Nirenberg introduced the notion of pseudo-differential operators.[KN65a] Nirenberg and Fran\u00e7ois Tr\u00e8ves investigated the famous Lewy's example for a non-solvable linear PDE of second order, and discovered the conditions under which it is solvable, in the context of both partial differential operators and pseudo-differential operators.[NT63][NT70] Their introduction of local solvability conditions with analytic coefficients has become a focus for researchers such as R. Beals, C. Fefferman, R.D. Moyer, Lars H\u00f6rmander, and Nils Dencker who solved the pseudo-differential condition for Lewy's equation.

His parents were Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha) and Emil Artin, preeminent algebraist of the 20th century of Armenian descent. Artin's parents left Germany in 1937, because his mother's father was Jewish.[3] His elder sister is Karin Tate, who was married to mathematician John Tate until the late 1980s./nArtin did his undergraduate studies at Princeton University, receiving an A.B. in 1955; he then moved to Harvard University, where he received a Ph.D. in 1960 under the supervision of Oscar Zariski, defending a thesis about Enriques surfaces.[1][4]/nIn the early 1960s, Artin spent time at the IH\u00c9S in France, contributing to the SGA4 volumes of the S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique, on topos theory and \u00e9tale cohomology, jointly with Alexander Grothendieck. \nHe also collaborated with Barry Mazur to define \u00e9tale homotopy theory which has become an important tool in algebraic geometry, and applied ideas from algebraic geometry (such as the Nash approximation) to the study of diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. His work on the problem of characterising the representable functors in the category of schemes has led to the Artin approximation theorem in local algebra as well as the \"Existence theorem\". This work also gave rise to the ideas of an algebraic space and algebraic stack, and has proved very influential in moduli theory. He also has made important contributions to the deformation theory of algebraic varieties, serving as the basis for all future work in this area of algebraic geometry. With Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, he provided a resolution of the Shafarevich-Tate conjecture for elliptic K3 surfaces and the pencil of elliptic curves over finite fields. He contributed to the theory of surface singularities which are both fundamental and seminal. The rational singularity and fundamental cycles, which are used in matroid theory, are such examples of his sheer originality and thinking. He began to turn his interest from algebraic geometry to noncommutative algebra (noncommutative ring theory), especially geometric aspects, after a talk by Shimshon Amitsur and an encounter in University of Chicago with Claudio Procesi and Lance W. Small, \"which prompted [his] first foray into ring theory\".[5]\nToday, he is a recognized world authority in noncommutative algebraic geometry and his impact can be felt across many related areas./nIn 2002, Artin won the American Mathematical Society's annual Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.

Le Verrier sent the coordinates to Johann Gottfried Galle in Berlin, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune the same night he received Le Verrier's letter, within 1\u00b0 of the predicted position./nThe discovery of Neptune is widely regarded as a dramatic validation of celestial mechanics, and is one of the most remarkable moments of 19th-century science./nUrbain Le Verrier was born at Saint-L\u00f4, Manche, France, to a modest bourgeois family, his parents being Louis-Baptiste Le Verrier and Marie-Jeanne-Josephine-Pauline de Baudre.[1]/nHe studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique \u2013 briefly chemistry, under Gay-Lussac, writing papers on the combinations of phosphorus and hydrogen, and of phosphorus and oxygen.[2]/nHe then switched to astronomy, particularly celestial mechanics, and accepted a job at the Paris Observatory.

His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower./nLe Verrier's first work in astronomy was presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in September 1839, entitled Sur les variations s\u00e9culaires des orbites des plan\u00e8tes (On the Secular Variations of the Orbits of the Planets). This work addressed the then most-important question in astronomy: the stability of the Solar System, first investigated by Laplace. He was able to derive some important limits on the motions of the system, but due to the inaccurately-known masses of the planets, his results were tentative./nFrom 1844 to 1847, Le Verrier published a series of works on periodic comets, in particular those of Lexell, Faye and DeVico. He was able to show some interesting interactions with the planet Jupiter, proving that certain comets were actually the reappearance of previously-known comets flung into different orbits.[4]/nLe Verrier's most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet Neptune, using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet Uranus. Encouraged by physicist Arago,[5] Director of the Paris Observatory, Le Verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between Uranus's observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of Newton. At the same time, but unknown to Le Verrier, similar calculations were made by John Couch Adams in England. Le Verrier announced his final predicted position for Uranus's unseen perturbing planet publicly to the French Academy on 31 August 1846, two days before Adams's final solution was privately mailed to the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Le Verrier transmitted his own prediction by 18 September in a letter to Johann Galle of the Berlin Observatory. The letter arrived five days later, and the planet was found with the Berlin Fraunhofer refractor that same evening, 23 September 1846, by Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest within 1\u00b0 of the predicted location near the boundary between Capricorn and Aquarius./nThere was, and to an extent still is, controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery. There is no ambiguity to the discovery claims of Le Verrier, Galle, and d'Arrest. Adams's work was begun earlier than Le Verrier's but was finished later and was unrelated to the actual discovery. Not even the briefest account of Adams's predicted orbital elements was published until more than a month after Berlin's visual confirmation. Adams made full public acknowledgement of Le Verrier's priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) when he gave his paper to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:[6]/nI mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of those of M. Le Verrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honours of the discovery; for there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world, and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr. Galle, so that the facts stated above cannot detract, in the slightest degree, from the credit due to M. Le Verrier./nEarly in the 19th century, the methods of predicting the motions of the planets were somewhat scattered, having been developed over decades by many different researchers. In 1847, Le Verrier took on the task to \"... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...\",[7] \na work which would occupy him for the rest of his life./nLe Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750. Examining these and correcting for inconsistencies with the most recent data occupied him until 1852.[4]/nLe Verrier published, in the Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris, tables of the motions of all of the known planets, releasing them as he completed them, starting in 1858.[8] \nThe tables formed the fundamental ephemeris of the Connaissance des Temps, the astronomical almanac of the Bureau des Longitudes, until about 1912.[9] \nAbout that time, Le Verrier's work on the outer planets was revised and expanded by Gaillot.[10]/nLe Verrier began studying the motion of Mercury as early as 1843, with a report entitled D\u00e9termination nouvelle de l 'orbite de Mercure et de ses perturbations (A New Determination of the Orbit of Mercury and its Perturbations).[4]\nIn 1859, Le Verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of Mercury's orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps, instead, a series of smaller 'corpuscules') might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation.[11] (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place some faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was even named Vulcan. However, no such planet was ever found,[12] and the anomalous precession was eventually explained by general relativity theory./nLe Verrier's methods of management were disliked by the staff of the Observatoire, and the disputes became so great that he was driven out in 1870. He was succeeded by Delaunay, but was reinstated in 1873 after Delaunay accidentally drowned. Le Verrier held the position until his death in 1877.[2]/nLe Verrier married Lucille Clotilde Choquet in 1837[13] and had 3 children.[14][15] He died in Paris, France and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

Adams believed, in the face of anything that had been attempted before, that he could use the observed data on Uranus, and utilising nothing more than Newton's law of gravitation, deduce the mass, position and orbit of the perturbing body. On 3 July 1841, he noted his intention to work on the problem.[2]/nAfter his final examinations in 1843, Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations. While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge, he tutored undergraduates, sending money home to educate his brothers, and even taught his bed maker to read.[2]/nApparently, Adams communicated his work to James Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory, in mid-September 1845, but there is some controversy as to how. On 21 October 1845, Adams, returning from a Cornwall vacation, without appointment, twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich. Failing to find him at home, Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution, again without the detailed calculations. Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification.[6] It appears that Adams did not regard the question as \"trivial\", as is often alleged, but he failed to complete a response. Various theories have been discussed as to Adams's failure to reply, such as his general nervousness, procrastination and disorganisation.[6]/nMeanwhile, Urbain Le Verrier, on 10 November 1845, presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in Paris a memoir on Uranus, showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion.[1] On reading Le Verrier's memoir, Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet.[7] The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July.[2] Only after the discovery of Neptune on 23 September 1846 had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet.[1]/nA keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers. As the facts became known, there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus, and each was ascribed equal importance.[1][2] However, there have been subsequent assertions that \"The Brits Stole Neptune\" and that Adams's British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due.[6]  But it is also notable (and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references) that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verrier's priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) in the paper that he gave 'On the Perturbations of Uranus' to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:[8]/nI mention these dates merely to show that my results were arrived at independently, and previously to the publication of those of M. Le Verrier, and not with the intention of interfering with his just claims to the honours of the discovery; for there is no doubt that his researches were first published to the world, and led to the actual discovery of the planet by Dr. Galle, so that the facts stated above cannot detract, in the slightest degree, from the credit due to M. Le Verrier./nAdams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy[2] and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world:[6]/nI could not expect however that practical astronomers, who were already fully occupied with important labours, would feel as much confidence in the results of my investigations, as I myself did./nHis lay fellowship at St John's College came to an end in 1852, and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election. However, Pembroke College, which possessed greater freedom, elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life.\nDespite the fame of his work on Neptune, Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism. He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations, often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors.[1] However, he was \"extraordinarily uncompetitive, reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority, averse to correspondence about it, and forgetful in practical matters\".[2] It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the \"repetitive behaviours and restricted interests\" necessary to perform the Neptune calculations, in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy.[9]/nIn 1852, he published new and accurate tables of the Moon's parallax, which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardt's, and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie-Charles Damoiseau, Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana, and Philippe Gustave Doulcet.[1]/nHe had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred, Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator.[2]/nSince ancient times, the Moon's mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as being constant, but in 1695, Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing.[10] Later, during the eighteenth century, Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as +10\" (arcseconds/century2) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude,[11] an effect that became known as the secular acceleration of the Moon. Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations.[12]/nIn 1820, at the insistence of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, Damoiseau, Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplace's work, investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms, and obtained similar results, again addressing only a radial, and neglecting tangential, gravitational force on the Moon. Hansen obtained similar results in 1842 and 1847.[13]/nIn 1853, Adams published a paper[14] showing that, while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of Laplace, they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted. Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66\" per century.[13]/nAt first, Le Verrier rejected Adams's results.[15] In 1856, Plana admitted Adams's conclusions, claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results. However, he soon recanted, publishing a third result different both from Adams's and Plana's own earlier work. Delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated Adams's result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth, sixth and seventh-order terms. Adams now calculated that only 5.7\" of the observed 11\" was accounted for by gravitational effects.[13] Later that year, Philippe Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pont\u00e9coulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen, who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator, declared that the burden of proof rested on Pont\u00e9coulant, while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance. Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and, in 1860, Adams duplicated his results without using a power series. Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams's results and Plana finally concurred. Adams's view was ultimately accepted and further developed, winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866.[1][13][15] The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration.[2]/nIn 1858 Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews, but lectured only for a session, before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry.  Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory, a post Adams held until his death.[1]/nThe great meteor shower of November 1866 turned his attention to the Leonids, whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864. Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node, that marked where the shower would occur, was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe's leading astronomers.[2]/nUsing a powerful and elaborate analysis, Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors, which belongs to the Solar System, traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years, and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. These results were published in 1867.[1]/nSome experts consider this Adams's most substantial achievement. His \"definitive orbit\" for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and thereby suggested the, later widely accepted, close relationship between comets and meteors.[2]/nTen years later, George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion. Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field, which, following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hill's.[1]/nOver a period of forty years, he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of terrestrial magnetism. Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime. They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers. Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime.[1] He calculated the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places[2] and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.[1]/nAdams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newton's thought.[1] In 1872, Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth, donated his private collection of Newton's papers to Cambridge University. Adams and G. G. Stokes took on the task of arranging the material, publishing a catalogue in 1888.[16][17]/nThe post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in 1881, but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge. He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884, when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia.[1]/nAfter a long illness, Adams died at Cambridge on 21 January 1892 and was buried near his home in St Giles Cemetery, now the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.[19] In 1863 he had married Miss Eliza Bruce (1827\u20131919), of Dublin, who survived him, and is buried with him.[1] His wealth at death was \u00a332,434 (\u00a32.6 million at 2003 prices).[2][20]", "38416618": "Ib Henning Madsen (born 12 April 1942, in Copenhagen)[1] is a Danish mathematician, a professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen.

His work in these disciplines was to prove important in other fields of mathematics and science, such as differential equations, geometry and physics (especially astrophysics and cosmology)./nKazimierz \u017borawski was born in Szczurzyn near Ciechan\u00f3w, in the Russian Empire, now in Poland, to Juliusz Bronis\u0142aw Wiktor \u017b\u00f3rawski and Kazimiera \u017b\u00f3rawska. In 1884 he completed secondary school in Warsaw.  From 1884 to 1888 he studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1889 he was selected to continue his mathematics studies on the strength of a paper on observations that he had made at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory./nIn the years that followed he studied the theory of conversion groups and analytical mechanics in Leipzig, and differential equations in G\u00f6ttingen.  In 1891 he was awarded a PhD (under M. Sophius Lie) in Leipzig for his thesis on the applications of group conversion theory to differential geometry.

Upon his retirement, the University of Warsaw conferred upon him the title of Professor Emeritus in mathematics and natural science./nBoth before World War II and during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Professor \u017borawski worked on analytical geometry, primarily in the area of first- and second-degree plane figures and differential properties of real andicomplex plane figures.  His work was three-quarters completed when the Warsaw Uprising occurred.  \u017borawski, like tens of thousands of Warsaw residents, was expelled from the capital and sent to Pruszk\u00f3w.  His apartment, which contained all of his property, including many of his scientific papers, was destroyed by fire./nUpon his release from the camp of Pruszk\u00f3w along with a group of other scientists, Zorawski took refuge in Niebor\u00f3w, staying at the home of the Radziwill family.

He was the first of the scientists of his generation to bring the name of Poland to the forefront of world mathematics.\"/nKazimierz \u017borawski dealt with a particularly difficult field of mathematics \u2013 continuous invariants of Lie groups, and the results of his work have been applied to other fields of mathematics and science, especially differential equations, geometry and physics./nThe seventy scientific works of Professor \u017borawski relate mainly to analytical geometry, differential geometry, Lie groups, differential equations, kinematics of continuous symmetry, and non-Euclidean complex geometry./nAt the turn of the 20th century, groups of mathematicians worked in the Polish scientific centers of Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw and created the \"mathematical Schools\" of Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w and Krak\u00f3w.  Kazimierz \u017borawski, along with Stanis\u0142aw Zaremba, (both faculty members of Jagiellonian University) was a cofounder of the Krak\u00f3w School of Mathematics, to which professors Franciszek Leja, W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u015alebodzi\u0144ski and Tadeusz Wa\u017cewski also belonged.

One can say that, thanks to these two scientists, Polish mathematics ceased being a mere consumer of foreign thinking and analysis.  Both played pivotal roles in the development of this science.

With much ability, \u017borawski worked to resolve difficult and complicated calculations which were necessary to solve the problems.../nIn 1863, \u017borawski's mother, Kazimiera, took part in the January Uprising against the Russian Empire. This uprising started as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army and was soon joined by politicians and high ranking Polish officers from the tsarist army.  While the uprising failed militarily, it succeeded in blunting the effect of the Tsar's abolition of serfdom in the Russian partition. Kazimiera was captured and imprisoned by the Russian authorities, and her father was imprisoned in the citadel at Warsaw, where he later died./n\u017borawski had five siblings, one of whom, Stanislaw, became proprietor of the Obrebiec Estate, near Przasnysz. In 1940, his property was seized by the Nazis and Stanislaw was arrested and interned at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where he died./n\u017borawski fell in love with the family governess, Maria Sk\u0142odowska (later better known as Marie Curie), whose father was a relative of the \u017borawskis. The two discussed marriage, but \u017borawski's parents rejected Maria due to her family's poverty. Nevertheless, their hopes of marriage continued until 1891, when a dispirited Maria moved to Warsaw and then to Paris, where she eventually married Pierre Curie and earned two Nobel prizes./n\u017borawski married Leokadia Jewniewicz, a pianist.

Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended by others to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today./nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and mathematical physics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves, leaving her position at Vassar. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert\u2013Mauchly she managed the development of one of the first COBOL compilers. She believed that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language.  Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. [2][3][4][5] During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. She is accredited with writing the first computer manual, \u201cA Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.\u201d/nIn 1954, Eckert\u2013Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. Hopper promoted the use of the language throughout the 60s. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences./nThe U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS\u00a0Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC.[6] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world.

On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[7]/nGrace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.[8] Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.[8]:\u200a2\u20133/nGrace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[9] Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, \u201cHumans are allergic to change. They love to say, \u2018We\u2019ve always done it this way.\u2019 I try to fight that. That\u2019s why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.\u201d[10] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930./nIn 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906\u20131976); they divorced in 1945.[11][12] She did not marry again and retained his surname./nIn 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[13] under the direction of \u00d8ystein Ore.[11][14] Her dissertation, \"New Types of Irreducibility Criteria\",[15] was published that same year.[16] She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[17]/nHopper tried to commission in the Navy early in World War II, however she was turned down. At age 34, she was too old to enlist and her weight-to-height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.[18] During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES./nShe had to get an exemption to commission; she was 15 pounds (6.8\u00a0kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54\u00a0kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken./nHopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.[19]/nIn 1949, Hopper became an employee of the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I.[17] Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.[20]/nWhen Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she \"was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English.\" Still, she persisted. \"It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols,\" she explained. \"So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.\"[21]/nHer idea was not accepted for three years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0.[22]:\u200a11/nIn 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that \"Nobody believed that,\" and that she \"had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"[23]/nIn 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming.[17] Beginning in 1954, Hopper's work was influenced by the Laning and Zierler system, which was the first compiler to accept algebraic notation as input.[24] Her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC.[17]/nHopper said that her compiler A-0, \"translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are, they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say 'Subtract income tax from pay' instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing.\"[25]/nIn the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL (an acronym for COmmon Business-Oriented Language). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN.  Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.[26] Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumna Jean E. Sammet.[27]/nFrom 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.[19]/nIn the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.[22]:\u200a119\u200a She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)./nIn accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966.[28] She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr.[29]/nAfter Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes, he championed H.J.Res.\u00a0341, a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives to promote Hopper to commodore on the retired list; the resolution was referred to, but not reported out of, the Senate Armed Services Committee.[30] Hopper was instead promoted to commodore on December 15, 1983 via the Appointments Clause by President Ronald Reagan.[31][29][32][33][34] She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress.[35] Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half) and Hopper became one of the Navy's few female admirals./nFollowing a career that spanned more than 42 years, Rear Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986.[36] At the time, she was the oldest serving member of the Navy. At a celebration held in Boston on the USS\u00a0Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.[37]/nAt the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).[38]/nAdmirals William D. Leahy, Chester W. Nimitz, Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navy's history to serve on active duty at a higher age. Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral./nAdmiral Hopper was the first ever person to be profiled twice on 60 Minutes, first in March 1983, and the second on August 24, 1986./nFollowing her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was hired as a full-time Principal Corporate Consulting Engineer, a tech-track SVP-equivalent. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.[39] She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992./nAt DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures contrary to U.S. Department of Defense policy.[40] In 2016 Hopper received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, in recognition of her remarkable contributions to the field of computer science./n\"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler,\" she said, \"is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.\"[41]/nThroughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname \"Grandma COBOL\".[42]/nWhile Hopper was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947,[43] her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay and impeding the operation of the computer. Upon extraction, the insect was affixed to a log sheet for that day with the notation, \u201cFirst actual case of bug being found\u201d. While neither she nor her crew members mentioned the exact phrase, \"debugging\", in their log entries, the case is held as a historical instance of \"debugging\" a computer and Hopper is credited with popularizing the term in computing. For many decades, the term \"bug\" for a malfunction had been in use in several fields before being applied to computers.[44][45] The remains of the moth can be found taped into the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.[43]/nHopper became known for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why satellite communication took so long.  She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long\u201411.8 inches (30\u00a0cm)\u2014the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym \"nanoseconds.\"[34] She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum distance the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out \"nanoseconds\" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet (300 meters) long,[46] representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.[47]/nJay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be \"'all Navy', but when you reach inside, you find a 'Pirate' dying to be released.\"[48]/nOn New Year's Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington County, Virginia;[49] she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.[50]/nHer legacy was an inspiring factor in the creation of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.[106] Held yearly, this conference is designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront.[107]", "4436275": "Karel Petr (Czech: [\u02c8kar\u025bl \u02c8p\u025btr\u0329];  14 June 1868, Zbyslav, Austria-Hungary \u2013 14 February 1950, Prague, Czechoslovakia) was a Czech mathematician.

She was the third child of Gianbattista Cornaro-Piscopia and his mistress Zanetta Boni. Her mother was a peasant and her parents were not married at the time of her birth.[4][5] Lady Elena was therefore not technically a member of the Cornaro family by birth, as Venetian law barred illegitimate children of nobles from noble privilege even if recognized by the noble parent. Worse for Zanetta's case, she was from an extremely poor peasant family. Zanetta had likely fled to Venice in order to escape starvation, and soon found herself the mistress of a member of one of the most powerful noble dynasties in the Republic. Gianbattista and Zanetta married officially in 1654 but their children were barred from noble privilege.[citation needed]/nIn 1664 Elena\u2019s father was chosen to become the Procuratore di San Marco de supra, the treasurer of St Mark's Cathedral, a coveted position among Venetian nobility. That made Gianbattista second only to the Doge of Venice in terms of precedence.[6] Because of this connection Lady Elena was prominent in the Marriage of the Sea celebration, even though she was born illegitimate. Her father tried to arrange betrothals for her several times but she rebuffed each man's advances. Early biographers' suggestion that she took a vow of chastity at age 11 is disputed by Francesco Ludovico Maschietto.[7]/nIn 1665 she took the habit of a Benedictine oblate without, however, becoming a nun.[4]/nAs a young girl Lady Elena was seen as a prodigy. On the advice of Giovanni Fabris, a priest who was a friend of the family, she began a classical education. She studied Latin and Greek under distinguished instructors and became proficient in those languages, as well as French and Spanish, by the age of seven.[4] She also mastered Hebrew and Arabic, earning the title of Oraculum Septilingue (\"Seven-language Oracle\"). Her later studies included mathematics, philosophy and theology.[citation needed]/nElena came to be an expert musician, mastering the harpsichord, the clavichord, the harp and the violin. Her skills were shown by the music that she composed in her lifetime. In her late teens and early twenties, she became interested in physics, astronomy and linguistics. Carlo Rinaldini\u00a0[it], her tutor in philosophy and at that point, the Chairman of Philosophy at the University of Padua, published a book in 1668 written in Latin and centred on geometry. The book was dedicated to a twenty-two-year-old Elena. After the death of her main tutor, Fabris, she became even closer to Rinaldini, who took over her studies.[4]/nIn 1669 she translated the Colloquy of Christ by Carthusian monk Lanspergius from Spanish into Italian.[c] The translation was dedicated to Gian Paolo Oliva, her close friend and confessor. The volume was issued in five editions in the Republic from 1669 to 1672. She was invited to be a part of many scholarly societies when her fame spread and in 1670 she became president of the Venetian society Accademia dei Pacifici.[8][9]/nOn the recommendation of Carlo Rinaldini, her tutor in philosophy, Felice Rotondi petitioned the University of Padua to grant Cornaro the laurea[d] in theology.[10] When Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo, the bishop of Padua, learned that she was pursuing a degree in theology, he refused on the grounds that she was a woman.[10] However he did allow her to study for a degree in philosophy and after a course of study she received the laurea in Philosophy.[10] The degree was conferred on 25 June 1678 in Padua Cathedral in the presence of the university authorities, the professors of all the faculties, the students and most of the Venetian Senators, together with many guests from the Universities of Bologna, Perugia, Rome and Naples. Lady Elena spoke for an hour in Classical Latin, explaining difficult passages selected at random from the works of Aristotle: one from the Posterior Analytics and the other from the Physics.[11] She was listened to with great attention and when she had finished she received plaudits as Professor Rinaldini proceeded to award her the insignia of the laurea: a book of philosophy, a laurel wreath on her head, a ring on her finger and over her shoulders an ermine mozzetta. She was proclaimed Magistra et Doctrix Philosophiae [teacher and doctor of philosophy],[12] thus becoming one of the first women to receive an academic degree from a university,[13][e]./nThe last seven years of her life were devoted to study and charity. She died in Padua in 1684 of tuberculosis and was buried in the church of Santa Giustina.[17]/nA few months after Elena's conferral, Charles Patin, lecturer in medicine at Padua, applied for his daughter Gabrielle-Charlotte [Carla Gabriella] Patin to begin a degree.[18] The university, supported by Gianbattista Cornaro-Piscopia, changed its statutes to prohibit women from graduating. The next female doctorate was granted by the University of Bologna in 1732 to Laura Bassi.[19]/nCornaro's death was marked by memorial services in Venice, Padua, Siena and Rome. The Accademia degli Infecondi\u00a0[it] published two memorial volumes of tributes by members: one to mark her degree,[20] and the other her death.[21] Padua's Accademia dei Ricovrati also produced a volume at her death.[22] Her statue was placed in the University of Padua, which caused a medal to be struck in her honour in 1685.[citation needed]/nIn 1895 Abbess Mathilda Pynsent of the English Benedictine Nuns in Rome had Cornaro's tomb opened, the remains placed in a new casket, and a suitable tablet inscribed to her memory. Her graduation ceremony is depicted in the Cornaro Window, installed in 1906 in the West Wing of the Thompson Memorial Library at Vassar College.[23] At the suggestion of Ruth Crawford Mitchell, Cornaro is depicted in Giovanni Romagnoli's 1949 mural in the Italian Nationality Room at the University of Pittsburgh.[23] On 5 June 2019, Google celebrated her 373rd birthday with a Google Doodle.[24][f]/nEarlier biographies of Elena Cornaro include Massimiliano Dezza's Vita di Helena Lucretia Cornara Piscopia (Venice: Bosio, 1686) and Antonio Lupis' L'eroina veneta (Venice: Curti, 1689).

He is best known for his book Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth (1802), which summarised the work of James Hutton.[1] It was through this book that Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism, later taken up by Charles Lyell, first reached a wide audience. Playfair's textbook Elements of Geometry made a brief expression of Euclid's parallel postulate known now as Playfair's axiom./nIn 1783 he was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as General Secretary to the society 1798\u20131819.[2]/nBorn at Benvie, slightly west of Dundee to Margaret Young (1719/20 \u2013 1805) and Reverend James Playfair (died 1772), the kirk minister of Liff and Benvie.[3][4]/nPlayfair was educated at home until the age of 14, when he entered the University of St Andrews to study divinity. He also did further studies at Edinburgh University. In 1766, when only 18, he was a candidate for the chair of mathematics in Marischal College (now part of the University of Aberdeen), and, although he was unsuccessful, his claims were admitted to be high./nSix years later (1772) he applied for the chair of natural philosophy (physics) at St Andrews University, but again without success. In 1773 he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland and was offered the united parishes of Liff and his home parish of Benvie (made vacant by the death of his father). However, Playfair chose to continue his studies in mathematics and physics, and in 1782 he resigned his charge to become the tutor of Adam Ferguson. By this arrangement Playfair regularly visited Edinburgh and went on to cultivate the literary and scientific society for which the city was at that time specially distinguished. In particular, he attended the natural history course of John Walker. Through Nevil Maskelyne, whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the celebrated Schiehallion experiments in 1774, he also gained access to the scientific circles of London. In 1785 when Dugald Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the University of Edinburgh Chair of Moral Philosophy, Playfair succeeded the former to become the chair of mathematics./nIn 1795 Playfair published an alternative, more stringent formulation of Euclid's parallel postulate, which is now called Playfair's axiom. Although the axiom bears Playfair's name, he did not create it, but credited others, in particular William Ludlam with its prior use.[5]/nIn 1802 Playfair published his celebrated volume entitled Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth. The influence exerted by James Hutton on the development of geology is thought to be largely due to its publication. In 1805 Playfair exchanged the Chair of Mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to John Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the ecclesiastical controversy that arose in connection with Sir John Leslie's appointment to the post he had vacated, and published a satirical letter (1806)./nHe moved from 6 Buccleuch Place to a new house at 2 Albany Street (then called Albany Row) in 1807.[6][7]/nPlayfair was an opponent of Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early version of the conservation of energy. In 1808, he launched an attack[8] on John Smeaton and William Hyde Wollaston's work championing the theory. In 1808 he also published a review of Laplace's Trait\u00e9 de M\u00e9canique Celeste.[9]/nHe died at 2 Albany Street on 20 July 1819. He is buried nearby in Old Calton Burial Ground (a secular burial ground).[10]/nPlayfair's brothers were architect James Playfair, solicitor Robert Playfair and engineer William Playfair.

She turned him down and married Sir Humphry Davy.[11]/nHe died of strangury on 20 July 1819, and, although an eminent man, was buried in an unmarked grave in Old Calton Burial Ground, on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh. His, and his brother, James's graves were marked by a plaque unveiled in 2011 following a local campaign.[12] The monument to his memory by William Henry Playfair, on Calton Hill,[13] is visible from the spot./nA four-volume collected edition of Playfair's works, with a memoir by James G.

P. Swanson, reviewing Science Speaks in The Quarterly Review of Biology, wrote: \"... the author has fallen into the commonest error of using only these facts which bolster his hypothesis, and of discarding or controverting those which do not. For example, his discussion of the theory of evolution is not only misleading; it displays an abysmal ignorance of recent evolutionary studies.\"[9]/nVarious critics have taken issue with Stoner's interpretation of prophecy.[10][11] Stoner's apologetic work did not receive critical attention until its inclusion in Josh McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict[citation needed] and criticism of these claims tends to be addressed to McDowell rather than Stoner, with Stoner's name mentioned in passing. These criticisms against McDowell, Stoner and others include historical errors, claims regarding after-the-event authorship or tampering with biblical prophecies, and disputed meanings of certain biblical phrases./nOthers who disagree with specific claims made by Stoner include fellow Christians and secular historians. For instance, while Stoner says of Ezekiel's prophecy of the permanent destruction of Tyre \"If Ezekiel had looked at Tyre in his day and had made these seven predictions in human wisdom, these estimates mean that there would have been only one chance in 75,000,000 of their all coming true. They all came true in the minutest detail\", others claim \"the problem is that very little of this actually came to pass! In fact, it badly missed how history actually unfolded\"[12] and \"The location of the city of Tyre is not in doubt, for it exists to this day on the same spot and is known as Sur.\"[13] However, it could still be argued that the boundaries of the ancient mainland city may have fallen within areas of the modern city not rebuilt in the present day.[14]", "63058245": "J\u00e1nos K\u00f6rner is a Hungarian mathematician who works on information theory and combinatorics.[1]/nK\u00f6rner studied Mathematics at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest with a degree in 1970[2] and was then at the Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences until 1992.

He introduced the Tschirnhaus transformation and is considered by some to have been the inventor of European porcelain,[1][2] an invention long accredited to Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger but others claim porcelain had been made by English manufacturers at an even earlier date.[3]/nVon Tschirnhaus was born in Kieslingswalde (now S\u0142awnikowice in western Poland) and died in Dresden, Saxony./nVon Tschirnhaus attended the Gymnasium at G\u00f6rlitz. Thereafter he studied mathematics, philosophy, and medicine[4] at the University of Leiden. He travelled considerably in France, Italy, and Switzerland, and served in the army of Holland (1672\u20131673). During his travels he met Baruch de Spinoza and Christiaan Huygens in the Netherlands, Isaac Newton in England, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (with whom he maintained a lifelong correspondence) in Paris. He became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences in Paris./nThe Tschirnhaus transformation, by which he removed certain intermediate terms from a given algebraic equation, is well known. It was published in the scientific journal Acta Eruditorum in 1683./nIn 1682, Von Tschirnhaus worked out the theory of catacaustics and showed that they were rectifiable. This was the second case in which the envelope of a moving line was determined. One of the catacaustics of a parabola is still known as Tschirnhausen cubic./nIn 1696, Johann Bernoulli posed the problem of the brachistochrone to the readers of Acta Eruditorum. Tschirnhaus was one of only five mathematicians to submit a solution. Bernoulli published these contributions (including Tschirnhaus') along with his own in the journal in May of the following year./nVon Tschirnhaus produced various types of lenses and mirrors, some of them are displayed in museums. He erected a large glass works in Saxony, where he constructed burning glasses of unusual perfection and carried on his experiments (1687\u20131688)./nHis work Medicina mentis sive artis inveniendi praecepta generali (1687) combines methods of deduction with empiricism and shows him to be philosophically connected to the Enlightenment./nTschirnhaus was for many years forgotten as a philosopher and the studies treating the subject often discuss Tschirnhaus' connection to other philosophers and scientists at the time. During his time at the University of Leiden he started correspondence with Spinoza and later also Leibniz. Tschirnhaus was one of the first to get a copy of Spinoza's masterpiece Ethics./nAfter he returned home to Saxony, von Tschirnhaus initiated systematic experiments, using mixtures of various silicates and earths at different temperatures to develop porcelain, which at the time was available only as a costly import from China and Japan. As early as 1704, he showed \u201cporcelan\u201d to Leibniz's secretary. He proposed the establishment of a porcelain factory to Augustus II of Poland, Elector of Saxony, but was denied. Also in 1704, von Tschirnhaus became the supervisor of Johann Friedrich B\u00f6ttger, a nineteen-year-old alchemist who claimed to be able to make gold. B\u00f6ttger only reluctantly and under pressure started to participate in Tschirnhaus\u2019 work by 1707. The use of kaolin (from Schneeberg, Saxony) and alabaster advanced the work, so that August II named him the director of the porcelain factory he intended to establish. The Elector ordered payment of 2,561 thalers to von Tschirnhaus, but the recipient requested postponement until the factory was producing. When Von Tschirnhaus died suddenly, on 11 October 1708, the project came to a halt./nThree days after Von Tschirnhaus's death, there was a burglary at his house and, according to a report by B\u00f6ttger, a small piece of porcelain was stolen. This report suggests that B\u00f6ttger himself recognized that Von Tschirnhaus already knew how to make porcelain, a key piece of evidence that Von Tschirnhaus and not B\u00f6ttger was the inventor. Work resumed on 20 March 1709, by which time Melchior Steinbr\u00fcck had arrived to assess the dead man's estate, which included the notes about making porcelain, and had met with B\u00f6ttger. On 28 March 1709, B\u00f6ttger went to August II and announced the invention of porcelain. B\u00f6ttger now was nominated to head the first European manufactory for porcelain. Steinbr\u00fcck became an inspector and married B\u00f6ttger's sister./nContemporary testimonies of knowledgeable people indicate that Tschirnhaus invented porcelain. In 1719, for example, Samuel St\u00f6lzel of the porcelain factory of Meissen went to Vienna with the still-secret recipe and confirmed that it had been invented by Von Tschirnhaus and not by B\u00f6ttger. In that same year, the General Secretary of the Meissen factory also indicated that the invention was not B\u00f6ttger's \u201cbut by the late Herr von Tschirnhaus[,] whose written science\u201d was handed to B\u00f6ttger \u201cby the inspector Steinbr\u00fcck.\u201d Nevertheless, B\u00f6ttger's name became closely associated with the invention.", "4665679": "Vavrinec Benedikt of Nedo\u017eery (Slovak: Vavrinec Benedikt z Nedo\u017eier, Czech: Vav\u0159inec Benedikt z Nudo\u017eer (Nedo\u017eer) or Nudo\u017eerinus, Hungarian: Benedicti M.

Basu invented simple examples that displayed some difficulties of likelihood-based statistics and frequentist statistics; Basu's paradoxes were especially important in the development of survey sampling. In statistical theory, Basu's theorem established the independence of a complete sufficient statistic and an ancillary statistic.[1]/nBasu was associated with the Indian Statistical Institute in India, and Florida State University in the United States.[2]/nDebabrata Basu was born in Dacca, Bengal, unpartitioned India, now Dhaka, Bangladesh. His father, N. M. Basu, was a mathematician specialising in number theory. Young Basu studied mathematics at Dacca University. He took a course in statistics as part of the under-graduate honours programme in Mathematics but his ambition was to become a pure mathematician.[3] After getting his master's degree from Dacca University, Basu taught there from 1947 to 1948.[4]/nFollowing the partition of India in 1947, Basu made several trips to India. In 1948, he moved to Calcutta, where he worked for some time as an actuary in an insurance company. In 1950, he joined the Indian Statistical Institute as a research scholar under C.R. Rao.[5]/nIn 1950, the Indian Statistical Institute was visited by Abraham Wald, who was giving a lecture tour sponsored by the International Statistical Institute. Wald greatly impressed Basu. Wald had developed a decision-theoretic foundations for statistics in which Bayesian statistics was a central part, because of Wald's theorem characterising admissible decision rules as Bayesian decision rules (or limits of Bayesian decision rules). Wald also showed the power of using measure-theoretic probability theory in statistics./nHe married Kalyani Ray in 1952 and subsequently had two children, Monimala (Moni) Basu and Shantanu Basu. Moni is a journalism professor at the University of Florida[6] and former CNN reporter,[7] and Shantanu is an astrophysicist at the University of Western Ontario.[8]/nIn 1953, after submitting his thesis to the University of Calcutta,[2] Basu went as a Fulbright scholar to the University of California, Berkeley. There Basu had intensive discussions with Jerzy Neyman and \"his brilliant younger colleagues\" like Erich Leo Lehmann.[9] Basu's theorem comes from this time. Basu thus had a good understanding of the decision-theoretic approach to statistics of Neyman, Pearson and Wald. In fact, Basu is described as having returned from Berkeley to India as a \"complete Neyman Pearsonian\" by J. K. Ghosh.[10]/nBasu met Ronald Fisher in the winter of 1954\u20131955; he wrote in 1988, \"With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a via media between the two poles of Statistics\u00a0\u2013 Berkeley and Bayes.[11] My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the likelihood principle\".[12] In their festschrift for Basu, the editors Malay Ghosh and Patak write that/n[Basu's] critical examination of both the Neyman\u2013Pearsonian and the Fisherian modes of inference eventually forced him to a Bayesian point of view, via the likelihood route. The final conversion to Bayesianism came in January 1968, when Basu was invited to speak at a Bayesian Session in the Statistics Section of the Indian Science Congress. He confesses that, while preparing for these lectures, he became convinced that Bayesian inference did indeed provide one with a logical resolution of the underlying inconsistencies of both the Neyman\u2013Pearson and the Fisherian theories. Since then, Dr. Basu became an ardent Bayesian and, in many of his foundation papers, pointed out the deficiencies of both the Neyman\u2013Pearsonian and the Fisherian methods.[1]/nAfter 1968, Basu began writing polemical essays, which provided paradoxes to frequentist statistics, and which produced great discussion in statistical journals and at statistical meetings. Particularly stimulating papers were Basu's papers on the foundations of survey sampling.[13] There is an extensive literature discussing Basu's problem of estimating the weight of the elephants at a circus with an enormous bull elephant named Jumbo, which Basu used to illustrate his objections to the Horvitz\u2013Thompson estimator[14][15] and to Fisher's randomisation test.[16]/nBasu taught at the Indian Statistical Institute and various universities around the world. He moved to the United States and taught statistics at Florida State University from 1975 to 1990 when he was made an emeritus professor; he has supervised six PhD students.[17] In 1979 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[18]/nBasu's main articles are reprinted with his comments in Basu, D.

He wrote the first Czech text on calculus and is credited for discovering the first seven Carmichael numbers in 1885./n\u0160imerka was born on 20 December 1819 in Vysok\u00e9 Vesel\u00ed in Bohemia to a family of coopers of businessman Petr \u0160imerka and his wife Terezie. After attending school in Ji\u010d\u00edn, he studied in the University of Prague's Faculty of Philosophy from 1839 to 1841. There, he studied mathematics under Jakob Philipp Kulik and astronomy under and practical geometry under Adam Bittner and also obligatory teaching of religion, philosophy, mathematics, Latin philology, natural science, physics, moral philosophy and history. After graduating in Prague, \u0160imerka studied in the Theological Seminary in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. \u0160imerka was ordained on 25 July 1845 and then became a chaplain in \u017dlunice near Ji\u010d\u00edn.[1] He only spent a short time being a chaplain in \u017dlunice as he gave up his appointment after disagreements with the pastor there.[2] In 1852, after passing the mathematics teacher qualification exam, he went to Prague to study physics under F. A. Pet\u0159ina. When he passed the physics qualification exam, he became a substitute teacher at the Piarist gymnasium in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice but did not attain a permanent appointment there. In 1862, \u0160imerka requested to return to spiritual administration and then was appointed became parish priest in Slatina nad Zdobnic\u00ed and then became a priest in Vra\u0148any from 1866 until 1886. He died in Praska\u010dka on 26 December 1887./nIn 1858, his work Die Perioden der quadratischen Zahlformen bei negativen Determinanten was published in the reports of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. The same journal published his article L\u00f6sungen zweier Arten von Gleichungen a year later. In 1862, the Royal Czech Society published P\u0159isp\u011bvky k neur\u010dit\u00e9 analytice, his contributions to indeterminate analytics.  His Die rationalen Dreiecke which deals with the diophantine problem of rational triangles was published in the Archiv der Mathematik und Physik in 1869[3] and is one of \u0160imerka's known contributions to the theory of factoring.[4]/n\u0160imerka is known for Algebra, \u010dili, po\u010dt\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed obecn\u00e9 pro vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed gymnasia, his textbook on algebra published in 1863.  Considered as his most important work, his algebra textbook for middle schools was published in three editions.[5] The book's appendix giving an introduction to differential and integral calculus was published separately in 1864 under the title P\u0159\u00eddavek k algebra, intended for the more inquisitive students. It is considered the first Czech text on calculus.[4] \u0160imerka's calculus text presented differential calculus without using the concepts of limits and continuity. His use of differentials is similar to the infinitesimal approach of 17th and 18th century mathematicians. The calculus text focused on explaining the basic knowledge and intuition to teach students to use mathematics in practical tasks.[6]/n\u0160imerka was influenced by Johann Friedrich Herbart in his philosophical writings, having referred to the said philosopher in the introduction to his work S\u00edla p\u0159esv\u011bd\u010den\u00ed. Pocus v duchovn\u00ed mechanice (originally published in \u010casopis pro p\u011bstov\u00e1n\u00ed mathematiky a fysiky in 1881, then translated into German in 1883 as Die Kraft der \u00dcberzeugung. Ein mathematisch-philosophischer Versuch). In this work, \u0160imerka set out to indicate the strength of one's belief using numbers between 0 and 1, where a belief of value 0 is an empty mind, increasing to a hunch, then conjecture then hypothesis then ultimately to necessary knowledge for a belief of value 1. \u0160imerka is quoted to have said \"The imperfection of human belief is equal to the product of ignorance of its reasons\" (translated from Czech),[7] which arose from his calculations dealing with strength of belief in his 1881 paper. Other results from this paper include \"When two conflicting beliefs collide, the weaker suffers more than the stronger\" and  \"The double impact of two counterarguments damages conviction more than the single impact of their consequence\".[8] This work was a forerunner of the theory of subjective probability, pre-dating Ramsey's (1931) and Bruno de Finetti's (1937) work on the subject. Due to this, \u0160imerka was the first Czech mathematician to apply of mathematics in psychology.[6]/nIn 1885, he enumerated the first seven Carmichael numbers, from 561 to 8911, in Zbytky z arithmetick\u00e9 posloupnosti.[9] This was years before Alwin Korselt's criterion hinted at their existence in 1899 and also before Robert Daniel Carmichael's popularized first example in 1912.", "31600984": "Erik Gustav Elfving (25 June 1908 \u2013 25 March 1984) was a Finnish mathematician and statistician. He wrote pioneering works in mathematical statistics, especially on the design of experiments.[1]/nErik Gustav Elfving was son of Fredrik Elfving (1854\u20131942), a professor of botany at the University of Helsinki,[2] and Thyra Elfving (n\u00e9e Ingman).[1] He was the youngest of four children.[1] Gustav Elfving earned excellent grades at the Svenska normallyceum i Helsingfors, a Helsinki  gymnasium for Swedish-speaking boys, from which he graduated in 1926.[3] In the same year he enrolled at the University of Helsinki, planning to major in astronomy. He switched to mathematics, graduating in 1930 in mathematics, with astronomy and physics as minor subjects. From 1927 to 1929, he worked as a computational assistant at the astronomical observatory of\nthe University of Helsinki.[4] He studied probability theory under J. W. Lindeberg,[2] who is now known for Lindeberg's condition for the central limit theorem.[5][1] He wrote his (1934) dissertation  under the supervision of Rolf Nevanlinna;[2] his thesis studied Riemann surfaces and their uniformization.[6] In the Nevanlinna theory of the values of meromorphic functions, Elfving's results  were praised by Drasin.[1][7]/nElfving was engaged to a young woman, who died in 1935, probably from tuberculosis. The grieving parents of his fianc\u00e9e helped Elfving contact the Danish Geodetic Institute, which hired him as the mathematician for a cartographic expedition\nto Western Greenland in the summer of 1935.[6] Elfving was photographed while he made theodolite measurements and peered from a tent.[4] Heavy rains forced the expedition to remain sheltered in their tents for three days, during which Elfving started to think about the best locations to take measurements for least squares estimation.[8]/nIn statistics, Elfving did research in the design of experiments, probability theory, and statistical inference, as well as applications./nIn statistics, Elfving is known as one of the founders of the modern theory of the optimal design of experiments.[1][2][9] While accompanying a surveying expedition to western Greenland, extended and intense rains left Elving with three days in his tent, during which time he considered the best locations of observations to estimate parameters of linear models.[2][8][9] Elfving's ideas appeared in his paper on the optimal design of experiments for estimating linear models. This paper also introduced concepts from convex geometry, including \"Elfving sets\"[10] and Elfving's theorem.[11][12]  Being symmetric, Elfving sets are formed by the union of a set and its reflection through the origin, \u2212S\u00a0\u222a\u00a0S.[13][14][15] According to Chernoff (1999, p.\u00a0204), Elfving was generous in crediting others' results: His paper in the Cram\u00e9r-festschrift acknowledged unpublished notes of L. J. Savage; Elfving was a referee for the fundamental paper on optimal designs by Kiefer and Wolfowitz.[16][17]/nAs a Professor at the University of Helsinki, Elfving was responsible for writing Finnish language texts, which were used for decades. In his texts and reviews, Elfving emphasized the decision-theoretic foundations of statistics, following Neyman, Pearson, and Wald, and recognized the value of Bayesian methods in statistics and also in operations research.[18] Elfving introduced the statistical symbol for probabilistic independence \u22a5\u22a5, which is a stronger condition than orthogonality \u22a5, by the 1950s.[19]/nElfving made notable contributions in many fields. In mathematics, he did research in complex analysis and probability theory (particularly Markov and point processes). In statistical theory, his most influential work was in optimal design, but he also worked in sampling theory,[20]\npsychometrics, applied statistics, and the decision sciences (including decision theory, game theory, and Bayesian statistics). He also contributed to mathematics education by writing textbooks, book reviews, and popular science. He wrote papers and a book on the history of mathematics.[1]/nHe also supervised many students. Elja Arjas is known for his work on inference on stochastic processes and reliability theory, as well as for his supervision of Esa Nummelin and Hannu Oja.[21] Johann Fellman has studied optimal designs for nonsingular or nondifferentiable information functions as well economic theory, and genetics (particularly the frequency of twin births) and for his supervision of Kenneth Nordstr\u00f6m and Katarina Juselius.[22][23]/nDuring 1938\u20131945, Elfving worked as a lecturer at the Helsinki University of Technology.\nDuring the academic year 1946\u20131947, Elfving served as locum tenens professor at Stockholm University. In 1948 Elfving became a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Helsinki succeeding Lars Ahlfors, who had moved to Harvard University. Elfving visited William Feller at Cornell University in 1949 and 1950. He was an invited plenary speaker at the Third Berkeley Symposium on Probability and Mathematical Statistics in 1955. That same year, he visited Columbia University in the Spring, at the invitation of Theodore W. Anderson, Herbert Robbins, and Herbert Solomon. He visited Solomon again at Stanford University during the fall of 1960 and the spring of 1966.[1]/nHe was elected as a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 1955 and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute in 1963. Elfving was elected as a foreign member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1974, the same year that he was elected to the Royal Statistical Society.[24] He served on the editorial boards of three international journals: Probability Theory and Related Fields (1962\u20131975), The Annals of Mathematical Statistics (1964\u20131967), and Mathematica Scandinavica (1953\u20131972).[1] Elfving had a deep sense of honor and propriety: When he resigned from the editorial boards following decades of service, he requested that he not be sent complimentary issues of the journals; when he failed to accomplish high levels of research, he offered to return the funding to the granting agency.[24]/nAt the University of Helsinki from 1964 to 1975, Elfving acted as the \"inspector\" of the \u00c5bo Nation, a Swedish-speaking \"nation\" at the University of Helsinki.[19] In Finnish and Swedish universities, \"nations\" are  student associations with similarities to fraternities or cooperatives; the inspector is a highly respected university officer, usually a senior professor, who officiates and delivers addresses at formal functions.", "340313": "Ludwig Immanuel Magnus (March 15, 1790 \u2013 September 25, 1861) was a German Jewish mathematician who, in 1831, published a paper about the inversion transformation, which leads to inversive geometry./nHis reputation as a mathematician was established by 1834 and an honorary doctorate conferred on him by the University of Bonn.

He was the son of Elisha Ruggles and Mary Clap who also parented six other children: Nathaniel, Micah, Henry, Charles, James, and Lucy.  William was the second youngest child in his family. Not much is known about his childhood growing up in Massachusetts until he enrolled in Brown University; where he later graduated from, at the age of twenty-three, in the class of 1820. Two years after graduating from Brown University, Ruggles became a tutor at Columbian College.  On February 9, 1821 Congress chartered Columbian College, a nonsectarian school but with Baptist sponsorship that would not become the George Washington University until January 23, 1904. In 1824, two years after he became a tutor, Ruggles became a Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, a position he would retain until 1865. In 1827 William Ruggles became the chair of both mathematics and natural philosophy. In 1865 Ruggles was made professor emeritus.  He continued to lecture on political economy and civil polity from 1865 to 1874. He  died at Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey, on Monday, September 10, 1877, five days after his eightieth birthday.[1][2]/nRuggles was a man of many admirable characteristics including loyalty, conscientiousness, and morality, which are shown not only through the words of those who describe him but through his actions as well. The best example of William Ruggles' loyalty was shown in his dedication to the Columbian College itself. Until 1985, no person had a longer stay at the George Washington University. Ruggles came to the George Washington University in 1822 and stayed until his death, a record at the time, of fifty-five and a half years, which has only been surpassed once by Elmer Louis Kayser who came to the university as a student in 1914 and stayed until his eventual death in 1985. William Ruggles was involved at the Columbian College (George Washington University) from almost the beginning of the Columbian College. He lived through the drab years of 1826 through 1842 where mounting debt and pressure threatened to shut down the Columbian College and rejoiced harder than anyone when that debt was lifted. He served under the first six presidents of the institution and even served as acting president three times. He saw a large student body dwindle down to a handful of students due to the US civil war. Since the college buildings were being used as a hospital in the war efforts, classes were taught in the homes of professors. Lastly, Professor Ruggles had the enjoyment of being a contemporary to University President Welling./nRuggles was the owner of over thirty historical and archival books which are now located in the Gelman Library Archives at George Washington University.  The subjects include theology, philosophy, psychology, economics, mathematics (algebra and geometry), and chemistry, all of which Ruggles either taught or was passionate about./nRuggles was described by President Welling, the second president of the George Washington University:/nWhen the Board was tardy in paying salaries or when it embarked on some policy he opposed, his resignation was always forthcoming .... A member of no religious denomination, but dealing almost exclusively with Baptists, he observed on the basis of attitudes, that he was perhaps the better Christian .... [he was] a man of great conscientiousness, high intelligence and blameless character. His excellent portrait in the University collection suggests a very wise man who perhaps was not always loved but who was respected./nThe Board of Trustees, in adopting resolutions in appreciation of his services, declared Ruggles in similar words to Welling, saying, \"We hereby testify and record our exulted sense of the virtues which adorned his private character, the unselfish zeal he brought to the performance of all his duties and the inestimable value of the manifold and multiform services which he rendered to the College during the long period of his connection with its history.\"/nWilliam Ruggles was noted for his generous contributions to charities and missionary bequests. His accomplishments and contributions were honored and recognized when he received an honorary LL.D. from Brown University in 1852, the same school that he graduated from more than thirty years prior/nUpon reviewing letters that Ruggles had written, it can be seen that he was full of charity towards his students. While he may be described as someone who was \"not always loved but who was always respected,\" it can be seen that Ruggles did have great affection towards the students he taught.  On November 24, 1837, Ruggles wrote a letter to Joel R. Poinsett about the character of a young man named John D. Kuntz, who was expecting to make appointment as a cadet at West Point Military Academy. In the letter Ruggles goes on to praise the young boy and even go as far as to call him, \"a young man of sound principles.\" William Ruggles' folders were filled with many such letters, expressing his kind opinions on the young students that he respected and cared for. Although it is noted that Ruggles was a man of spirit, he was a member of no religion despite the fact that he dealt almost exclusively with the Baptist church. Ruggles shared very many correspondences with Reverend Elon Galusha with letters dating from November 1825 all the way until April 1832, while it is unclear what the two wrote about it clear that these letters dealt with Ruggles faith. In a letter preserved to a different Reverend, Ruggles states that,/n\"Oh, whatever else is taken from me, may I have a share in the great inheritance purchased by Jesus Christ for those who love him and are regenerated by the Holy Spirit!\"/nAlthough William Ruggles died 1877, a reprint of his obituary appeared in the Faculty Newsletter volume 2, number 1, Spring 1965 as part of a series of called GW Footnotes.  It was titled the 55-Year Professor and was the first in a series of anecdotes from the university's past written by the university historian./nThe Ruggles Prizes are awarded annually for excellence in mathematics to a candidate for a bachelor's degree. The prizes were initiated in 1859, and consists of two gold medals. They are awarded \"upon examination to the best two scholars in Mathematics.\"[3]", "6893920": "Clifford Henry Taubes (born February 21, 1954)[1] is the William Petschek Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University and works in gauge field theory, differential geometry, and low-dimensional topology.

This fact improved mathematicians' understanding of the topology of symplectic four-manifolds./nMore recently (in Taubes 2007), by using Seiberg\u2013Witten Floer homology as developed by Peter Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka  together with some new estimates on the spectral flow of Dirac operators and some methods from Taubes 2000, Taubes proved the longstanding Weinstein conjecture for all three-dimensional contact manifolds, thus establishing that the Reeb vector field on such a manifold always has a closed orbit. Expanding both on this and on the equivalence of the Seiberg\u2013Witten and Gromov invariants, Taubes has also proven (in a long series of preprints, beginning with Taubes 2008 harvnb error: no target: CITEREFTaubes2008 (help)) that a contact 3-manifold's embedded contact homology is isomorphic to a version of its Seiberg\u2013Witten Floer cohomology.

He was baptised one day later at the local church as evidenced by an extract from the register of baptisms for Mihalj \u0160ilobod, located at the parish in Podgra\u0111e Podoki\u0107ko.[1][2]/nAndrija \u0160ilobod was then a prominent senior member of the Karlovac Military Generalate of the Slunj regiment. From 1735 to 1739, Andrija participated in military operations against the Turks, as was required by the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia. Mihalj's brother, Ivan (Johan) \u0160ilobod, was also a soldier in the Slunj infantry. Andrija and Ivan were awarded nobility by Queen Maria Theresa of Austria in 1758 for their military services in the Croatian Military Frontier in 1741.[3]/nMihalj was initially schooled at the Jesuit school in Samobor, Zagreb. Later, he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and continued further education in theology at the University of Bologna.[1][4] Once he finished university in 1747, he went to work as a chaplain in the towns of Tuhlje and Ivanec, in what is now Hrvatsko Zagorje. He pioneered literacy efforts for the low-income Croatian community in a number of parishes, making him a standout even in that very deprived region.[2]/nIn 1751, \u0160ilobod was appointed pastor in Martinska Ves near Sisak. In 1783, he renovated the dilapidated local parish church at Sv. Nedelja, which was formerly in the care of the Erd\u00f6dy family. These works included raising the walls, naves and sanctuaries, adding a new sacristy, paining the main altar painted, and arranging a tomb for the pastors in which he is also buried.[5][1] The big clock on the church tower (horologium) drew special attention and praise from the monarchy, which he created and placed himself.[5] Additionally, he commissioned the construction of the Sveti Rok brick choir, which is still in use today.[2]/nIn the same period, while he served in Sv. Nedjelja, he particularly advocated for the construction of the first public school in Sveti Martin pod Oki\u0107em in 1761, the neighboring parish of where he was born. Mihalj's father Andreas bought from the land for this school from the Catholic Church and, with the assistance of the Zrinski family, transferred the ownership to his son Mihalj.[1] Mihalj drew out the plans for the school and raised enough money to pay for the building's stone foundations and half of the bottom story during his lifetime; however, after his passing, his successors were unable to gather enough money to continue building. Had Mihael lived long enough to see the project through, the school would have been the first post-war public institution of learning in rural Croatia. Nevertheless, the uncompleted structure did not go to waste and in January 1867, it housed its first class of pupils.[2] The elementary school (O\u0160 Mihaela \u0160iloboda) still retains Mihalj's namesake to this day.[5]/nHe died in Sveta Nedelja on 4 April 1787 and was buried in one of the tombs in Sv. Nedjelja.[5] In his life, Mihalj was pious and never used the acquired nobility in his title or professional career. In fact, his father Andrija claimed that the priest signed all of his documents with the simple name \"M. \u0160ilobod\" out of a desire for humility and to avoid the privileges and trappings of nobility. In Arithmetika Horvatzka, he uses both his birth and baptismal surname, \u0160ilobod, and his second (\"different\") last name, Bol\u0161i\u0107, to honour the feminine lineage of his family tree, which originated with his grandmother and had a profound impact on his life's social orientation. Many people from Hrvatsko Zagorje and Sisak Posavina, as well as Catholic Church leaders and a high-ranking military delegation from the Slunj Regiment, were documented as having travelled to Sv. Nedelja for the burial.[2][5]/n\u0160ilobod wrote mainly in Latin and Croatian. In addition to his main works, he also wrote various poems and songs, primary in Latin.[1][6][7] His major publications include:/n\u0160ilobod was the editor of the third edition of the Cithara Octochord Collection (1751), according to musicological study. This edition represents a form of restoration intervention in the Zagreb church's liturgical-musical programme. CO's greatest creative worth and innovation are hymnic forms with innovative text and music content, in which \u0160ilobod undoubtedly played an active role as a poet, musician, and composer.[9]/nAfter moving into the rural countryside and immersing himself in the local culture he began compiling traditional songs and hymns that had been passed down orally until then. He gathered a treasury of songs, and published them in Zagreb under Zbirka Crkvenih Pjesama (\"Collection of Church Songs;\" 1757), a book with almost 300 pages of unlicensed sheet music.[2]/nHis best known work, Arithmetika Horvatzka (1758), written in the vernacular Kajkavian dialect of Croatian language, established a complete system of arithmetic terminology in Croatian, and vividly used examples from everyday life in Croatia to present mathematical operations.[10] \u0160ilobod drew inspiration for his arithmetic handbook from a variety of sources, including the classic arithmetic handbook by Italian author Giuseppe Maria Figatelli.[1] It was published 1758 in Zagreb, divided in four parts and signed as Mihalj \u0160ilobod-Bol\u0161i\u0107, as appropriate to the Kajkavian dialect.[1][6][7]/nPublic education in the Habsburg Monarchy was not institutionalised until the middle of the 18th century. The teaching service was sometimes done by municipally assigned teachers, and sometimes by parish priests. Students were taught to read and write, but it wasn't until the middle of the 18th century that they were also taught to count. Calculus textbooks were only available in foreign languages at the time, and the subject had to be taught in Croatian. The textbook's creation was prompted by a desire to uplift the material conditions of the local people through education. Mihalj identified that there was a severe lack of accounting skills in local organisers who struggled to handle even the most basic financial and business calculations.[1] As the contemporary Croatian mathematician Mate Zoricic describes: \"This is the main evil and the cause of poverty and misery in the people, and while foreigners, knowing the calculation, come to Dalmatia and get rich in a short time, sometimes it is not enough for our people even to nutrition.\" Thus, the book was written for a wide range of people who were literate but could not read Latin, such as business people, hosts, and anyone else who might need an account. Because of this, it is full of examples from real-world situations. In addition, it consistently demonstrates how one currency may be exchanged for another by pointing out the conversion of currencies and assigning activities in which Groschen and Kreuzer occur together.[8]/nThe general structure of Arithmetika Horvatzka adapted the structure and presentation style of similarly utilitarian books from the same time period: The first section of \u0160ilobod's manual covers the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), the second section covers all operations with fractions, the third section covers the simple and complex rule of three, and the fourth section covers real-world business applications (such as accounts, debts, profits and losses, and mix calculus). This fourth section also includes some additional in-depth explanations, puzzles and riddles, presumably aimed at students who have previously demonstrated an adequate grasp of the material presented in sections one through three. One of the puzzles, for example, states: Two fathers and two sons once hunted three rabbits, and each of them liked one rabbit. How can that be? Explanation: He had to be father, son and son's son, i.e. grandson. So two fathers and two sons each have a rabbit.\"Silobod hoped that including riddles in his book would make the material more engaging and readable for the general public.\"[1][8]  Tables of various uses are presented on the final 36 pages of the book that are not numbered. Knowledge of fundamental accounting and all accounts that emerge in real life, especially in commerce, were regarded as essential learning.[1] The book's content, explanations and exercises serve their intended function by including the computation of mixes and other calculations that are part of everyday economic mathematics.[8]/nSince the guidebook was the first to be written in Croatian language, this is the first appearance of any Croatian mathematical terms. Although it was clear that \u0160ilobod had made use of words that were in dictionaries, this was clearly insufficient for his purposes. On the other hand, dictionaries lacked entries for the more advanced mathematical terminology since they were not commonly utilised. Because of this, \u0160ilobod realised he was up against an enormous challenge: his handbook would be the first documented record of the preexisting mathematical language in the Kaikavian region. For this reason, he would have had to modify existing dictionary terms, especially that found in J. Belloszt\u00e9ncz's lexicon. Later, he would have had to create the terminology he need, drawing on the origins of existing words with overlapping meanings from the Kaikavian dialect of Croatian. Evidently, he had made up some names by adapting Latin terminology to Kaikavian use.[1]/nFundamentum cantus Gregoriani seu chroralis is considered to be his second most famous publication. It delves into musical-Gregorian melodic principles. It is divided into six dialogues in which they discuss: the birth of music or singing (dialogue one); drawing, notes, and clefs (dialogue two); solmization (dialogue three); intervals (dialogue four); genuine and plagal tones (dialogue five); and intonation (dialogue six). For over a century, this handbook was utilised as a liber textus in the Zagreb seminary.[9][11] As of today, this work is still studied in the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome and is considered a great theoretical guide to choral singing even after a century has passed.[1]/nBecause it was the first appearance of the systematically utilised Croatian mathematical vocabulary, \u0160ilobod's Arithmatika Horvatzka has had enormous cultural value in Croatia. In addition, the manual played a crucial part in the education in Croatian people at a time when there was a pressing need to increase students' understanding of accounting's function in business and economics.[1]/nEven a century after his death, the famous phrase that Arithmetika printed at the time had a huge resonance among the people \"Ak ne bu\u0161 u\u010dil matematiku i\u0161el bu\u0161 k \u0160ilobodu da te podu\u010di!\" (\"If you didn't teach mathematics, you went to \u0160ilobod to teach you!\") \u2013 is still prevalent.[5] His name has entered several other idioms, especially among Kajkavians. For example, it has long been customary to encourage anybody who calculates incorrectly to pray to \u0160ilobod, and when someone wishes to brag about successfully counting or multiplying, they may playfully add, \"It would be the same with \u0160ilobod.\"[8]/nHrvatska po\u0161ta issued a commemorative stamp in 2008, celebrating 250 years since the publishing of Arithmatika Horvatzka.[7] Irena Mi\u0161urac Zorica concluded in her analysis of the work that Mihalj \u0160ilobod Bol\u0161i\u0107 demonstrated a very high pedagogical and methodical maturity, creating a standard for further development of mathematics curriculum and education.[12]/nIn addition to the stamp, a scientific symposium was organised in Sveta Nedjelja to honour Mihalj \u0160ilobod Bol\u0161i\u0107. It was the first scientific conference honouring the priest and teacher who is revered in Kajkavian culture. The Samobor Museum produced a book in 2009 that included the writings of the seven people who had taken part in the scientific meeting: Ph.D. Stjepan Razum, prof. Domagoj Sremi, prof. Ph.D. Alojz Jembriha, M.Sc. sc.  Irena Mi\u0161urac Zorica, Ph.D. Zvonimir Jakobovi, M.Sc. sc. Marijane Bori, and Ph.D. Katarina Koprek. These writings help provide light on the life and accomplishments of Mihalj, an important figure in the spread of mathematics education in the 18th century. To celebrate the event, the Museum issued a reproduction of the entire Arithmatika Horvatzka in separate volumes, and the collection includes a transcription of \u0160ilobod's prologue to the work in its appendix.[13]", "20754801": "B\u00f8rge Christian Jessen (19 June 1907 \u2013 20 March 1993) was a Danish mathematician best known for his work in analysis, specifically on the Riemann zeta function, and in geometry, specifically on Hilbert's third problem./nJessen was born on 19 June 1907 in Copenhagen to Hans Jessen and Christine Jessen (n\u00e9e Larsen).

Pogue Municipal Airport[b] in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, was named in Pogue's honor in 1974.[54] The Oklahoma Aviation and Space Museum awarded him the Clarence E. Page Memorial Trophy for \"making significant and ongoing contributions to the U.S. aviation industry\" in February 1989.[55] Page died eight days before the award was presented and Pogue used most of his speech to memorialize Page's life.[55] Pogue was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from Oklahoma Baptist University in 1974.[56] Pogue received the City of New York gold medal[36] and the General Thomas D. White USAF Space Trophy for the same year.[57]/nPogue has been inducted into three halls of fame. He was inducted into the Five Civilized Tribes Hall of Fame in 1975,[58] and was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame in 1980.[59] Pogue was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.[60] As a member of the USAF Thunderbirds, he won the Air Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.[61]/nThis article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.", "52605326": "Vincenzo Amato (2 June 1881 in Taranto \u2013 2 March 1963 in Catania) was an Italian mathematician./n/nThis article about an Italian mathematician is a stub.

After the war, in the spring of 1919, Nielsen married Carola von Pieverling, a German medical doctor./nIn 1920 Nielsen took a position at the Technical University of Breslau. The next year he published a paper in Mathematisk Tidsskrift in which he proved that any subgroup of a finitely generated free group is free. In 1926 Otto Schreier would generalize this result by removing the condition that the free group be finitely generated; this result is now known as the Nielsen\u2013Schreier theorem.  Also in 1921 Nielsen moved to the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen, where he would stay until 1925, when he moved to the Technical University in Copenhagen.  \nHe also proved the Dehn\u2013Nielsen theorem on mapping class groups./nNielsen was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.[2]/nDuring World War II some efforts were made to bring Nielsen to the United States as it was feared that he would be assaulted by the Nazis. Nielsen would, in fact, stay in Denmark during the war without being harassed by the Nazis./nIn 1951 Nielsen became professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, taking the position vacated by the death of Harald Bohr.

He is known for work on logic, astronomy, education and horsemanship, as well as for translations from the Italian. His interests were both wide-ranging and directed towards practical ends, and he adapted freely a number of the works he translated./nHe was a pioneer writer in English in several areas, and inventor of a standard classroom geometrical instrument, the protractor./nHe lived as a country gentleman on his estate at Newton Flotman, in Norfolk. He inherited from his father Edward Blundeville in 1568, having possibly studied at the University of Cambridge.[1]/nHe had connections with court circles, and London scientific intellectuals. He was an associate of Henry Briggs, at Gresham College, and enjoyed the patronage of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, among other aristocrats.[2]/nOther indications on his life are more tenuous. It has been plausibly suggested that as \"T. B.\" he added a prefatory poem to John Studley's Agamemnon;[3] he was certainly alluded to by Jasper Heywood, in the preface to his Thyestes of 1560, as a translator of Plutarch.[1] From this it is argued that he had connection to the Inns of Court. He may have travelled to Italy, an inference from his familiarity with Italian literature. He was a mathematics tutor, to households including that of Nicholas Bacon and Francis Wyndham; and Cecil may have recommended Blundeville to Leicester.[4][5] W. W. Rouse Ball gives a date of death of 1595, and possible connections to mathematicians: \"Thomas Blundeville was resident at Cambridge about the same time as Dee and Digges\u2014possibly he was a non-collegiate student, and if so must have been one of the last of them.\"[6]/nHe married twice, and his male heir Andrew was killed in the Flemish wars.[1] His daughter Elizabeth married Rowland Meyrick, son of Sir Gelli Meyrick who was steward to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex and caught up in his fall.[7]/nHe made a partial verse translation of the Moralia of Plutarch, to which Roger Ascham added verses.[8] It appeared as Three Moral Treatises in 1561, his first work, to mark the accession of Elizabeth I, to whom one of the pieces was dedicated. Another was dedicated to the courtiers John Harington and John Astley.[9]/nHis book on horsemanship, The arte of ryding and breakinge greate horses, was published about 1560 and is the first work on equitation published in English. It is an abridged and adapted translation, made at the suggestion of John Astley, of Gli ordini di cavalcare by Federico Grisone, and is directed towards the use of horses in war.[10][11] He followed it with The fower chiefyst offices belonging to Horsemanshippe (1565\u20136), which included a revised translation of Grisone together with other treatises.[12] It was praised as \"Xenophontean\" by Gabriel Harvey.[13]/nHis expressed views on history are considered standard for Elizabethan England.[14] The approach is causal, invoking the \"meanes and instrumentes\" of history, and mechanism in politics.[15] Influentially, he compromised between \"linear\" (traditional Christian medieval) and \"cyclic\" (classical) overall views of the working-out of history, for a \"spiral\" model. For him, the providential is not incompatible with the moral order as it asserts itself in the details of exemplary political history, and he has been compared to Edmund Bolton in combining the medieval and humanist traditions.[16][17] He commented that to be a good historiographer is a prerequisite for a counsellor, in his 1570 book on counsel.[18]/nHis True Order and Methode was dedicated to the Earl of Leicester and was a loose translation and summary of historiographical works by Jacopo Aconcio and Francesco Patrizzi. It endorsed the realist writing of history as process, and was one of the few English contributions of the period to the artes historicae.[19][20] He translated also a manuscript of Aconcio on fortification, for the Earl of Bedford.[21]/nHis Arte of Logike (written 1575, published 1599) is somewhat Ramist in approach, but strongly so in discussing method.[22] Besides Aristotle, it also shows the influence of Galen, Melanchthon, the De Methodo of Aconcio of 1558, and Thomas Wilson.[23]/nIt contains a section on fallacies. Under petitio principii, it uses an even-handed example of Aristotelian and Copernican arguments on the motion of the Earth.[24]/nThese later works are directed towards geography, navigation and travel, geography in Blundeville's view being a necessary support to history; their content is very mixed.[25]/nThe Exercises (1594) collected six treatises on practical skills, with a serious effort to be up-to-date. One of the parts described the world map of Petrus Plancius, published two years earlier. Other topical matters covered were Molyneux's globes, the work of John Blagrave and Gemma Frisius, and the cross-staff of Thomas Hood.[26] According to Rouse Ball:/nIn 1594 he published his Exercises in six parts, containing a brief account of arithmetic, cosmography, the use of the globes, a universal map, the astrolabe, and navigation. The arithmetic is taken from Recorde, but to it are added trigonometrical tables (copied from Clavius) of the natural sines, tangents, and secants of all angles in the first quadrant; the difference between consecutive angles being one minute. These are worked out to seven places of decimals. This is the earliest English work in which plane trigonometry is introduced.[6]/nA later edition (1613) showed the circumnavigations of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish.[27]/nHe collaborated on an astronomy book, The Theoriques of the Seuen Planets (1602), assisted by Lancelot Browne as he notes in the preface.[28] It contained also information about the recent research of William Gilbert on the Earth's magnetic field, which he included with help from Edward Wright and Henry Briggs. Wright had earlier supplied some of the innovative material for his writing on navigation in the Exercises. He had worked with William Barlow and others on the required scientific instruments; according to Hill Blundeville invented the protractor.[2] In fact he described a semicircular instrument for measuring angles in 1589, in his Briefe Description of Universal Mappes and Cardes.[29]", "24687007": "Jen\u0151 Elek Egerv\u00e1ry (April 16, 1891 \u2013 November 30, 1958) was a Hungarian mathematician./nEgerv\u00e1ry was born in Debrecen in 1891.

He retired in 1996.[8] He became an honorary research fellow at University College London.[13] He was designated emeritus at London South Bank University in 2020.[8]/nThe power of conjugation ... was the last point I understood; I remember lying awake thinking about it, seeing that I could move any four edges into the working locations and realising that this completed the general method for restoring the cube to its original state./n\u2013David Singmaster, Moral and Mathematical Lessons from a Rubik Cube, New Scientist, 1982/nSingmaster's association with Rubik's Cubes dates from August 1978, when he saw a Cube (at that time a rarity) at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki.[5] Some other mathematicians at the conference, including John Conway and Roger Penrose, already had one.[5]/nSingmaster quickly acquired a Cube (in exchange for a copy of an M. C. Escher book) and was able to solve it by early September 1978.[5] He said that it took him \"two weeks, on and off\" to find a general solution for the Cube.[14] He devised his notation for recording moves (now known as the Singmaster notation) in December 1978.[10] In June 1979 he wrote one of the first articles about the Cube in The Observer newspaper.[15]/nIn October 1979, he self-published his Notes on the \"Magic Cube\".[16] The booklet contained his mathematical analysis of Rubik's Cube, allowing a solution to be constructed using basic group theory.[17] In August 1980 he published an expanded 5th edition of the book retitled as Notes on Rubik's \"Magic Cube\".[16] It included the results of his correspondence with other \"cubologists\", and included details on monotwists, U-flips, Cayley graphs, and wreath products.[17] The book contained his own \"step by step solution\" for the Cube,[18] and it is accepted that he was a pioneer of the general Layer by Layer approach for solving the Cube.[19] If you managed to solve the Cube using his method then Singmaster suggested that you should:/nScream HOORAY!! Buy a round of drinks. Send me a cheque. Tell the orderlies that they can let you out now. Etc. etc.[18]/nThe book also contained a catalogue of pretty patterns including his \"cube in a cube in a cube\" pattern which he had discovered himself \"and was very pleased with\".[20] In 1981, at the height of the Rubik's Cube craze, the book was republished by Penguin Books, with a US edition by Enslow Publishers.[16] There were also Dutch and Spanish translations.[16] He estimated that he sold around 50 to 60\u00a0000 copies of his book.[5] Much of the mathematical content of the book was later reworked by Alexander H. Frey in collaboration with Singmaster to create their Handbook of Cubik Math published in 1982./nSingmaster was described as \"one of the most enthusiastic and prolific promoters of the Cube\".[21] In September 1981 he was said to be devoting \"almost 100%\" of his time to promoting, reporting, marketing and analysing the Cube.[22] He soon began publishing a quarterly newsletter called the Cubic Circular which was published between 1981 and 1985.[5][22]/nSingmaster had one of the world's largest collections of books on recreational mathematics which he had accumulated starting in the late 1970s.[23] In 1996 he reported that the collection contained over 4700 works.[24] He also collected books on cartoons, humour, and language.[5] In 2013 his book collection was reported to be \"nearly 10000 items\".[23] Many of the books were housed in a library added as an extension to Singmaster's study.[23] He had a huge collection of mechanical puzzles, which he started in 2002 containing \"perhaps 3000 puzzles, of which about 400 are about Rubik's Cube and its variants\".[5]/nFrom around 1980 to 1982, he ran his own puzzle company, David Singmaster Ltd, which stocked \"over 100 puzzles and books\".[25] However the venture lost him \"a fair amount of money\" and led to prolonged tax negotiations.[12] He referred to this period of his life as \"a massive overdose of cubism\".[12]/nSingmaster was both a puzzle historian and a composer of puzzles, and he described himself as a \"metagrobologist\". Many of his puzzles appeared in publications such as BBC Focus, Games & Puzzles, the Los Angeles Times, and the Weekend Telegraph.[26] He published a collection of his puzzles in his 2016 book Problems for Metagrobologists.[26] From around 2006 Singmaster was a director at the New York-based Conjuring Arts Research Center, retiring from the position (becoming Director Emeritus) in 2013.[27] He was instrumental in the re-discovery of one of the world's oldest books on puzzles and magic illusions when he came across a reference to the work in a 19th-century manuscript. The recovered text, De viribus quantitatis (English: On The Powers Of Numbers) was penned by Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar who lived around 1500.[28]/nIn combinatorial number theory, Singmaster's conjecture states that there is a finite upper bound on the number of times a number other than 1 can appear in Pascal's triangle. Paul Erd\u0151s suspected that the conjecture is true, but thought it would probably be very difficult to prove. The empirical evidence is consistent with the proposition that the smallest upper bound is\u00a08./nIn November 1981, Singmaster appeared on the scifi-themed BBC puzzle show The Adventure Game.[5] From 1998 to 1999 he was a frequent panelist on the BBC Radio 4 show Puzzle Panel.[5]/nSingmaster was married twice, the second time to Deborah in 1972.

He earned the State Prize of the Latvian SSR in 1980 for his research on nonlinear electronic circuit theory.[3]/nAnother early line of research by Grinbergs at the Computer Center concerned the automated design of ship hulls, and the computations with spline curves and surfaces needed in this design. The goal of this research was to calculate patterns for cutting and then bending flat steel plates so that they could be welded together to form ship hulls without the need for additional machining after the bending step; the methods developed by Grinbergs were later used throughout the Soviet Union.[1][3][4]/nIn graph theory, Grinbergs is best known for Grinberg's theorem, a necessary condition for a planar graph to have a Hamiltonian cycle that has been frequently used to find non-Hamiltonian planar graphs with other special properties.[3][9] His researches in graph theory also concerned graph coloring, graph isomorphism, cycles in directed graphs, and a counterexample to a conjecture of Andr\u00e1s \u00c1d\u00e1m on the number of cycles in tournaments.[3]/nOther topics in Grinbergs' research include Steiner triple systems, magnetohydrodynamics, operations research, and the mathematical modeling of hydrocarbon exploration.[3]", "504326": "Nicholas Constantine Metropolis (Greek: \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039c\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2;[1] June 11, 1915 \u2013 October 17, 1999) was a Greek-American physicist.[2]/nMetropolis received his BSc (1937) and PhD in physics (1941, with Robert Mulliken) at the University of Chicago.

Metropolis received his BSc (1936) and PhD in chemical physics (1941) at the University of Chicago. During his PhD he worked with Robert Mulliken. After graduation, he worked as an instructor at the University of Chicago with James Franck. Shortly afterwards, in 1943, Robert Oppenheimer recruited him from Chicago for the Manhattan Project, where he worked in Harold C. Urey's group. Later he joined University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory and worked under Edward Teller's supervision, who encouraged him to move into theoretical physics. At Los Alamos Metropolis worked together with Richard Feynman on \"electromechanical devices used for hand computations\".[3]/nAfter World War II, he returned to the faculty of the University of Chicago as an assistant professor. He came back to Los Alamos in 1948 to lead the group in the theoretical division that designed and built the MANIAC I computer in 1952 that was modeled on the IAS machine, and the MANIAC II in 1957. (John von Neumann thought this acronym too frivolous;[4] Metropolis claims to have chosen the name \"MANIAC\" in the hope of stopping the rash of such acronyms for machine names, but may have instead further stimulated such use.)[3] From 1957 to 1965 he was a full professor of physics at the University of Chicago and was the founding director of its Institute for Computer Research. In 1965 he returned to Los Alamos, where he was made a laboratory senior fellow in 1980./nAt Los Alamos in the late 1940s and early 1950s a group of researchers led by Metropolis, including John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo method.[5][6] This is a class of computational approaches that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results, named in reference to Ulam's relative's love for the casinos of Monte Carlo. Metropolis was deeply involved in the very first use of the Monte Carlo method, rewiring the ENIAC computer to perform simulations of a nuclear core in 1948.[6] In 1953 Metropolis co-authored a paper entitled Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines.[7] This landmark paper showed the first numerical simulations of a liquid and introduced a new Monte Carlo computational method for doing so./nIn applications of the Monte Carlo method to problems in statistical mechanics prior to the introduction of the Metropolis algorithm, a large number of random configurations of the system would be generated, the properties of interest (such as energy or density) would be computed for each configuration, and then a weighted average computed where the weight of each configuration was its Boltzmann factor, \n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\u2212\nE\n\n/\n\nk\nT\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{-E/kT}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is the energy, \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n is the temperature, and \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n is the Boltzmann constant. The key contribution of the paper was the idea that/nInstead of choosing configurations randomly, then weighting them with exp(\u2212E/kT), we choose configurations with a probability  exp(\u2212E/kT) and weight them evenly./nThe algorithm for generating samples from the Boltzmann distribution was later generalized by W.K. Hastings and has become widely known as the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm./nIn recent years a controversy has arisen as to whether Metropolis actually made significant contributions to the Equation of State Calculations paper.[8]/nMetropolis was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the American Mathematical Society. In 1987 he became the first Los Alamos employee honored with the title \"emeritus\" by the University of California.

He was an avid skier and tennis player until his mid-seventies. He died at a nursing home in Los Alamos, New Mexico.[11]/nIn his memoirs,[12] Stanislaw Ulam remembers that a small group, including himself, Metropolis, Calkin, Konopinski, Kistiakowsky, Teller and von Neumann, spent several evenings at Los Alamos playing poker. They played for very small sums, but: \"Metropolis once described what a triumph it was to win ten dollars from John von Neumann, author of a famous treatise on game theory.

He was a pioneer of computer science and machine translation (MT) in France. An astronomer-turned-computer scientist, he is known for his work on the programming language ALGOL 60, and later for extensive work on the theoretical and practical problems of MT, of which the eponymous Vauquois triangle is one of the most widely-known contributions.[2]/nHe was a professor at what would become the Grenoble Alpes University.[2]/nBernard Vauquois was initially a researcher at French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) from 1952 to 1958 at the Astrophysics Institute of the Meudon Observatory, after completing studies in mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Since 1957, his research program has also focused on methods applied to physics from the perspective of electronic computers, and he has taught programming to physicists. This double interest in astrophysics and electronic computers is reflected in the subject of his thesis and that of the complementary thesis in physical sciences that he defended in 1958./nIn 1960, at 31 years old, he was appointed professor of computer science at the Grenoble University where, with professors Jean Kuntzmann and No\u00ebl Gastinel, he began activities in computer science.

He led the GETA in constructing the first large second-generation system, applied to Russian\u2013French, from 1962 to 1971./nAt the end of this period, the accumulated experience led him to correct some defects of the \"pure\" declarative and interlingual approach, and to use heuristic programming methods, implemented with procedural grammars written in LSPLs (\"specialized languages for linguistic programming\", langages sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s pour la programmation linguistique) that were developed under his direction, and integrated into the ARIANE-78 machine translation system.[4]/nIn 1974, when he cofounded the Leibniz laboratory,[5] he proposed \"multilevel structure descriptors\" (descripteurs de structures multiniveaux) for units larger than sentence translation. This idea, premonitory of later theoretical work (Ray Jackendoff, Gerald Gazdar) is still the cornerstone of all machine translation software built by GETA and the French national TA project./nBernard Vauquois' last contribution was \"static grammar\" (grammaire statique) in 1982\u201383, during the ESOPE project, the preparatory phase of the French national MT project./nHe was a key figure in the field of computational linguistics in France.

His influence is due\nboth to his original contributions to a remarkably broad\nspectrum of mathematical theories, and to the mark \nhe left on mathematical practice and style, through\nsome of his own works as well as through the Bourbaki group, of which he was one of the principal\nfounders./nAndr\u00e9 Weil was born in Paris to agnostic Alsatian Jewish parents who fled the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870\u201371. Simone Weil, who would later become a famous philosopher, was Weil's younger sister and only sibling. He studied in Paris, Rome and G\u00f6ttingen and received his doctorate in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended Carl Ludwig Siegel. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at Aligarh Muslim University in India. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in Hinduism and Sanskrit literature: he had taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.[4][5] After teaching for one year at Aix-Marseille University, he taught for six years at University of Strasbourg. He married \u00c9veline de Possel (n\u00e9e \u00c9veline Gillet) in 1937.[6]/nWeil was in Finland when World War II broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife \u00c9veline returned to France without him. Weil was arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the Winter War on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.[7] Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at Le Havre in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then Rouen. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in Cherbourg. After the fall of France in June 1940, he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where he managed to join his wife \u00c9veline, who had been living in German-occupied France./nIn January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he did not have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. He quit the job at Lehigh and moved to Brazil, where he taught at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo from 1945 to 1947, working with Oscar Zariski. Weil and his wife had two daughters, Sylvie (born in 1942) and Nicolette (born in 1946).[6]/nHe then returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[8] in 1954 in Amsterdam,[9] and in 1978 in Helsinki.[10] Weil was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1966.[1] In 1979, he shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray./nWeil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell\u2013Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel's theorem on integral points).[11] Mordell's theorem had an ad hoc proof;[12] Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach, by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories./nAmong his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions of curves over finite fields,[13] and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). The so-called Weil conjectures were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by Bernard Dwork,[14] Alexander Grothendieck,[15][16][17] Michael Artin, and finally by Pierre Deligne, who completed the most difficult step in 1973.[18][19][20][21][22]/nWeil introduced the adele ring[23] in the late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his Basic Number Theory in 1967).[24] His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann\u2013Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers[25] proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) became known as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikk\u014d conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.[26]/nOther significant results were on Pontryagin duality and differential geometry.[27] He introduced the concept of a uniform space in general topology, as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with Henri Cartan in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also chose the symbol \u2205, derived from the letter \u00d8 in the Norwegian alphabet (which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with), to represent the empty set.[28]/nWeil also made a well-known contribution in Riemannian geometry in his very first paper in 1926, when he showed that the classical isoperimetric inequality holds on non-positively curved surfaces. This established the 2-dimensional case of what later became known as the Cartan\u2013Hadamard conjecture./nHe discovered that the so-called Weil representation, previously introduced in quantum mechanics by Irving Segal and David Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of quadratic forms.[29] This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting representation theory and theta functions./nWeil was a member of both the National Academy of Sciences[30] and the American Philosophical Society.[31]/nWeil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of Bourbaki, before and after World War\u00a0II. He also wrote several books on the history of number theory./nHindu thought had great influence on Weil.[32] He was an agnostic,[33] and he respected religions.[34]/nAsteroid 289085 Andreweil, discovered by astronomers at the Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2004, was named in his memory.[35] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 February 2014 (M.P.C. 87143).[36]/nMathematical works:/nCollected papers:/nAutobiography:/nMemoir by his daughter:", "57487970": "Jean Estelle Hirsh Rubin (October 29, 1926 \u2013 October 25, 2002) was an American mathematician known for her research on the axiom of choice.

He claims that an unnamed superior came and erased the tape. These events contributed to Vall\u00e9e's lifelong interest in the UFO phenomenon. Vall\u00e9e began to correspond with Aim\u00e9 Michel (who would become a key mentor and research collaborator) in 1958./nIn the mid-1960s, like many other UFO researchers, Vall\u00e9e initially attempted to validate the popular Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (or ETH)./nHowever, by 1969, Vall\u00e9e's conclusions had changed, and he publicly stated that the ETH was too narrow and ignored too much data. Vall\u00e9e began exploring the commonalities between UFOs, cults, religious movements, demons, angels, ghosts, cryptid sightings, and psychic phenomena. His speculation about these potential links was first detailed in his third UFO book, Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying Saucers.[4]/nAs an alternative to the extraterrestrial visitation hypothesis, Vall\u00e9e has suggested a multidimensional visitation hypothesis. This hypothesis represents an extension of the ETH where the alleged extraterrestrials could be potentially from anywhere. The entities could be multidimensional beyond space-time; thus they could coexist with humans, yet remain undetected./nVall\u00e9e's opposition to the popular ETH was not well received by prominent U.S. ufologists, hence he was viewed as something of an outcast. Indeed, Vall\u00e9e refers to himself as a \"heretic among heretics\"./nVall\u00e9e's opposition to the ETH theory is summarised in his paper, \"Five Arguments Against the Extraterrestrial Origin of Unidentified Flying Objects\", Journal of Scientific Exploration, 1990:/nScientific opinion has generally followed public opinion in the belief that unidentified flying objects either do not exist (the \"natural phenomena hypothesis\") or, if they do, must represent evidence of a visitation by some advanced race of space travellers (the extraterrestrial hypothesis or \"ETH\"). It is the view of the author that research on UFOs need not be restricted to these two alternatives. On the contrary, the accumulated data base exhibits several patterns tending to indicate that UFOs are real, represent a previously unrecognized phenomenon, and that the facts do not support the common concept of \"space visitors\". Five specific arguments articulated here contradict the ETH:/nVall\u00e9e's ideas about Miracle at Fatima and Marian apparitions are that they are a class of UFO encounters. Vall\u00e9e is one of the first people to speculate publicly about the possibility that the \"solar dance\" at Fatima was a UFO. Vall\u00e9e has also speculated that UFO activity may have caused other religious apparitions, including Our Lady of Lourdes and the revelations of Joseph Smith. Vall\u00e9e believes that religious experiences such as these should be studied outside of their religious contexts.[5][6][7]/nVia professional association with SRI and independent friendships with Harold E. Puthoff and Central Intelligence Agency analyst Kit Green (who obtained a temporary security clearance for him in 1974), Vall\u00e9e was intermittently consulted on classified remote viewing research (including the Stargate Project) throughout the 1970s and 1980s. During the early SRI experiments (led by Puthoff and Russell Targ in conjunction with Green as CIA contract monitor), he became acquainted with Uri Geller, Edgar Mitchell, Charles Mus\u00e8s, Andrija Puharich, Jack Sarfatti, Arthur M. Young, Edwin C. May, Pat Price and Ingo Swann. In 1973, Doubleday editor Bill Whitehead introduced Vall\u00e9e to Ira Einhorn, a close confederate of Puharich; their association would span Vall\u00e9e's business and paranormal networks until Einhorn was charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend in 1979. More recently, he has been associated with Robert Bigelow as a consultant to the National Institute for Discovery Science and a member of the scientific advisory board of Bigelow Aerospace./nIn 1979, Robert Emenegger and Alan Sandler updated their 1974 UFOs: Past, Present, and Future documentary with new 1979 footage narrated by Jacques Vall\u00e9e. The updated version is entitled UFOs: It Has Begun./nVall\u00e9e served as the real-life model for Lacombe, the researcher portrayed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.[8] He also attempted to interest Spielberg in an alternative explanation for the phenomenon. In an interview on Conspire.com, Vall\u00e9e said, \"I argued with him that the subject was even more interesting if it wasn't extraterrestrials. If it was real, physical, but not ET. So he said, 'You're probably right, but that's not what the public is expecting\u00a0\u2014 this is Hollywood and I want to give people something that's close to what they expect.'\"[9]/nEpisode \"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\" of X-Files which aired on April 12, 1996 had fake alien pilots named Jacques Sheaffer and Robert Vallee. According to Robert Sheaffer this was a joke by the X-Files creator Chris Carter to name the characters after Vallee and Sheaffer. Sheaffer further states that \"the M.P. who later arrested them [the characters] was Sgt. Hynek\", a reference to ufologist J.

From 1879 to 1882 he studied at the Technical University of Munich under Felix Klein and Alexander von Brill and in 1881 at the University of Leipzig. In 1881 he received his Promotion (PhD) in Munich in mathematics with a thesis \u00dcber Involutionen auf ebenen Curven (On involutions on plane curves) under the supervision of Ludwig Seidel. In Karlsruhe in 1882 he passed the state examination for secondary school teachers. He was from 1882 to 1883 a Lehramtspraktikant (teaching trainee) at the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe and from 1882 to 1883 his father's assistant at the Polytechnische Schule Karlsruhe. In 1885 Hermann Wiener habilitated at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg with a thesis Rein geometrische Theorie der Darstellung bin\u00e4rer Formen durch Punktgruppen auf der Geraden (Purely geometrical theory of the representation of binary forms by point groups on the line).

(1892). Wiener proposed that geometry be studied without using visual images, but rather by abstract axiomatic methods. He also joined his father in the creation of mathematical models of geometric surfaces, constructed from plaster and wire.[1]/nHe was elected in 1895 a member of the German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina) and was appointed in 1907 Geheimer Hofrat (Court Councillor).[4]", "46805636": "Paul Richard Halmos (Hungarian: Halmos P\u00e1l; March 3, 1916 \u2013 October 2, 2006) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician and statistician who made fundamental advances in the areas of mathematical logic, probability theory, statistics, operator theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis (in particular, Hilbert spaces). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of The Martians.[1]/nBorn in Hungary into a Jewish family, Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the Champaign\u2013Urbana campus; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,[2] he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. Joseph L. Doob supervised his dissertation, titled Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems.[3]/nShortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the Institute for Advanced Study, lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under John von Neumann, which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces, which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.[4]/nFrom 1967 to 1968 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin./nHalmos taught at Syracuse University, the University of Chicago (1946\u201360), the University of Michigan (~1961\u201367), the University of Hawaii (1967\u201368), Indiana University (1969\u201385), and the University of California at Santa Barbara (1976\u201378). From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at Santa Clara University (1985\u20132006)./nIn a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 Algebraic Logic, Halmos devised polyadic algebras, an algebraic version of first-order logic differing from the better known cylindric algebras of Alfred Tarski and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in monadic Boolean algebra./nIn addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1971[5] and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson).[6] Halmos chaired the American Mathematical Society committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS's Leroy P. Steele Prize for exposition./nIn the American Scientist 56(4): 375\u2013389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways./nHalmos's 1985 \"automathography\" I Want to Be a Mathematician is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book \"automathography\" rather than \"autobiography\", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:/nDon't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?/nWhat does it take to be [a mathematician]?

Bianchi was also greatly influenced by the geometrical ideas of Bernhard Riemann and by the work on transformation groups of Sophus Lie and Felix Klein. Bianchi became a professor at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in 1896, where he spent the remainder of his career. At Pisa, his colleagues included the talented Ricci. In 1890, Bianchi and Dini supervised the dissertation of the noted analyst and geometer Guido Fubini./nIn 1898, Bianchi worked out the Bianchi classification of nine possible isometry classes of three-dimensional Lie groups of isometries of a (sufficiently symmetric) Riemannian manifold. As Bianchi knew, this is essentially the same thing as classifying, up to isomorphism, the three-dimensional real Lie algebras. This complements the earlier work of Lie himself, who had earlier classified the complex Lie algebras./nThrough the influence of Luther P. Eisenhart and Abraham Haskel Taub, Bianchi's classification later came to play an important role in the development of the theory of general relativity. Bianchi's list of nine isometry classes, which can be regarded as Lie algebras, Lie groups, or as three dimensional homogeneous (possibly nonisotropic) Riemannian manifolds, are now often called collectively the Bianchi groups./nIn 1902, Bianchi rediscovered[1] what are now called the Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor, which play an even more important role in general relativity.  (They are essential for understanding the Einstein field equation.)  According to Tullio Levi-Civita, these identities had first been discovered by Ricci in about 1889, but Ricci apparently forgot all about the matter, which led to Bianchi's rediscovery.[2] However, the contracted Bianchi identities, which are sufficient for the proof that the divergence of the Einstein tensor always vanishes, had been published by Aurel Voss in 1880.[3]", "340621": "George Stephen Boolos (/\u02c8bu\u02d0lo\u028as/;[1] 4 September 1940 \u2013 27 May 1996) was an American philosopher and a mathematical logician who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[2]/nBoolos was of Greek-Jewish descent.[3] He graduated with an A.B. in mathematics from Princeton University after completing a senior thesis, titled \"A simple proof of G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem\", under the supervision of Raymond Smullyan.[4] Oxford University awarded him the B.Phil. in 1963.

He wrote a paper on \"The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever\"\u2014one of many puzzles created by Raymond Smullyan./nBoolos died of pancreatic cancer on 27 May 1996.[5]/nBoolos coauthored with Richard Jeffrey the first three editions of the classic university text on mathematical logic, Computability and Logic. The book is now in its fifth edition, the last two editions updated by John P. Burgess./nKurt G\u00f6del wrote the first paper on provability logic, which applies modal logic\u2014the logic of necessity and possibility\u2014to the theory of mathematical proof, but G\u00f6del never developed the subject to any significant extent. Boolos was one of its earliest proponents and pioneers, and he produced the first book-length treatment of it, The Unprovability of Consistency, published in 1979. The solution of a major unsolved problem some years later led to a new treatment, The Logic of Provability, published in 1993. The modal-logical treatment of provability helped demonstrate the \"intensionality\" of G\u00f6del's Second Incompleteness Theorem, meaning that the theorem's correctness depends on the precise formulation of the provability predicate. These conditions were first identified by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their Grundlagen der Arithmetik. The unclear status of the Second Theorem was noted for several decades by logicians such as Georg Kreisel and Leon Henkin, who asked whether the formal sentence expressing \"This sentence is provable\" (as opposed to the G\u00f6del sentence, \"This sentence is not provable\") was provable and hence true. Martin L\u00f6b showed Henkin's conjecture to be true, as well as identifying an important \"reflection\" principle also neatly codified using the modal logical approach. Some of the key provability results involving the representation of provability predicates had been obtained earlier using very different methods by Solomon Feferman./nBoolos was an authority on the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege. Boolos proved a conjecture due to Crispin Wright (and also proved, independently, by others), that the system of Frege's Grundgesetze, long thought vitiated by Russell's paradox, could be freed of inconsistency by replacing one of its axioms, the notorious Basic Law V with Hume's Principle. The resulting system has since been the subject of intense work.[citation needed]/nBoolos argued that if one reads the second-order variables in monadic second-order logic plurally, then second-order logic can be interpreted as having no ontological commitment to entities other than those over which the first-order variables range. The result is plural quantification. David Lewis employed plural quantification in his Parts of Classes to derive a system in which Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and the Peano axioms were all theorems. While Boolos is usually credited with plural quantification, Peter Simons (1982) has argued that the essential idea can be found in the work of Stanislaw Le\u015bniewski./nShortly before his death, Boolos chose 30 of his papers to be published in a book. The result is perhaps his most highly regarded work, his posthumous Logic, Logic, and Logic. This book reprints much of Boolos's work on the rehabilitation of Frege, as well as a number of his papers on set theory, second-order logic and nonfirstorderizability, plural quantification, proof theory, and three short insightful papers on G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem.

This work provided examples for which the equivalence between motivic and automorphic L-functions postulated in the Langlands program could be tested: automorphic forms realized in the cohomology of a Shimura variety have a construction that attaches Galois representations to them.[8]/nIn 1958, Shimura generalized the initial work of Martin Eichler on the Eichler\u2013Shimura congruence relation between the local L-function of a modular curve and the eigenvalues of Hecke operators.[9][10] In 1959, Shimura extended the work of Eichler on the Eichler\u2013Shimura isomorphism between Eichler cohomology groups and spaces of cusp forms which would be used in Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures.[11][12]/nIn 1971, Shimura's work on explicit class field theory in the spirit of Kronecker's Jugendtraum resulted in his proof of Shimura's reciprocity law.[13] In 1973, Shimura established the Shimura correspondence between modular forms of half integral weight k+1/2, and modular forms of even weight 2k.[14]/nShimura's formulation of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture (later known as the modularity theorem) in the 1950s played a key role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In 1990, Kenneth Ribet proved Ribet's theorem which demonstrated that Fermat's Last Theorem followed from the semistable case of this conjecture.[15] Shimura dryly commented that his first reaction on hearing of Andrew Wiles's proof of the semistable case was 'I told you so'.[16]/nHis hobbies were shogi problems of extreme length and collecting Imari porcelain.

Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research.[1]/nSimon's best known work, for which he was honored with the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research, deals with the uniqueness of asymptotics of certain nonlinear evolution equations and Euler-Lagrange equations. The main tool is an infinite-dimensional extension and corollary of the \u0141ojasiewicz inequality, using the standard Fredholm theory of elliptic operators and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction.[9][10] The resulting \u0141ojasiewicz\u2212Simon inequalities are of interest in and of themselves and have found many applications in geometric analysis./nSimon's primary applications of his \u0141ojasiewicz\u2212Simon inequalities deal with the uniqueness of tangent cones of minimal surfaces and of tangent maps of harmonic maps, making use of the deep regularity theories of William Allard, Richard Schoen, and Karen Uhlenbeck.[11][12] Other authors have made fundamental use of Simon's results, such as Rugang Ye's use for the uniqueness of subsequential limits of Yamabe flow.[13][14] A simplification and extension of some aspects of Simon's work was later found by Mohamed Ali Jendoubi and others.[15]/nSimon also made a general study of the Willmore functional for surfaces in general codimension, relating the value of the functional to several geometric quantities. Such geometric estimates have proven to be relevant in a number of other important works, such as in Ernst Kuwert and Reiner Sch\u00e4tzle's analysis of Willmore flow and in Hubert Bray's proof of the Riemannian Penrose inequality.[16][17][18] Simon himself was able to apply his analysis to establish the existence of minimizers of the Willmore functional with prescribed topological type./nWith his thesis advisor James Michael, Simon provided a fundamental Sobolev inequality for submanifolds of Euclidean space, the form of which depends only on dimension and on the length of the mean curvature vector. An extension to submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds is due to David Hoffman and Joel Spruck.[19] Due to the geometric dependence of the Michael\u2212Simon and Hoffman\u2212Spruck inequalities, they have been crucial in a number of contexts, including in Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau's resolution of the positive mass theorem and Gerhard Huisken's analysis of mean curvature flow.[20][21][22][23]/nRobert Bartnik and Simon considered the problem of prescribing the boundary and mean curvature of a spacelike hypersurface of Minkowski space. They set up the problem as a second-order partial differential equation for a scalar graphing function, giving novel perspective and results for some of the underlying issues previously considered in Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau's analysis of similar problems.[24]/nUsing approximation by harmonic polynomials, Robert Hardt and Simon studied the zero set of solutions of general second-order elliptic partial differential equations, obtaining information on Hausdorff measure and rectifiability. By combining their results with earlier results of Harold Donnelly and Charles Fefferman, they obtained asymptotic information on the sizes of the zero sets of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold.[25]/nSchoen, Simon, and Yau studied stable minimal hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds, identifying a simple combination of Simons' formula with the stability inequality which produced various curvature estimates. As a consequence, they were able to re-derive some results of Simons such as the Bernstein theorem in appropriate dimensions. The Schoen\u2212Simon\u2212Yau estimates were adapted from the setting of minimal surfaces to that of \"self-shrinking\" surfaces by Tobias Colding and William Minicozzi, as part of their analysis of singularities of mean curvature flow.[26] The stable minimal hypersurface theory itself was taken further by Schoen and Simon six years later, using novel methods to provide geometric estimates without dimensional restriction. As opposed to the earlier purely analytic estimates, Schoen and Simon used the machinery of geometric measure theory. The Schoen\u2212Simon estimates are fundamental for the general Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theory, and consequently for its various applications./nWilliam Meeks, Simon, and Yau obtained a number of remarkable results on minimal surfaces and the topology of three-dimensional manifolds, building in large part on earlier works of Meeks and Yau.

Many of his early papers are concerned with the study of Whitehead products and their behaviour under suspension and more generally with the (unstable) homotopy groups of spheres. In a 1957 paper he showed the first non-existence result for the Hopf invariant 1 problem. This period of his work culminated in his book Composition methods in homotopy groups of spheres (1962). Here he uses as important tools the Toda bracket (which he calls the toric construction) and the Toda fibration, among others, to compute the first 20 nontrivial homotopy groups for each sphere./nAmong his most important contributions to stable homotopy theory is his work on the existence and non-existence of so-called Toda\u2013Smith complexes. These are finite complexes which can be characterized as having a particularly simple ordinary homology (as modules over the Steenrod algebra) or, alternatively, by having a particularly simple BP-homology. They can be used to construct the Greek letter infinite families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In his paper On spectra realizing exterior parts of the Steenrod algebra (1971), Toda deduced several existence and non-existence results on these complexes.

The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. He also wrote an international auxiliary language, Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflections\"), which is a simplified version of Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latino sine flexione, while others are in Italian./nPeano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy. He attended the Liceo classico Cavour in Turin, and enrolled at the University of Turin in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honours, after which the University employed him to assist first Enrico D'Ovidio, and then Angelo Genocchi, the Chair of calculus. Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within two years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the union and intersection of sets appeared for the first time.[2]/nIn 1887, Peano married Carola Crosio, the daughter of the Turin-based painter Luigi Crosio, known for painting the Refugium Peccatorum Madonna.[3] In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the Royal Military Academy, and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. In that year he published the Peano axioms, a formal foundation for the collection of natural numbers. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. The Peano curve was published in 1890 as the first example of a space-filling curve which demonstrated that the unit interval and the unit square have the same cardinality. Today it is understood to be an early example of what is known as a fractal./nIn 1890 Peano founded the journal Rivista di Matematica, which published its first issue in January 1891.[4] In 1891 Peano started the Formulario Project. It was to be an \"Encyclopedia of Mathematics\", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Z\u00fcrich. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with Formulario to the detriment of his other work./nIn 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about binary numeration and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press./nParis was the venue for the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. The conference was preceded by the First International Conference of Philosophy where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, i.e. \"how do you define a definition?\". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference, Peano met Bertrand Russell and gave him a copy of Formulario. Russell was struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols and after the conference, he retired to the country \"to study quietly every word written by him or his disciples\".[5]/nPeano's students Mario Pieri and Alessandro Padoa also had papers presented at the philosophy congress. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an \"international auxiliary language\" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it./nBy 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of analysis, foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of differential equations and vector analysis. Peano played a key role in the axiomatization of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the Formulario project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.[6]/nIn 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called Latino sine flexione (\"Latin without inflexion,\" later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the Interlingua of the IALA). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. On 3 January 1908, he read a paper to the  Academia delle Scienze di Torino in which he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.[7]/nThe year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the Formulario project, titled Formulario mathematico, was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in Latino sine flexione./nAlso in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of Academia pro Interlingua. Having previously created Idiom Neutral, the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favour of Peano's Latino sine flexione./nAfter his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other auxiliary languages, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the Accademia dei Lincei to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions)./nDuring the years 1913\u20131918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various numerical quadrature formulas, and introduced the Peano kernel.[8]/nIn 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died when he suffered a fatal heart attack.", "45298424": "Michiel Coignet (also Quignet, Cognet or Connette in Italian) (1549 in Antwerp \u2013 24 December 1623 in Antwerp) was a Flemish polymath who made significant contributions to various disciplines including cosmography, mathematics, navigation and cartography. He also built new and improved scientific instruments and made military engineering designs./nCoignet was a scientist at the court of the governors of the Spanish Netherlands Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia where he held a position similar to that of his compatriot Simon Stevin at the rival court of Maurice, Prince of Orange.[1]/nMichiel Coignet\u2019s father Gillis (also known as Egidius) was a goldsmith and maker of astronomical and mathematical instruments in Antwerp and was married to Brigitte Anthonis Hendriks.   Michiel\u2019s brother Jacob III became a physician while his brother Gillis I became a painter. Michiel\u2019s father died in 1562-1563.  The details on Michiel\u2019s education are scarce.[2] He was admitted to the St Ambrose Guild of School Teachers in 1568.  He taught French and mathematics.  It is likely that at the time he started working as a teacher he had already studied higher mathematics since the mathematics class he taught was referred to as 'mathematicam' whereas lower mathematics was referred to as 'cijfferen' (calculation).[3]/nHe married Maria vanden Eynde c. 1570 and the couple would have 10 children. Only their son Antonius was still alive at the time of his death.[4] In 1572-73 Michiel Coignet was appointed by the city as 'wijnroeier' ('wine gauger').  The wijnroeier was a municipal employee tasked with measuring the wine barrels that arrived in the city in order to calculate the taxes due.  From the year 1572 also dates Michiel\u2019s first signed instrument, an astrolabium.   This is an indication that his mother likely kept her deceased husband\u2019s workshop in operation until her son could become a master of the Guild of Saint Luke.   Michiel became a member of the Guild as the son of a member in 1581 and became a full master in 1589 after a period of apprenticeship.[3] He also became a member of the Guild of Meerse, which was the guild of the shopkeepers and wine gaugers.[5]/nMichiel Coignet converted to the Protestant faith.  After the Fall of Antwerp in 1585, he joined a local schutterij called the 'kolveniersgilde'.  Since only Catholics were typically allowed to join the schutterij it is assumed that he had reconverted to Catholicism.  His brother Gillis, however, did not and emigrated to Amsterdam where he had a successful career as an artist.[3] In 1585 Coignet stopped teaching except for classes for military officers and sons of prosperous merchants.[6]/nMichiel Coignet remained in this position of 'wijnroeier' until he started his service as a mathematician and engineer for the Archdukes in 1596.  He would remain in court service until his death in 1623.[3] In 1604 Coignet received a further stipend from the court for his role as of cosmographer.[7] In 1606, he remarried after the death of his first wife in November 1605 and had four children from this second marriage.[8] One of them was the painter Michiel II Coignet (1618-1663).[9]/nIn the summer of 1623 Coignet made a request to the Archduchess Isabella to get a pension.  She yielded his request and decided to grant him a single lump sum for his services.  However, Coignet died before the sum was paid. The Archduchess Isabella wanted to have his works published, but this plan was not realized.[8]/nCoignet invented several instruments and corresponded with Galileo Galilei (from 1588), Gerhard Mercator, Godefroy Wendelin, Ludolph van Ceulen and Fabrizio Mordente, whom he met during the latter\u2019s 1584 sojourn in Antwerp.  Among other things, Coignet invented and described instruments that had a function similar to that of the proportional compass.[10] During the dispute over the invention of the proportional compass in 1610, Giovanni Camillo Gloriosi attributed the invention to Coignet and not to Galileo, although the instrument is now mainly attributed to Coignet\u2019s friend Mordente.[11] Coignet distributed the computational functions over several bars and described the instrument in several treatises: on the flat ruler (Trait\u00e9 des Sinus, 1610); flat-legged proportional compasses (De regulae pantometae, 1612); and four-point proportional compasses (El uso del compas proportional, 1618).[6]/nStrongly encouraged by Gillis Hooftman[12] in 1580 Coignet published a treatise on navigation entitled Nieuwe Onderwijsinghe op de principaelste Puncten der Zeevaert ('New Instructions on the Principal Points of Navigation').  It was published by the Antwerp publisher Hendrik Hendriksen as an appendix to the Dutch-language translation of Pedro de Medina's Arte de Navegar.[13] In the appendix he pointed to the possibility of determining longitude at sea with watches on the ships. He also described some of his newly invented instruments such as the nautical hemisphere.[14] The nautical hemisphere is an instrument with which the longitude problem could, in theory, be solved. In 2008 an example of this instrument, likely made in Coignet\u2019s workshop, surfaced during an exhibition on the history of the Jesuit Seminary of Tournai.[15]/nAn expanded, French-language version of the 'Nieuwe Onderwijsinghe prepared by Coignet was published in 1581 by Hendrik Hendriksen under the title Instruction nouvelle des poincts plus excellents et n\u00e9cessaires, touchant l'art de naviguer... nouvellement practiqu\u00e9 et compos\u00e9 en langue thioise, par Michiel Coignet,... Depuis reveu et augment\u00e9 par le mesme autheur\u2026[16]/nAround 1600 Coignet became involved in the publication of atlases.  He edited various editions of the world maps of Abraham Ortelius. He added an introduction on projections and 13 maps to some editions of Ortelius' atlas published as Epitome theatri orbis terrarum d'Ortelius (1601).  The Latin-language 'Epitome' was quickly translated into English and French.  Coignet edited the French version published in Antwerp. One of the new maps was a map with a description of Japan, for which he had obtained the information from Jesuit sources.[17] Coignet also added an introduction to the atlas Speculum Orbis terrarum of Gerard de Jode.[18]/nIn 1621 Coignet drew a map that showed the preferred itinerary for merchants and merchandise traveling from Flanders to Milan (two copies are preserved one of which is kept in the library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven).  The map was promoted in May 1621 by the Antwerp newspaper Nieuwe Tijdinghe in an advertisement that referred to the route as the Prince conduitte since the route fell supposedly under the protection of the Archdukes.  The advertisement claimed that the proposed itinerary would reduce travel time by 10 to 12 days and was 'without danger'.[19]/nCoignet may have been a pupil of the German mathematician Valentin Mennher, whose books he published in new editions after Mennher's death in 1570.  He also edited Willem Raets' Arithmetica in 1580 and included an appendix on wine gauging.[5] As a mathematician Coignet was highly regarded by his contemporaries and was praised by the Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen.  He taught the subject including during his European tour when he instructed Marin Getaldi\u0107 and the officers of Archduke Albert. Getaldi\u0107 was later in Paris from where he informed Coignet in a letter dated 15 February 1600 about the mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te.[20]/nCoignet was involved in various military engineering projects mainly related to fortification and wrote about ballistics in one of his treatises (El uso de las doze diuisiones geometricas, 1618). From 1596 he worked for the Archdukes on the fortification of the forts along the Scheldt river.  He took on an advisory role in the Siege of Hulst of 1596 and the Siege of Ostend from 1602 to 1604.[5]/nIn 1608 he designed together with the municipal surveyor Mattheus van Herle a fortification in the area of the St Michael\u2019s Abbey.  Around 1614 he made further military maps.  During that time he was in charge of inspecting the excavation of the city moats.  He discovered that the contractor was making the moats too narrow and tried to cut off some of the corners to save time.  He was forced to conduct regular inspections in order to curb these malpractices.  During this time he may also have been involved in the reparation of the city walls and the design of a new fort on the left bank of the Scheldt river. In 1618 he discussed with Don I\u00f1igo de Borgia, the commander of the Spanish garrison, the construction of two guard posts on the city walls.[21]", "69055224": "Goong Chen (Chinese: \u9673\u978f, born July 7, 1950, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) is an applied mathematician known for his use of computer forensics and computer simulation to recreate what may have occurred in aviation accidents.

While at AT&T, Vapnik and his colleagues did work on the support-vector machine, which he also worked on much earlier before moving to the USA. They demonstrated its performance on a number of problems of interest to the machine learning community, including handwriting recognition. The group later became the Image Processing Research Department of AT&T Laboratories when AT&T spun off Lucent Technologies in 1996.

His proposal in 1743 to reverse the Celsius thermometer scale (from water boiling at 0 degrees and ice melting at 100 degrees, to where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water) was widely accepted and is still in use today.[1][2][3]/nChristin was born in Lyon. He was a founding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Lyon and served as its Permanent Secretary from 1713 until 1755. His thermometer was known in France before the Revolution as the thermometer of Lyon. One of these thermometers was kept at the Science Museum in London.[4]/nThe first thermometers used in Lyon were made according to the indications of Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur, who created the alcohol thermometer in 1730 and applied a graduation divided into 80 parts between the melting point of water (0\u00b0) and the boiling point (80\u00b0)./nAfter experimenting, Christin considered that the mercury thermometer was preferable to the one with alcohol and pronounced in favor of its instrumentation in a conference on 13 June 1740. He noticed the idea of the centesimal division when, in his research, he observed that a quantity of mercury poured into a test tube, first condensed by the cold of crushed ice and then expanded by the heat of boiling water, moved its volume from 66 to 67 parts of the tube and represented them as 6600 and 6700 parts. By registering the mercury dilated in one hundred parts, he found it natural to divide the space traveled by one hundred hundredths, being that these new units, smaller than those of R\u00e9aumur, would be more in harmony with the sensations caused by the variations in temperature./nWith this in mind, in 1743 he created the mercury-based \"thermometer of Lyon\" and with its new centigrade degree thermometer with 0 degrees to indicate the temperature at which the water reaches its point of fusion and 100 degrees where it reaches its boiling point.", "68530959": "Kitty Baker (born Sallie Kathryn Cardwell,  August 21, 1912 \u2013 June 2, 2014) was an American mathematics educator, artist and weaver, and author of books on theater.[1][2][3][4]/nSallie Kathryn Cardwell was born on August 21, 1912, in Lynchburg, Virginia.

In the latter, his key contributions are in the motion of an elastic body and the development of methods for integration of the equations of dynamics and fluid power, following up on the works of Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson and Augustin Louis Cauchy./nIn Russia, his work in these fields was continued by Nikolay Dmitrievich Brashman (1796\u20131866), August Yulevich Davidov (1823\u20131885) and especially by Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky (1847\u20131921)./nOstrogradsky did not appreciate the work on non-Euclidean geometry of Nikolai Lobachevsky from 1823, and he rejected it, when it was submitted for publication in the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences./nOstrogradsky was a teacher of the children of Emperor Nicholas I.[9]/nIn 1826, Ostrogradsky gave the first general proof of the divergence theorem, which was discovered by Lagrange in 1762.[10]  This theorem may be expressed using Ostrogradsky's equation:/nwhere P, Q, and R are differentiable functions of x, y, and z defined on the compact region V bounded by a smooth closed surface \u03a3; \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03bd are the angles that the outward normal to \u03a3 makes with the positive x, y, and z axes respectively; and d\u03a3 is the surface area element on \u03a3./nHis method for integrating rational functions[11] is well known.

In a 1993 paper[9] Bowditch proved that five standard characterisations of geometric finiteness for discrete groups of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space and hyperbolic plane, (including the definition in terms of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron) remain equivalent for groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space where n\u00a0\u2265\u00a04. He showed, however, that in dimensions n\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 the condition of having a finitely-sided Dirichlet domain is no longer equivalent to the standard notions of geometric finiteness. In a subsequent paper[10] Bowditch considered a similar problem for discrete groups of isometries of Hadamard manifold of pinched (but not necessarily constant) negative curvature and of arbitrary dimension n\u00a0\u2265\u00a02. He proved that four out of five equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness considered in his previous paper remain equivalent in this general set-up, but the condition of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron is no longer equivalent to them./nMuch of Bowditch's work in the 1990s concerned studying boundaries at infinity of word-hyperbolic groups. He proved the cut-point conjecture which says that the boundary of a one-ended word-hyperbolic group does not have any global cut-points. Bowditch first proved this conjecture in the main cases of a one-ended hyperbolic group that does not split over a two-ended subgroup[11] (that is, a subgroup containing infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index) and also for one-ended hyperbolic groups that are \"strongly accessible\".[12] The general case of the conjecture was finished shortly thereafter by G. Ananda Swarup[13] who characterised Bowditch's work as follows: \"The most significant advances in this direction were carried out by Brian Bowditch in a brilliant series of papers ([4]-[7]). We draw heavily from his work\". Soon after Swarup's paper Bowditch supplied an alternative proof of the cut-point conjecture in the general case.[14] Bowditch's work relied on extracting various discrete tree-like structures from the action of a word-hyperbolic group on its boundary./nBowditch also proved that (modulo a few exceptions) the boundary of a one-ended word-hyperbolic group G has local cut-points if and only if G admits an essential splitting, as an amalgamated free product or an HNN extension, over a virtually infinite cyclic group. This allowed Bowditch to produce[15] a theory of JSJ decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups that was more canonical and more general (particularly because it covered groups with nontrivial torsion) than the original JSJ decomposition theory of Zlil Sela.[16] One of the consequences of Bowditch's work is that for one-ended word-hyperbolic groups (with a few exceptions) having a nontrivial essential splitting over a virtually cyclic subgroup is a quasi-isometry invariant./nBowditch also gave a topological characterisation of word-hyperbolic groups, thus solving a conjecture proposed by Mikhail Gromov. Namely, Bowditch proved[17] that a group G is word-hyperbolic if and only if G admits an action by homeomorphisms on a perfect metrisable compactum M as a \"uniform convergence group\", that is such that the diagonal action of G on the set of distinct triples from M is properly discontinuous and co-compact; moreover, in that case M is G-equivariantly homeomorphic to the boundary \u2202G of G. Later, building up on this work, Bowditch's PhD student Yaman gave a topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups.[18]/nMuch of Bowditch's work in 2000s concerns the study of the curve complex, with various applications to 3-manifolds, mapping class groups and Kleinian groups. The curve complex C(S) of a finite type surface S, introduced by Harvey in the late 1970s,[19] has the set of free homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on S as the set of vertices, where several distinct vertices span a simplex if the corresponding curves can be realised disjointly. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the Teichm\u00fcller space, of mapping class groups and of Kleinian groups. In a 1999 paper[20] Howard Masur and Yair Minsky proved that for a finite type orientable surface S the curve complex C(S) is Gromov-hyperbolic. This result was a key component in the subsequent proof of Thurston's Ending lamination conjecture, a solution which was based on the combined work of Yair Minsky, Howard Masur, Jeffrey Brock, and Richard Canary.[21] In 2006 Bowditch gave another proof[22] of hyperbolicity of the curve complex. Bowditch's proof is more combinatorial and rather different from the Masur-Minsky original argument. Bowditch's result also provides an estimate on the hyperbolicity constant of the curve complex which is logarithmic in complexity of the surface and also gives a description of geodesics in the curve complex in terms of the intersection numbers. A subsequent 2008 paper of Bowditch[23] pushed these ideas further and obtained new quantitative finiteness results regarding the so-called \"tight geodesics\" in the curve complex, a notion introduced by Masur and Minsky to combat the fact that the curve complex is not locally finite. As an application, Bowditch proved that, with a few exceptions of surfaces of small complexity, the action of the mapping class group Mod(S) on C(S) is \"acylindrical\" and that the asymptotic translation lengths of pseudo-Anosov elements of Mod(S) on C(S) are rational numbers with bounded denominators./nA 2007 paper of Bowditch[2] produces a positive solution of the angel problem of John Conway:[24] Bowditch proved[2] that a 4-angel has a winning strategy and can evade the devil in the \"angel game\".

In statistics, Dantzig solved two open problems in statistical theory, which he had mistaken for homework after arriving late to a lecture by Jerzy Neyman.[2]/nAt his death, Dantzig was the Professor Emeritus of Transportation Sciences and Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science at Stanford University./nBorn in Portland, Oregon, George Bernard Dantzig was named after George Bernard Shaw, the Irish writer.[3][4] He was born to Jewish parents; his father, Tobias Dantzig, was a mathematician and linguist, and his mother, Anja Dantzig (n\u00e9e Ourisson), was a Russian-born linguist of French-Lithuanian origin. Dantzig's parents met during their study at the University of Paris, where Tobias studied mathematics under Henri Poincar\u00e9, after whom Dantzig's brother was named.[4] The Dantzigs emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Portland, Oregon./nEarly in the 1920s the Dantzig family moved from Baltimore to Washington, D.C. His mother became a linguist at the Library of Congress, and his father became a math tutor at the University of Maryland, College Park./nDantzig attended Powell Junior High School and Central High School. By the time he reached high school, he was already fascinated by geometry, and this interest was further nurtured by his father, challenging him with complicated problems, particularly in projective geometry.[2][4]/nGeorge Dantzig received his B.S. from University of Maryland in 1936 in mathematics and physics. He earned his master's degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1937. After working as a junior statistician at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1937 to 1939,[5] he enrolled in the doctoral program in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied statistics under Jerzy Neyman./nIn 1939, a misunderstanding brought about surprising results. Near the beginning of a class, Professor Neyman wrote two problems on the blackboard. Dantzig arrived late and assumed that they were a homework assignment. According to Dantzig, they \"seemed to be a little harder than usual\", but a few days later he handed in completed solutions for both problems, still believing that they were an assignment that was overdue.[4][6] Six weeks later, an excited Neyman eagerly told him that the \"homework\" problems he had solved were two of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.[2][4] He had prepared one of Dantzig's solutions for publication in a mathematical journal.[7] This story began to spread and was used as a motivational lesson demonstrating the power of positive thinking. Over time, some facts were altered, but the basic story persisted in the form of an urban legend and as an introductory scene in the movie Good Will Hunting.[6]/nDantzig recalled in a 1986 interview in the College Mathematics Journal, \"A year later, when I began to worry about a thesis topic, Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis.\"[8]/nYears later, another researcher, Abraham Wald, was preparing to publish a paper where he had arrived at a conclusion for the second problem when he learned of Dantzig's earlier solution. When Dantzig suggested publishing jointly, Wald simply added Dantzig's name as co-author.[4][8][9]/nWith the outbreak of World War II, Dantzig took a leave of absence from the doctoral program at Berkeley to work as a civilian for the United States Army Air Forces. From 1941 to 1946, he became the head of the combat analysis branch of the Headquarters Statistical Control for the Army Air Forces.[2] In 1946, he returned to Berkeley to complete the requirements of his program and received his PhD that year.[3] Although he had a faculty offer from Berkeley, he returned to the Air Force as mathematical advisor to the comptroller.[4]/nIn 1952, Dantzig joined the mathematics division of the RAND Corporation. By 1960, he became a professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at UC Berkeley, where he founded and directed the Operations Research Center. In 1966, he joined the Stanford faculty as Professor of Operations Research and of Computer Science. A year later, the Program in Operations Research became a full-fledged department. In 1973, he founded the Systems Optimization Laboratory (SOL) there. On a sabbatical leave that year, he managed the Methodology Group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Later, he became the C. A. Criley Professor of Transportation Sciences at Stanford University.[3]/nHe was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Dantzig was the recipient of many honors, including the first John von Neumann Theory Prize in 1974, the National Medal of Science in 1975,[10] and an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland, College Park in 1976. The Mathematical Programming Society honored Dantzig by creating the George B. Dantzig Prize, bestowed every three years since 1982 on one or two people who have made a significant impact in the field of mathematical programming. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.[11]/nFreund wrote further that \"through his research in mathematical theory, computation, economic analysis, and applications to industrial problems, Dantzig contributed more than any other researcher to the remarkable development of linear programming\".[12]/nDantzig's work allows the airline industry, for example, to schedule crews and make fleet assignments. Based on his work, tools are developed \"that shipping companies use to determine how many planes they need and where their delivery trucks should be deployed. The oil industry long has used linear programming in refinery planning, as it determines how much of its raw product should become different grades of gasoline and how much should be used for petroleum-based byproducts. It is used in manufacturing, revenue management, telecommunications, advertising, architecture, circuit design and countless other areas\".[2]/nLinear programming is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a given mathematical model for some list of requirements represented as linear relationships. Linear programming arose as a mathematical model developed during World War II to plan expenditures and returns in order to reduce costs to the army and increase losses to the enemy. It was kept secret until 1947. Postwar, many industries found its use in their daily planning./nThe founders of this subject are Leonid Kantorovich, a Russian mathematician who developed linear programming problems in 1939, Dantzig, who published the simplex method in 1947, and John von Neumann, who developed the theory of the duality in the same year./nDantzig was asked to work out a method the Air Force could use to improve their planning process.[13]  This led to his original example of finding the best assignment of 70 people to 70 jobs, showing the usefulness of linear programming. The computing power required to test all the permutations to select the best assignment is vast; the number of possible configurations exceeds the number of particles in the universe. However, it takes only a moment to find the optimum solution by posing the problem as a linear program and applying the Simplex algorithm. The theory behind linear programming drastically reduces the number of possible optimal solutions that must be checked./nIn 1963, Dantzig's Linear Programming and Extensions was published by Princeton University Press. The book quickly became a standard text in linear programming./nDantzig married Anne S. Shmuner in 1936.[14][15]  He died on May 13, 2005, in his home in Stanford, California, of complications from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He was 90 years old.[2]/nOn October 18, 1976 President Gerald Ford presented Dantzig with the President's National Medal of Science.

He summarized his findings in a monograph (1982) which did not gain international recognition until Victor L. Shapiro\u2019s English edition appeared six years later.[3]/nWith R-functions there appears the possibility of creating a constructive mathematical tool which incorporates the capabilities of classical continuous analysis and logic algebra. This allows one to overcome the main obstacle which hinders the use of variational methods when solving boundary problems in domains of complex shape with complex boundary conditions, this obstacle being connected with the construction of so-called coordinate sequences. In contrast to widely used methods of the network type (finite difference, finite and boundary elements), in the R-functions method all the geometric information present in the boundary value problem statement is reduced to analytical form, which allows one to search for a solution in the form of formulae called solution structures containing some indefinite functional components.[4]/nRvachev therefore provided computational mechanics with a new form of mathematical foundation with considerable heuristic potential./nTogether with his students, he published more than 500 scientific papers and 17 monographs.

He is best known for his work on the supplementary forces that are detected in a rotating frame of reference, leading to the Coriolis effect. He was the first to apply the term travail (translated as \"work\") for the transfer of energy by a force acting through a distance, and he prefixed the factor \u00bd to Leibniz's concept of vis viva, thus specifying today's kinetic energy.[1]/nCoriolis was born in Paris in 1792.

More recent interests have \nconcentrated on understanding the effect that the introduction of a random medium has on the propagation of \nnonlinear waves. Using the self-induced transparency of optical pulses in inhomogeneously broadened media as a \nparadigm, he have investigated the dependence of the Anderson localization distance on wave amplitude and \nshape./n\u2022 Optics. \nDeveloped with colleagues (Aceves, McLaughlin, Moloney, Lega, L'vov, Wright) useful results in connection \nwith nonlinear Snell's Laws, optical bistability and feedback, pattern formation in wide aperture lasers, eye \ndamage due to lasers, and semiconductor lasers. With L\u2019vov, investigated the role of finite flux (rather than \nFermi-Dirac) equilibria of the fermionic quantum kinetic equation in enhancing laser output. As part of the MURI \nAFOSR grant, developed with Glasner, Koselik and Moloney the canonical equation for ultra-short pulse \npopulation./n\u2022 Wave Turbulence. \nDeveloped (with Benney) consistent derivation of wave turbulence closure relying on minimal a priori statistical assumptions. With Dyachenko, Pushkarev and Zakharov, wrote a much cited paper on optical turbulence where we introduced the notion of cycle of intermittency. Developed (with Nazarenko, Biven, Connaughton) conditions on the wavenumber ranges of validity of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra in order for the wave turbulence closure to hold. With Galtier, Nazarenko and Pouquet wrote highly cited paper on weak magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and discovered the finite capacity anomaly, later addressed for three-wave interactions in a paper with Connaughton, in which the spectral of turbulence systems are realized in a very curious manner. With Rumpf and Zakharov, solved the MMT conundrum in which an initially weakly nonlinear system relaxes not to a wave turbulence state dominated by a resonant waves but to one dominated by radiating, coherent structures. This led, in two review papers with Rumpf to several suggestions as to what a priori premises are required in order for the wave turbulence closure to be valid. With Zakharov, pointed out the central role which the generalized Phillips's spectrum may play in wave turbulence./n\u2022 Plasmas and Fluids. \nDeveloped with colleagues (Nazarenko, Rubenchik, Zakharov) useful results in connection with the use of \nnonlinear plasma properties to enhance communication with reentry space vehicles. With the same coauthors, investigated \nnovel ways to improve drag reduction and flight characteristics of hypersonic vehicles./n\u2022 Coherent Structures. \nWith Benno Rumpf, have developed an explanation for the appearance of robust, large and coherent \nstructures in nonintegrable systems with modulational (self-focusing) instabilities and constrained by more than \none conservation law. This result has widespread application. Suggested an approach towards \ndeveloping an H-theorem for nonisolated systems with a consequence that coherent structures play a vital \nrole in order to enable highly nonlinear systems to reach a statistically steady state.", "13145": "Gerolamo Cardano (Italian: [d\u0292e\u02c8r\u0254\u02d0lamo kar\u02c8da\u02d0no]; also Girolamo[1] or Geronimo;[2] French: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cardan; Latin: Hieronymus Cardanus; 24 September 1501\u2013 21 September 1576) was an Italian polymath whose interests and proficiencies ranged through those of mathematician, physician, biologist, physicist, chemist, astrologer, astronomer, philosopher, writer, and gambler.[3] He became one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance and one of the key figures in the foundation of probability; he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem in the Western world. He wrote more than 200 works on science.[4]/nCardano partially invented and described several mechanical devices, including the combination lock, the gimbal consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported compass or gyroscope to rotate freely, and the Cardan shaft with universal joints, which allows the transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. He made significant contributions to hypocycloids - published in De proportionibus, in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids, later named \"Cardano circles\" or \"cardanic circles\", were used for the construction of the first high-speed printing presses.[5]/nToday, Cardano is well known for his achievements in algebra. In his 1545 book Ars Magna he made the first systematic use of negative numbers in Europe, published (with attribution) the solutions of other mathematicians for cubic and quartic equations, and acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers./nCardano was born on 24 September 1501[6] in Pavia, Lombardy, the illegitimate child of Fazio Cardano, a mathematically gifted jurist, lawyer, and close friend of Leonardo da Vinci. In his autobiography, Cardano wrote that his mother, Chiara Micheri, had taken \"various abortive medicines\" to terminate the pregnancy; he said: \"I was taken by violent means from my mother; I was almost dead.\" She was in labour for three days.[7] Shortly before his birth, his mother had to move from Milan to Pavia to escape the Plague; her three other children died from the disease./nAfter a depressing childhood, with frequent illnesses, and the rough upbringing by his overbearing father, in 1520, Cardano entered the University of Pavia against the wish of his father, who wanted his son to undertake studies of law, but Girolamo felt more attracted to philosophy and science. During the Italian War of 1521\u20131526, however, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the university in 1524.[8] Cardano resumed his studies at the University of Padua, where he graduated with a doctorate in medicine in 1525.[9] His eccentric and confrontational style did not earn him many friends and he had a difficult time finding work after his studies had ended. In 1525, Cardano repeatedly applied to the College of Physicians in Milan, but was not admitted owing to his combative reputation and illegitimate birth. However, he was consulted by many members of the College of Physicians, because of his irrefutable intelligence.[10]/nCardano wanted to practice medicine in a large, rich city like Milan, but he was denied a license to practice, so he settled for the town of Piove di Sacco, where he practiced without a license. There, he married Lucia Banderini in 1531. Before her death in 1546, they had three children, Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and Aldo Urbano (1543).[7] Cardano later wrote that those were the happiest days of his life./nWith the help of a few noblemen, Cardano obtained a teaching position in mathematics in Milan. Having finally received his medical license, he practiced mathematics and medicine simultaneously, treating a few influential patients in the process. Because of this, he became one of the most sought-after doctors in Milan. In fact, by 1536, he was able to quit his teaching position, although he was still interested in mathematics. His notability in the medical field was such that the aristocracy tried to lure him out of Milan. Cardano later wrote that he turned down offers from the kings of Denmark and France, and the Queen of Scotland.[11]/nGerolamo Cardano was the first European mathematician to make systematic use of negative numbers.[12] He published with attribution the solution of Scipione del Ferro to the cubic equation and the solution of Cardano's student Lodovico Ferrari to the quartic equation in his 1545 book Ars Magna, an influential work on algebra. The solution to one particular case of the cubic equation \n\n\n\na\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\nb\nx\n+\nc\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ax^{3}+bx+c=0}\n\n[13] (in modern notation) had been communicated to him in 1539 by Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia (who later claimed that Cardano had sworn not to reveal it, and engaged Cardano in a decade-long dispute) in the form of a poem,[14] but del Ferro's solution predated Tartaglia's.[11] In his exposition, he acknowledged the existence of what are now called imaginary numbers, although he did not understand their properties, described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. In Opus novum de proportionibus he introduced the binomial coefficients and the binomial theorem./nCardano was notoriously short of money and kept himself solvent by being an accomplished gambler and chess player. His book about games of chance, Liber de ludo aleae (\"Book on Games of Chance\"), written around 1564,[15] but not published until 1663, contains the first systematic treatment of probability,[16] as well as a section on effective cheating methods. He used the game of throwing dice to understand the basic concepts of probability. He demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes).[17] He was also aware of the multiplication rule for independent events but was not certain about what values should be multiplied.[18]/nCardano's work with hypocycloids led him to Cardan's Movement or Cardan Gear mechanism, in which a pair of gears with the smaller being one-half the size of the larger gear is used converting rotational motion to linear motion with greater efficiency and precision than a Scotch yoke, for example.[19] He is also credited with the invention of the Cardan suspension or gimbal./nCardano made several contributions to hydrodynamics and held that perpetual motion is impossible, except in celestial bodies. He published two encyclopedias of natural science which contain a wide variety of inventions, facts, and occult superstitions. He also introduced the Cardan grille, a cryptographic writing tool, in 1550./nSignificantly, in the history of education of the deaf, he said that deaf people were capable of using their minds, argued for the importance of teaching them, and was one of the first to state that deaf people could learn to read and write without learning how to speak first. He was familiar with a report by Rudolph Agricola about a deaf mute who had learned to write./nCardano's medical writings included: a commentary on Mundinus' anatomy and of Galen's medicine, along with the treaties Delle cause, dei segni e dei luoghi delle malattie, Picciola terapeutica, Degli abusi dei medici and Delle orine, libro quattro.[20]/nCardano has been credited with the invention of the so-called Cardano's Rings, also called Chinese Rings, but it is very probable that they predate Cardano. The universal joint, sometimes called Cardan joint, was not described by Cardano./nAs quoted from Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology:/nThe title of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, De Subtilitate (corresponding to what would now be called transcendental philosophy), would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far fetched theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells, he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea upon the mountains.[21]/nIn 1552 Cardano traveled to Scotland with the Spanish physician William Casanatus, via London,[22] to treat the Archbishop of St Andrews who suffered of a disease that had left him speechless and was thought incurable. The treatment was a success and the diplomat Thomas Randolph recorded that \"merry tales\" about Cardano's methods were still current in Edinburgh in 1562.[23] Cardano and Casanatus argued over the Archbishop's cure.[24] Cardano wrote that the Archbishop had been short of breath for ten years, and after the cure was effected by his assistant, he was paid 1,400 gold crowns.[25]/nTwo of Cardano's children \u2014 Giovanni Battista and Aldo Urbano \u2014 came to ignoble ends. Giovanni Battista, Cardano's eldest and favorite son was arrested in 1560 for having poisoned his wife,[11] after he had discovered that their three children were not his. Giovanni was put to trial and, when Cardano could not pay the restitution demanded by the victim's family, was sentenced to death and beheaded. Gerolamo's other son Aldo Urbano was a gambler, who stole money from his father, and so Cardano disinherited him in 1569./nCardano moved from Pavia to Bologna, in part because he believed that the decision to execute his son was influenced by Gerolamo's battles with the academic establishment in Pavia, and his colleagues' jealousy at his scientific achievements, and also because he was beset with allegations of sexual impropriety with his students.[7] He obtained a position as professor of medicine at the University of Bologna./nCardano was arrested by the Inquisition in 1570 after an accusation of heresy by the Inquisitor of Como, who targeted Cardano's De rerum varietate (1557).[26] The inquisitors complained about Cardano's writings on astrology, especially his claim that self-harming religiously motivated actions of martyrs and heretics were caused by the stars.[27] In his 1543 book De Supplemento Almanach, a commentary on the astrological work Tetrabiblos by Ptolemy, Cardano had also published a horoscope of Jesus. Cardano was imprisoned for several months and lost his professorship in Bologna. He abjured and was freed, probably with help from powerful churchmen in Rome.[27] All his non-medical works were prohibited and placed on the Index.[27]/nHe moved to Rome, where he received a lifetime annuity from Pope Gregory XIII (after first having been rejected by Pope Pius V, who died in 1572) and finished his autobiography. He was accepted in the Royal College of Physicians, and as well as practising medicine he continued his philosophical studies until his death in 1576.[citation needed]/nThe seventeenth-century English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne possessed the ten volumes of the Lyon 1663 edition of the complete works of Cardan in his library.[28]/nBrowne critically viewed Cardan as:/nthat famous Physician of Milan, a great Enquirer of Truth, but too greedy a Receiver of it. He hath left many excellent Discourses, Medical, Natural, and Astrological; the most suspicious are those two he wrote by admonition in a dream, that is De Subtilitate & Varietate Rerum. Assuredly this learned man hath taken many things upon trust, and although examined some, hath let slip many others. He is of singular use unto a prudent Reader; but unto him that only desireth Hoties,[a] or to replenish his head with varieties; like many others before related, either in the Original or confirmation, he may become no small occasion of Error.[29]/nRichard Hinckley Allen tells of an amusing reference made by Samuel Butler in his book Hudibras:/nCardan believ'd great states depend\nUpon the tip o'th' Bear's tail's end;\nThat, as she wisk'd it t'wards the Sun,\nStrew'd mighty empires up and down;\nWhich others say must needs be false,\nBecause your true bears have no tails./nAlessandro Manzoni's novel I Promessi Sposi portrays a pedantic scholar of the obsolete, Don Ferrante, as a great admirer of Cardano. Significantly, he values him only for his superstitious and astrological writings; his scientific writings are dismissed because they contradict Aristotle, but excused on the ground that the author of the astrological works deserves to be listened to even when he is wrong./nEnglish novelist E. M. Forster's Abinger Harvest, a 1936 volume of essays, authorial reviews and a play, provides a sympathetic treatment of Cardano in the section titled 'The Past'. Forster believes Cardano was so absorbed in \"self-analysis that he often forgot to repent of his bad temper, his stupidity, his licentiousness, and love of revenge\" (212)./nA chronological key to this edition is supplied by M.

Buckminster Fuller. He was introduced to the work of Fuller by designer Peter Pearce in 1963.  He finished graduate studies in structural design at Southern Illinois University in 1967, where Fuller was University Professor.[2] While at SIU, he invented a system of clustering dome structures by using small circle Catenatic Geometry principles rather than great circles, or geodesics, as Fuller had designed into geodesic dome structures.[3] From his research with naturally packed cell systems (biological cells, soap bubble packings, and metal crystallites) he also discovered a new space-filling polyhedron, the \u03b2-tetrakaidecahedron, the faces of which closely approximate the actual distribution of the kinds of faces found in experimental samples of cell geometry in natural systems.[citation needed]/nWilliams met astronomer, Albert George Wilson at the Rand Corporation in 1966. Wilson invited him to conduct research at the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation Advanced Research Laboratories (DARL) in Huntington Beach, California, USA. After graduate studies, he joined Dr. Wilson in September 1967 and continued his research into general structure principles in natural systems. He was the geometry and structure consultant to NASA engineer, Charles A. Willits, on the initiatory work in the development of large scale structure systems for space stations.[4] The first of four editions of his structural geometry research was published by DARL in 1969, with the title:Handbook of Structure.[5] His paper in the journal Science proposed that his discovery of the \u03b2-tetrakaidecahedron is the most reasonable alternative[6]  to Lord Kelvin's \u03b1-tetrakaidecahedron.[7]/nAs an organizer and presenter at the First International Conference on Hierarchical Structures sponsored by DARL in 1968, Williams was an early proponent advocating the discipline of Hierarchical Structure to be a legitimate area of scientific research.[8]\nIn the spring of 1970, Williams became a visiting lecturer in Design at Southern Illinois University.[9] A year later he returned to California, and started the design company Mandala Design Associates.[citation needed] In 1972, Eudaemon Press published Natural Structure: Toward a Form Language, an expanded edition of the original Handbook of Structure. In 1979, Dover Publications published the third edition titled, The Geometrical Foundation of Natural Structure, in its series of classical explanations of science. These works are cited in many books on geometry, science, and design.[10][11] Numerous references to these works are found in geometry articles in Wikipedia and Mathworld./nOn the fortieth anniversary of the initial DARL publication, Eudaemon Press published a commemorative 40th anniversary edition: The Geometry of Natural Structure: A Language of Form Source Book for Scientists and Designers. As a companion volume, Eudaemon Press also published Williams's recent work: The Kiss Catenatic: The Introduction of Catenatic Geometry and its Environs./nWilliams uses the geometry of Natural Structure, Catenatic Geometry principles, and Symbolic analysis as fundamental components of his architectural, environmental design, and cosmology work.[12][13] In 1967, he became a charter member [14] of Experiments in Art and Technology(E.A.T.) founded by engineers Billy Kl\u00fcver and Fred Waldhauer and  artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman.   In addition to theoretical work, Williams was awarded  U.S. Patent No. 6,532,701] in 2003 for a shelter system of clustered modular enclosures. He designed and constructed 18,000 square feet (1,700\u00a0m2) of these modular, moveable, expandable-contractible enclosures to raise the endangered desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation and Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA.[15][16][17][18] Of all of Williams' design and architectural work, he considers his association with biologists, David Morafka[19] and Kenneth Nagy to repopulate the Western Mojave Desert with the desert tortoise as his most rewarding environmental design work.[20]/nIn both his books and lectures, Williams is a keen popularizer of the geometries in natural structures and how they can be used in environmental design. His current work focuses on  two concepts first introduced in Natural Structure: Toward a Form Language./nFollowing the lead of mathematicians L. Fejes T\u00f3th and C. A. Rogers, Williams formalized the concepts underlying Catenatic Geometry. In The Kiss Catenatic he expanded the concept of small circles covering a sphere to include interconnected platen circuits that model multi-level linked units of the 3-dimensional matrix chain. He presented examples of the use of Catenatic Geometry in discussions of dark matter and dark energy, red-shift, fundamental forces, discrete units of space, and the expansion of the universe./nFrom the beginning of his geometry research, Williams considered polyhedral geometry as the basis of a Form Language comprising three levels: the Formative (geometry), the Purportive (psychology), and the Symbolic.\nWith respect to the symbolic Level, he followed the lead of symbologist and mythographer Robert Lawlor.[21] In The Integration of Universal Constants Williams presented relationships among numerous diverse subjects: geometric form, color spectrum, the music octave, the periodic table, astronomy, astrology, psychology, tarot, chakras, gender, seasons of the year, among others.

He created important globes, improved the mathematical instruments of his day and applied mathematics in new ways to surveying and navigation. Gemma's rings, an astronomical instrument, are named after him. Along with Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, Frisius is often considered one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography, and significantly helped lay the foundations for the school's golden age (approximately 1570s\u20131670s)./nFrisius was born in Dokkum, Friesland (present-day Netherlands), of poor parents who died when he was young. He moved to Groningen and later studied at the University of Leuven (Louvain), Belgium, beginning in 1525. He received the degree of MD in 1536 and remained on the faculty of medicine of Leuven for the rest of his life where, in addition to teaching medicine, he also taught mathematics, astronomy and geography. His oldest son, Cornelius Gemma, edited a posthumous volume of his work and continued to work with Ptolemaic astronomical models./nOne of his most influential teachers at Leuven was Franciscus Monachus who, circa 1527, had constructed a famous globe  in collaboration with the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden[2] Under the guidance of Monachus and the technical assistance of Van der Heyden, Frisius set up a workshop to produce globes and mathematical instruments  which were praised for their quality and accuracy by contemporary astronomers such as Tycho Brahe. Of particular fame were the terrestrial globe of 1536 and the celestial globe of 1537. On the first of these Frisius is described as the author with technical assistance from Van der Heyden and engraving by Gerardus Mercator who was a pupil of Frisius at the time. On  the second globe Mercator is promoted to co-author./nIn 1533, he described for the first time the method of triangulation still used today in surveying (see diagram). Having established a baseline, e.g., in this case, the cities of Brussels and Antwerp, the location of other cities, e.g. Middelburg, Ghent etc., can be found by taking a compass direction from each end of the baseline, and plotting where the two directions cross. This was only a theoretical presentation of the concept \u2014 due to topographical restrictions, it is impossible to see Middelburg from either Brussels or Antwerp. Nevertheless, the figure soon became well known all across Europe./nTwenty years later, in about 1553, he was the first to describe how an accurate clock could be used to determine longitude.[3] Jean-Baptiste Morin (1583\u20131656) did not believe that Frisius' method for calculating longitude would work, remarking, \"I do not know if the Devil will succeed in making a longitude timekeeper but it is folly for man to try.\"[4] It took two centuries before John Harrison produced a sufficiently accurate clock./nFrisius created or improved many instruments, including the cross-staff, the astrolabe, and the astronomical rings (also known as \"Gemma's rings\").

He was the son of Jan Urban Jarn\u00edk\u00a0[cs], a professor of Romance language philology at Charles University,[2] and his older brother, Hertv\u00edk Jarn\u00edk, also became a professor of linguistics.[3] Despite this background, Jarn\u00edk learned no Latin at his gymnasium (the C.K. \u010desk\u00e9 vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed re\u00e1ln\u00e9 gymnasium, Je\u010dn\u00e1, Prague), so when he entered Charles University in 1915 he had to do so as an extraordinary student until he could pass a Latin examination three semesters later.[3]/nHe studied mathematics and physics at Charles University from 1915 to 1919, with Karel Petr as a mentor. After completing his studies, he became an assistant to Jan Vojt\u011bch at the Brno University of Technology, where he also met Mathias Lerch.[3] In 1921 he completed a doctoral degree (RNDr.) at Charles University with a dissertation on Bessel functions supervised by Petr,[3] then returned to Charles University as Petr's assistant.[3][1][4]/nWhile keeping his position at Charles University, he studied with Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1927 to 1929.[5] On his first return to Charles University he defended his habilitation, and on his return from the second visit, he was given a chair in mathematics as an extraordinary professor. He was promoted to full professor in 1935 and later served as Dean of Sciences (1947\u20131948) and Vice-Rector (1950\u20131953). He retired in 1968.[1][4]/nJarn\u00edk supervised the dissertations of 16 doctoral students. Notable among these are Miroslav Kat\u011btov, a chess master who became rector of Charles University, Jaroslav Kurzweil, known for the Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral, and Slovak mathematician Tibor \u0160al\u00e1t.[3][6]/nHe died on 22 September 1970, at the age of 72.[1]/nAlthough Jarn\u00edk's 1921 dissertation,[1] like some of his later publications, was in mathematical analysis, his main area of work was in number theory. He studied the Gauss circle problem and proved a number of results on Diophantine approximation, lattice point problems, and the geometry of numbers.[4] He also made pioneering, but long-neglected, contributions to combinatorial optimization.[7]/nThe Gauss circle problem asks for the number of points of the integer lattice enclosed by a given circle.\nOne of Jarn\u00edk's theorems (1926), related to this problem, is that any closed strictly convex curve with length L passes through\nat most/npoints of the integer lattice. The \n\n\n\nO\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O}\n\n in this formula is an instance of Big O notation. Neither the exponent of L nor the leading constant of this bound can be improved, as there exist convex curves with this many grid points.[8][9]/nAnother theorem of Jarn\u00edk in this area shows that, for any closed convex curve in the plane with a well-defined length, the absolute difference between the area it encloses and the number of integer points it encloses is at most its length.[10]/nJarn\u00edk also published several results in Diophantine approximation, the study of the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers.\nHe proved (1928\u20131929) that the badly approximable real numbers (the ones with bounded terms in their continued fractions) have Hausdorff dimension one. This is the same dimension as the set of all real numbers, intuitively suggesting that the set of badly approximable numbers is large. He also considered the numbers x\nfor which there exist infinitely many good rational approximations p/q, with/nfor a given exponent k > 2, and proved (1929) that these have the smaller Hausdorff dimension 2/k. The second of these results was later rediscovered by Besicovitch.[11] Besicovitch used different methods than Jarn\u00edk to prove it, and the result has come to be known as the Jarn\u00edk\u2013Besicovitch theorem.[12]/nJarn\u00edk's work in real analysis was sparked by finding, in the unpublished works of Bernard Bolzano, a definition of a continuous function that was nowhere differentiable. Bolzano's 1830 discovery predated the 1872 publication of the Weierstrass function, previously considered to be the first example of such a function. Based on his study of Bolzano's function, Jarn\u00edk was led to a more general theorem: If a real-valued function of a closed interval does not have bounded variation in any subinterval, then there is a dense subset of its domain on which at least one of its Dini derivatives is infinite. This applies in particular to the nowhere-differentiable functions, as they must have unbounded variation in all intervals. Later, after learning of a result by Stefan Banach and Stefan Mazurkiewicz that generic functions (that is, the members of a residual set of functions) are nowhere differentiable, Jarn\u00edk proved that at almost all points, all four Dini derivatives of such a function are infinite. Much of his later work in this area concerned extensions of these results to approximate derivatives.[13]/nIn computer science and combinatorial optimization, Jarn\u00edk is known for an algorithm for constructing minimum spanning trees that he published in 1930, in response to the publication of Bor\u016fvka's algorithm by another Czech mathematician, Otakar Bor\u016fvka.[14] Jarn\u00edk's algorithm builds a tree from a single starting vertex of a given weighted graph by repeatedly adding the cheapest connection to any other vertex, until all vertices have been connected.\nThe same algorithm was later rediscovered in the late 1950s by Robert C. Prim and Edsger W. Dijkstra. It is also known as Prim's algorithm or the Prim\u2013Dijkstra algorithm.[15]/nHe also published a second, related, paper with Milo\u0161 K\u00f6ssler\u00a0[cs] (1934) on the Euclidean Steiner tree problem. In this problem, one must again form a tree connecting a given set of points, with edge costs given by the Euclidean distance. However, additional points that are not part of the input may be added to make the overall tree shorter. This paper is the first serious treatment of the general Steiner tree problem (although it appears earlier in a letter by Gauss), and it already contains \"virtually all general properties of Steiner trees\" later attributed to other researchers.[7]/nJarn\u00edk was a member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts, from 1934 as an extraordinary member and from 1946 as a regular member.[1] In 1952 he became one of the founding members of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.[1][4] He was also awarded the Czechoslovak State Prize in 1952.[1]/nThe Vojt\u011bch Jarn\u00edk International Mathematical Competition, held each year since 1991 in Ostrava, is named in his honor,[16] as is Jarn\u00edkova Street in the Chodov district of Prague.

He was the brother of Giordano Riccati, and the second son of Jacopo Riccati.[2] He began his studies at the College of St. Francis Xavier in Bologna, under the guidance of Luigi Marchenti, a pupil of the French mathematician Pierre Varignon. He entered the Society of Jesus on December 20, 1726.[3] He taught belles lettres in the colleges of the Order in Piacenza (1728), Padua (1729), and Parma (1734). He then went to Rome to study theology. In 1739 he was assigned to the College of St. Francis Xavier of Bologna, where he taught mathematics for thirty years, succeeding his former teacher Luigi Marchenti. He was among the first members of the Italian National Academy of Sciences.[4] In 1760 he was elected Honorary Fellow of the Russian Academy of Sciences.[5]/nRiccati's main research continued the work of his father in mathematical analysis, especially in the fields of the differential equations and physics. In 1746 and 1749 Riccati published two works, in which he discussed the question of the parallelogram of forces in the context of the vis viva controversy. In 1752, he published the short treatise De usu motus tractorii in constructione aequationum di\ufb00erentialium, in which he proved that all first-order (ordinary) differential equations conceivable at the time could be constructed using tractional motion.[6]/nRiccati's main contributions to mathematics and physics were published in two volumes, Opusculorum ad res physicas mathematicas pertinentium (Bologna, 1757-1762), where he introduced the use of hyperbolic functions.[7] Vincenzo edited, in collaboration with his brother Giordano, the Works of his father and published, in collaboration with his friend and student Girolamo Saladini, the three-volume treatise Institutiones analyticae, an important textbook on calculus printed in Bologna in 1765-67. Ten years later Saladini produced an Italian translation of the work under the title Instituzioni Analitiche. Riccati's Institutiones analyticae is the fullest 18th-century Italian treatise on analytic methods in mathematics./nAfter the suppression of the Society of Jesus, Riccati retired to his family home in Treviso, where he died on January 17, 1775. Riccati was a friend and correspondent of Maria Gaetana Agnesi and Ramiro Rampinelli.[8]/nHis contributions were in hyperbolic functions for solutions of cubics, their derivatives and exponential fiunctions. Lambert is sometimes incorrectly credited as the first to introduce the hyperbolic functions, however, he did this subsequent to Riccati's contributions in 1770. Riccati not only introduced these new functions but also derived the integral formulas connected with them. He then went on to derive the integral formulas for the trigonometric functions. Riccati with Saladini also worked on the rose curves, which was first postulated by Grandi. Like his father, Vincenzo Riccati was skilled in hydraulic engineering.[7] His efforts and implementations of flood control projects saved the regions around Venice and Bologna./nVincenzo Riccati (1757) introduced hyperbolic functions cosh and sinh, which he denoted as Ch. and Sh. related by \n\n\n\nC\nh\n\n.\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\nS\nh\n\n.\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Ch.^{2}-Sh.^{2}=r^{2}}\n\n with r being set to unity in modern publications, and formulated the addition laws of hyperbolic sine and cosine:/nHe furthermore showed that \n\n\n\nC\nh\n.\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Ch.{\\overline {\\varphi -\\pi }}}\n\n and \n\n\n\nS\nh\n.\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Sh.{\\overline {\\varphi -\\pi }}}\n\n follow by setting \n\n\n\nC\nh\n.\n\u03c0\n\u21d2\nC\nh\n.\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Ch.\\pi \\Rightarrow Ch.-\\pi }\n\n and \n\n\n\nS\nh\n.\n\u03c0\n\u21d2\nS\nh\n.\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Sh.\\pi \\Rightarrow Sh.-\\pi }\n\n in the above formulas.", "68891550": "Mary Emily Sinclair (September 27, 1878 \u2013 June 3, 1955) was an American mathematician whose research concerned algebraic surfaces and the calculus of variations. She was the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Chicago, and became Clark Professor of Mathematics at Oberlin College.[1][2]/nSinclair was born on September 27, 1878, in Worcester, Massachusetts; she was the fourth of five children of John Elbridge Sinclair and Marietta S. Fletcher Sinclair. Her father was a mathematics professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and also had two daughters from an earlier marriage. Her mother, originally from Worcester, taught English and modern languages at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute but stopped when her children were born. After graduating in 1896 from the Worcester Classical High School, Mary Emily Sinclair became a student at Oberlin, and as a student served as president of the Oberlin branch of the YWCA. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1900 with an A.B.[1][2]/nWhile working as a teacher at a seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, Sinclair continued her studies through the University of Chicago, earning a master's degree in mathematics in 1903.[1][2] After briefly teaching at Lake Erie College in 1903, she taught at the University of Nebraska from 1904 through 1907, while continuing her graduate study at the University of Chicago.[1][2] She completed her Ph.D. in 1908, with the dissertation On a Compound Discontinuous Solution Connected with the Surface of Revolution of Minimum Area in the calculus of variations, supervised by Oskar Bolza.[1][2][3] She became the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Chicago,[1][4] and her doctorate marked the beginning of a period in which the university gave over 50 doctorates to women through 1946, likely the most of any American university.[5]/nMeanwhile, in 1907, Sinclair had taken a position as instructor at Oberlin College, where she would remain for the rest of her career, teaching there for 37 years. The next year, on receiving her doctorate, she was promoted to associate professor. Although unmarried, she adopted two children as infants in 1914 and 1915. Also in 1915, she became one of the founding members of the Mathematical Association of America. She was promoted to professor in 1925, and became head of the mathematics department at Oberlin in 1939. In 1941 she was named Clark Professor of Mathematics. She retired in 1944, but continued to teach mathematics to US Navy students for two more years through Berea College.[1][2]/nShe returned to Oberlin in 1947, but was heavily injured in a carjacking incident in 1950.

His best known contribution is the definition of real numbers through the notion of Dedekind cut. He is also considered a pioneer in the development of modern set theory and of the philosophy of mathematics known as Logicism./nDedekind's father was Julius Levin Ulrich Dedekind, an administrator of Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig. His mother was Caroline Henriette Dedekind (n\u00e9e Emperius), the daughter of a professor at the Collegium.[1] Richard Dedekind had three older siblings. As an adult, he never used the names Julius Wilhelm. He was born in Braunschweig (often called \"Brunswick\" in English), which is where he lived most of his life and died. His body rests at Braunschweig Main Cemetery./nHe first attended the Collegium Carolinum in 1848 before transferring to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1850. There, Dedekind was taught number theory by professor Moritz Stern. Gauss was still teaching, although mostly at an elementary level, and Dedekind became his last student. Dedekind received his doctorate in 1852, for a thesis titled \u00dcber die Theorie der Eulerschen Integrale (\"On the Theory of Eulerian integrals\"). This thesis did not display the talent evident by Dedekind's subsequent publications./nAt that time, the University of Berlin, not G\u00f6ttingen, was the main facility for mathematical research in Germany. Thus Dedekind went to Berlin for two years of study, where he and Bernhard Riemann were contemporaries; they were both awarded the habilitation in 1854. Dedekind returned to G\u00f6ttingen to teach as a Privatdozent, giving courses on probability and geometry. He studied for a while with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and they became good friends. Because of lingering weaknesses in his mathematical knowledge, he studied elliptic and abelian functions. Yet he was also the first at G\u00f6ttingen to lecture concerning Galois theory. About this time, he became one of the first people to understand the importance of the notion of groups for algebra and arithmetic./nIn 1858, he began teaching at the Polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich (now ETH Z\u00fcrich). When the Collegium Carolinum was upgraded to a Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in 1862, Dedekind returned to his native Braunschweig, where he spent the rest of his life, teaching at the Institute. He retired in 1894, but did occasional teaching and continued to publish. He never married, instead living with his sister Julia./nDedekind was elected to the Academies of Berlin (1880) and Rome, and to the French Academy of Sciences (1900). He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oslo, Zurich, and Braunschweig./nWhile teaching calculus for the first time at the Polytechnic school, Dedekind developed the notion now known as a Dedekind cut (German: Schnitt), now a standard definition of the real numbers. The idea of a cut is that an irrational number divides the rational numbers into two classes (sets), with all the numbers of one class (greater) being strictly greater than all the numbers of the other (lesser) class. For example, the square root of 2 defines all the nonnegative numbers whose squares are less than 2 and the negative numbers into the lesser class, and the positive numbers whose squares are greater than 2 into the greater class. Every location on the number line continuum contains either a rational or an irrational number. Thus there are no empty locations, gaps, or discontinuities. Dedekind published his thoughts on irrational numbers and Dedekind cuts in his pamphlet \"Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen\" (\"Continuity and irrational numbers\");[2] in modern terminology, Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit, completeness./nDedekind defined two sets to be \"similar\" when there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them.[3]  He invoked similarity to give the first[citation needed] precise definition of an infinite set: a set is infinite when it is \"similar to a proper part of itself,\"[4] in modern terminology, is equinumerous to one of its proper subsets. Thus the set N of natural numbers can be shown to be similar to the subset of N whose members are the squares of every member of N, (N \u2192  N2):/nDedekind's work in this area anticipated that of Georg Cantor, who is commonly considered the founder of set theory. Likewise, his contributions to the foundations of mathematics anticipated later works by major proponents of Logicism, such as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell./nDedekind edited the collected works of Lejeune Dirichlet, Gauss, and Riemann. Dedekind's study of Lejeune Dirichlet's work led him to his later study of algebraic number fields and ideals. In 1863, he published Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory as Vorlesungen \u00fcber Zahlentheorie (\"Lectures on Number Theory\") about which it has been written that:/nAlthough the book is assuredly based on Dirichlet's lectures, and although Dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as Dirichlet's, the book itself was entirely written by Dedekind, for the most part after Dirichlet's death./nThe 1879 and 1894 editions of the Vorlesungen included supplements introducing the notion of an ideal, fundamental to ring theory. (The word \"Ring\", introduced later by Hilbert, does not appear in Dedekind's work.) Dedekind defined an ideal as a subset of a set of numbers, composed of algebraic integers that satisfy polynomial equations with integer coefficients. The concept underwent further development in the hands of Hilbert and, especially, of Emmy Noether. Ideals generalize Ernst Eduard Kummer's ideal numbers, devised as part of Kummer's 1843 attempt to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. (Thus Dedekind can be said to have been Kummer's most important disciple.) In an 1882 article, Dedekind and Heinrich Martin Weber applied ideals to Riemann surfaces, giving an algebraic proof of the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem./nIn 1888, he published a short monograph titled Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen? (\"What are numbers and what are they good for?\" Ewald 1996: 790),[5] which included his definition of an infinite set. He also proposed an axiomatic foundation for the natural numbers, whose primitive notions were the number one and the successor function. The next year, Giuseppe Peano, citing Dedekind, formulated an equivalent but simpler set of axioms, now the standard ones./nDedekind made other contributions to algebra. For instance, around 1900, he wrote the first papers on modular lattices. In 1872, while on holiday in Interlaken, Dedekind met Georg Cantor. Thus began an enduring relationship of mutual respect, and Dedekind became one of the first mathematicians to admire Cantor's work concerning infinite sets, proving a valued ally in Cantor's disputes with Leopold Kronecker, who was philosophically opposed to Cantor's transfinite numbers.[6]/nPrimary literature in English:/nPrimary literature in German:/nThere is an online bibliography of the secondary literature on Dedekind.

If Var\u0101hamihira wrote his work in 505 CE even at the young age of 25, he must have been over 105 years old at the time of his death, which seems exceptionally high to these scholars.[4] Consequently, these scholars consider date Var\u0101hamihira's lifespan to 505-587 CE.[5] Other scholars doubt the accuracy of Amaraja's statement, since he lived a thousand years after Var\u0101hamihira.[4]/nAccording to a historically inaccurate tradition, Var\u0101hamihira was associated with the first century BCE legendary emperor Vikramaditya.[6][7] This tradition is based on Jyotirvid-abharana, a work attributed to Kalidasa, which states that Var\u0101hamihira (along with Kalidasa) was one of the navaratnas (\"nine gems\") at Vikramaditya's court. However, this text is a literary forgery, and is dated variously from 12th-18th century.[1][8] Var\u0101hamihira definitely did not live in the same century as some of the purported \"Navaratnas\", such as the much older Kalidasa.[9]/nMuch of the undisputed information about the life of Var\u0101hamihira comes from a stanza in his Brhaj-jataka. According to this stanza, he was a resident of Avanti, was a son of Aditya-dasa, and studied at Kapitthaka through the boon of the sun god.[10]/nVar\u0101hamihira's father Aditya-dasa likely trained him in jyotisha (Indian astrology and astronomy), as suggested by the Brhaj-jataka stanza and the opening stanza of Pancha-siddhantika.[10]/nVar\u0101hamihira's commentator Utpala calls him \"Magadha-dvija\". According to one interpretation, this means that Var\u0101hamihira was a Brahmin (dvija), whose ancestors belonged to the Magadha region.[11][12]/nAccording to another theory, the word \"Magadha\" in this context refers to the sun-worshipping Maga cult that Var\u0101hamihira was a part of. In his Brhat-samhita, Var\u0101hamihira mentions that the Magas were the only people suitable for consecrating an image of the Sun god, just like Bhagavatas for Vishnu, the ash-bearing Brahmanas (Pashupatas) for Shambhu, those well-versed in the mandala-krama worship for the mother goddess, the Brahmanas for Brahman, the Shakyas for the Buddha, and the Digambaras (nagnas) for Jina. The Magas, as they came to be known in India, originated from the Magi priests of the Achaemenid Empire. Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri cites a Bhavishya Purana passage according to which the term \"Magadha\" is a synonym of \"Maga\" and refers to \"those who contemplate on the Maga\". According to Shastri, Utpala has used the word \"Magadha\" to denote the Magas, who had been accepted as Shaka-dvipi (Maga) Brahmins in the Indian society.[13]/nShastri theorizes that \"Varaha-mihira\" may be a Sanskritized form of the Iranian name \"Varaza-Mihr\", and may refer to a legend mentioned in the Mihr Yasht of the Avesta. According to this legend, the god Verethraghna, in the form of a boar (varaza), precedes Mihr in his march. Shastri notes that the 5th century Sassanian monarch Bahram V bore the name Mihrvaraza, which is quite similar to Varahamihra. Academic J.E. Sanjana suggests that Var\u0101hamihira was descended from an Iranian Magi priest.[14]/nSome scholars, such as M.T. Patwardhan and A.N. Upadhye, have identified Var\u0101hamihira with Bazurjmehr, mentioned in Firishta's writings as a minister of the Sasanian king Khusraw Nushirwan (r. 531-578). However, A.M. Shastri dismisses this theory as unconvincing.[15]/nThere are several historically inaccurate legends about the ancestry of Var\u0101hamihira:/nKapitthaka, where Var\u0101hamihira studied, was probably his birthplace.[12][10] While \"Kapitthaka\" is the most popular reading the place's name, several variants of this name appear in various manuscripts, including Kampilyaka,[a] Kapilaka, Kapishthala, and Kapishkala.[10] Utpala suggests that this village had a sun temple. According to one theory, Kapitthaka is the modern Kayatha, an archaeological site near Ujjain. Statues of the sun deity Surya (whom Var\u0101hamihira worshipped) dated 600-900 CE have been found there, and kapittha trees are abundant in and around Kayatha. However, no historical source suggests that Kapitthaka was another name for Kayatha. According to another theory, Kapitthaka is same as Sankissa (ancient Sankashya) in present-day Uttar Pradesh: according to the 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang, this town was also known as Kah-pi-t'a. Historian Ajay Mitra Shastri notes that Kah-pi-t'a is phonetically similar to Kapittha or Kapitthaka.[21]/nBased on the term \"Magadha-dvija\" (see above), Sudhakara Dvivedi suggests that Var\u0101hamihira was born and brought up in Magadha, and later migrated to Ujjain.[22] Ajay Mitra Shastri disputes this, noting that Utpala describes him as \"Avantikacharya\" (Acharya of Avanti) and \"Madgadha-dvija\": these two terms cannot be reconciled if \"Magadha-dvija\" is interpreted as \"Dvija (Brahmana) of Magadha\"; instead \"Magadha\" here means Maga, as attested by the Bhavishya Purana.[11]/nBesides the above-mentioned stanza, Var\u0101hamihira's association with Avanti is confirmed by other evidence: in Pancha-siddhantika, he calls himself Avantyaka (\"of Avanti\"), and the later commentators such as Utpala and Mahidhara describe him as Avantikacharya (\"acharya of Avanti\").[10] Utpala also describes Var\u0101hamihira's son Prthu-yashas as Avantikacharya, in his commentary on Shat-panchashika.[23]/nHistorian Ajay Mitra Shastri, relying on Utpala, believes that \"Avanti\" here refers to the city of Ujjayini in the Avanti region of central India.[10] Scholar D\u00e1niel Balogh, however, notes that Avanti here may refer to the city of Ujjayini or the Avanti region in general: there is no concrete evidence that Var\u0101hamihira lived in the city; he may have lived elsewhere in Avanti.[24]/nVar\u0101hamihira likely lived in the Aulikara kingdom, as the Aulikaras ruled Avanti in the 6th century CE.[25][26] Var\u0101hamihira's Brhat-samhita states that on the topic of omens (shakuna), one of the works he consulted was that of Dravya-vardhana, the king of Avanti.[27] Dravya-vardhana likely belonged to the Aulikara dynasty, several of whose members bore names ending in -vardhana.[25]/nHistorian Ajay Mitra Shastri notes that Dravya-vardhana is the only person for whom Var\u0101hamihira employs the honorific Shri, although he mentions several other notable people. Moreover, he mentions Dravya-vardhana's work before he mentions reputed authorities such as the Saptarishis and Garga. According to Shastri, this, combined with the fact that both Dravya-vardhana and Var\u0101hamihira lived in Avanti, suggests that Dravya-vardhana was the royal patron of Var\u0101hamihira.[27] Shastri theorizes that Dravya-vardhana was a successor of Yashodharman alias Vishnu-vardhana, who may have also been a patron of Var\u0101hamihira.[28]/nSome other historians identify Dravya-vardhana with the earlier Aulikara ruler Drapa-vardhana. Shastri disputes this, arguing that Var\u0101hamihira describes Dravya-vardhana was a maharajadhiraja (emperor), while the R\u012bsthal inscription describes Drapa-vardhana as a senapati (commander). Balogh disagrees with Shastri, noting that Var\u0101hamihira actually uses the term nrpo maharajadhiraja-kah (nrpa or ruler \"connected to the emperor\") for the king, which Shastri has misunderstood as maharajadhirajah (emperor). Only one manuscript reads maharajadhirajah, which can be discarded as it doesn't fit the metre; three others have maharajdhiraja-jah. Thus, the actual title of Drapa-vardhana was nrpa, which is much closer to senapati in status. Utpala also interprets the term maharajadhiraja-kah to mean \"born in the dynasty of the (or an) emperor\".[29] Hans Bakker interprets the term to maharajadhiraja-kah as a governor installed at Ujjayini by the contemporary Gupta emperor.[26] Balogh believes that Dravya-vardhana was probably same as Drapa-vardhana: \"Dravya\" may be a variant arising from a mistake in a medieval manuscript, which is the source of later manuscripts.[26]/nBalogh disputes Shastri's assertion that Var\u0101hamihira shows a particularly reverential attitude to the king, and even if he did, this is no evidence that the two were contemporaries. Var\u0101hamihira consulted the king's work instead of the original work of Bharadvaja that it was based on; according to Balogh, this actually makes it more likely that the king lived at a time earlier than Var\u0101hamihira, who did not have access to the older work of Bharadvaja.[30]/nAccording to Balogh, Var\u0101hamihira likely lived during the reign of the Aulikara kings Prakasha-dharman, Yashodharman, or an unknown successor of Yashodharman. However, unlike Shastri, Balogh believes that Var\u0101hamihira did not have a royal patron.[26]/nSeveral scholars theorize that Varahamihra came from a Brahminized family of the sun-worshipping Magi priests (see see Ancestry above).[31][13] He was a worshipper of the sun god Savitru, and stated that he had received all his knowledge by the grace of this god.[32] For example, in Brhaj-jataka, he states that he was able to compose the text because of a boon by the Sun.[28] While he mentions other deities, he devotes a much larger number of verses to the Sun.[11] His commentator Utpala credits his sharp intellect to a boon by the Sun.[28] Some later writers describe him as an incarnation of the Sun god.[18] Utpala, for example, decares that the Sun descended on the earth in form of Var\u0101hamihira to save the jyotisha-shastra from destruction.[33] The Subhashita-ratna-kosha quotes stanzas that praise Var\u0101hamihira as an incarnation of Vishnu and the Sun, presumably because of two parts of his name (varaha referring to an avatar of Vishnu, and mihira meaning sun).[23]/nSun worship seems to have been his family's religion, as his father Aditya-dasa's name literally means \"slave (or servant) of the Sun\".[28][34] Kutuhula-manjari, a later text, suggests that Var\u0101hamihira was born to Aditya-dasa by the blessings of the Sun. Var\u0101hamihira's son Prthu-yashas also invokes the Sun in the opening stanza of his work Shatpanchashikha.[28]/nVar\u0101hamihira was well-versed with the Vedic tradition.[35] He recommends the performance of several ancient Hindu rituals such as Punyaham and chanting of Vedic hymns.[36]/nVar\u0101hamihira praises Vishnu in the chapters 42 and 104 of Brhat-samhita, leading A.N.S. Aiyangar and K.V.R Aiyangar to speculate that he came in contact with the Shrivaishnava saints (Alvars); however, A.M. Shastri dismisses this theory, describing the praise for Vishnu as an example of religious eclecticism.[37]/nIn Brhat-samhita, Varahamihira discusses the iconography of several Brahmanical deities, including Vishnu, Baladeva, Ekanamsha, Shamba, Pradyumna, consorts of Shamba and Pradyumna, Brahma, Skanda, Indra, Shiva, Surya, the divine mothers (Matrikas), Revanta, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera.[38] These were presumably the popular gods worshipped during his period. He also describes the iconography of two non-Brahmanical faiths, that of the Buddha and the Jinas. He appears to have been religiously liberal, as he reveres the Buddha as \"the father of the world\" and devotes an entire stanza to Buddha's iconology (compared to shorter descriptions of several Brahmanical deities).[39] A verse in the Brhat-samhita describes the iconography of Ganesha, but this verse appears only in one or two manuscripts, and is likely a later interpolation. Similarly, a Tikanika-yatra verse in which the author reveres Ganesha (among other deities), is likely spurious; this verse appears in only one manuscript.[40]/nVar\u0101hamihira is credited with writing several authoritative texts on astronomy and astrology. He was also known for his poetic skills, and the 11th-century writer Kshemendra describes him as a great poet.[2]/nHe apparently wrote a set of two works - detailed and short - in the following areas:[41]/nThe chronological order of some of these works can be determined based on the internal evidence and Utpala's commentary. In order or earliest to latest, these works are:[42]/nLaghu-jataka states that it was written after Brhaj-jataka, and Utpala's commentary states that it was written after the abridged version of Pancha-siddhantika. However, its order with respect to the other works is not certain.[42]/nLater authors also mention or quote from some other works composed by Varaha-mihira. Manuscripts of some other works attributed to Varaha-mihira exist, but these attributions are of doubtful nature.[42]/nThe Romaka Siddhanta (\"The Doctrine of the Romans\") and the Paulisa Siddhanta were two works of Western origin which influenced Var\u0101hamihira's thought. The Pauli\u1e63a Siddh\u0101nta is often mistakenly thought to be a single work and attributed to Paul of Alexandria (c. 378 CE).[43] However, this notion has been rejected by other scholars in the field, notably by David Pingree who stated that \"...the identification of Paulus Alexandrinus with the author of the Pauli\u1e63a Siddh\u0101nta is totally false\".[44] A number of his writings share similarities with the earlier texts like Vedanga Jyotisha.[45]/nSome scholars consider Var\u0101hamihira to be the strong candidate for the one who understood and introduced the zodiac signs, predictive calculations for auspicious ceremonies and astrological computations in India.[46][47][48]/nVar\u0101hamihira's works contain 35 Sanskritized Greek astronomical terms, and he exhibits a good understanding of the Greek astronomy.[49] He praised the Greeks (Yavanas) for being \"well trained in the sciences\", though impure in ritual order.[50]/nVar\u0101hamihira gained reputation as the most eminent writer on jyotisha after his death, and his works superseded nearly all the earlier Indian texts in this area. Several later Indian astrologer-astronomers speak highly of him, and acknowledge his works among their main sources.[51] The 11th-century writer Al-Biruni also greatly admires him, describing him as an excellent astronomer.[52]", "897982": "Francis John Welsh Whipple ScD FInstP (17 March 1876 \u2013 25 September 1943) was an English mathematician, meteorologist and seismologist.

Whipple remained in this post until he retired in 1939.[3] He also served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1936 to 1937.[8]/nIn his role as Superintendent of Kew Observatory, Whipple played an important part in the recording of earthquakes, since Kew had been the site of a seismological observatory since 1898.[9] During his time as superintendent, Whipple devoted considerable time and energy to improve the quality of the seismological observations. He realised that the sensitivity of the seismometers was badly affected by wind, since wind would cause the whole observatory building to move. So he designed and commissioned a new, underground bunker to hold the Kew seismometers.[10] Whipple was Chair of the Seismological Investigations Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 1931-1939,[11] and also served on the National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics.[12] These roles brought him into contact with prominent seismologists around the world.

He \"introduced many of the fundamental notions of model theory\".[3] Using these methods, he found a way of using formal logic to show that there are self-consistent nonstandard models of the real number system that include infinite and infinitesimal numbers. Others, such as Wilhelmus Luxemburg, showed that the same results could be achieved using ultrafilters, which made Robinson's work more accessible to mathematicians who lacked training in formal logic. Robinson's book Non-standard Analysis was published in 1966. Robinson was strongly interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, and often remarked that he wanted to get inside the head of Leibniz, the first mathematician to attempt to articulate clearly the concept of infinitesimal numbers./nWhile at UCLA his colleagues remember him as working hard to accommodate PhD students of all levels of ability by finding them projects of the appropriate difficulty.

After completing his  studies at the Jesuit College of Brera in Milan, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1718, professing the vows on 15 August 1736.[2]/nAt first professor of humanities in Pavia and Vercelli, Lecchi taught mathematics and hydraulics at the Brera College in Milan from 1738 to 1773.[2] He also worked as technical consultant for the Senate of Milan on hydraulic matters. His first work was published in Milan in 1739 and it was about the theory of light (\"Theoria lucis, opticam, perspectivam, catoptricam, dioptricam complectens\").[3] In his second work he dealt with mathematical analysis according to the basic elements of Newton's method, and provided also a full course of geometry, algebra and trigonometry.[2] In his first hydraulic papers, written on behalf of the College of Brera, Lecchi tried to apply mathematics to the problem of the measure of the speed and of the flow rate of water, by using a theoretical approach./nFrom 1757 years Lecchi worked mainly as a hydraulic engineer. In 1759, the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa conferred upon him the title of imperial mathematician and hydraulic engineer, for which he received an annual pension of 300 florins. Later, Pope Clement XIII appointed him the director of hydraulic works of the papal territories. In the years 1765-67 Lecchi made some inspections in the Reno valleys together with two other engineers, Tommaso Temanza and Giovanni Verace.[2] The results of Lecchi\u2019s surveys were published in the Memorie idrostatico-storiche delle operazioni eseguite nell\u2019inalveazione del Reno di Bologna (Modena, 1773).[2] In his Idrostatica (Hydrostatics, 1765), Lecchi provided a good theoretical grounding in the science of waters. Lecchi renounced the appointment with the advent of Pope Clement XIV.[2]/nLecchi was a friend and correspondent of Roger Joseph Boscovich.[4] On his request, Boscovich revised the Idrostatica and contributed to Lecchi's work, writing a theoretical essay on the principles of hydrostatics that was inserted into the third part of the work.[5] After the suppression of the Society of Jesus Lecchi withdrew from public life.

His earliest mathematical work was on conic sections; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines), establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.[8][9]/nLike his contemporary Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum in 1647./nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism.[10] Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pens\u00e9es, the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascal's wager, known in the original as the Discourse on the Machine,[11][12] a fideistic probabilistic argument for God's existence. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids./nThroughout his life, Pascal was in frail health, especially after the age of 18; he died just two months after his 39th birthday.[13]/nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, which is in France's Auvergne region, by the Massif Central. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three.[14] His father, \u00c9tienne Pascal (1588\u20131651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte./nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife,[2] \u00c9tienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became a key member of the family. \u00c9tienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science./nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the Mystic Hexagram, Essai pour les coniques (Essay on Conics) and sent it \u2014 his first serious work of mathematics \u2014 to P\u00e8re Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line)./nPascal's work was so precocious that Ren\u00e9 Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"[15]/nIn France at that time offices and positions could be\u2014and were\u2014bought and sold. In 1631, \u00c9tienne sold his position as second president of the Cour des Aides for 65,665 livres.[16] The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris, but in 1638 Cardinal Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly \u00c9tienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.[citation needed]/nLike so many others, \u00c9tienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that \u00c9tienne was pardoned. In time, \u00c9tienne was back in good graces with the Cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen\u2014a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos./nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline. Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.[17]/nAlthough these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.[18] He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.[19]/nPascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in actuarial science. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.\"[20] However, Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace./nIn 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9, he corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probabilities.[21] The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. Pascal later (in the Pens\u00e9es) used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz' formulation of the calculus.[22]/nPascal's Trait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique, written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal's triangle.[23][24] The triangle can also be represented:/nHe defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (m\u00a0+\u00a01)th row and (n\u00a0+\u00a01)th column tmn. Then tmn\u00a0=\u00a0tm\u20131,n\u00a0+\u00a0tm,n\u20131, for m\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... and n\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... The boundary conditions are tm,\u22121\u00a0=\u00a00, t\u22121,n\u00a0=\u00a00 for m\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... and n\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... The generator t00\u00a0=\u00a01. Pascal concluded with the proof,/nIn the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction.[23] In 1654, he proved Pascal's identity relating the sums of the p-th powers of the first n positive integers for p = 0, 1, 2, ..., k.[25]/nThat same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics./nIn 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.[citation needed]/nPascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by John Wallis and Antoine de Lalouv\u00e8re) were judged to be adequate.[26] While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren's proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis's Tractus Duo, giving Wren priority for the first published proof./nPascal contributed to several fields in physics, most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions, the name Pascal has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascal's law (an important principle of hydrostatics). He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.[27]/nHis work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment./nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum, i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space, rather than a vacuum. \"Nature abhors a vacuum.\" This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance, moved by another substance.[28] Furthermore, light passed through the glass tube, suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space./nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by R\u00e9cit de la grande exp\u00e9rience de l'\u00e9quilibre des liqueurs (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648./nThe Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de D\u00f4me mountain, 4,790 feet (1,460\u00a0m) tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it.[29] On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin P\u00e9rier, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by P\u00e9rier, reads:/nThe weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-D\u00f4me was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work.../n...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town....First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and 3+1\u20442 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time.../nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-D\u00f4me, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...[30]/nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines. He found with both experiments that an ascent of 7 fathoms lowers the mercury by half a line.[note 1] Note: Pascal used pouce and ligne for \"inch\" and \"line\", and toise for \"fathom\".[31]/nIn a reply to \u00c9tienne No\u00ebl, who believed in the plenum, Pascal wrote, echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"[32]/nBlaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.[33]/nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France, Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\"[34] However treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors./nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year./nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648\u201354). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him./nSuddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.[35]/nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"[36]\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\"[37] With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty./nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.[38]/nOn the 23 of November, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death.[39] This piece is now known as the Memorial. The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.[40]\nHis belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the Provincial Letters./nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists./nBeginning in 1656\u201357, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments./nAside from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau./nIt is in the Provincial Letters that Pascal made his oft-quoted apology for writing a long letter, as he had not had time to write a shorter one.\nFrom Letter XVI, as translated by Thomas M'Crie:\n'Reverend fathers, my letters were not wont either to be so prolix, or to follow so closely on\none another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter is\na very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.'/nCharles Perrault wrote of the Letters: \"Everything is there\u2014purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an agr\u00e9ment not to be found anywhere else.\"[41]/nPascal is arguably best known as a philosopher, considered by some the second greatest French mind behind Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes.[42] However, he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology, empiricism, preferring fideism./nHe cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\".[43]/nPascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up\u2014first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true./nPascal also used De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes./nIn De l'Art de persuader (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths./nMan is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed./nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the Pens\u00e9es (\"Thoughts\") is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language.[44] Will Durant hailed the Pens\u00e9es as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".[45]/nThe Pens\u00e9es was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion Chr\u00e9tienne (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pens\u00e9es de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic./nOne of the Apologie's main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God./nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Sickness is the natural state of Christians.\"[46]/nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, \u00c9crit sur la signature du formulaire (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, the carrosses \u00e0 cinq sols, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation: The carriages had a fixed route, fixed price, and left even if there were no passengers.[47] It is widely considered that the idea of public transportation was well ahead of time. The lines were not commercially successful, and the last one closed by 1675.[48]/nIn 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont.[46]/nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two.[49] The headaches which affected Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.[citation needed]/nOne of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, France \u2013 Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal \u2013 is named after him. \u00c9tablissement scolaire fran\u00e7ais Blaise-Pascal in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after Pascal./nThe 1969 Eric Rohmer film My Night at Maud's is based on the work of Pascal. Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, Blaise Pascal, which originally aired on Italian television in 1971.[50] Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, Sea of Faith, presented by Don Cupitt.

The word vorticity was invented by Lamb in 1916.[6]/nLamb was born in Stockport, Cheshire, the son of John Lamb and his wife Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Rangeley.[4] John Lamb was a foreman in a cotton mill who had gained some distinction by the invention of an improvement to spinning machines, he died when his son was a child. Lamb's mother married again, and soon afterwards Horace went to live with his strict maternal aunt, Mrs. Holland. He studied at Stockport Grammar School, where he made the acquaintance of a wise and kindly headmaster in the Rev. Charles Hamilton, and a graduate of classics, Frederic Slaney Poole, who in his final year became a good friend. It was from these two tutors that Lamb acquired his interest in mathematics and, to a somewhat lesser extent, classical literature.[7]/nIn 1867, he gained a classical scholarship at Queens' College, Cambridge. Since Lamb's inclination, however, was to pursue a career in engineering, he chose to decline the offer, and instead worked for a year at the Owens College in nearby Manchester, as a means of developing his mathematical proficiency further.[7]/nAt that time, the Chair of Pure Mathematics at Owens College was held by Thomas Barker, an eminent Scottish mathematician, who graduated as Senior Wrangler and first Smith's prizeman from the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos in 1862. An acknowledged lecturer of high quality, Lamb prospered under the guidance of Barker, and was elected to a minor scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge.[7]/nAt Trinity, he was Second Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos, 2nd Smith's prizeman and elected fellow in 1872.[8] Among his professors were James Clerk Maxwell and George Gabriel Stokes. He was soon elected both a Fellow and a tutor in the college./nBy 1874, Lamb had become thoroughly invested in his work at Trinity, preparing there an innovative and original series of lectures on the subject of hydrodynamics for third-year students. Richard Glazebrook, a final-year student at the time, wrote of them that they were 'a revelation', and praised Lamb for his lucid presentation of the properties of liquids in rotational motion.[7] However, Lamb soon became romantically involved with Elizabeth Foot, sister-in-law to his former headmaster, and, since the conditions of his position at Trinity stipulated that he should hold it only so long as he was unmarried, he was compelled, in 1875, to resign and continue his work elsewhere.[4]/nLamb's acquaintance from Stockport, Frederic Slaney Poole, had by now for some years lived in South Australia; hearing of his engagement, Poole suggested in a letter that he should apply for the chair at the recently founded University of Adelaide.  In 1875, he was appointed the first (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics there, and took up the chair in March, 1876. Lamb was instrumental in the establishment of the academic and administrative structure of the university, and lectured in pure and applied mathematics, also giving practical demonstrations in physics.[4] For the next ten years the average number of students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts course at Adelaide was fewer than twelve; though Lamb also gave some public lectures in the evenings, his workload was relatively light. His deftly rendered and original A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of the Motions of Fluids (which would later be reprinted as Hydrodynamics in 1895) was first published in 1878./nIn 1883, Lamb published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society[9] applying Maxwell's equations to the problem of oscillatory current flow in spherical conductors, an early examination of what was later to be known as the skin effect. Lamb was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1884./nLamb was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at Owens College, Manchester, in 1885 and which became the Beyer Chair in 1888, a position Lamb held until retirement in 1920 (Owens College was merged with the Victoria University of Manchester in 1904). His Hydrodynamics appeared in 1895 (6th ed. 1933), and other works included An Elementary Course of Infinitesimal Calculus (1897, 3rd ed. 1919), Propagation of Tremors over the Surface of an Elastic Solid (1904), The Dynamical Theory of Sound (1910, 2nd ed. 1925), Statics (1912, 3rd ed. 1928), Dynamics (1914), Higher Mechanics (1920) and The Evolution of Mathematical Physics (1924)./nIn 1932 Lamb, in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, wittily expressed on the difficulty of explaining and studying turbulence in fluids.\nHe reportedly said, \"I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids.

His father, Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi, had studied ancient Indian texts with a particular emphasis on Buddhism and its literature in the Pali language. Damodar Kosambi emulated him by developing a keen interest in his country's ancient history. He was also a Marxist historian specialising in ancient India who employed the historical materialist approach in his work.[4] He is particularly known for his classic work An Introduction to the Study of Indian History./nHe is described as \"the patriarch of the Marxist school of Indian historiography\".[4] Kosambi was critical of the policies of then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, which, according to him, promoted capitalism in the guise of democratic socialism. He was an enthusiast of the Chinese Communist Revolution and its ideals, and was a leading activist in the world peace movement./nDamodar Dharmananda Kosambi was born at Kosben in Portuguese Goa into a Saraswat Brahmin family to Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi. After a few years of schooling in India, in 1918, Damodar and his elder sister, Manik  travelled to Cambridge, Massachusetts with their father, who had taken up a teaching position at the Cambridge Latin School.[5] Their father was tasked by Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman of Harvard University to complete compiling a critical edition of Visuddhimagga, a book on Buddhist philosophy, which was originally started by Henry Clarke Warren. There, the young Damodar  spent a year in a Grammar school and then was admitted to the Cambridge High and Latin School in 1920. He became a member of the Cambridge branch of American Boy Scouts./nIt was  in Cambridge that he befriended another prodigy of the time, Norbert Wiener, whose father Leo Wiener was the elder Kosambi's colleague at Harvard University. Kosambi excelled in his final school examination and was one of the few candidates who was exempt on the basis of merit from necessarily passing an entrance examination essential at the time to gain admission to Harvard University. He enrolled in Harvard in 1924, but eventually postponed his studies, and returned to India. He stayed with his father who was now working in the Gujarat University, and was in the close circles of Mahatma Gandhi./nIn January 1926, Kosambi returned to the US with his father, who once again studied at Harvard University for a year and half. Kosambi studied mathematics under George David Birkhoff, who wanted him to concentrate on mathematics, but the ambitious Kosambi instead took many diverse courses excelling in each of them. In 1929, Harvard awarded him the Bachelor of Arts degree with a summa cum laude. He was also granted membership to the esteemed Phi Beta Kappa Society, the oldest undergraduate honours organisation in the United States. He returned to India soon after./nHe obtained the post of professor at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), teaching German alongside mathematics. He struggled to pursue his research on his own, and published his first research paper, \"Precessions of an Elliptic Orbit\" in the Indian Journal of Physics in 1930./nIn 1931, Kosambi married Nalini from the  wealthy Madgaonkar family. It was in this year that he was hired by mathematician Andr\u00e9 Weil, then Professor of Mathematics at Aligarh Muslim University, to the post of lecturership in mathematics at Aligarh.[6] His other colleagues at Aligarh included Vijayraghavan. During his two years stay in Aligarh, he produced eight research papers in the general area of Differential Geometry and Path Spaces. His fluency in several European languages allowed him to publish some of his early papers in French, Italian and German journals in their respective languages./nMarxism cannot, even on the grounds of political expediency or party solidarity, be reduced to a rigid formalism like mathematics. Nor can it be treated as a standard technique such as work on an automatic lathe. The material, when it is present in human society, has endless variations; the observer is himself part of the observed population, with which he interacts strongly and reciprocally. This means that the successful application of the theory needs the development of analytical power, the ability to pick out the essential factors in a given situation. This cannot be learned from books alone. The one way to learn it is by constant contact with the major sections of the people. For an intellectual, this means at least a few months spent in manual labour, to earn his livelihood as a member of the working class; not as a superior being, nor as a reformist, nor as a sentimental \"progressive\" visitor to the slums. The experience gained from living with worker and peasant, as one of them, has then to be consistently refreshed and regularly evaluated in the light of one's reading. For those who are prepared to do this, these essays might provide some encouragement, and food for thought./n\u2014 From Exasperating Essays: Exercises in Dialectical Method (1957)/nIn 1932, he joined the Deccan Education Society's Fergusson College in Pune, where he taught mathematics for 14 years.[7] In 1935, his eldest daughter, Maya was born, while in 1939, the youngest, Meera./nIn 1944 he published a small article of 4 pages titled The Estimation of Map Distance from Recombination Values in Annals of Eugenics, in which he introduced what later came to be known as Kosambi map function.  According to his equation, genetic map distance (w) is related to recombination fraction (\u03b8) in the following way:/nw\n=\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\nln\n\u2061\n\n\n\n1\n+\n2\n\u03b8\n\n\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u03b8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w={\\frac {1}{4}}\\ln {\\frac {1+2\\theta }{1-2\\theta }}}\n\n or, put in another way, \n\n\n\n\u03b8\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n4\nw\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\ne\n\n4\nw\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta ={\\frac {1}{2}}{\\frac {e^{4w}-1}{e^{4w}+1}}.}/nKosambi's mapping function adjusts the map distance based on interference which changes the proportion of double crossovers.(To know more about this you can explore the given website https://www.academia.edu/665254/Kosambi_and_the_genetic_mapping_function (edit: Bhaskarlal Datta)/nOne of the most important contributions of Kosambi to statistics is the widely known technique called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Although it was originally developed by Kosambi in 1943, it is now referred to as the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve expansion. In the 1943 paper entitled 'Statistics in Function Space' presented in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society, Kosambi presented the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition some years before Karhunen (1945) and Loeve (1948). This tool has found application to such diverse fields as image processing, signal processing, data compression, oceanography, chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. Unfortunately this most important contribution of his is barely acknowledged in most papers that utilise the POD method. In recent years though, some authors have indeed referred to it as the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve decomposition.[8]/nUntil 1939, Kosambi was almost exclusively focused on mathematical research, but later, he gradually started foraying into social sciences.[7] It was his studies in numismatics that initiated him into the field of historical research. He did extensive research in difficult science of numismatics. His evaluation of data was by modern statistical methods.[9] For example, he statistically analyzed the weight of thousands of punch-marked coins from different Indian museums to establish their chronological sequence and put forward his theories about the economic conditions under which these coins could have been minted.[7]/nHe made a thorough study of Sanskrit and ancient literature, and he started his classic work on the ancient poet Bhart\u1e5bhari. He published exemplary critical editions of Bhartrihari's \u015aatakatraya and Subhashitas during 1945\u20131948./nIt was during this period that he started his political activism, coming close to the radical streams in the ongoing Independence movement, especially the Communist Party of India. He became an outspoken Marxist and wrote some political articles.[citation needed]/nIn the 1940s, Homi J. Bhabha invited Kosambi to join the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).[citation needed] Kosambi joined TIFR as chair for mathematics in 1946, and held the position for the next 16 years. He continued to live in his own house in Pune, and commute to Mumbai every day by the Deccan Queen train.[10]/nAfter independence, in 1948\u201349 he was sent to England and to the US as a UNESCO Fellow to study the theoretical and technical aspects of computing machines.  In London, he started his long-lasting friendship with Indologist and historian A.L. Basham.  In the spring semester of 1949, he was a visiting professor of geometry in the Mathematics Department at the University of Chicago, where his colleague from his Harvard days, Marshall Harvey Stone, was the chair. In April\u2013May 1949, he spent nearly two months at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, discussing with such illustrious physicists and mathematicians as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann, Marston Morse, Oswald Veblen and Carl Ludwig Siegel amongst others./nAfter his return to India, in the Cold War circumstances, he was increasingly drawn into the World Peace Movement and served as a Member of the World Peace Council. He became a tireless crusader for peace, campaigning against the nuclearisation of the world. Kosambi's solution to India's energy needs was in sharp conflict with the ambitions of the Indian ruling class. He proposed alternative energy sources, like solar power. His activism in the peace movement took him to Beijing, Helsinki and Moscow. However, during this period he relentlessly pursued his diverse research interests, too. Most importantly, he worked on his Marxist rewriting of ancient Indian history, which culminated in his book, An Introduction to the Study of Indian History (1956)./nHe visited China many times during 1952\u201362 and was able to watch the Chinese revolution very closely, making him critical of the way modernisation and development were envisaged and pursued by the Indian ruling classes. All these contributed to straining his relationship with the Indian government and Bhabha, eventually leading to Kosambi's exit from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1962./nHis exit from the TIFR gave Kosambi the opportunity to concentrate on his research in ancient Indian history culminating in his book, The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India, which was published in 1965 by Routledge, Kegan & Paul. The book was translated into German, French and Japanese and was widely acclaimed. He also utilised his time in archaeological studies, and contributed in the field of statistics and number theory. His article on numismatics was published in February 1965 in Scientific American./nDue to the efforts of his friends and colleagues, in June 1964, Kosambi was appointed as a Scientist Emeritus of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) affiliated with the Maharashtra Vidnyanvardhini in Pune. He pursued many historical, scientific and archaeological projects (even writing stories for children). But most works he produced in this period could not be published during his lifetime./nKosambi died of myocardial infarction in the early hours of 29 June 1966, after being declared generally fit by his family doctor on the previous day.[5]/nHe was posthumously decorated with the Hari Om Ashram Award by the government of India's University Grant Commission in 1980./nHis friend A.L. Basham, a well-known indologist, wrote in his obituary:/nCertain opponents of Marxism dismiss it as an outworn economic dogma based upon 19th century prejudices. Marxism never was a dogma. There is no reason why its formulation in the 19th century should make it obsolete and wrong, any more than the discoveries of Gauss, Faraday and Darwin, which have passed into the body of science... The defense generally given is that the Gita and the Upanishads are Indian; that foreign ideas like Marxism are objectionable. This is generally argued in English the foreign language common to educated Indians; and by persons who live under a mode of production (the bourgeois system forcibly introduced by the foreigner into India.) The objection, therefore seems less to the foreign origin than to the ideas themselves which might endanger class privilege. Marxism is said to be based upon violence, upon the class-war in which the very best people do not believe nowadays. They might as well proclaim that meteorology encourages storms by predicting them. No Marxist work contains incitement to war and specious arguments for senseless killing remotely comparable to those in the divine Gita./n\u2014 From Exasperating Essays: Exercises in Dialectical Method (1957)/nAlthough Kosambi was not a practising historian, he wrote four books and sixty articles on history: these works had a significant impact on the field of Indian historiography.[12] He understood history in terms of the dynamics of socio-economic formations rather than just a chronological narration of \"episodes\" or the feats of a few great men \u2013 kings, warriors or saints. In the very first paragraph of his classic work, An Introduction to the Study of Indian History, he gives an insight into his methodology as a prelude to his life work on ancient Indian history:/nAccording to A. L. Basham, \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History is in many respects an epoch making work, containing brilliantly original ideas on almost every page; if it contains errors and misrepresentations, if now and then its author attempts to force his data into a rather doctrinaire pattern, this does not appreciably lessen the significance of this very exciting book, which has stimulated the thought of thousands of students throughout the world.\"[11]/nProfessor Sumit Sarkar says: \"Indian Historiography, starting with D.D. Kosambi in the 1950s, is acknowledged the world over \u2013 wherever South Asian history is taught or studied \u2013 as quite on a par with or even superior to all that is produced abroad.\"[14]/nIn his obituary of Kosambi published in Nature, J. D. Bernal had summed up Kosambi's talent as follows: \"Kosambi introduced a new method into historical scholarship, essentially by application of modern mathematics. By statistical study of the weights of the coins, Kosambi was able to establish the amount of time that had elapsed while they were in circulation and so set them in order to give some idea of their respective ages.\"/nKosambi is an inspiration to many across the world, especially to Sanskrit philologists[15] and Marxist scholars. He deeply influenced Indian historiography.[16] The Government of Goa has instituted the annual D.D. Kosambi Festival of Ideas since February 2008 to commemorate his birth centenary.[17]/nHistorian Irfan Habib said, \"D. D. Kosambi and R.S.

They reported that he used \"strategies for encoding information with the sole purpose of making it more memorable\", and concluded that superior memory was not driven by exceptional intellectual ability or differences in brain structure.[32]/nIn another study, Baron-Cohen and others at the Autism Research Centre tested Tammet's abilities in around 2005.[33] Tammet was found to have synaesthesia, according to the \"Test of Genuineness-Revised\", which tests the subjects' consistency in reporting descriptions of their synaesthesia. He performed well on tests of short-term memory (with a digit-span of 11.5, where 6.5 is typical). Conversely, test results showed his memory for faces scored at the level expected of a 6- to 8-year-old child in this task. The authors of the study speculated that his savant memory could be a result of synaesthesia combined with Asperger syndrome, or it could be the result of mnemonic strategies./nIn a further study published in Neurocase in 2008, Baron-Cohen, Bor and Billington investigated whether Tammet's synaesthesia and Asperger syndrome explained his savant memory abilities. They concluded that his abilities might be explained by hyperactivity in one brain region (the left prefrontal cortex), which results from his Asperger syndrome and synaesthesia.[34] On the Navon task, relative to non-autistic controls, Tammet was found to be faster at finding a target at the local level and to be less distracted by interference from the global level.[34] In an fMRI scan, \"Tammet did not activate extra-striate regions of the brain normally associated with synaesthesia, suggesting that he has an unusual and more abstract and conceptual form of synaesthesia\".[34] Published in Cerebral Cortex (2011), an fMRI study led by Jean-Michel Hup\u00e9 at the University of Toulouse (France) observed no activation of colour areas in ten synaesthetes.[35] Hup\u00e9 suggests that synaesthetic colour experience lies not in the brain's colour system, but instead results from \"a complex construction of meaning in the brain, involving not only perception, but language, memory and emotion\".[36]/nIn his book Moonwalking with Einstein (2011), Joshua Foer, a science journalist and former US Memory Champion, speculates that Tammet's study of conventional mnemonic approaches has played a role in the savant's feats of memory. While accepting that Tammet meets the standard definition of a prodigious savant, Foer suggests that his abilities may simply reflect intensive training using memory techniques, rather than any abnormal psychology or neurology. In a review of his book for The New York Times, psychologist Alexandra Horowitz described Foer's speculation as among the few \"missteps\" in his book. She questioned whether it would matter if Tammet had used such strategies or not.[37]/nTammet has been studied continuously[10] by researchers in Britain and the United States, and has been the subject of several peer-reviewed scientific papers.[21] Allan Snyder at the Australian National University has said of him: \"Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do. It just comes to them. Daniel can describe what he sees in his head. That's why he's exciting. He could be the Rosetta Stone.\"[38]/nIn his mind, Tammet says, each positive integer up to 10,000 has its own unique shape, colour, texture and feel. He has described his visual image of 289 as particularly ugly, 333 as particularly attractive, and pi, though not an integer, as beautiful. The number 6 apparently has no distinct image yet what he describes as an almost small nothingness, opposite to the number 9, which he says is large, towering, and quite intimidating. He describes the number 117 as \"a handsome number. It's tall, it's a lanky number, a little bit wobbly.\"[9][39] He described David Letterman with the number 117 in these terms when interviewed on the Late Show with David Letterman.[40] In his memoir, he describes undergoing a synaesthetic and emotional response for numbers and words.[9]/nTammet set the European record for reciting pi from memory on 14 March 2004 \u2013 recounting to 22,514 digits in five hours and nine minutes.[41][42][43][44][45][46][47] He revealed in a French talk show on Radio Classique on 29 April 2016, that this event inspired Kate Bush's song \"Pi\" from her album Aerial./nHe is a polyglot.

After time spent abroad, he was offered a chair by the University of Florence in 1926, and a year later by the University of Palermo. He spent the years 1934 to 1939 in the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil collaborating with Benedito Castrucci notorious Italian-Brazilian mathematician. In 1939 he was offered a chair at the University of Rome./nIn 1941 he discovered that negative entropy has qualities that are associated with life: The cause of processes driven by negative energy lies in the future, exactly such as living beings work for a better day tomorrow. A process that is driven by negative entropy will increase order with time, such as all forms of life tend to do. This was a very controversial view at the time and not at all accepted by his colleagues. His findings indicate that negative entropy is associated with life in the same way as consciousness is. Consciousness could be a process based on negative entropy.[citation needed] In 1942 he put forth a unified theory of physics and biology, and the syntropy concept. In 1952 he started to work on a unified physical theory called projective relativity, for which, he asserted, special relativity was a limiting case.

He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria. His work is comparable to what is now known as the study of geography, and he introduced some of the terminology still used today.[1]/nHe is best known for being the first person known to calculate the circumference of the Earth, which he did by using the extensive survey results he could access in his role at the Library; his calculation was remarkably accurate.[2][3] He was also the first to calculate Earth's axial tilt, which has also proved to have remarkable accuracy.[4] He created the first global projection of the world, incorporating parallels and meridians based on the available geographic knowledge of his era./nEratosthenes was the founder of scientific chronology;[5] he used Egyptian and Persian records to estimate the dates of the main events of the Trojan War, dating the sack of Troy to 1183 BC. In number theory, he introduced the sieve of Eratosthenes, an efficient method of identifying prime numbers./nHe was a figure of influence in many fields who yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.[6] His devotees nicknamed him Pentathlos after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Yet, according to an entry[7] in the Suda (a 10th-century encyclopedia), some critics scorned him, calling him Beta (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavours.[8]/nThe son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in Cyrene. Now part of modern-day Libya, Cyrene had been founded by Greeks centuries earlier and became the capital of Pentapolis (North Africa), a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, Berenice, Ptolemias, and Apollonia. Alexander the Great conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and silphium, a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.[1] Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek at the time, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local gymnasium, where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.[9]/nEratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught Stoicism by its founder, Zeno of Citium, in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life.[10] He then studied under Aristo of Chios, who led a more cynical school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the Platonic Academy, who was Arcesilaus of Pitane. His interest in Plato led him to write his very first work at a scholarly level, Platonikos, inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophies.[6] Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under Callimachus.[9] He wrote poems: one in hexameters called Hermes, illustrating the god's life history; and another in elegiacs, called Erigone, describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden Erigone (daughter of Icarius).[6] He wrote Chronographies, a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the Trojan War. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy. George Syncellus was later able to preserve from Chronographies a list of 38 kings of the Egyptian Thebes. Eratosthenes also wrote Olympic Victors, a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities./nThese works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh Ptolemy III Euergetes to seek to place him as a librarian at the Library of Alexandria in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about fifty years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet Apollonius Rhodius had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including Ptolemy IV Philopator who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the original or the copy.\nHe sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the Library of Pergamum. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.[6]/nEratosthenes made several important contributions to mathematics and science, and was a friend of Archimedes. Around 255\u00a0BC, he invented the armillary sphere. In On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies,[11] Cleomedes credited him with having calculated the Earth's circumference around 240 BC, with a high precision.[2]/nEratosthenes believed there was both good and bad in every nation and criticized Aristotle for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and barbarians, as well as for arguing that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure.[12] As he aged, he contracted ophthalmia, becoming blind around 195 BC. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194\u00a0BC at 82 in Alexandria.[9]/nThe measurement of Earth's circumference is the most famous among the results obtained by Eratosthenes,[13] who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 stadia (39,060 to 40,320 kilometres (24,270 to 25,050\u00a0mi)), with an error on the real value between \u22122.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres (509 and 525\u00a0ft)).[2] Eratosthenes described his arc measurement technique,[14] in a book entitled On the measure of the Earth, which has not been preserved.  However, a simplified version of the method has been preserved, as described by Cleomedes.[15]/nThe simplified method works by considering two cities along the same meridian and measuring both the distance between them and the difference in angles of the shadows cast by the sun on a vertical rod (a gnomon) in each city at noon on the summer solstice.  The two cities used were Alexandria and Syene (modern Aswan), and the distance between the cities was measured by professional bematists.[16]  A geometric calculation reveals that the circumference of the Earth is the distance between the two cities divided by the difference in shadow angles expressed as a fraction of one turn./n/nEratosthenes now continued from his knowledge about the Earth. Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format.[17] In his three-volume work Geography (Greek: Geographika), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones:[18] two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics.[19] This book is the first recorded instance of many terms still in use today, including the name of the discipline geography.[20]  He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the Geography the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown, which had never been achieved before.[1]  However, his Geography has been lost to history, although fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like Pliny, Polybius, Strabo, and Marcianus. While this work is the earliest we can trace certain ideas, words, and concepts in the historical record, earlier contributions may have been lost to history./nAccording to Strabo, Eratosthenes argued against the Greek-Barbarian dichotomy. He says Alexander ignored his advisers by his regard for all people with law and government.[23] Strabo says that Eratosthenes was wrong to claim that Alexander had disregarded the counsel of his advisers. Strabo argues it was Alexander's interpretation of their \"real intent\" in recognizing that \"in some people there prevail the law-abiding and the political instinct, and the qualities associated with education and powers of speech\".[24]/nEratosthenes was described by the Suda Lexicon as a \u03a0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (Pentathlos) which can be translated as \"All-Rounder\", for he was skilled in a variety of things: He was a true polymath. He was nicknamed Beta because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information but never achieved the highest rank in anything; Strabo accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians.[25]/nEratosthenes proposed a simple algorithm for finding prime numbers. This algorithm is known in mathematics as the Sieve of Eratosthenes./nIn mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f18\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), one of a number of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, i.e., not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime./nEratosthenes was one of the most pre-eminent scholarly figures of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics\u00a0\u2013 geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. There are no documents left of his work after the destruction of the Library of Alexandria.[25]", "61060134": "Judita Cofman (1936\u20132001) was a Yugoslav-German mathematician, the first person to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Novi Sad.\nShe was known for her work in finite geometry and for her books aimed at young mathematicians.[1][2][3]/nCofman was born on 4 June 1936 to a prominent ethnically German but Hungarian-speaking family (variously spelled Cofman or Zoffmann) in Vr\u0161ac, then in Yugoslavia and now part of Serbia.

Planner was the first programming language based on procedural plans invoked using pattern-directed invocation from assertions and goals. The actor model influenced the development of the Scheme programming language,[5] the \u03c0-calculus,[6] and served as an inspiration for several other programming languages.[7]/nHewitt obtained his PhD in mathematics at MIT in 1971, under the supervision of Seymour Papert, Marvin Minsky, and Mike Paterson. He began his employment at MIT that year,[8] and retired from the faculty of the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science during the 1999\u20132000 school year.[9] He became emeritus in the  department in 2000.[10] Among the doctoral students that Hewitt supervised during his time at MIT are Gul Agha, Henry Baker, William Clinger, Irene Greif,  and Akinori Yonezawa.[11]/nFrom September 1989 to August 1990, Hewitt was the IBM Chair Visiting Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Keio University in Japan.[12] He has also been a Visiting Professor at Stanford University./nHewitt was best known for his work on the actor model of computation. For the last decade, his work had been in \"inconsistency robustness\", which aims to provide practical rigorous foundations for systems dealing with pervasively inconsistent information.[13] This work grew out of his doctoral dissertation focused on the procedural (as opposed to logical) embedding of knowledge, which was embodied in the Planner programming language./nHis publications also include contributions in the areas of open information systems,[14] organizational and multi-agent systems,[15] logic programming,[3] concurrent programming, paraconsistent logic[16] and cloud computing.[17]/nThe Planner language was developed during the late 1960s as part of Hewitt's doctoral research in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hewitt's work on Planner introduced the notion of the \"procedural embedding of knowledge\",[18] which was an alternative to the logical approach to knowledge encoding for artificial intelligence pioneered by John McCarthy.[19] Planner has been described as \"extremely ambitious\".[20] A subset of Planner called Micro-Planner was implemented at MIT by Gerry Sussman, Drew McDermott, Eugene Charniak and Terry Winograd[21] and was used in Winograd's SHRDLU program,[22] Charniak's natural language story understanding work,[23] and L. Thorne McCarty's work on legal reasoning.[24] Planner was almost completely implemented in Popler[25] by Julian Davies at Edinburgh. Planner also influenced the later development of other AI research languages such as Muddle and Conniver,[20] as well as the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language.[26]/nHewitt's own work on Planner continued with Muddle (later called MDL), which was developed in the early 1970s by Sussman, Hewitt, Chris Reeve, and David Cressey as a stepping-stone towards a full implementation of Planner. Muddle was implemented as an extended version of Lisp, and introduced several features that were later adopted by Conniver, Lisp Machine Lisp, and Common Lisp.[20] However, in late 1972 Hewitt abruptly halted his development of the Planner design in his thesis, when he and his graduate students invented the actor model of computation./nHewitt's work on the actor model of computation spanned over 30 years, beginning with the introduction of the model in a 1973 paper authored by Hewitt, Peter Bishop, and Richard Steiger,[27] and including new results on actor model semantics published as recently as 2006.[28] Much of this work was carried out in collaboration with students in Hewitt's Message Passing Semantics Group at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.[29]/nSussman and Steele developed the Scheme programming language in an effort to gain a better understanding of the actor model. However, their Scheme interpreter was not capable of fully implementing the actor model because actor customers cannot be implemented as lambda calculus continuations and actors can change their local state in a way that is impossible in the lambda calculus. [30][31] A number of programming languages were developed to specifically implement the actor model, such as  ACT-1,[32] SALSA,[33] Caltrop,[34] E[7] and ActorScript.[35] The actor model also influenced the development of the \u03c0-calculus.[36] (See actor model and process calculi history.)", "24884274": "Erling St\u00f8rmer (born 2 November 1937) is a Norwegian mathematician, who has mostly worked with operator algebras./nHe was born in Oslo as a son of Leif St\u00f8rmer.[1] He was a grandson of Carl St\u00f8rmer and nephew of Per St\u00f8rmer.[2] He took his doctorate at Columbia University in 1963 with thesis advisor Richard Kadison,[3] and was a professor at the University of Oslo from 1974 to his retirement in 2007.[1]/nHe is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[4] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5]/n/nThis article about a Norwegian scientist is a stub.

The Earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) near the northern hemisphere winter solstice. The earth moves faster through its orbit when closer to the sun. Hence, the period from the northern hemisphere's autumn equinox to winter and spring is shorter by around seven days than the period from spring to summer to autumn; the reverse is true in the southern hemisphere. Hence, northern hemisphere winter is shorter./nBecause of this, Adhemar reasoned that because the southern hemisphere had more hours of darkness in winter, it must be cooling, and attributed the Antarctic ice sheet to this. Adhemar knew of the 22,000 year cycle of precession of the equinoxes, and theorised that the ice ages occurred in this cycle./nOne immediate objection to the theory was that the total insolation during a year does not vary at all during the precessional cycle, only its seasonal distribution. Another was that the timing was wrong; however this could not be tested by observations available at the time./nAdhemar's theory was further developed, first by James Croll and later by Milutin Milankovi\u0107./nAdhemar predicted the Antarctic ice sheet and theorised about its thickness by comparing the depths of the Arctic and circum-Antarctic oceans.

He is known for the famous determinantal identities, known as Frobenius\u2013Stickelberger formulae, governing elliptic functions, and for developing the theory of biquadratic forms. He was also the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Pad\u00e9 approximants), and gave the first full proof for the Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem. He also lent his name to certain differential-geometric objects in modern mathematical physics, known as Frobenius manifolds./nFerdinand Georg Frobenius was born on 26 October 1849 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin,[1] from parents Christian Ferdinand Frobenius, a Protestant parson, and Christine Elizabeth Friedrich. He entered the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 1860 when he was nearly eleven.[2] In 1867, after graduating, he went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he began his university studies but he only studied there for one semester before returning to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer and Karl Weierstrass. He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics.[2] Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to Z\u00fcrich to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Z\u00fcrich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences./nGroup theory was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today./nMore important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups. A group G is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup H\u00a0<\u00a0G such that/nIn that case, the set/ntogether with the identity element of G forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959.[4] All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group \n\n\n\nP\nS\nL\n(\n2\n,\np\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle PSL(2,p)}\n\n of order (1/2)(p3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0p) for all odd primes\u00a0p (this group is simple provided\u00a0p\u00a0>\u00a03). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups./nFrobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q. Specifically, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime p which does not ramify in K and to each prime ideal P lying over p in K there is a unique element g of Gal(K/Q) satisfying the condition g(x)\u00a0=\u00a0xp\u00a0(mod\u00a0P) for all integers x of K. Varying P over p changes g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p. This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of p and any element of \nthe conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p. If we take for K the mth cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo m (and thus \nis abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p not dividing m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p\u00a0mod\u00a0m. From this point of view, \nthe distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions. The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.", "46137": "Rafael E.

He was born in a Greek colony in Italy and migrated to Greece. Philolaus has been called one of three most prominent figures in the Pythagorean tradition and the most outstanding figure in the Pythagorean school. Pythagoras developed a school of philosophy that was dominated by both mathematics and mysticism. Most of what is known today about the Pythagorean astronomical system is derived from Philolaus's views. He may have been the first to write about Pythagorean doctrine. According to August B\u00f6ckh (1819), who cites Nicomachus, Philolaus was the successor of Pythagoras.[3]/nHe argued that at the foundation of everything is the part played by the limiting and limitless, which combine in a harmony. With his assertions that the Earth was not the center of the universe (geocentrism), he is credited with the earliest known discussion of concepts in the development of heliocentrism, the theory that the Earth is not the center of the Universe, but rather that the Sun is. Philolaus discussed a Central Fire as the center of the universe and that spheres (including the Sun) revolved around it./nVarious reports give the birthplace of Philolaus as either Croton,[4] Tarentum,[5] or Metapontum[6]\u2014all part of Magna Graecia (the name of the coastal areas of Southern Italy on the Tarentine Gulf that were colonized extensively by Greek settlers). It is most likely that he came from Croton.[7][8] He migrated to Greece, perhaps while fleeing the second burning of the Pythagorean meeting-place around 454\u00a0BC.[9]/nAccording to Plato's Phaedo, he was the instructor of Simmias and Cebes at Thebes, around the time the Phaedo takes place, in 399\u00a0BC.[10] That would make him a contemporary of Socrates, and would agree  with the statement that Philolaus and Democritus were contemporaries.[11]/nThe writings of much later writers are the sources of further reports about his life. They are scattered and of dubious value in reconstructing his life. Apparently, he lived for some time at Heraclea, where he was the pupil of Aresas, or (as Plutarch calls him) Arcesus.[12] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius is the only authority for the claim that shortly after the death of Socrates, Plato traveled to Italy where he met with Philolaus and Eurytus.[13] The pupils of Philolaus were said to have included Xenophilus, Phanto, Echecrates, Diocles, and Polymnastus.[14]/nAs to his death, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius reports a dubious story that Philolaus was put to death at Croton on account of being suspected of wanting to be the tyrant;[15] a story which Diogenes La\u00ebrtius even chose to put into verse.[16]/nPythagoras and his earliest successors do not appear to have committed any of their doctrines to writing. According to Porphyrius (Vit. Pyth. p. 40) Lysis and Archippus collected in a written form some of the principal Pythagorean doctrines, which were handed down as heirlooms in their families, under strict injunctions that they should not be made public. But amid the different and inconsistent accounts of the matter, the first publication of the Pythagorean doctrines is pretty uniformly attributed to Philolaus.[17]/nIn one source, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius speaks of Philolaus composing one book,[18] but elsewhere he speaks of three books,[19] as do Aulus Gellius and Iamblichus. It might have been one treatise divided into three books. Plato is said to have procured a copy of his book. Later, it was claimed that Plato composed much of his Timaeus based upon the book by Philolaus.[20]/nOne of the works of Philolaus was called On Nature.[18] It seems to be the same work that Stobaeus calls On the World and from which he has preserved a series of passages.[21] Other writers refer to a work entitled Bacchae, which may have been another name for the same work, and which may originate from Arignote. However, it has been mentioned that Proclus describes the Bacchae as a book for teaching theology by means of mathematics.[7] It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things.[22]/nHe composed a work on the Pythagorean philosophy in three books, which Plato is said to have procured at the cost of 100 minae through Dion of Syracuse, who purchased it from Philolaus, who was at the time in deep poverty.[23] Other versions of the story represent Plato as purchasing it himself from Philolaus or his relatives when in Sicily. [24] Out of the materials which he derived from these books Plato is said to have composed his Timaeus. But in the age of Plato the leading features of the Pythagorean doctrines had long ceased to be a secret; and if Philolaus taught the Pythagorean doctrines at Thebes, he was hardly likely to feel much reluctance in publishing them; and amid the conflicting and improbable accounts preserved in the authorities above referred to, little more can be regarded as trustworthy, except that Philolaus was the first who published a book on the Pythagorean doctrines, and that Plato read and made use of it. [25]\nHistorians from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Chapter Philolaus' Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia, noted the following:[7]/nIt is implied that these books were not by Philolaus himself, and it seems likely that the statement refers to three spurious works assigned to Pythagoras at D.L. VIII 6  (Burkert 1972a, 224\u20135). The story of Plato's purchase of these books from Philolaus was probably invented to authenticate the three forged treatises of Pythagoras. Burkert's arguments (1972a, 238\u2013277), supported by further study (Huffman 1993), have led to a consensus that some 11 fragments are genuine (Frs. 1\u20136, 6a, 7, 13, 16 and 17 in the numbering of Huffman 1993) and derive from Philolaus' book On Nature (Barnes 1982; Kahn 1993 and 2001; Kirk, Raven and Schofield 1983; Nussbaum 1979; Zhmud 1997). Fragments 1, 6a and 13 are identified as coming from the book On Nature by ancient sources. Stobaeus cites fragments 2 and 4\u20137 as coming from a work On the Cosmos, but this appears to be an alternate title for On Nature, which probably arose because the chapter heading in Stobaeus under which the fragments are cited is 'On the Cosmos.'/nPhilolaus argued at the foundation of everything is the part played by the ideas of limit and the unlimited. One of the first declarations in the work of Philolaus was that all things in the universe result from a combination of the unlimited and the limiting;[27] for if all things had been unlimited, nothing could have been the object of knowledge.[28] Limiters and unlimiteds are combined in a harmony (harmonia):/nThis is the state of affairs about nature and harmony. The essence of things is eternal; it is a unique and divine nature, the knowledge of which does not belong to Man. Still it would not be possible that any of the things that are, and are known by us, should arrive to our knowledge, if this essence was not the internal foundation of the principles of which the world was founded, that is, of the limiting and unlimited elements. Now since these principles are not mutually similar, neither of similar nature, it would be impossible that the order of the world should have been formed by them, unless the harmony intervened [...]./nRobert Scoon explained Philolaus' universe in 1922:[29]/nPhilolaus is trying to show how the ordered universe that we know came into its present condition. It arose, he says, by the action of harmony on a basic substance, which we do not know but must infer. This substance consisted of different primary elements, and harmony fitted these together in such a way that nature \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 turns out to be an ordered world \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2./nThe book by Philolaus begins with the following:[7]/nNature (physis) in the world-order (cosmos) was fitted together out of things which are unlimited and out of things which are limiting, both the world-order as a whole and everything in it./nAccording to Stobaeus, Philolaus did away with the ideas of fixed direction in space and developed one of the first non-geocentric views of the universe and in his new way of thinking, the universe revolved around a hypothetical astronomical object he called the Central Fire./nPhilolaus says that there is fire in the middle at the centre [...] and again more fire at the highest point and surrounding everything. By nature the middle is first, and around it dance ten divine bodies\u2014the sky, the planets, then the sun, next the moon, next the earth, next the counterearth, and after all of them the fire of the hearth which holds position at the centre. The highest part of the surrounding, where the elements are found in their purity, he calls Olympus; the regions beneath the orbit of Olympus, where are the five planets with the sun and the moon, he calls the world; the part under them, being beneath the moon and around the earth, in which are found generation and change, he calls the sky./nIn Philolaus's system a sphere of the fixed stars, the five planets, the Sun, Moon, and Earth, all moved around a Central Fire. According to Aristotle, writing in Metaphysics, Philolaus added a tenth unseen body, he called Counter-Earth, as without it there would be only nine revolving bodies, and the Pythagorean number theory required a tenth. However, Greek scholar George Burch asserts his belief that Aristotle was lampooning Philolaus's addition./nThe system that Philolaus described predated the idea of spheres by hundreds of years, however.[30] Nearly two-thousand years later, Nicolaus Copernicus would mention in De revolutionibus that Philolaus already knew about the Earth's revolution around a central fire./nIt has been pointed out, however, that Stobaeus betrays a tendency to confound the dogmas of the early Ionian philosophers, and in his accounts, he occasionally mixes up Platonism with Pythagoreanism.[31]", "308290": "Walter William Rouse Ball[a] (14 August 1850 \u2013 4 April 1925), known as W.\u00a0W.

He was the author of 57 books (some under the pen name Robert Irving) about mathematics, science, and education, and the co-author of 30 more, for both children and adults. His books have been published in 31 countries in 19 different languages. Since his teenaged years, Adler was involved in social and political activities[3] focused on civil rights, civil liberties, and peace, including his role as a plaintiff in the McCarthy-era case Adler vs. Board of Education[4] that bears his name./nIrving Adler was born in Harlem, in New York City, the third of five children. His parents emigrated to the United States from Galicia, a part of Austria, which today is a part of Poland, with his father coming in 1906 to seek work and his mother following four years later. His father, working first as a house painter, earned enough money to start a small business selling ice, coal, wood, seltzer, and prohibition beer (less than 1/2 of 1% alcohol). Adler was given the Hebrew name Yitzchak, anglicized on his birth certificate as Isaac. His name was changed to Irving by a school clerk when he was enrolled in elementary school. Adler was accelerated in school five times, entering Townsend Harris High School at age 11, and beginning City College (CCNY) when he was 14.[5] During his junior year he was awarded the Belden Gold Medal[6] for excellence in mathematics and a Silver Medal for ranking second in the college. Adler graduated magna cum laude from CCNY in 1931, when he was 18./nAdler began his teaching career with a one-year appointment as a teacher-in-training at Stuyvesant High School. After being licensed as a regular teacher, he taught for 3 years as a substitute teacher during a period when the Board of Education, in violation of state law, refused to fill vacancies with regular teachers entitled to full benefits. He joined the Unemployed Teachers Association, which filed a lawsuit that resulted in 3,500 teachers, including Adler, being elevated from substitute to regular status in one day./nIn the course of Adler's activities in the student peace movement of the 1930s, he met Ruth Relis, a Barnard College student whom he married when she graduated in 1935. Irving and Ruth Adler had two children, Stephen and Peggy./nAdler taught mathematics at various New York City high schools during the 1930s and 1940s. He was chair of the math department at Straubenmuller Textile High School from 1946 until 1952. He was also an active member of the New York City Teachers Union, Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers, and was drafted into a leadership role as a member of its executive board, chairman of the educational policy committee, and then as chairman of the salary and legislative committee./nAfter President Harry Truman issued an executive order in 1947 calling for loyalty investigations of federal employees, New York State adopted the \"Feinberg Law\" in 1949 providing for the dismissal of teachers who belonged to \"subversive organizations\". The New York Teachers' Union won a suit challenging the constitutionality of the Feinberg Law in the New York State Supreme Court, but the decision was reversed on appeal to the federal courts. The United States Supreme Court decided against the teachers in a 6\u20133 decision in 1952, in a case that became known as Adler vs. Board of Education[4][7] because Adler was the plaintiff with the earliest name alphabetically./nBefore the Feinberg Law was implemented, the New York Superintendent of Schools, William Jansen, began calling in teachers for questioning. Union leaders and active members were asked the same question being asked of those subpoenaed before the House Un-American Activities Committee, \"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?\" On the advice of counsel, most refused to answer on the grounds that the question was a violation of section 26a of the New York Civil Service Law that prohibited questioning civil service employees about their political affiliation. Those who refused to answer the question, Adler among them, were dismissed for \"insubordination and conduct unbecoming a teacher.\" Adler was suspended in 1952 and dismissed in 1954./nIn 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in a subsequent case, Keyishian v. Board of Regents.[8] The teachers who had been fired in the 1950s then sued for reinstatement. Adler was reinstated and retired from the city schools in 1977, with his pension rights restored./nAdler wrote his first science book for children, The Secret of Light,[9] while still working as a teacher. It was published by International Publishers in 1952. In 1955, he began a long association with the John Day Company, his first title for them being Time in Your Life.[10] Although the majority of Adler's books were published by the John Day Company, he had seven published by Alfred A. Knopf, under the pen name \"Robert Irving\", and several by Golden Press and Doubleday under his own name. Adler wrote six books a year for many years, mostly on scientific subjects for the junior-high and high-school levels./nA book Adler wrote for adults in 1958, The New Mathematics,[11] was important in the \"New Math\" curriculum reform movement, and led to his frequent appearances at educational meetings throughout North America./nIn 1959, Irving and Ruth Adler together began writing \"The Reason Why\" series of books about scientific concepts for elementary school children. Adler also wrote The Giant Golden Book of Mathematics[12] followed by a series of six arithmetic workbooks for grade-school children, aptly named Mathematics - Grade 1 through Mathematics - Grade 6. His workbooks eventually sold about 28 million copies worldwide./nIrving and Ruth Adler moved from their home in Bayside, New York, to Shaftsbury, Vermont, at the end of 1960. In 1961, Irving Adler completed his doctorate in mathematics at Columbia University under supervision of Ellis Kolchin. After moving to Vermont, he became the chairman of a committee of Vermont peace organizations that mobilized against atmospheric testing of atomic weapons; led a contingent from southern Vermont to the 1963 March on Washington; and was president of a group called the Vermont-in-Mississippi Corporation that supported civil rights activities in the southern U.S./nRuth Adler died of cancer in early 1968. Later that year, Irving Adler married Joyce Sparer, a long-time family friend who had been teaching in Guyana. Irving and Joyce Sparer Adler co-authored Language and Man (1970), after which she pursued her own writings. After the death of Joyce's daughter Ellen, her three children came to live with them in Shaftsbury in 1977, and Adler retired from writing full-time. In 1984, the Adlers embarked on an around-the-world lecture tour, speaking at universities in Australia, New Zealand, and several countries in Asia, and Europe./nIn the late 1970s, Adler turned his attention to the question of phyllotaxis, specifically to the arrangement of plant spirals according to the Fibonacci sequence. His papers in the Journal of Theoretical Biology serve as the basis for a revival of interest in the subject. In 2012, a compilation of these papers was published in the book Solving the Riddle of Phyllotaxis by World Scientific Publishing.[13] The book's foreword is by Adler's son, Stephen L. Adler, and the diagrams by his daughter, Peggy Adler.

Although Manetti never himself published his research regarding the topic, the earliest Renaissance Florentine editors of the poem, Cristoforo Landino and Girolamo Benivieni, reported the results of his researches in their respective editions of the Divine Comedy. Manetti is also famous for his short story, The Fat Woodworker, which recounts a cruel practical joke devised by Brunelleschi.[2] Furthermore, his supposed authorship of the biography of Filippo Brunelleschi has been widely discussed and analyzed.[3] Manetti was further a member of the Arte di Por Santa Maria[4] (also known as Arte della Seta), one of the seven Arti Maggiori guilds of Florence./nBorn to a family of silk merchants, Manetti not only received an excellent education but was confronted with ample free time in which he was able to cultivate his many interests, which included mathematics, geometry, astronomy and philosophy.[3]/nFrom the Parte Guelfa records, it becomes apparent that Manetti had 4 brothers, named Nezzo di Tuccio Marabottino, Lorenzo di Tuccio Marabottino, Marabottino di Tuccio di Marabottino and Benedetto di Tuccio Marabottino.[4] Also present in the records is what seems like his grandson, Benedetto di Tuccio di Marabottino, which would indicate a marriage at some point in his life.[4]/nMuch of what is known about Manetti's private life stems from the works of Milanesi; He writes that Manetti was named a Bonomini in 1470.[3] He became a member of the Bal\u00eca a year later and in 1475 he became the Vicario of the Valdarno di Sopra.[3] In 1476 he was one of the Priori and in 1481 he was Vicario of Valdinievole.[3] In 1485 he was Gonfaloniere di Giustizia, and after that he served as Podest\u00e0 of Colle di Val d'Elsa.[3] He was among the civis et architectus working on the facade of S. Maria del Fiore in January 1491.[3] His presence in the executive branch of the Florentinian government suggests that Manetti was well connected with influential thinkers of his time.[5]/nRecent documents also suggest that during 1466 Manetti was part of the operai of the Spedale degli Innocenti.[3]/nOf the vita of Filippo Brunelleschi three manuscripts have survived until modern time. They are called Magliabecchiana (Magl.), Pistoiese (Pist.), and Corsiniana (Cor.).[3]/nOf the three, the Magliabecchiana has received the most thorough attention. The first edited version by Canon Domenico Moreni was published in 1812 and attributed the work to an anonymous contemporary of Brunelleschi.[6] The year 1887 brought the publication of three new publications of the work./nThe first, and simultaneously best known edition, was edited by Gaetano Milanesi who attributed the handwriting to Manetti.[7] Milanesi also contemporized the orthography in his edition which has led to critique of his work.[8]/nAnother edition of the Maggliabecchiana was edited by Carl Frey in 1887 and was intended to be used in lectures.[9] In comparison with other editions, this has been called the closest translation of the original document.[3] Frey mentions that Milanesi attributed the authorship of the document to Manetti, however he remains critical of the truth of this statement.[9]/nThe third publication was an edited version of Moreni's translation by Heinrich Holtzinger which attributes the work to Manetti, citing Milanesi as his source.[10] Holtzinger states as the reason for this re-publication the rarity of Moreni's version in German bookstores.[10] Holtzinger also states that his version was first created without access to the original document and only in the late stages was it possible to compare his version with the document and refer to deviations in his appendix.[10]/nThis text was discovered and edited by Alessandro Chiappelli.[3] The publication in 1896 provided additional information regarding some of Brunnelleschi's work, however, Chiappelli has been criticized for working not with the original Magliabecchiana but with Milanesi's publication for the first part of his work.[3] Elena Toesca published another edition in 1927, using both a re-edited version of Milanesi's edition and copying Chiappelli's work.[3]/nThis version of the manuscript leaves out the first part of the Vita and continues where the Magl. abruptly stops.[3]/nThis manuscript has not been published and is not well known.[3] Although it shares its first and last sentence with the Pistoiese manuscript, it is written in different handwritings and thus can not be attributed to one author.[3]/nAlthough the authorship and the dating of the documents has been subject to scholarly debate, most agree that the document was written by Antonio Manetti before 1497.[3] Cornel von Fabriczy has attempted a more accurate dating than the death of Manetti and set the work in the 1480s.[8] He presents as his evidence the past tense use regarding Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, who died in 1482.[8] He also states that the work had to be finished before 1489, as some changes to one of the buildings of Brunelleschi were made in that year and not recorded in the biography.[8]/nWhen it comes to authorship of the Magliabecchiana, the debate starts with the question of whether the Magl. is an original document or merely a copy.[3] While Moreni and Milanesi agree that the Magl. is indeed the original document, only Frey offers evidence on this conclusion.[3] The reason for the importance of this debate is, that the evidence of the authorship of the document that Milanesi presents, is based on the handwriting of the document.[7] Subsequently, if the document is merely a copy and not the original, Manetti is not the original author of the Magl. It is further important that Milanesi attributes the handwriting of the document to Manetti on the basis of Manetti's work \"the fat woodworker\".[7] This has led to critique, as Manetti is known for making copies of other works such as Ficino's translation of \"Dante's Monarchy\".[1] Another part of the critique is that the work differs from other writing attributed to Manetti, both in length and style.[1]/nThe absence of corrections in the text has led to both arguments for and against it being a copy.[3] It has also been attributed to a fluent style of writing which was practiced frequently by Florentinian humanists.[3] Although no final conclusion can be drawn, Manetti's handwriting was found under a pasted-over piece of paper, negating much of the evidence for a copy based on the absence of corrections.[3]/nAlthough Dante described his Inferno, the specifics of his architecture are left to the imagination of his fellow thinkers, which has led to various versions of the Inferno.[11] Manetti's version of Dante's Inferno gained attention through Galileo Galilei and his lectures regarding Dante's inferno in 1588.[11] In these lectures, Galileo compared the shape, location and size of proposed Infernos by Antonio Manetti and Alessandro Vellutello of Lucca.[12] The reasoning behind Galileo's favoritism towards Manetti's work can be traced towards a political conflict with Vellutello's hometown of Lucca.[12] During a previous military conflict between the two places in 1430, Filipo Brunelleschi had suggested to re-route a river in order to isolate Lucca and force a surrender to the siege.[12] However, this had failed spectacularly with the flooding of the Florentinian's own camp and led to the humiliation of not only Brunelleschi but the whole of Florence.[12]/nManetti's Inferno consists of a cone-shaped region, the vertex of which is centred and its base centred on Jerusalem.[12] Manetti proposes a direct line from the center of the Earth, simultaneously the heaviest part of the universe, to Jerusalem.[12] An arc extends from Jerusalem over the Earth and water to a twelfth part of its circumference.[12] One end of this arc will touch Jerusalem, while the other end of this arc will be connected to the center of the earth by a straight line.[12] These two straight lines will form the sector of a circle, which if moved in a circle and cutting through the Earth would reveal a cone like hole; the Inferno.[12]/nManetti's levels of the Inferno are arranged regularly, being 1/8 of the Earth's circumference apart between each level. Galileo calculated that this would lead to a diameter of 405 miles of the cone at its surface and with that being much larger in size than Vellutello's Inferno.[12]/nManetti himself never published his investigation into Dante's inferno, his findings were instead published by Girolamo Benevieni in his Dialogo de Antonio Manetti.[13]/nThe Fat Woodworker or Fat Woodcarver (IT.: Novella del Grasso Legnajulo) is a humorous book in the beffe tradition.[2] The book tells the tale of a cruel and juvenile prank played on a woodworker named Manetto by Filipo Brunelleschi.[14]/nThe story is set in the year 1409 in Florence around influential men of the public life.[14] The tale introduces the reader to the social scene of artists and artisanal workers in Florence, while setting up Brunelleschi as a questionable hero.[2] These men often eat dinner together, but one night a woodworker named Manetto is absent from the group.[14] The men interpret this as a slight by Manetto, who is described as having a simple mind.[14] The men decide to play a prank on Manetto as a punishment for his refusal of the dinner invitation.[14] Filipo Brunelleschi comes up with the idea to convince Manetto that he has become another person, after convincing the other men that he is simple enough to believe this.[14]/nBrunelleschi goes about his plan and is able to convince Manetto that he has indeed become another person.[14] The story follows Manetto's internal confusion while focusing on the psychological aspects of the prank on the woodworker.[2] At the end of the story, Manetto goes to Hungary and comes back to Florence on several occasions.[14] He has gained a deeper understanding of the meaning of self and even smiles when Brunelleschi finally reveals himself as the mastermind some years later.[2] Instead of focusing on the cruelty of the joke, the story focuses on how the prank has benefitted Manetto.[2]/nThe Zibaldone Manetti is a collection of writings by Antonio Manetti's hand, which are attributed to other authors.[2] It can be found in the National Library in Florence and includes works like The Book of Archandreo by Gherardi di Cremona, Immago Mundia, Della Imagine del Mondo di Santo Isidero, De Origine Civitas Florentinae by Filippo Vilani, The Life of Charlemagne by Donato Acciaiuolo.[2]/nThe works show the wide reaching interests of Manetti, which span from architecture to astronomy and the arts to mathematics, geography, and Dante.[2]/nMedia related to Category:Antonio Manetti at Wikimedia Commons", "1750122": "Damiaen J. van Doorninck (29 August 1902 Vught, Netherlands - 24 September 1987, Mynachlog-ddu, Wales[1]) was a Dutch officer (lieutenant commander in the Royal Netherlands Navy Reserve) and a prisoner of war in Colditz./nIn May 1940 he was aide de camp to the Dutch supreme commander, General Henri Winkelman.

Kmeth accused him in several scientific journals of forging observational data of Buda Observatory. After examining the data many prominent scientists in Europe stood in Paskvi\u0107's defense, such as Carl Friedrich Gauss, Friedrich Bessel, Johann Franz Encke, Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers, Heinrich Christian Schumacher. From 1824 he worked in Vienna where he died./nPaskvi\u0107 dealt with astronomy, higher geodesy, mathematics, mechanics and theory of machines. His scientific work is divided into two periods. The first period deals with mechanics, higher mathematics and with its applications to theory of machines.[1][2][3] The second period deals with astronomy and higher geodesy.[4][5][6][7] He derives the formula for the length of a mathematical seconds pendulum at any place on the Earth, compares it with that of Laplace and corrects de Prony's formula for the length of physical seconds pendulum.[8] He determined the flattening of the Earth by finding formula's for 1) radius of the circle that passes through a point on Earth's surface and is parallel to the equator, 2) distance of the center of this circle from the center of the Earth, 3) meridian radius curvature at any point on Earth's surface, 4) size of one meridian degree, 5) the angle between the radius of the Earth at the equator and at some other point on Earth's surface, 6) the length of the quarter meridian, 7) the length of the meridian arc, 8) surface of Earth's zone between any two parallels.[9][10]", "18887796": "Jean-Michel Bismut (born 26 February 1948) is a French mathematician who has been a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud since 1981.[1]\nHis mathematical career covers two apparently different branches of\nmathematics: probability theory and differential geometry. Ideas from probability play an important role in his works on geometry./nBismut's early work was related to stochastic differential equations, stochastic control, and Malliavin calculus, to which he made fundamental contributions./nBismut received in 1973 his Docteur d'\u00c9tat in Mathematics, from the Universit\u00e9 Paris-VI, a thesis entitled Analyse convexe et probabilit\u00e9s.  In his thesis, Bismut established a stochastic version of Pontryagin's maximum principle in control theory by introducing and studying the backward stochastic differential equations which have been the starting point of an intensive research in stochastic analysis and it stands now as a major tool in Mathematical Finance.[2]\n[3]/nUsing the quasi-invariance of the Brownian measure, Bismut gave a new approach to the Malliavin calculus and a probabilistic proof of H\u00f6rmander's theorem. He established his celebrated integration by parts for the Brownian motion on manifolds./nSince 1984, Bismut works on differential geometry.\nHe found a heat equation proof for the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem.\nAnd he established a local version of the Atiyah-Singer families index theorem for Dirac operators, by introducing the Bismut superconnection which plays a central role in modern aspects of index theory./nBismut-Freed developed the theory of Quillen metrics on the smooth determinant line bundle associated with a family of Dirac operators. Bismut-Gillet-Soul\u00e9 gave a curvature theorem for the Quillen metric on the holomorphic determinant of a direct image by a holomorphic proper submersion. This and Bismut\u2014Lebeau's embedding formula for analytic torsions play a crucial role in the proof of the arithmetic Riemann-Roch theorem in Arakelov theory, in which analytic torsion is an essential analytic ingredient in the definition of the direct image./nBismut gave a natural construction of a Hodge theory whose corresponding Laplacian is a hypoelliptic operator acting on the total space of the cotangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold. This operator interpolates formally between the classical elliptic Laplacian on the base and the generator of the geodesic flow. One striking application is Bismut's explicit formulas for all orbital integrals at semi-simple elements of any reductive Lie group./nHe was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in the summer of 1984.[4] In 1990, he was awarded the Prix Ampere of the Academy of Sciences.

She was an acclaimed scholar: \"An extraordinary woman of 18th century China.\"[3]/nWang's ancestral home is in Anhui province, but her grandfather's family moved to Jiangning or present-day Nanjing.[1][2] She was very fond of reading when she was a child and was very clever.[1]/nHer family consisted of her grandfather, grandmother, and her father. Her grandfather Wang Zhefu (\u738b\u8005\u8f85), was a former governor of Fengchen county and Xuanhua District. He had a broad and profound intellect with a deep love for reading and had a collection of over seventy-five bookshelves. Her father Wang Xichen failed the imperial examination and instead studied medical science and recorded his findings in a four-volume collection called \"Yifang Yanchao\" (Collection of Medical Prescriptions).[1] Her grandmother's maiden name was Dong. Her grandfather was her first teacher in astronomy; her grandmother was her teacher of poetry; and her father taught her medicine, geography, and mathematics.[4]/nFrom the age of 9, she was taught to write poetry and essays, showing a keen sensitivity to social and human conditions, and had unique thoughts and understandings of social realities. After the death of Wang Zhefu, she, along with her grandmother Dong and her father, went to mourn outside the Great Wall and lived in Jilin for four years, where she studied under the Lady of Bu Qianyao. Wang Zhefu died in 1782 and the family traveled to Jiling (close to the Great Wall) for his funeral. They stayed in the region for five years, which is where Zhenyi gained extensive knowledge from reading her grandfather\u2019s collection of books as well as learning equestrian skills, archery, and martial arts from the wife of a Mongolian general named Aa.[1]  At the age of eleven, Wang Zhenyi accompanied her grandmother to Jilin to mourn her grandfather. She lived in Xuanhua Prefecture for five years. Later, she also traveled with her grandmother and father to various places including Beijing, Shaanxi, Hubei, Guangdong, and Anhui. During these journeys, she visited numerous historical sites, gaining extensive experiences and exposure to various aspects of society.[5]/nAt the age of sixteen, Wang Zhenyi traveled south of the Yangtze river with her father until she moved back to the capital. She was able to see places like Shaanxi, Hubei, and Guangdong, broadening her horizons and enriching her experiences.[1] When she was eighteen, she made friends with female scholars in Jiangning through her poetry and began focusing on her studies in astronomy and mathematics, most of which were self-taught.[4] At age twenty-five she married Zhan Mei from Xuancheng in Anhui province. After her marriage, she became better known for her poetry and knowledge in mathematics and astronomy that she once taught to some male students.[4] Wang Zhenyi died at age twenty-nine and had no children.[1]/nAlthough she only lived to be twenty-nine, Wang Zhenyi was very accomplished in the academic world. She excelled in astronomy and mathematics. One of her contributions was being able to describe her views of celestial phenomena in her article, \"Dispute of the Procession of the Equinoxes.\" She was able to explain and simply prove how equinoxes move and then how to calculate their movement. She wrote many other articles such as \"Dispute of Longitude and Stars\" as well as \"The Explanation of a Lunar Eclipse.\" She commented on the number of stars; the revolving direction of the sun, the moon, and the planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn; as well as describing the relationship between lunar and solar eclipses.[1] Not only did she study the research of other astronomers, but she was also able to do her own original research. At that time, there were few successors in the field of new astronomical calendrical knowledge. Moreover, due to the civil service examination system focusing on the eight-legged essay, scholars were disinclined to study natural sciences like calendrical astronomy, fearing its complexity and difficulty. As a result, the study of calendrical astronomy nearly became a \"lost art\" of the era. Additionally, the restrictions on women learning astronomical calendrics were even more stringent, as it was deemed inappropriate for them to study in their seclusion. However, Wang Zhenyi had a profound understanding of the social significance of astronomical studies. She bravely went against the current, persistently delving into both Chinese and Western astronomical knowledge, and authored several works on the subject. Of her works, only about ten papers, such as \"Explanation of Lunar Eclipses\" and \"Explanation of the Starry Sky,\" have survived.[6]/nOne of her experiments to study a lunar eclipse included placing a round table in a garden pavilion, acting as a globe; she hung a crystal lamp on a cord from the ceiling beams, representing the sun. Then on one side of the table, she had a round mirror like the moon. She moved these three objects as if they were the sun, earth, and moon according to astronomical principles. Her findings and observations were very accurate and recorded in her article, \"The Explanation of a Solar Eclipse.\"[1]/nIn the realm of mathematics, Zhenyi mastered trigonometry and knew the Pythagorean theorem. She wrote an article called \"The Explanation of the Pythagorean Theorem and Trigonometry,\" where she described a triangle and the relationship between the shorter leg of a right triangle, the long leg, and the triangle's hypotenuse all correctly.[1]/nShe admired the mathematician Mei Wending (1633\u20131721 A.D.). [1] He was famous in the early Qing dynasty and wrote the book, Principles of Calculation. Wang Zhenyi became a master of this book, rewriting it with simpler language, and made it available to others under the title, The Musts of Calculation. She was able to simplify multiplication and division to make learning mathematics easier for beginners.[1] She was very dedicated in her study of mathematics and wrote a book called The Simple Principles of Calculation when she was twenty-four. Her studies were difficult and she once said, \"There were times that I had to put down my pen and sigh. But I love the subject, I do not give up.\"[1]/nWang Zhenyi's \"Explanation of Lunar Eclipses\" primarily analyzes the causes of lunar eclipses, with theories consistent with modern astronomical principles. In her work, she summarized various astronomical theories from Yu Xi to Guo Shoujing, and aligned them with Islamic, Western, and modern calendars. She corrected misunderstandings about the movement of celestial bodies and established the gradual shift of stars over decades, a concept nearly accurate to actual conditions./nWang Zhenyi also clarified concepts of calendrical epochs and methods, differentiating between the starting point of calendar creation and the methods of calculation, including arithmetic, diagrams, and instruments. She argued that changes in calendars across dynasties were about epochs, not methods./nIn \"Theory of the Earth's Roundness,\" Wang Zhenyi refuted the thousand-year-old concept of a flat earth with a round sky, applying astronomical and geographical terms to advocate for the concept of a spherical Earth and revealing the idea of relative spatial positions, a significant advancement over traditional beliefs./nHer works, including discussions on the movements of stars and planets, addressed complex questions in an accessible manner, significantly correcting misconceptions and promoting astronomical knowledge./nWang Zhenyi compared Chinese and Western astronomical knowledge, adopting a comparative approach in her research. She identified both similarities and key differences in Chinese and Western methods, contributing to the integration of these knowledge systems in the 18th century./nDespite limited experimental tools, Wang Zhenyi conducted simple experiments, like her innovative approach to understanding lunar eclipses using a lamp, a table, and a mirror. Her observational skills also extended to meteorology, where she recorded weather patterns and made accurate predictions./nWang Zhenyi's contributions to medicine, although not encapsulated in a specific book, are evident in her prefaces to her father's medical works and her practical medical knowledge. She emphasized diagnostic precision, preventive medicine, and bespoke treatment strategies, showcasing her deep understanding and practical experience in medical sciences./nWang's works and approach were groundbreaking for her time, blending Chinese and Western scientific knowledge, advocating for comparative research, and applying innovative methods in both astronomy and mathematics. Her legacy is a testament to her contributions to science and culture in 18th-century China.[7]/nHer travel experiences as well as her academic research gave her plenty of ideas and material for her poetry. She left a lasting impression through her literature. She left thirteen volumes of Ci (poetry), prose, and prefaces and postscripts written for other works.[1]  The famous Qing dynasty scholar Yuan Mei commented on Wang\u2019s poetry by saying it, \u201chad the flavor of a great pen, not of a female poet.\u201d[1] Zhenyi\u2019s poetry was known for its lack of flowery words, at the time believed to be common to feminine traits.[4]  Her poetry included her understanding of classics and history and experiences during her travels, such as sceneries and the lives of commoners with whom she made acquaintances./nSome examples of her work are:/n\u201cTransiting Tong Pass\u201d/nSo important is the doorway,\noccupying the throat of the mountain\nLooking down from the heaven,\nThe sun sees Yellow river streaming[1]/n\u201cClimbing Tai Mountain\u201d/nClouds overcast the hills,\nThe sun bathes in the sea.[1]/nShe also depicted the hard lives of commoners, especially those of laboring women in poems like \u201cWoman Breeder of Silkworm\u201d and \u201cClothes Washing.\u201d In addition, she portrayed corruption and the polar contrast between the lives of the rich and poor in poems like \u201cA Poem of Eight Lines,\u201d which contained:/nVillage is empty of cooking smoke,\nRich families let grains stored decay;\nIn wormwood strewed pitiful starved bodies,\nGreedy officials yet push farm levying.[1]/nWang Zhenyi's poetry is renowned for its simplicity, directness, and emotional depth. Her verses often reflect social realities, shedding light on the conditions and sentiments of her time. She utilized poetry as a medium to express her thoughts on various themes, including the status of women in society, the value of education, and her love for scientific inquiry. Her work is notable for its blend of traditional literary forms with progressive ideas, making her a unique voice in Qing Dynasty literature. Her poetic legacy, though partially preserved, remains a testament to her intellect, empathy, and pioneering spirit as a female scholar in a male-dominated era./nWang Zhenyi died at the age of twenty-nine. There is no exact record of how she died. When she knew she was dying, she gave her works and manuscripts to her best friend, Madam Kuai (1763\u20131827 A.D.) who eventually passed them on to her nephew, Qian Yiji (1783\u20131850 A.D.), who was a famous scholar of the time.[1] He compiled her work into Shusuan Jiancun or Simple Principles of Calculation.[1] He described Wang Zhenyi as the \"number one female scholar after Ban Zhao.\"[1]/nIn the second year of the Jiaqing era, Wang Zhenyi suffered a relapse of malaria and fell seriously ill. During her illness, she and her husband Zhan Quan sorted through her writings, \"deleting and burning much, with only about twenty to thirty percent preserved.\" Before her death, she entrusted her husband to deliver her remaining manuscripts to Lady Kuai, expressing her wish for Lady Kuai to commemorate her after her passing. Unfortunately, Wang Zhenyi's last wishes were not fully realized. In the fourth year of the Jiaqing era (1799), Wang Zhenyi tragically passed away at the age of only 30. A few years later, her husband Zhan Quan also passed away unexpectedly, leaving no children.[7]/nDuring the Qing Dynasty, it was extremely difficult for women to study, and even more so to excel in natural sciences such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine, which were considered exceptionally rare fields of study.[8] Young female scientists like Wang Zhenyi were extremely rare in feudal society. The Qing scholar Qian Yiji praised her in the preface of \"Shu Suan Jian Cun,\" likening her to Ban Zhao, a prominent female scholar of ancient China. Wang Zhenyi was not only accomplished in natural sciences but also progressive in thought. From a young age, she dedicated every moment to studying and reading extensively, believing that \"one's pursuit of learning knows no bounds, and every moment is precious.\" Her travels with her father broadened her horizons and expanded her mind. However, in the feudal society, women like her, despite their ambitions, had limited opportunities to express themselves. She expressed strong dissatisfaction with the feudal society's denial of education and learning opportunities for women and protested against the societal norm of undervaluing women in academics. She yearned for freedom and hoped that women could harbor the ambition and intellect of men. Unfortunately, many of her scientific works were not recognized by society or even understood by her relatives, some of whom mocked her pursuits. Most of her scientific works have been lost, and only some of her general readership writings remain. Wang Zhenyi was a well-rounded talent with achievements in literature, history, poetry, and lyrics, mainly self-taught. Later scholars described her as versatile in both literary and martial arts, excelling in a wide range of subjects, and unparalleled in her comprehensive expertise, particularly in astronomy and understanding both Chinese and Western methods.[6]/nWang Zhenyi believed in equality and equal opportunity for both men and women. She wrote in one of her poems:/nIt's made to believe,\nWomen are the same as Men;\nAre you not convinced,\nDaughters can also be heroic?[1]/n\u8db3\u884c\u4e07\u91cc\u4e66\u4e07\u5377\uff0c\u5c1d\u62df\u96c4\u5fc3\u80dc\u4e08\u592b\uff01/nShe was pleased in her marriage, and she believed social feudal values were inappropriate \"when talking about learning and sciences, people thought of no women,\" she said that \"women should only do cooking and sewing, and that they should not be bothered about writing articles for publication, studying history, composing poetry or doing calligraphy.\"[1] [Men and women] \"are all people, who have the same reason for studying.\"[1]/nIn 1994, the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature approved naming crater on Venus Wang Zhenyi after her.[9]/nWang Zhenyi's legacy is marked by her remarkable achievements as a female scientist, poet, and scholar during the Qing Dynasty, a period when women's education was highly restricted. She defied societal norms by excelling in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Her dedication to learning and extensive travels allowed her to gain a broad perspective and deep understanding of various subjects. Despite the challenges she faced as a woman in a feudal society, Wang Zhenyi persisted in her pursuits and expressed her thoughts on gender equality and the importance of education for women. Her poetry and few surviving scientific writings reflect her intellectual depth and progressive thinking. Wang Zhenyi is celebrated as a pioneering figure in Chinese history, remembered for her contributions to science and literature and as an inspiring example of women's capabilities in scholarly and scientific fields. Her life and work challenged the gender norms of her time and set a precedent for future generations./nWang Zhenyi, a renowned Qing Dynasty female scholar, continues to be remembered and honored in modern times for her contributions to various fields. Some significant instances of her modern remembrance include:/nThese tributes and references highlight Wang Zhenyi's enduring legacy as a trailblazer in science and a symbol of women's intellectual capabilities, particularly in a historical context where such achievements were extraordinary.

Gans's annals are memorable as the first work of this kind among the German Jews.[citation needed] In his preface to the second volume the author tries to justify writing about a \"profane\" subject like general history, and demonstrated that it was permitted to read history on Shabbat. Tzemach David was published in many editions. To the 1692 edition published in Frankfurt, David ben Moses Rheindorf added a third part containing the annals of that century, which addition has been retained in later editions of the Tzemach.

In one of his lectures Wishart described his geometric derivation of the Wishart distribution. Overnight Bartlett worked out a proof using characteristic functions. Bartlett was Wishart's first post-graduate student and they wrote two papers together. This was the beginning of Bartlett's involvement with multivariate analysis. During his Queens years, he rowed for the college.[7]/nIn 1933, Bartlett was recruited by Egon Pearson to the new statistics department at University College, London. Pearson was already working with Jerzy Neyman. Also in the college were Ronald A. Fisher and J. B. S. Haldane. Bartlett was stimulated by all of them, most of all by the work of Fisher, criticising some of it (for example, fiducial inference) while developing other parts (for example conditional inference). Relations between the two men fluctuated; sometimes Bartlett was in Fisher's good books, but often not. In 1934, Bartlett became statistician at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) agricultural research station at Jealott's Hill. Not only did he deal with practical problems but he worked on statistical theory, as well as on problems in genetics but he became interested in the characterisation of intelligence. He remembered Jealott's Hill as the best working environment of his career. Bartlett left ICI for the University of Cambridge in 1938 but at the outset of World War II was mobilised into the Ministry of Supply, conducting rocket research alongside Frank Anscombe, David Kendall and Pat Moran./nAfter the war Bartlett's renewed Cambridge work focused on time-series analysis and stochastic process. With Jo Moyal he planned a large book on probability, but the collaboration did not work out and Bartlett went ahead and published his own book on stochastic processes. He made a number of visits to the United States. In 1947 he became professor of mathematical statistics at the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester where he not only developed his interests in epidemiology but also served as an able and active administrator. In 1960, he took up the chair of statistics at University College, London before serving the last eight years of his academic life as professor of biomathematics at the University of Oxford. He retired in 1975./nAfter his retirement Bartlett remained active in statistics, visiting the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University several times. He had married Sheila, daughter of C. E. Chapman, in 1957, the couple parenting a daughter.

Coxeter derived Clifford's theorem by exchanging the arbitrary point on a line ab with an arbitrary sphere about 0 which then intersects ab.

However, he was forced to retire in 1935 and eventually fled Germany in 1939 and emigrated to the United States.[1]/nDehn was a student of David Hilbert, and in his habilitation in 1900 Dehn resolved Hilbert's third problem, making him the first to resolve one of Hilbert's well-known 23 problems. Dehn's students include Ott-Heinrich Keller, Ruth Moufang, Wilhelm Magnus, and the artists Dorothea Rockburne and Ruth Asawa./nDehn was born to a family of Jewish origin[2]\n[3] in Hamburg, Imperial Germany./nHe studied the foundations of geometry with Hilbert at G\u00f6ttingen in 1899, and obtained a proof of the Jordan curve theorem for polygons. In 1900 he wrote his dissertation on the role of the Legendre angle sum theorem in axiomatic geometry. \nFrom 1900 to 1911 he was an employee and researcher at the University of M\u00fcnster. In his habilitation at the University of M\u00fcnster in 1900 he resolved Hilbert's third problem, by introducing what was afterwards called the Dehn invariant. This was the first resolution of one of the Hilbert Problems./nDehn's interests later turned to topology and combinatorial group theory. In 1907 he wrote with Poul Heegaard the first book on the foundations of combinatorial topology, then known as analysis situs. Also in 1907, he described the construction of a new homology sphere. In 1908 he believed that he had found a proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, but Tietze found an error./nIn 1910 Dehn published a paper on three-dimensional topology in which he introduced Dehn surgery and used it to construct homology spheres. He also stated Dehn's lemma, but an error was found in his proof by Hellmuth Kneser in 1929. The result was proved in 1957 by Christos Papakyriakopoulos. The word problem for groups, also called the Dehn problem, was posed by him in 1911.[4]/nDehn married Antonie Landau on August 23, 1912. Also in 1912, Dehn invented what is now known as Dehn's algorithm and used it in his work on the word and conjugacy problems for groups. The notion of a Dehn function in geometric group theory, which estimates the area of a relation in a finitely presented group in terms of the length of that relation, is also named after him. In 1914 he proved that the left and right trefoil knots are not equivalent. In the early 1920s Dehn introduced the result that would come to be known as the Dehn-Nielsen theorem; its proof would be published in 1927 by Jakob Nielsen./nIn 1922 Dehn succeeded Ludwig Bieberbach at Frankfurt, where he stayed until he was forced to retire in 1935.

After negotiating his salary from $25 to $40 per month, Dehn and his wife moved into housing provided by the school and he began teaching in January 1945./nWhile at Black Mountain College, Dehn taught courses in Mathematics, Philosophy, Greek, and Italian. In his class \"Geometry for Artists,\" Dehn introduced students to geometric concepts such as points, lines, planes and solids; cones sectioned into circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas; spheres and regular polyhedrons. His classes had an emphasis on the way shapes relate to each other, a concept that can be useful in artistic mediums./nHe enjoyed the forested mountains found in Black Mountain, and would often hold class in the woods, giving lectures during hikes.

He is considered the founder of trigonometry,[1] but is most famous for his incidental discovery of the precession of the equinoxes.[2] Hipparchus was born in Nicaea, Bithynia, and probably died on the island of Rhodes, Greece. He is known to have been a working astronomer between 162 and 127\u00a0BC.[3]/nHipparchus is considered the greatest ancient astronomical observer and, by some, the greatest overall astronomer of antiquity.[4][5] He was the first whose quantitative and accurate models for the motion of the Sun and Moon survive. For this he certainly made use of the observations and perhaps the mathematical techniques accumulated over centuries by the Babylonians and by Meton of Athens (fifth century BC), Timocharis, Aristyllus, Aristarchus of Samos, and Eratosthenes, among others.[6]/nHe developed trigonometry and constructed trigonometric tables, and he solved several problems of spherical trigonometry. With his solar and lunar theories and his trigonometry, he may have been the first to develop a reliable method to predict solar eclipses./nHis other reputed achievements include the discovery and measurement of Earth's precession, the compilation of the first known comprehensive star catalog from the western world, and possibly the invention of the astrolabe, as well as of the armillary sphere that he may have used in creating the star catalogue. Hipparchus is sometimes called the \"father of astronomy\",[7][8] a title conferred on him by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre in 1817.[9]/nHipparchus was born in Nicaea (Greek: \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1), in Bithynia. The exact dates of his life are not known, but Ptolemy attributes astronomical observations to him in the period from 147 to 127\u00a0BC, and some of these are stated as made in Rhodes; earlier observations since 162\u00a0BC might also have been made by him. His birth date (c.\u2009190\u00a0BC) was calculated by Delambre based on clues in his work. Hipparchus must have lived some time after 127\u00a0BC because he analyzed and published his observations from that year. Hipparchus obtained information from Alexandria as well as Babylon, but it is not known when or if he visited these places. He is believed to have died on the island of Rhodes, where he seems to have spent most of his later life./nIn the second and third centuries, coins were made in his honour in Bithynia that bear his name and show him with a globe.[10]/nRelatively little of Hipparchus's direct work survives into modern times. Although he wrote at least fourteen books, only his commentary on the popular astronomical poem by Aratus was preserved by later copyists. Most of what is known about Hipparchus comes from Strabo's Geography and Pliny's Natural History in the first century; Ptolemy's second-century Almagest; and additional references to him in the fourth century by Pappus and Theon of Alexandria in their commentaries on the Almagest.[11][12]/nHipparchus's only preserved work is Commentary on the Phaenomena of Eudoxus and Aratus (Greek: \u03a4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u0395\u1f50\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03be\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). This is a highly critical commentary in the form of two books on a popular poem by Aratus based on the work by Eudoxus.[13] Hipparchus also made a list of his major works that apparently mentioned about fourteen books, but which is only known from references by later authors. His famous star catalog was incorporated into the one by Ptolemy and may be almost perfectly reconstructed by subtraction of two and two-thirds degrees from the longitudes of Ptolemy's stars. The first trigonometric table was apparently compiled by Hipparchus, who is consequently now known as \"the father of trigonometry\"./nEarlier Greek astronomers and mathematicians were influenced by Babylonian astronomy to some extent, for instance the period relations of the Metonic cycle and Saros cycle may have come from Babylonian sources (see \"Babylonian astronomical diaries\"). Hipparchus seems to have been the first to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically.[14] Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Timocharis and Aristillus in the 3rd century BC already divided the ecliptic in 360 parts (our degrees, Greek: moira) of 60 arcminutes and Hipparchus continued this tradition. It was only in Hipparchus's time (2nd century BC) when this division was introduced (probably by Hipparchus's contemporary Hypsikles) for all circles in mathematics. Eratosthenes (3rd century BC), in contrast, used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts. Hipparchus also adopted the Babylonian astronomical cubit unit (Akkadian ammatu, Greek \u03c0\u1fc6\u03c7\u03c5\u03c2 p\u0113chys) that was equivalent to 2\u00b0 or 2.5\u00b0 ('large cubit').[15]/nHipparchus probably compiled a list of Babylonian astronomical observations; Gerald J. Toomer, a historian of astronomy, has suggested that Ptolemy's knowledge of eclipse records and other Babylonian observations in the Almagest came from a list made by Hipparchus. Hipparchus's use of Babylonian sources has always been known in a general way, because of Ptolemy's statements, but the only text by Hipparchus that survives does not provide sufficient information to decide whether Hipparchus's knowledge (such as his usage of the units cubit and finger, degrees and minutes, or the concept of hour stars) was based on Babylonian practice.[16] However, Franz Xaver Kugler demonstrated that the synodic and anomalistic periods that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus had already been used in Babylonian ephemerides, specifically the collection of texts nowadays called \"System B\" (sometimes attributed to Kidinnu).[17][pages\u00a0needed]/nHipparchus's long draconitic lunar period (5,458 months = 5,923 lunar nodal periods) also appears a few times in Babylonian records.[18] But the only such tablet explicitly dated, is post-Hipparchus so the direction of transmission is not settled by the tablets./nHipparchus was recognized as the first mathematician known to have possessed a trigonometric table, which he needed when computing the eccentricity of the orbits of the Moon and Sun. He tabulated values for the chord function, which for a central angle in a circle gives the length of the straight line segment between the points where the angle intersects the circle. He may have computed this for a circle with a circumference of 21,600 units and a radius (rounded) of 3,438 units; this circle has a unit length for each arcminute along its perimeter. (This was \u201cproven\u201d by Toomer,[19] but he later \u201ccast doubt\u201c upon his earlier affirmation.[20] Other authors have argued that a circle of radius 3,600 units may instead have been used by Hipparchus.[21]) He tabulated the chords for angles with increments of 7.5\u00b0. In modern terms, the chord subtended by a central angle in a circle of given radius equals the radius times twice the sine of half of the angle, i.e.:/nThe now-lost work in which Hipparchus is said to have developed his chord table, is called T\u014dn en kukl\u014di euthei\u014dn (Of Lines Inside a Circle) in Theon of Alexandria's fourth-century commentary on section I.10 of the Almagest. Some claim the table of Hipparchus may have survived in astronomical treatises in India, such as the Surya Siddhanta. Trigonometry was a significant innovation, because it allowed Greek astronomers to solve any triangle, and made it possible to make quantitative astronomical models and predictions using their preferred geometric techniques.[19]/nHipparchus must have used a better approximation for \u03c0 than the one from Archimedes of between 3+10\u204471 (3.14085) and 3+1\u20447 (3.14286). Perhaps he had the one later used by Ptolemy: 3;8,30 (sexagesimal)(3.1417) (Almagest VI.7), but it is not known whether he computed an improved value./nHipparchus could have constructed his chord table using the Pythagorean theorem and a theorem known to Archimedes. He also might have developed and used the theorem called Ptolemy's theorem; this was proved by Ptolemy in his Almagest (I.10) (and later extended by Carnot)./nThe stereographic projection was ambiguously attributed to Hipparchus by Synesius (c. 400 AD), and on that basis Hipparchus is often credited with inventing it or at least knowing of it. However, some scholars believe this conclusion to be unjustified by available evidence.[22] The oldest extant description of the stereographic projection is found in Ptolemy's Planisphere (2nd century AD).[23]/nBesides geometry, Hipparchus also used arithmetic techniques developed by the Chaldeans. He was one of the first Greek mathematicians to do this and, in this way, expanded the techniques available to astronomers and geographers./nThere are several indications that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, but the first surviving text discussing it is by Menelaus of Alexandria in the first century, who now, on that basis, commonly is credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.) Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute things such as the rising and setting points of the ecliptic, or to take account of the lunar parallax. If he did not use spherical trigonometry, Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, or he may have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans./nHipparchus also studied the motion of the Moon and confirmed the accurate values for two periods of its motion that Chaldean astronomers are widely presumed to have possessed before him. The traditional value (from Babylonian System B) for the mean synodic month is 29\u00a0days; 31,50,8,20 (sexagesimal) = 29.5305941... days. Expressed as 29\u00a0days + 12\u00a0hours + 793/1080\u00a0hours this value has been used later in the Hebrew calendar. The Chaldeans also knew that 251 synodic months \u2248 269 anomalistic months. Hipparchus used the multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an eclipse period, and is also close to an integer number of years (4,267 moons\u00a0: 4,573 anomalistic periods\u00a0: 4,630.53 nodal periods\u00a0: 4,611.98 lunar orbits\u00a0: 344.996 years\u00a0: 344.982 solar orbits\u00a0: 126,007.003 days\u00a0: 126,351.985 rotations).[b] What was so exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly more than 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only approximately \u00b11\u20442 hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4,267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million./nHipparchus could confirm his computations by comparing eclipses from his own time (presumably 27 January 141\u00a0BC and 26 November 139\u00a0BC according to Toomer[24]) with eclipses from Babylonian records 345 years earlier (Almagest IV.2[12])./nLater al-Biruni (Qanun VII.2.II) and Copernicus (de revolutionibus IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is approximately five minutes longer than the value for the eclipse period that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus. However, the timing methods of the Babylonians had an error of no fewer than eight minutes.[25][26] Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the eclipse period to the nearest hour, and used it to confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than to try to derive an improved value from his own observations. From modern ephemerides[27] and taking account of the change in the length of the day (see \u0394T) we estimate that the error in the assumed length of the synodic month was less than 0.2 second in the fourth century\u00a0BC and less than 0.1 second in Hipparchus's time./nIt had been known for a long time that the motion of the Moon is not uniform: its speed varies. This is called its anomaly and it repeats with its own period; the anomalistic month. The Chaldeans took account of this arithmetically, and used a table giving the daily motion of the Moon according to the date within a long period. However, the Greeks preferred to think in geometrical models of the sky. At the end of the third century BC, Apollonius of Perga had proposed two models for lunar and planetary motion:/nApollonius demonstrated that these two models were in fact mathematically equivalent. However, all this was theory and had not been put to practice. Hipparchus is the first astronomer known to attempt to determine the relative proportions and actual sizes of these orbits. Hipparchus devised a geometrical method to find the parameters from three positions of the Moon at particular phases of its anomaly. In fact, he did this separately for the eccentric and the epicycle model. Ptolemy describes the details in the Almagest IV.11. Hipparchus used two sets of three lunar eclipse observations that he carefully selected to satisfy the requirements. The eccentric model he fitted to these eclipses from his Babylonian eclipse list: 22/23 December 383\u00a0BC, 18/19 June 382\u00a0BC, and 12/13 December 382\u00a0BC. The epicycle model he fitted to lunar eclipse observations made in Alexandria at 22 September 201\u00a0BC, 19 March 200\u00a0BC, and 11 September 200\u00a0BC./nThese figures are due to the cumbersome unit he used in his chord table and may partly be due to some sloppy rounding and calculation errors by Hipparchus, for which Ptolemy criticised him while also making rounding errors. A simpler alternate reconstruction[28] agrees with all four numbers. Hipparchus found inconsistent results; he later used the ratio of the epicycle model (3122+1\u20442\u00a0: 247+1\u20442), which is too small (60\u00a0: 4;45 sexagesimal). Ptolemy established a ratio of 60\u00a0: 5+1\u20444.[29] (The maximum angular deviation producible by this geometry is the arcsin of 5+1\u20444 divided by 60, or approximately 5\u00b0 1', a figure that is sometimes therefore quoted as the equivalent of the Moon's equation of the center in the Hipparchan model.)/nBefore Hipparchus, Meton, Euctemon, and their pupils at Athens had made a solstice observation (i.e., timed the moment of the summer solstice) on 27 June 432\u00a0BC (proleptic Julian calendar). Aristarchus of Samos is said to have done so in 280\u00a0BC, and Hipparchus also had an observation by Archimedes. He observed the summer solstices in 146 and 135\u00a0BC both accurately to a few hours, but observations of the moment of equinox were simpler, and he made twenty during his lifetime. Ptolemy gives an extensive discussion of Hipparchus's work on the length of the year in the Almagest III.1, and quotes many observations that Hipparchus made or used, spanning 162\u2013128\u00a0BC, including an equinox timing by Hipparchus (at 24 March 146\u00a0BC at dawn) that differs by 5 hours from the observation made on Alexandria's large public equatorial ring that same day (at 1 hour before noon). Ptolemy claims his solar observations were on a transit instrument set in the meridian./nAt the end of his career, Hipparchus wrote a book entitled Peri eniaus\u00edou meg\u00e9thous (\"On the Length of the Year\") regarding his results. The established value for the tropical year, introduced by Callippus in or before 330\u00a0BC was 365+1\u20444 days.[30] Speculating a Babylonian origin for the Callippic year is difficult to defend, since Babylon did not observe solstices thus the only extant System B year length was based on Greek solstices (see below). Hipparchus's equinox observations gave varying results, but he points out (quoted in Almagest III.1(H195)) that the observation errors by him and his predecessors may have been as large as 1\u20444 day. He used old solstice observations and determined a difference of approximately one day in approximately 300 years. So he set the length of the tropical year to 365+1\u20444 \u2212 1\u2044300 days (= 365.24666... days = 365\u00a0days 5\u00a0hours 55\u00a0min, which differs from the modern estimate of the value (including earth spin acceleration), in his time of approximately 365.2425 days, an error of approximately 6\u00a0min per year, an hour per decade, and ten hours per century./nBetween the solstice observation of Meton and his own, there were 297 years spanning 108,478 days; this implies a tropical year of 365.24579... days = 365\u00a0days;14,44,51 (sexagesimal; = 365\u00a0days + 14/60 + 44/602 + 51/603), a year length found on one of the few Babylonian clay tablets which explicitly specifies the System B month. Whether Babylonians knew of Hipparchus's work or the other way around is debatable./nAnother value for the year that is attributed to Hipparchus (by the astrologer Vettius Valens in the first century) is 365 + 1/4 + 1/288 days (= 365.25347... days = 365\u00a0days 6\u00a0hours 5\u00a0min), but this may be a corruption of another value attributed to a Babylonian source: 365 + 1/4 + 1/144 days (= 365.25694... days = 365\u00a0days 6\u00a0hours 10\u00a0min). It is not clear whether this would be a value for the sidereal year at his time or the modern estimate of approximately 365.2565 days, but the difference with Hipparchus's value for the tropical year is consistent with his rate of precession (see below)./nBefore Hipparchus, astronomers knew that the lengths of the seasons are not equal. Hipparchus made observations of equinox and solstice, and according to Ptolemy (Almagest III.4) determined that spring (from spring equinox to summer solstice) lasted 941\u20442 days, and summer (from summer solstice to autumn equinox) 92+1\u20442 days. This is inconsistent with a premise of the Sun moving around the Earth in a circle at uniform speed. Hipparchus's solution was to place the Earth not at the center of the Sun's motion, but at some distance from the center. This model described the apparent motion of the Sun fairly well. It is known today that the planets, including the Earth, move in approximate ellipses around the Sun, but this was not discovered until Johannes Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609. The value for the eccentricity attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy is that the offset is 1\u204424 of the radius of the orbit (which is a little too large), and the direction of the apogee would be at longitude 65.5\u00b0 from the vernal equinox. Hipparchus may also have used other sets of observations, which would lead to different values. One of his two eclipse trios' solar longitudes are consistent with his having initially adopted inaccurate lengths for spring and summer of 95+3\u20444 and 91+1\u20444 days.[31][failed verification] His other triplet of solar positions is consistent with 94+1\u20444 and 92+1\u20442 days,[12][32][failed verification] an improvement on the results (94+1\u20442 and 92+1\u20442 days) attributed to Hipparchus by Ptolemy. Ptolemy made no change three centuries later, and expressed lengths for the autumn and winter seasons which were already implicit (as shown, e.g., by A. Aaboe).[citation needed]/nHipparchus also undertook to find the distances and sizes of the Sun and the Moon, in the now-lost work On Sizes and Distances (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03b8\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd Peri megethon kai apostematon). His work is mentioned in Ptolemy's Almagest V.11, and in a commentary thereon by Pappus; Theon of Smyrna (2nd century) also mentions the work, under the title On Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon./nHipparchus measured the apparent diameters of the Sun and Moon with his diopter. Like others before and after him, he found that the Moon's size varies as it moves on its (eccentric) orbit, but he found no perceptible variation in the apparent diameter of the Sun. He found that at the mean distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are 360\u2044650 = 0\u00b033\u203214\u2033./nLike others before and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a noticeable parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles the center of the Earth, but the observer is at the surface\u2014the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now know that it is about 8.8\", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye)./nIn the first book, Hipparchus assumes that the parallax of the Sun is 0, as if it is at infinite distance. He then analyzed a solar eclipse, which Toomer presumes to be the eclipse of 14 March 190\u00a0BC.[33] It was total in the region of the Hellespont (and in his birthplace, Nicaea); at the time Toomer proposes the Romans were preparing for war with Antiochus III in the area, and the eclipse is mentioned by Livy in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri VIII.2. It was also observed in Alexandria, where the Sun was reported to be obscured 4/5ths by the Moon. Alexandria and Nicaea are on the same meridian. Alexandria is at about 31\u00b0 North, and the region of the Hellespont about 40\u00b0 North. (It has been contended that authors like Strabo and Ptolemy had fairly decent values for these geographical positions, so Hipparchus must have known them too. However, Strabo's Hipparchus dependent latitudes for this region are at least 1\u00b0 too high, and Ptolemy appears to copy them, placing Byzantium 2\u00b0 high in latitude.) Hipparchus could draw a triangle formed by the two places and the Moon, and from simple geometry was able to establish a distance of the Moon, expressed in Earth radii. Because the eclipse occurred in the morning, the Moon was not in the meridian, and it has been proposed that as a consequence the distance found by Hipparchus was a lower limit. In any case, according to Pappus, Hipparchus found that the least distance is 71 (from this eclipse), and the greatest 83 Earth radii./nIn the second book, Hipparchus starts from the opposite extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7\u2032, which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2\u2032; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1\u2032). In this case, the shadow of the Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+1\u20442 lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360\u2044650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1\u20443, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2\u20443 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii\u2014exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived./nHipparchus thus had the problematic result that his minimum distance (from book 1) was greater than his maximum mean distance (from book 2). He was intellectually honest about this discrepancy, and probably realized that especially the first method is very sensitive to the accuracy of the observations and parameters. (In fact, modern calculations show that the size of the 189\u00a0BC solar eclipse at Alexandria must have been closer to 9\u204410ths and not the reported 4\u20445ths, a fraction more closely matched by the degree of totality at Alexandria of eclipses occurring in 310 and 129\u00a0BC which were also nearly total in the Hellespont and are thought by many to be more likely possibilities for the eclipse Hipparchus used for his computations.)/nPtolemy later measured the lunar parallax directly (Almagest V.13), and used the second method of Hipparchus with lunar eclipses to compute the distance of the Sun (Almagest V.15). He criticizes Hipparchus for making contradictory assumptions, and obtaining conflicting results (Almagest V.11): but apparently he failed to understand Hipparchus's strategy to establish limits consistent with the observations, rather than a single value for the distance. His results were the best so far: the actual mean distance of the Moon is 60.3 Earth radii, within his limits from Hipparchus's second book./nTheon of Smyrna wrote that according to Hipparchus, the Sun is 1,880 times the size of the Earth, and the Earth twenty-seven times the size of the Moon; apparently this refers to volumes, not diameters. From the geometry of book 2 it follows that the Sun is at 2,550 Earth radii, and the mean distance of the Moon is 60+1\u20442 radii. Similarly, Cleomedes quotes Hipparchus for the sizes of the Sun and Earth as 1050:1; this leads to a mean lunar distance of 61 radii. Apparently Hipparchus later refined his computations, and derived accurate single values that he could use for predictions of solar eclipses./nSee Toomer (1974) for a more detailed discussion.[34]/nPliny (Naturalis Historia II.X) tells us that Hipparchus demonstrated that lunar eclipses can occur five months apart, and solar eclipses seven months (instead of the usual six months); and the Sun can be hidden twice in thirty days, but as seen by different nations. Ptolemy discussed this a century later at length in Almagest VI.6. The geometry, and the limits of the positions of Sun and Moon when a solar or lunar eclipse is possible, are explained in Almagest VI.5. Hipparchus apparently made similar calculations. The result that two solar eclipses can occur one month apart is important, because this can not be based on observations: one is visible on the northern and the other on the southern hemisphere\u2014as Pliny indicates\u2014and the latter was inaccessible to the Greek./nPrediction of a solar eclipse, i.e., exactly when and where it will be visible, requires a solid lunar theory and proper treatment of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus must have been the first to be able to do this. A rigorous treatment requires spherical trigonometry, thus those who remain certain that Hipparchus lacked it must speculate that he may have made do with planar approximations. He may have discussed these things in Per\u00ed t\u0113s kat\u00e1 pl\u00e1tos m\u0113nia\u00edas t\u0113s sel\u0113n\u0113s kin\u0113se\u014ds (\"On the monthly motion of the Moon in latitude\"), a work mentioned in the Suda./nPliny also remarks that \"he also discovered for what exact reason, although the shadow causing the eclipse must from sunrise onward be below the earth, it happened once in the past that the Moon was eclipsed in the west while both luminaries were visible above the earth\" (translation H. Rackham (1938), Loeb Classical Library 330 p.\u00a0207). Toomer argued that this must refer to the large total lunar eclipse of 26 November 139\u00a0BC, when over a clean sea horizon as seen from Rhodes, the Moon was eclipsed in the northwest just after the Sun rose in the southeast.[24] This would be the second eclipse of the 345-year interval that Hipparchus used to verify the traditional Babylonian periods: this puts a late date to the development of Hipparchus's lunar theory. We do not know what \"exact reason\" Hipparchus found for seeing the Moon eclipsed while apparently it was not in exact opposition to the Sun. Parallax lowers the altitude of the luminaries; refraction raises them, and from a high point of view the horizon is lowered./nHipparchus and his predecessors used various instruments for astronomical calculations and observations, such as the gnomon, the astrolabe, and the armillary sphere./nHipparchus is credited with the invention or improvement of several astronomical instruments, which were used for a long time for naked-eye observations. According to Synesius of Ptolemais (4th century) he made the first astrolabion: this may have been an armillary sphere (which Ptolemy however says he constructed, in Almagest V.1); or the predecessor of the planar instrument called astrolabe (also mentioned by Theon of Alexandria). With an astrolabe Hipparchus was the first to be able to measure the geographical latitude and time by observing fixed stars. Previously this was done at daytime by measuring the shadow cast by a gnomon, by recording the length of the longest day of the year or with the portable instrument known as a scaphe./nPtolemy mentions (Almagest V.14) that he used a similar instrument as Hipparchus, called dioptra, to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun and Moon. Pappus of Alexandria described it (in his commentary on the Almagest of that chapter), as did Proclus (Hypotyposis IV). It was a four-foot rod with a scale, a sighting hole at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon./nHipparchus also observed solar equinoxes, which may be done with an equatorial ring: its shadow falls on itself when the Sun is on the equator (i.e., in one of the equinoctial points on the ecliptic), but the shadow falls above or below the opposite side of the ring when the Sun is south or north of the equator. Ptolemy quotes (in Almagest III.1 (H195)) a description by Hipparchus of an equatorial ring in Alexandria; a little further he describes two such instruments present in Alexandria in his own time./nHipparchus applied his knowledge of spherical angles to the problem of denoting locations on the Earth's surface. Before him a grid system had been used by Dicaearchus of Messana, but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the latitude and longitude of places on the Earth. Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (3rd century\u00a0BC), called Pr\u00f2s t\u00e8n Eratosth\u00e9nous geograph\u00edan (\"Against the Geography of Eratosthenes\"). It is known to us from Strabo of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own Geographia. Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes. It seems he did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the geographical longitudes of different cities at lunar eclipses (Strabo Geographia 1 January 2012). A lunar eclipse is visible simultaneously on half of the Earth, and the difference in longitude between places can be computed from the difference in local time when the eclipse is observed. His approach would give accurate results if it were correctly carried out but the limitations of timekeeping accuracy in his era made this method impractical./nLate in his career (possibly about 135\u00a0BC) Hipparchus compiled his star catalog. Scholars have been searching for it for centuries.[35] In 2022, it was announced that a part of it was discovered in a medieval parchment manuscript, Codex Climaci Rescriptus, from Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt as hidden text (palimpsest).[36][37]/nHipparchus also constructed a celestial globe depicting the constellations, based on his observations. His interest in the fixed stars may have been inspired by the observation of a supernova (according to Pliny), or by his discovery of precession, according to Ptolemy, who says that Hipparchus could not reconcile his data with earlier observations made by Timocharis and Aristillus. For more information see Discovery of precession. In Raphael's painting The School of Athens, Hipparchus may be depicted holding his celestial globe, as the representative figure for astronomy. It is not certain that the figure is meant to represent him.[35]/nPreviously, Eudoxus of Cnidus in the fourth century\u00a0BC had described the stars and constellations in two books called Phaenomena and Entropon. Aratus wrote a poem called Phaenomena or Arateia based on Eudoxus's work. Hipparchus wrote a commentary on the Arateia\u2014his only preserved work\u2014which contains many stellar positions and times for rising, culmination, and setting of the constellations, and these are likely to have been based on his own measurements./nAccording to Roman sources, Hipparchus made his measurements with a scientific instrument and he obtained the positions of roughly 850 stars. Pliny the Elder writes in book II, 24\u201326 of his Natural History:[39]/nThis same Hipparchus, who can never be sufficiently commended, ... discovered a new star that was produced in his own age, and, by observing its motions on the day in which it shone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen, that those stars have motion which we suppose to be fixed. And the same individual attempted, what might seem presumptuous even in a deity, viz. to number the stars for posterity and to express their relations by appropriate names; having previously devised instruments, by which he might mark the places and the magnitudes of each individual star. In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whether they were destroyed or produced, but whether they changed their relative positions, and likewise, whether they were increased or diminished; the heavens being thus left as an inheritance to any one, who might be found competent to complete his plan./nThis passage reports that/nIt is unknown what instrument he used. The armillary sphere was probably invented only later\u2014maybe by Ptolemy 265 years after Hipparchus. The historian of science S. Hoffmann found clues that Hipparchus may have observed the longitudes and latitudes in different coordinate systems and, thus, with different instrumentation.[16] Right ascensions, for instance, could have been observed with a clock, while angular separations could have been measured with another device./nHipparchus is conjectured to have ranked the apparent magnitudes of stars on a numerical scale from 1, the brightest, to 6, the faintest.[40] This hypothesis is based on the vague statement by Pliny the Elder but cannot be proven by the data in Hipparchus's commentary on Aratus's poem. In this only work by his hand that has survived until today, he does not use the magnitude scale but estimates brightnesses unsystematically. However, this does not prove or disprove anything because the commentary might be an early work while the magnitude scale could have been introduced later.[16]/nNevertheless, this system certainly precedes Ptolemy, who used it extensively about AD 150.[40] This system was made more precise and extended by N. R. Pogson in 1856, who placed the magnitudes on a logarithmic scale, making magnitude 1 stars 100 times brighter than magnitude 6 stars, thus each magnitude is 5\u221a100 or 2.512 times brighter than the next faintest magnitude.[41]/nIt is disputed which coordinate system(s) he used. Ptolemy's catalog in the Almagest, which is derived from Hipparchus's catalog, is given in ecliptic coordinates. Although Hipparchus strictly distinguishes between \"signs\" (30\u00b0 section of the zodiac) and \"constellations\" in the zodiac, it is highly questionable whether or not he had an instrument to directly observe / measure units on the ecliptic.[16][39] He probably marked them as a unit on his celestial globe but the instrumentation for his observations is unknown.[16]/nDelambre in his Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne (1817) concluded that Hipparchus knew and used the equatorial coordinate system, a conclusion challenged by Otto Neugebauer in his History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy (1975). Hipparchus seems to have used a mix of ecliptic coordinates and equatorial coordinates: in his commentary on Eudoxus he provides stars' polar distance (equivalent to the declination in the equatorial system), right ascension (equatorial), longitude (ecliptic), polar longitude (hybrid), but not celestial latitude. This opinion was confirmed by the careful investigation of Hoffmann[39] who independently studied the material, potential sources, techniques and results of Hipparchus and reconstructed his celestial globe and its making./nAs with most of his work, Hipparchus's star catalog was adopted and perhaps expanded by Ptolemy, who has (since Brahe in 1598) been accused by some[42] of fraud for stating (Syntaxis, book 7, chapter 4) that he observed all 1025 stars\u2014critics claim that, for almost every star, he used Hipparchus's data and precessed it to his own epoch 2+2\u20443 centuries later by adding 2\u00b040' to the longitude, using an erroneously small precession constant of 1\u00b0 per century. This claim is highly exaggerated because it applies modern standards of citation to an ancient author. True is only that \"the ancient star catalogue\" that was initiated by Hipparchus in the second century BC, was reworked and improved multiple times in the 265 years to the Almagest (which is good scientific practise even today).[43] Although the Almagest star catalogue is based upon Hipparchus's, it is not only a blind copy but enriched, enhanced, and thus (at least partially) re-observed.[16]/nHipparchus's celestial globe was an instrument similar to modern electronic computers.[39] He used it to determine risings, settings and culminations (cf. also Almagest, book VIII, chapter 3). Therefore, his globe was mounted in a horizontal plane and had a meridian ring with a scale. In combination with a grid that divided the celestial equator into 24 hour lines (longitudes equalling our right ascension hours) the instrument allowed him to determine the hours. The ecliptic was marked and divided in 12 sections of equal length (the \"signs\", which he called zodion or dodekatemoria in order to distinguish them from constellations (astron). The globe was virtually reconstructed by a historian of science./nFor:/nAgainst:/nConclusion: Hipparchus's star catalogue is one of the sources of the Almagest star catalogue but not the only source.[43]/nHipparchus is generally recognized as discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes in 127\u00a0BC.[44] His two books on precession, On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points and On the Length of the Year, are both mentioned in the Almagest of Claudius Ptolemy. According to Ptolemy, Hipparchus measured the longitude of Spica and Regulus and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, Timocharis and Aristillus, he concluded that Spica had moved 2\u00b0 relative to the autumnal equinox. He also compared the lengths of the tropical year (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the sidereal year (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving (\"precessing\") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1\u00b0 in a century./nHipparchus's treatise Against the Geography of Eratosthenes in three books is not preserved.[45] \nMost of our knowledge of it comes from Strabo, according to whom Hipparchus thoroughly and often unfairly criticized Eratosthenes, mainly for internal contradictions and inaccuracy in determining positions of geographical localities. Hipparchus insists that a geographic map must be based only on astronomical measurements of latitudes and longitudes and triangulation for finding unknown distances. \nIn geographic theory and methods Hipparchus introduced three main innovations.[46]/nHe was the first to use the grade grid, to determine geographic latitude from star observations, and not only from the Sun's altitude, a method known long before him, and to suggest that geographic longitude could be determined by means of simultaneous observations of lunar eclipses in distant places. In the practical part of his work, the so-called \"table of climata\", Hipparchus listed latitudes for several tens of localities. In particular, he improved Eratosthenes' values for the latitudes of Athens, Sicily, and southern extremity of India.[47][48][49] In calculating latitudes of climata (latitudes correlated with the length of the longest solstitial day), Hipparchus used an unexpectedly accurate value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, 23\u00b040' (the actual value in the second half of the second century\u00a0BC was approximately 23\u00b043'), whereas all other ancient authors knew only a roughly rounded value 24\u00b0, and even Ptolemy used a less accurate value, 23\u00b051'.[50]/nHipparchus opposed the view generally accepted in the Hellenistic period that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and the Caspian Sea are parts of a single ocean. At the same time he extends the limits of the oikoumene, i.e. the inhabited part of the land, up to the equator and the Arctic Circle.[51] Hipparchus's ideas found their reflection in the Geography of Ptolemy. In essence, Ptolemy's work is an extended attempt to realize Hipparchus's vision of what geography ought to be./nHipparchus was in the international news in 2005, when it was again proposed (as in 1898) that the data on the celestial globe of Hipparchus or in his star catalog may have been preserved in the only surviving large ancient celestial globe which depicts the constellations with moderate accuracy, the globe carried by the Farnese Atlas.[52][53] Evidence suggests that the Farnese globe may show constellations in the Aratean tradition and deviate from the constellations used by Hipparchus.[39]/nA line in Plutarch's Table Talk states that Hipparchus counted 103,049 compound propositions that can be formed from ten simple propositions. 103,049 is the tenth Schr\u00f6der\u2013Hipparchus number, which counts the number of ways of adding one or more pairs of parentheses around consecutive subsequences of two or more items in any sequence of ten symbols. This has led to speculation that Hipparchus knew about enumerative combinatorics, a field of mathematics that developed independently in modern mathematics.[54][55]/nHipparchos was suggested in a 2013 paper to have accidentally observed the planet Uranus in 128 BC and catalogued it as a star, over a millennium and a half before its formal discovery in 1781.[56]/nHipparchus may be depicted opposite Ptolemy in Raphael's 1509\u20131511 painting The School of Athens, although this figure is usually identified as Zoroaster.[35]/nThe formal name for the ESA's Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission is High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite, making a backronym, HiPParCoS, that echoes and commemorates the name of Hipparchus./nThe lunar crater Hipparchus, the Martian crater Hipparchus, and the asteroid 4000 Hipparchus are named after him./nHe was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 2004.[57]/nJean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, historian of astronomy, mathematical astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, in his history of astronomy in the 18th century (1821), considered Hipparchus along with Johannes Kepler and James Bradley the greatest astronomers of all time.[58]/nThe Astronomers Monument at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California, United States features a relief of Hipparchus as one of six of the greatest astronomers of all time and the only one from Antiquity.[59]/nJohannes Kepler had great respect for Tycho Brahe's methods and the accuracy of his observations, and considered him to be the new Hipparchus, who would provide the foundation for a restoration of the science of astronomy.[60]/nYaggy, Levy W.; Haines, Thomas L.

He was appointed to a position in the school in Gem\u00fcnden on 22 February 1499 and ordained as a Catholic priest in the Bishopric of Bamberg on 13 June 1500. On 2 February 1500 he moved to Bamberg and was appointed chaplain in Hallstatt near Bamberg on 18 April 1500. His next appointment was as vicar in his hometown Karlstadt from 4 June 1504. Between 4 May and 29 October 1506 he was again in Bamberg before he returned to Karlstadt. His diary also informs us that he entered a relationship with Kunigunde Holocher in 1499, with whom he had three children: a son Johannes born on 1 February 1502, a daughter Sibilla born on 12 June 1503 and a second son Vitus born on 21 November 1504./nSch\u00f6ner was the owner of the only specimen of the 1507 Waldseem\u00fcller map of the world that has survived and which was rediscovered at Schloss Wolfegg in Upper Swabia in 1901. Since 2003 it is in possession of the Library of Congress.[2]/nNo diary exists after 1506, and up to 1515 there are only indirect traces of Sch\u00f6ner's existence in the financial records of the bishopric and in the correspondence of Lorenz Beheim (?1457 - 1521), who after 24 years in Rome as chamberlain to Pope Alexander IV had returned to Bamberg in 1505 as a canon of the cathedral./nIn 1526, he was called to N\u00fcrnberg, by Philip Melanchthon, as the first professor of mathematics at the newly founded gymnasium Aegidianum, a post he held till one year prior to his death. At the same time, he converted to Protestantism and married./nAlready in Bamberg, he owned his own printing company and published many maps and globes. He produced the first ever printed celestial globe in his workshop in 1517, as a matching pair to his printed terrestrial globe from 1515. He made another globe in 1520./nSch\u00f6ner had also made still unpublished data of Mercury observations from Walther available to Copernicus, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in \"De revolutionibus\", giving only longitudes, and falsely attributing them to Sch\u00f6ner. The values differed slightly from the ones published by Sch\u00f6ner in 1544./nIn 1538, Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young professor of mathematics at Wittenberg and former assistant of Copernicus, stayed for some time with Sch\u00f6ner who convinced him to visit Nicolaus Copernicus in Frauenburg. In 1540, Rheticus dedicated the first published report of Copernicus work, the Narratio prima, to Sch\u00f6ner, to test the waters of the reaction by the Catholic Church. As this was well received, Copernicus finally agreed to publish his main work, and Rheticus prepared Copernicus' manuscript for printing./nIn N\u00fcrnberg, Sch\u00f6ner published in 1544 the astronomical observations of Regiomontanus and Walther, as well as manuscripts of Regiomontanus, which had been in the hand of Walther, as Observationes XXX annorum a I.

He gained a government scholarship to attend the University of Auckland, where he completed a double degree in mathematics and physics.[1] Whilst at the University of Auckland he was an active member of the mountaineering club and climbed with Edmund Hillary.[1] In 1949, Morton was awarded the Rutherford fellowship to study for a BA mathematical tripos at St John's College, Cambridge./nIn 1956 he completed his PhD in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMPT) at Cambridge University under the supervision of Sir G.I. Taylor and Sir George Batchelor. His thesis work was published in paper that became a classic of the fluid dynamics literature - the much cited Morton, Taylor and Turner result.[2] The study developed an explanation for a source of buoyancy being injected into a stratified fluid. By conserving volume, momentum and buoyancy, the study predicted the final height to which a plume of light fluid will rise in a stably stratified fluid. These predictions where then compared with laboratory experiments created using a stratified salt solution.[2]/nFellow student and co-author on the plume paper Stewart Turner recalled that Batchelor suggested that he conduct some laboratory experiments to test Morton's theory of the rise of plumes and \u201cbuoyant clouds\u201d in stratified surroundings. The starting point was an entrainment hypothesis proposed by Taylor which assumes that the rising turbulent motion in the plume causes an inflow of environmental fluid at a rate that is proportional to the average upward velocity.[3] When Morton and Turner wrote the manuscript documenting the agreement between theory and experiment they discovered that Taylor was also preparing a \u201cmuch delayed note\u201d on the subject. Taylor included an explanation at the end of the Morton paper explaining the circumstances. He did add some distinctive touches to the article including estimates of the height of rise of smoke from an autumn bonfire (150 ft) and a burning town (3200 m) with specified burning rates and atmospheric conditions; and as noted by Turner - the mixed units are Taylor's.[4]/nAfter his Ph.D. Morton briefly took up an academic appointment at University College London.

Vit\u00e9z's mother was originated from the Gar\u00e1zda genus (originally from Bosnia, genus is named after Gora\u017ede). On his father's side he derived from Pilis county (his father's surname was originally Cs\u00e9vi).[2] His father was the secretary of the regent John Hunyadi, from 1446 to 1452. Vit\u00e9z became a prothonotary in his government./nVit\u00e9z studied in Vienna, where he graduated in law and became knowledgeable in physics, astronomy and alchemy due to frequent contacts with other humanists. In the chancery of King Sigismund, he probably met the excellent Italian humanist Pier Paolo Vergerio. For a while (around 1437) he was the canon in Zagreb. In that period, he helped strengthen the relations between the Croatian capital and the thriving Italian cultural and scientific centers. Then he left for Hungary, where he was to play a major role in the development of cultural and scientific institutions./nVit\u00e9z was one of the educators of Hunyadi's son Matthias Corvinus, who became King of Hungary.[3] Vit\u00e9z became the bishop of Oradea in 1445 and turned it into a humanist centre, where he invited a number of Polish and German humanists, such as Gregory of Sanok.[citation needed] He was a book collector[3] and built a library there. Both his court and the library moved from Oradea to Esztergom in 1465, when he became the primate of Hungary, or the archbishop of Esztergom \u2013 one of the two bishoprics in Hungary./nIn the government of Matthias Corvinus, he fulfilled many positions. First of all, due to his earlier practice, he was an excellent diplomat to the king. In 1458 he was sent to Prague to George of Pod\u011bbrady to redeem the king and then he (according to Bonfini) welcomed the king when he entered the kingdom. He served the king in a few diplomatic missions, especially to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. After 1464 he became active in the highest and secret chancellor (together with Stephen V\u00e1rdai), but did not take many actions in the position. During the late 1460s he became estranged to the king and in 1471 he led a plot against the ruler./nVit\u00e9z, who spoke and wrote in excellent Latin, had a major role in the international circle of humanists at Corvin's court, some of whom were prominent scientists, such as Regiomontanus, Bylica, Peuerbach, Hans Dorn. He was especially interested in natural sciences and promoted their study. He founded the academy and library in Oradea (moved to Esztergom) and the Universitas Istropolitana in Pozsony (currently Bratislava). He promoted astrologic and astronomic research, had astronomic instruments of his own, and founded the observatory in Esztergom.

His name is occasionally written as Carolus Gustavus Iacobus Iacobi in his Latin books, and his first name is sometimes given as Karl./nJacobi was born of Ashkenazi Jewish parentage in Potsdam on 10 December 1804. He was the second of four children of banker Simon Jacobi. His elder brother Moritz von Jacobi would also become known later as an engineer and physicist. He was initially home schooled by his uncle Lehman, who instructed him in the classical languages and elements of mathematics. In 1816, the twelve-year-old Jacobi went to the Potsdam Gymnasium, where students were taught all the standard subjects: classical languages, history, philology, mathematics, sciences, etc. As a result of the good education he had received from his uncle, as well as his own remarkable abilities, after less than half a year Jacobi was moved to the senior year despite his young age. However, as the University would not accept students younger than 16 years old, he had to remain in the senior class until 1821. He used this time to advance his knowledge, showing interest in all subjects, including Latin, Greek, philology, history and mathematics. During this period he also made his first attempts at research, trying to solve the quintic equation by radicals.[3][4]/nIn 1821 Jacobi went to study at Berlin University, where he initially divided his attention between his passions for philology and mathematics. In philology he participated in the seminars of B\u00f6ckh, drawing the professor's attention with his talent. Jacobi did not follow a lot of mathematics classes at the time, finding the level of mathematics taught at Berlin University too elementary. He continued, instead, with his private study of the more advanced works of Euler, Lagrange and Laplace. By 1823 he understood that he needed to make a decision between his competing interests and chose to devote all his attention to mathematics.[5] In the same year he became qualified to teach secondary school and was offered a position at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin. Jacobi decided instead to continue to work towards a university position. In 1825 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with a dissertation on the partial fraction decomposition of rational fractions defended before a commission led by Enno Dirksen. He followed immediately with his Habilitation and at the same time converted to Christianity. Now qualifying for teaching university classes, the 21-year-old Jacobi lectured in 1825/26 on the theory of curves and surfaces at the University of Berlin.[5][6]/nIn 1827 Jacobi became a professor and in 1829, a tenured professor of mathematics at K\u00f6nigsberg University, and held the chair until 1842.\nHe suffered a breakdown from overwork in 1843. He then visited Italy for a few months to regain his health. On his return he moved to Berlin, where he lived as a royal pensioner, apart from a very brief interim, until his death.[7] During the Revolution of 1848 Jacobi was politically involved and unsuccessfully presented his parliamentary candidature on behalf of a Liberal club. This led, after the suppression of the revolution, to his royal grant being cut off \u2013 but his fame and reputation were such that it was soon resumed, thanks to the personal intervention of Alexander von Humboldt./nJacobi died in 1851 from a smallpox infection. His grave is preserved at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the Friedhof I der Dreifaltigkeits-Kirchengemeinde (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of Johann Encke, the astronomer. The crater Jacobi on the Moon is named after him./nOne of Jacobi's greatest accomplishments was his theory of elliptic functions and their relation to the elliptic theta function. This was developed in his great treatise Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum (1829), and in later papers in Crelle's Journal. Theta functions are of great importance in mathematical physics because of their role in the inverse problem for periodic and quasi-periodic flows. The equations of motion are integrable in terms of Jacobi's elliptic functions in the well-known cases of the pendulum, the Euler top, the symmetric Lagrange top in a gravitational field, and the Kepler problem (planetary motion in a central gravitational field)./nHe also made fundamental contributions in the study of differential equations and to classical mechanics, notably the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi theory./nIt was in algebraic development that Jacobi's particular power mainly lay, and he made important contributions of this kind in many areas of mathematics, as shown by his long list of papers in Crelle's Journal and elsewhere from 1826 onwards.[7] He is said to have told his students that when looking for a research topic, one should 'Invert, always invert' (German original: \"man muss immer umkehren\"), reflecting his belief that inverting known results can open up new fields for research, for example inverting elliptic integrals and focusing on the nature of elliptic and theta functions.[8]/nIn his 1835 paper, Jacobi proved the following basic result classifying periodic (including elliptic) functions:/nIf a univariate single-valued function is multiply periodic, then such a function cannot have more than two periods, and the ratio of the periods cannot be a real number./nHe discovered many of the fundamental properties of theta functions, including the functional equation and the Jacobi triple product formula, as well as many other results on q-series and hypergeometric series./nThe solution of the Jacobi inversion problem for the hyperelliptic Abel map by Weierstrass in 1854 required the introduction of the hyperelliptic theta function and later the general Riemann theta function for algebraic curves of arbitrary genus. The complex torus associated to a genus \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n algebraic curve, obtained by quotienting \n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\ng\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathbf {C} }^{g}}\n\n by the lattice of periods is referred to as the Jacobian variety. This method of inversion, and its subsequent extension by Weierstrass and Riemann to arbitrary algebraic curves, may be seen as a higher genus generalization of the relation between elliptic integrals and the Jacobi or Weierstrass elliptic functions./nJacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to number theory, for example proving Fermat's two-square theorem and Lagrange's four-square theorem, and similar results for 6 and 8 squares./nHis other work in number theory continued the work of Gauss: new proofs of quadratic reciprocity, and the introduction of the Jacobi symbol; contributions to higher reciprocity laws, investigations of continued fractions, and the invention of Jacobi sums./nHe was also one of the early founders of the theory of determinants.[9] In particular, he invented the Jacobian determinant formed from the n2 partial derivatives of n given functions of n independent variables, which plays an important part in changes of variables in multiple integrals, and in many analytical investigations.[7] In 1841 he reintroduced the partial derivative \u2202 notation of Legendre, which was to become standard./nHe was one of the first to introduce and study the symmetric polynomials that are now known as Schur polynomials, giving the so-called bialternant formula for these, which is a special case of the Weyl character formula, and deriving the Jacobi\u2013Trudi identities. He also discovered the Desnanot\u2013Jacobi formula for determinants, which underlie the Plucker relations for Grassmannians./nStudents of vector fields, Lie theory, Hamiltonian mechanics and operator algebras often encounter the Jacobi identity, the analog of associativity for the Lie bracket operation./nPlanetary theory and other particular dynamical problems likewise occupied his attention from time to time. While contributing to celestial mechanics, he introduced the Jacobi integral (1836) for a sidereal coordinate system. His theory of the last multiplier is treated in Vorlesungen \u00fcber Dynamik, edited by Alfred Clebsch (1866).[7]/nHe left many manuscripts, portions of which have been published at intervals in Crelle's Journal. His other works include Commentatio de transformatione integralis duplicis indefiniti in formam simpliciorem (1832), Canon arithmeticus (1839), and Opuscula mathematica (1846\u20131857).

In the early 1960s, he either controlled or influenced virtually all non-military uncrewed space missions for the free world./nNewell was born March 11, 1915, in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He was educated in the public schools, graduating at the top of his class from Holyoke High in 1932.[1] In a 1980 interview, he recalled that his interest in science arose from his grandfather Arthur J. Newell, an engineer for a local electrical equipment manufacturer,[2] who had an extensive private library where Newell found books on astronomy and chemistry. Arthur also provided the money for his grandson's university education at Harvard University, where he graduated with a 1936 Bachelor of Arts in Math, and a 1937 Master of Arts in Teaching. He applied for a scholarship to pursue a Doctorate in Math, but Harvard did not award it. Instead, he completed his education at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, which awarded him a Math Ph.D. in 1940[3] with Rudolf Langer as thesis advisor.[4]/nFrom 1940 to 1944, Newell was an instructor, and then assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland. During World War II he also worked as a Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) ground instructor in air navigation, taught engineering classes for military cadets, and briefly taught astronomy.[5] The additional work for the CAA and military ended in 1944, and Newell, who was unhappy as a professor, applied for positions at several organizations doing military research.[6] He was offered a contract position at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)'s communications security section in 1944, and later that year became an NRL employee.[7] In 1945, the communications security section became the rocket sonde section. Newell became successively head of the theoretical analysis subsection, associate head of the section, and by 1947 headed the section; which performed upper atmosphere research using rockets including German-built V2s, US-built Aerobees and eventually NRL's own Viking; mostly launched from the White Sands Missile Range.[8]/nIn 1954, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned NRL responsibility to launch satellites during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), Newell was promoted to Acting Superintendent of NRL's Atmosphere and Astrophysics division, with an additional assignment as science coordinator for Project Vanguard. In this position, Newell worked with the National Academy of Sciences to identify which experiments would be flown on Vanguard satellites.[9] In the wake of the first two Soviet satellites, and the explosion of the first Vanguard on the launch pad, one of the experiment packages selected by Newell was switched to the U.S. Army's Explorer I satellite, which subsequently discovered the Van Allen radiation belts.[10]/nNewell played a significant behind the scenes role in the negotiations which led to the creation of NASA, chairing a committee of rocket and satellite experimenters that drafted a consensus plan for a national space establishment which was presented to Eisenhower's science advisor, and advising the Senate preparedness investigating subcommittee. In both roles, Newell\u2014though at this time a senior DOD administrator\u2014both publicly and privately advocated transfer of space activities to a separate civilian agency.[11] When the legislation establishing NASA was passed in 1958, Newell was given credit by his peers, including Van Allen, who called him \"The Spark Plug\" for a strong space science element in NASA.[12] Newell joined NASA in 1958, and was successively assistant director for space sciences (1958-1960), deputy director of space flight programs (1960-1961), director of space sciences (1961-1963), associate administrator for space science and applications (1963-1967) and finally associate administrator of NASA (1967-1974).[7] In 1965, Newell was awarded the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service[13]/nWhile at NASA, Newell drafted the first national plan for unmanned exploration of the Moon and planets, developed NASA's procedure for scientific experiment selection, and was responsible for NASA's university programs.[14] His influence peaked in the 1963-1967 period, when his Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA) operated effectively as a nearly independent space program, not only selecting experiments and contracting for satellites and space probes but also contracting for launch vehicles and acting as the \"executive agent\" for space launch for other U.S. and allied agencies.[15] The first civil weather, communications, and Earth resources satellites date from this period./nIn 1967, Newell was promoted to the position of associate administrator of NASA, the third-ranking position in the agency, which he held until his retirement in 1974. He held this post under four successive NASA administrators. Among other activities in this position, he traveled to the Rice Hotel in Houston to meet with disgruntled scientist-astronauts in 1971.[16] Among the results of that meeting was the assignment of Dr. Harrison Schmitt as the last human being (and only scientist) to set foot on the surface of the Moon./nNewell retired from NASA in 1974. He wrote at least eight books, one of which, Vector Analysis, (McGraw Hill, NY,1955) remains in print today.

He used sentences such as \"\u00e9coulement tourbillonnant et tumultueux\". The first mention of the word \"turbulence\" in French or English scientific fluid mechanics literature (the word \"turbulence\" existed in other context) can be found in a paper by Lord Kelvin in 1887.[2]", "177640": "Carsten Niebuhr, or Karsten Niebuhr (17 March 1733 L\u00fcdingworth \u2013 26 April 1815 Meldorf, Dithmarschen), was a German mathematician, cartographer, and explorer in the service of Denmark. He is renowned for his participation in the Danish Arabia expedition (1761-1767). He was the father of the Danish-German statesman and historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, who published an account of his father's life in 1817./nNiebuhr was born in L\u00fcdingworth (now a part of Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony) in what was then Bremen-Verden. His father Barthold Niebuhr (1704-1749) was a successful farmer and owned his own property. Carsten and his sister were educated at home by a local school teacher, then he attended the Latin School in Otterndorf, near Cuxhaven./nOriginally Niebuhr had intended to become a surveyor, but in 1757 he went to the Georgia Augusta University of G\u00f6ttingen, at this time Germany's most progressive institution of higher education. Niebuhr was probably a bright student because in 1760 Johann David Michaelis (1717-1791) recommended him as a participant in the Danish Arabia expedition (1761-1767), mounted by Frederick V of Denmark (1722\u20131766). For a year and a half before the expedition Niebuhr studied mathematics, cartography and navigational astronomy under Tobias Mayer (1723\u20131762), one of the premier astronomers of the 18th century, and the author of the Lunar Distance Method for determining longitude. Niebuhr's observations during the Arabia Expedition proved the accuracy and the practicality of this method for use by mariners at sea./nThe expedition sailed in January 1761 via Marseilles and Malta to Istanbul and Alexandria. Then the members of the expedition visited Cairo and Sinai, before traversing the Red Sea via Jiddah to Yemen, which was their main destination./nIn Mocha, on 25 May 1763, the expedition's philologist, Frederik Christian von Haven, died, and on 11 July 1763, on the way to Sana\u02bda, the capital of Yemen, its naturalist Peter Forssk\u00e5l also died./nIn Sana\u02bda the remaining members of the expedition had an audience with the Imam of Yemen al-Mahdi Abbas (1719\u20131775), but suffered from the climate and returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have preserved his own life and restored his health by adopting native dress and eating native food.[1]/nFrom Mocha the expedition continued to Bombay, the expedition's artist Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind died on the 29th of August and the expedition's servant Lars Berggren on the following day; both were buried at sea. The surgeon Christian C. Kramer (1732\u20131763) also died, soon after landing in Bombay. Niebuhr was the only surviving member. He stayed in Bombay for fourteen months and then returned home by way of Muscat, Bushire, Shiraz, and Persepolis.[1] His copies of the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis proved to be a key turning-point in the decipherment of cuneiform, and the birth of Assyriology.[2][3]/nHis transcriptions were especially useful to Georg Friedrich Grotefend, who made the first correct decipherments of Old Persian cuneiform:[4]/nHe also visited the ruins of Babylon (making many important sketches), Baghdad, Mosul, and Aleppo. He seems also to have visited the Behistun Inscription in around 1764. After a visit to Cyprus, he made a tour through Palestine, crossed the Taurus Mountains to Bursa, reached Constantinople in February 1767 and finally arrived in Copenhagen in the following November.[1]/nNiebuhr's production during the expedition is indeed impressive. It includes small-scale maps and charts of Yemen, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and Oman, and other larger scale maps covering the Nile Delta, the Gulf of Suez and the regions surrounding various port cities he visited, including Mocha and Surat. He completed 28 town plans of significant historical value because of their uniqueness for that period./nIn summary, Niebuhr's maps, charts and plans constitute the greatest single addition to the cartography of the region that was produced through field research and published in the 18th century.[7]/nIn 1773, Niebuhr married Christiane Sophia Blumenberg, the daughter of the crown physician, and for some years he held a post in the Danish military service, which enabled him to remain in Copenhagen. In 1776 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1778 he accepted a position in the civil service of Danish Holstein, and went to reside at Meldorf (Ditmarschen).[1] In 1806 he was promoted to Etatsrat, and in 1809 was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, one of Denmark\u2013Norway's most valued honours for service./nNiebuhr's first book, Beschreibung von Arabien, was published in Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish government providing subsidies for the engraving and printing of its numerous illustrations. This was followed in 1774 and 1778 by the first two volumes of Niebuhr's Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegender L\u00e4ndern. These works (particularly the one published in 1778), and most specifically the accurate copies of the cuneiform inscriptions found at Persepolis, were to prove to be extremely important to the decipherment of cuneiform writing. Before Niebuhr's publication, cuneiform inscriptions were often thought to be merely decorations and embellishments, and no accurate decipherments or translations had been made up to that point. Niebuhr demonstrated that the three trilingual inscriptions found at Persepolis were in fact three distinct forms of cuneiform writing (which he termed Class I, Class II, and Class III) to be read from left to right. His accurate copies of the trilingual inscriptions gave Orientalists the key to finally crack the cuneiform code, leading to the discovery of Old Persian, Akkadian, and Sumerian.[8]/nThe third volume of the Reisebeschreibung, also based on materials from the expedition, was not published till 1837, long after Niebuhr's death, under the editorship of his daughter and his assistant, Johan Nicolaus Gloyer. Niebuhr also contributed papers on the interior of Africa, the political and military condition of the Ottoman Empire, and other subjects to a German periodical, the Deutsches Museum. In addition, he edited and published the work of his friend Peter Forssk\u00e5l, the naturalist on the Arabian expedition, under the titles Descriptiones animalium, Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica and Icones rerum naturalium (Copenhagen, 1775 and 1776).[1]/nFrench and Dutch translations of Niebuhr's narratives were published during his lifetime, and a condensed English translation of his own three volumes, prepared by Robert Heron, was published in Edinburgh in 1792, under the title \"Travels through Arabia\". A facsimile edition of this translation, as by \"M. Niebuhr\", was published in two volumes by the Libraire du Liban, Beirut (undated)./nThe government funds covered only a fraction of the printing costs for Niebuhr's first book, and probably a similar or smaller proportion of the costs for the other two volumes. To ensure that the volumes were published, Niebuhr had to pay over 80% of the costs himself. In all, Niebuhr devoted ten years of his life, the years 1768\u20131778, to the publication of six volumes of findings from the expedition. He had virtually no help from the academics who had conceived and shaped the expedition in G\u00f6ttingen and Copenhagen. It was only Niebuhr's determination to publish the findings of the expedition that ensured that the Danish Arabia expedition would produce results that would benefit the world of scholarship.[7]/nNiebuhr died in Meldorf in 1815./nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) highly prized Niebuhr's works. In 1811 he wrote to Niebuhr's son, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, that \"You carry a name which I have learned to honour since my youth.\"/nCarsten Niebuhrs Gade, a street in the port area of Copenhagen, is named for him./nIn 2011, Copenhagen's National Library and National Museum held exhibitions of Carsten Niebuhr's life and work, celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Danish Arabia Expedition's commencement. Commemorative Carsten Niebuhr postal stamps were issued. And in the same year the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had planned a series of cultural events based on the Expedition and Niebuhr's work that would take place in Ankara, Cairo, Damascus, Beirut, Tehran, and Yemen. It has been suggested that these efforts were intended in part to repair the reputational damage in the Islamic world caused by the Danish cartoon controversy. Ultimately, the planned events were prevented by the Arab Spring.[9]", "210413": "Evangelista Torricelli (/\u02cct\u0252ri\u02c8t\u0283\u025bli/ TORR-ee-CHEL-ee;[1][2] Italian: [evand\u0292e\u02c8lista torri\u02c8t\u0283\u025blli] \u24d8; 15 October 1608\u00a0\u2013 25 October 1647) was an Italian physicist and mathematician, and a student of Galileo. He is best known for his invention of the barometer, but is also known for his advances in optics and work on the method of indivisibles. The torr is named after him./nTorricelli was born on 15 October 1608 in Rome, the firstborn child of Gaspare Torricelli and Caterina Angetti.[3] His family was from Faenza in the Province of Ravenna, then part of the Papal States. His father was a textile worker and the family was very poor. Seeing his talents, his parents sent him to be educated in Faenza, under the care of his uncle, Giacomo (James), a Camaldolese monk, who first ensured that his nephew was given a sound basic education. He then entered young Torricelli into a Jesuit College in 1624, possibly the one in Faenza itself, to study mathematics and philosophy until 1626, by which time his father, Gaspare, had died. The uncle then sent Torricelli to Rome to study science under the Benedictine monk Benedetto Castelli, professor of mathematics at the Collegio della Sapienza (now known as the Sapienza University of Rome).[4][5]\nCastelli was a student of Galileo Galilei.[6]\n\"Benedetto Castelli made experiments on running water (1628), and he was entrusted by Pope Urban VIII with hydraulic undertakings.\"[7]\nThere is no actual evidence that Torricelli was enrolled at the university. It is almost certain that Torricelli was taught by Castelli. In exchange he worked for him as his secretary from 1626 to 1632 in a private arrangement.[8]\nBecause of this, Torricelli was exposed to experiments funded by Pope Urban VIII. While living in Rome, Torricelli became also the student of the mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri, with whom he became great friends.[6] It was in Rome that Torricelli also became friends with two other students of Castelli, Raffaello Magiotti and Antonio Nardi. Galileo referred to Torricelli, Magiotti, and Nardi affectionately as his \"triumvirate\" in Rome.[9]/nIn 1632, shortly after the publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, Torricelli wrote to Galileo of reading it \"with the delight ... of one who, having already practiced all of geometry most diligently ... and having studied Ptolemy and seen almost everything of Tycho Brahe, Kepler and Longomontanus, finally, forced by the many congruences, came to adhere to Copernicus, and was a Galileian in profession and sect\". (The Vatican condemned Galileo in June 1633, and this was the only known occasion on which Torricelli openly declared himself to hold the Copernican view.)/nAside from several letters, little is known of Torricelli's activities in the years between 1632 and 1641, when Castelli sent Torricelli's monograph of the path of projectiles to Galileo, then a prisoner in his villa at Arcetri. Although Galileo promptly invited Torricelli to visit, Torricelli did not accept until just three months before Galileo's death. The reason for this was that Torricelli's mother, Caterina Angetti died.[6] \"(T)his short intercourse with the great mathematician enabled Torricelli to finish the fifth dialogue under the personal direction of its author; it was published by Viviani, another pupil of Galileo, in 1674.\"[7] After Galileo's death on 8 January 1642, Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici asked Torricelli to succeed Galileo as the grand-ducal mathematician and chair of mathematics at the University of Pisa.  Right before the appointment, Torricelli was considering returning to Rome because of there being nothing left for him in Florence,[6] where he had invented the barometer. In this new role he solved some of the great mathematical problems of the day, such as finding a cycloid's area and center of gravity.  As a result of this study, he wrote the book the Opera Geometrica in which he described his observations.  The book was published in 1644.[6]/nLittle was known about Torricelli in regard to his works in geometry when he accepted the honorable position, but after he published Opera Geometrica two years later, he became highly esteemed in that discipline.[10]  \"He was interested in Optics, and invented a method whereby microscopic lenses might be made of glass which could be easily melted in a lamp.\"[7]  As a result, he designed and built a number of telescopes and simple microscopes; several large lenses, engraved with his name, are still preserved in Florence. On 11 June 1644, he famously wrote in a letter to Michelangelo Ricci:/nNoi viviamo sommersi nel fondo d'un pelago d'aria. (We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air.)[11]/nHowever his work on the cycloid involved him in a controversy with Gilles de Roberval, who accused him of plagiarizing his earlier solution of the problem of its quadrature. Although it appears that Torricelli reached his solution independently, the matter was still in dispute up to his death.[12]/nTorricelli died of fever, most likely typhoid,[3][13] in Florence on 25 October 1647,[14] 10 days after his 39th birthday, and was buried at the Basilica of San Lorenzo. He left all his belongings to his adopted son Alessandro.  \"Belonging to that first period are his pamphlets on Solidi spherali, Contatti and the major part of the propositions and sundry problems which were gathered together by Viviani after Torricelli's death. This early work owes much to the study of the classics.\"[6] Sixty-eight years after Torricelli had died, his genius still filled his contemporaries with admiration, as evidenced by the anagram below the frontispice of Lezioni accademiche d'Evangelista Torricelli published in 1715: En virescit Galileus alter, meaning \"Here blossoms another Galileo.\"/nIn Faenza, a statue of Torricelli was created in 1868 in gratitude for all that Torricelli had done in advancing science during his short lifetime.[7]/nThe asteroid 7437 Torricelli and a crater on the Moon were named in his honour./nThe mountain range Torricelli Mountains on New Guinea carry his name./nIn 1830, botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle published Torricellia, which is a genus of flowering plants from Asia belonging to the family Torricelliaceae. They were named in Evangelista Torricelli's honour.[15]/nThe perusal of Galileo's Two New Sciences (1638) inspired Torricelli with many developments of the mechanical principles there set forth, which he embodied in a treatise De motu (printed amongst his Opera geometrica, 1644). Its communication by Castelli to Galileo in 1641, with a proposal that Torricelli should reside with him, led to Torricelli traveling to Florence, where he met Galileo, and acted as his amanuensis during the three remaining months of his life.[12]/nTorricelli's work led to first speculations about atmospheric pressure, and to the corollary invention of the mercury barometer (from the Greek word baros, meaning weight[16]) -- the principle of which was described as early as 1631 by Ren\u00e9 Descartes, although there is no evidence that Descartes ever built such an instrument.[17]/nThe barometer arose from the need to solve a theoretical and practical problem: a suction pump could only raise water up to a height of 10\u00a0metres (34\u00a0ft) (as recounted in Galileo's Two New Sciences). In the early 1600s, Torricelli's teacher, Galileo, argued that suction pumps were able to draw water from a well because of the \"force of vacuum.\"[16] This argument, however, failed to explain the fact that suction pumps could only raise water to a height of 10 metres./nAfter Galileo's death, Torricelli proposed, rather, that we live in a \"sea of air\" that exerts a pressure analogous in many ways to the pressure of water on submerged objects.[18] According to this hypothesis, at sea level, the air in the atmosphere has weight that roughly equals the weight of a 10-meter column of water.[16]  When a suction pump creates a vacuum inside a tube, the atmosphere no longer pushes on the water column below the piston but still pushes down on the surface of the water outside, thus causing the water to rise until its weight counterbalances the weight of the atmosphere. This hypothesis might have led him to a striking prediction: That a suction pump might only raise mercury, which is 13 times heavier than water, to 1/13 the height of the water column (76 centimeters) in a similar pump. (It is possible however that Torricelli carried out the mercury experiment first, and then formulated his sea of air hypothesis[18])./nIn 1643, Torricelli filled a meter-long tube (with one end sealed off) with mercury\u2014thirteen times denser than water\u2014and set the open end of the tube into a basin of the liquid metal and raised the sealed end so the tube stood vertically. The mercury level in the tube fell until it was about 76 centimetres (30\u00a0in) above the surface of the mercury basin, producing a Torricellian vacuum above.[19] This was also the first recorded incident of creating permanent vacuum./nA second unambiguous prediction of Torricelli's sea of air hypothesis was made by Blaise Pascal, who argued, and proved, that the mercury column of the barometer should drop at higher elevations. Indeed, it dropped slightly on top of a 50-meter bell tower, and much more so at the peak of a 1460-meter mountain./nAs we know now, the column's height fluctuates with atmospheric pressure at the same location, a fact which plays a key role in weather forecasting.  Baseline changes in the column's height at different elevations, in turn, underlie the principle of the altimeter.  Thus, this work laid the foundations for the modern concept of atmospheric pressure, the first barometer, an instrument that would later play a key role in weather forecasting, and the first pressure altimeter, which measures altitude and is often used in hiking, climbing, skiing, and aviation./nThe solution to the suction pump puzzle and the discovery of the principle of the barometer and altimeter have perpetuated Torricelli's fame with terms such as \"Torricellian tube\" and \"Torricellian vacuum\". The torr, a unit of pressure used in vacuum measurements, is named after him./nTorricelli also discovered a law, regarding the speed of a fluid flowing out of an opening, which was later shown to be a particular case of Bernoulli's principle. He found that water leaks out a small hole in the bottom of a container at a rate proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. So if the container is an upright cylinder with a small leak at the bottom and y is the depth of the water at time t, then/nfor some constant k > 0.[20]/nThe concept of center of gravity was discovered by Archimedes. Torricelli, following in his footsteps, discovered an important new principle, Torricelli\u2019s principle, which says: if any number of bodies be so connected that, by their motion, their centre of gravity can neither ascend nor descend, then those bodies are in equilibrium.[12] This is essentially a version of the principle of virtual work. This principle was later used by Christiaan Huygens to study pendulum motion./nTorricelli studied projectiles and how they traveled through the air.  \"Perhaps his most notable achievement in the field of projectiles was to establish for the first time the idea of an envelope: projectiles sent out at [...] the same speed in all directions trace out parabolas which are all tangent to a common paraboloid. This envelope became known as the parabola di sicurezza (parabola of safety).\"[6][5]/nTorricelli gave the first scientific description of the cause of wind:/n... winds are produced by differences of air temperature, and hence density, between two regions of the earth.[4]/nTorricelli is also famous for the discovery of the Torricelli's trumpet (also - perhaps more often - known as Gabriel's Horn) whose surface area is infinite, but whose volume is finite. This was seen as an \"incredible\" paradox by many at the time, including Torricelli himself, and prompted a fierce controversy about the nature of infinity, also involving the philosopher Hobbes. It is supposed by some to have led to the idea of a \"completed infinity\".  Torricelli tried several alternative proofs, attempting to prove that its surface area was also finite - all of which failed.[citation needed]/nTorricelli was also a pioneer in the area of infinite series. In his De dimensione parabolae of 1644, Torricelli considered a decreasing sequence of positive terms \n\n\n\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n,\n\na\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots }\n\n and showed the corresponding telescoping series \n\n\n\n(\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\n1\n\n\n)\n+\n(\n\na\n\n1\n\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n)\n+\n\u22ef\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a_{0}-a_{1})+(a_{1}-a_{2})+\\cdots }\n\n necessarily converges to \n\n\n\n\na\n\n0\n\n\n\u2212\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a_{0}-L}\n\n, where L is the limit of the sequence, and in this way gives a proof of the formula for the sum of a geometric series./nTorricelli developed further the method of indivisibles of Cavalieri. Many 17th century mathematicians learned of the method through Torricelli whose writing was more accessible than Cavalieri's.[21]/nSeveral Italian Navy submarines were named after Evangelista Torricelli:/nHis original manuscripts are preserved at Florence, Italy.

After completing two semesters at the University of Munich, he volunteered to join the German Army in a field artillery regiment. He was wounded in the Battle of Verdun and was discharged from the German Army in December 1918. In 1919 he continued his mathematical studies for one semester at the Technical University of Berlin (TU Berlin) and then transferred to Berlin's Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t (Friedrich Wilhelm University, now called the Humboldt University of Berlin). There he studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy and in 1923 passed the Lehramtsexamen qualifying him to become a Gymnasium teacher. From 1923 to 1926 he taught at Berlin's Mommsen-Gymnasium.[1] In 1927 he received his Promotion from TU Berlin. His dissertation \u00dcber einige Analogien zwischen linearen partiellen und linearen gew\u00f6hnlichen Differentialgleichungen (About some analogies between linear partial and linear ordinary differential equations) was supervised by Erhard Schmidt and Richard von Mises.[5] Rothe worked from 1926 to 1927 at the Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Friedrich Wilhelm University. In 1928 he married the mathematician Hildegard Ille (1899\u20131942).[1] From 1928 to 1931 he was a Privatdozent and Assistent under Fritz Noether at the Technische Hochschule Breslau. There he received his Habilitation in 1928. From 1931 to  1935 he was a Privatdozent at the University of Breslau. There he received his Umhabilitation in 1931).[6][7] During the time he held positions in Breslau, he took study leave for a year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. In Breslau in April 1931 Hildegard Rothe gave birth to Erhard W. Rothe.[1]/nAfter being dismissed in 1935 from the German civil service because he was a Jew, Rothe with his wife and son escaped to Zurich and in emigrated in 1937 to the USA. From 1937 to 1943 he taught mathematics (with a very small salary) at William Penn College (now William Penn University) in Oskaloosa, Iowa.[1][8] His wife died of cancer in December 1942. At the University of Michigan, Rothe was an assistant professor from 1944 to 1949, an associate professor from 1949 to 1955, and a full professor from 1955 to 1964, when he retired as professor emeritus.[1] In retirement, he taught at the University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn[9] and in the academic year 1967\u20131968 at Western Michigan University (WMU).[1] During his year at WMU, Rothe helped to develop the PhD program for WMU's mathematics department, which awarded its first PhD in December 1969.[10]/nRothe published more than 50 mathematical papers.[9] He was a co-author, with Hans Rademacher, of chapter 19 of the 7th edition of Die Differential- und Integralgleichungen der Mechanik und Physik.[11] In 1986 at the age of 91, Rothe published the 242-page book Introduction to Various Aspects of Degree Theory in Banach Spaces.[1]/nHis contributions to mathematical research reflect his great breadth: differential and integral equations, linear and nonlinear functional analysis, topology, calculus of variations.[12]/nIn addition to the Rothe Method, he is also known for his theorem, proven in 1937, that a functional in a Hilbert space is weakly continuous if and only if its Fr\u00e9chet derivative is a completely continuous operator[13][14][15][16] and for Rothe's fixed point theorem, proven in 1937.[17][18] In 1978 a collection of papers was published in his honor.[19] His doctoral students include Jane Cronin Scanlon and George J.

Taylor's most famous developments are Taylor's theorem and the Taylor series, essential in the infinitesimal approach of functions in specific points./nBrook Taylor was born in Edmonton (former Middlesex). Taylor was the son of John Taylor, MP of Patrixbourne, Kent[1] and Olivia Tempest, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Tempest, Baronet of Durham.[2]/nHe entered St John's College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner in 1701, and took degrees in LL.B. in 1709 and LL.D. in 1714.[3] Taylor studied mathematics under John Machin and John Keill, leading to Taylor obtaining a solution to the problem of \"center of oscillation.\" Taylor's solution remained unpublished until May 1714,[4] when his claim to priority was disputed by Johann Bernoulli./nTaylor's Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa (1715) (\"Direct and Indirect Methods of Incrementation\") added a new branch to higher mathematics, called \"calculus of finite differences\". Taylor used this development to determine the form of movement in vibrating strings. Taylor also wrote the first satisfactory investigation of astronomical refraction.[5][6] The same work contains the well-known Taylor's theorem, the importance of which remained unrecognized until 1772, when Joseph-Louis Lagrange realized its usefulness and termed it \"the main foundation of differential calculus\".[7][8]/nIn Taylor's 1715 essay Linear Perspective, Taylor set forth the principles of perspective in a more understandable form, but the work suffered from brevity and obscurity problems which plagued most of his writings, meaning the essay required further explanation in the treatises of Joshua Kirby (1754) and Daniel Fournier (1761).[8][9]/nTaylor was elected as a fellow in the Royal Society in 1712. In the same year, Taylor sat on the committee for adjudicating the claims of Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. He acted as secretary to the society from 13 January 1714 to 21 October 1718./nFrom 1715 onward, Taylor's studies took a philosophical and religious bent. He corresponded with the Comte de Montmort on the subject of Nicolas Malebranche's tenets. Unfinished treatises written on his return from Aix-la-Chapelle in 1719, On the Jewish Sacrifices and On the Lawfulness of Eating Blood, were afterwards found among his papers.[8]/nTaylor was one of few English mathematicians, along with Isaac Newton and Roger Cotes, who was capable of holding his own with the Bernoullis, but a lack of clarity affected a great part of his demonstrations and Taylor lost brevity through his failure to express his ideas fully and clearly.[8]/nHis health began to fail in 1717 after years of intense work.[10]/nTaylor married Miss Brydges of Wallington, Surrey in 1721 without his father's approval. The marriage led to an estrangement with his father, which improved in 1723 after Taylor's wife died in childbirth while giving birth to a son. Taylor's son did not survive./nHe spent the next two years with his family at Bifrons, and in 1725 he married with his father's approval, Sabetta Sawbridge of Olantigh, Kent. She died in childbirth in 1730, though his only[11] daughter, Elizabeth, survived./nTaylor's father died in 1729, leaving Taylor to inherit the Bifrons estate./nTaylor died at the age of 46, on 29 December 1731, at Somerset House, London./nTaylor's grandson, Sir William Young, printed a posthumous work entitled Contemplatio Philosophica for private circulation in 1793, (2nd Bart., 10 January 1815). The work was prefaced by a biography,[10] and had an appendix containing letters addressed to him by Bolingbroke, Bossuet, and others./nSeveral short papers by Taylor were published in Phil. Trans., vols. xxvii to xxxii, which including accounts of experiments in magnetism and capillary attraction. In 1719, Brook issued an improved version of his work on perspective, New Principles of Linear Perspective, which was revised by John Colson in 1749. A French translation was published in 1757.[12] It was reprinted, with a portrait and short biography, in 1811./nTaylor is an impact crater located on the Moon, named in honor of Brook Taylor in 1935.[13]", "13822": "Heisuke Hironaka (\u5e83\u4e2d \u5e73\u7950, Hironaka Heisuke, born April 9, 1931) is a Japanese mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1970 for his contributions to algebraic geometry.[1]/nHironaka was born on April 9, 1931 in Yamaguchi, Japan. He was inspired to study mathematics after a visiting Hiroshima University mathematics professor gave a lecture at his junior high school. Hironaka applied to the undergraduate program at Hiroshima University, but was unsuccessful. However, the following year, he was accepted into Kyoto University to study physics, entering in 1949 and receiving his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science from the University in 1954 and 1956. Hironaka initially studied physics, chemistry, and biology, but his third year as an undergraduate, he chose to move to taking courses in mathematics.[2]/nThe same year, Hironaka was invited to a seminar group led by Yasuo Akizuki, who would have a major influence on Hironaka's mathematical development. The group, informally known as the Akizuki School, discussed cutting edge research developments including the resolution of singularities problem for which Hironaka later received the Fields Medal.[3] Hironaka has described his interest in this problem as having the logic and mystery of \"a boy falling in love with a girl.\"[4] In 1956, Akizuki invited then Harvard professor Oscar Zariski to Kyoto University. Hironaka took the opportunity to present his own research to Zariski, who suggested that Hironaka move to Harvard University to continue his studies.[2]/nIn 1957, Hironaka moved to the United States to attend Harvard University as a doctoral student under the direction of Zariski.[5] Hironaka's algebra background, developed under Akizuki, allowed him to bring fresh insights into mathematics discussions in Harvard, which placed a greater emphasis on geometric perspectives. In 1958-1959, Alexander Grothendieck visited Harvard University and was another important influence on Hironaka, inviting him to the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifique (IHES) in Paris.[3]/nReturning to Harvard in 1960, Hironaka received his PhD for his thesis On the Theory of Birational Blowing-up.[6]/nHironaka was an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Brandeis University from 1960-1963. He taught at Columbia University from 1964-1968 and became a professor of mathematics at Harvard University from 1968 until becoming emeritus in 1992./nHironaka returned to Japan for a joint professorship at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences and Kyoto University from 1975-1983 and was the Institute Director from 1983-1985.[7]/nHironaka was the president of Yamaguchi University from 1996-2002.[8]/nIn 1960, Hironaka introduced Hironaka's example, showing that a deformation of K\u00e4hler manifolds need not be K\u00e4hler. The example is a 1-parameter family of smooth compact complex 3-folds such that most fibers are K\u00e4hler (and even projective), but one fiber is not K\u00e4hler. This can be used to show that several other plausible statements holding for smooth varieties of dimension at most 2 fail for smooth varieties of dimension at least 3.[9]/nIn 1964, Hironaka proved that singularities of algebraic varieties admit resolutions in characteristic zero. Hironaka was able to give a general solution to this problem, proving that any algebraic variety can be replaced by (more precisely is birationally equivalent to) a similar variety which has no singularities.[2]/nHironaka recalled that he felt very close to approaching the solution while studying in Harvard. Then, soon after getting his first teaching position at Brandeis, he realized that if he combined his commutative algebra experience from Kyoto, geometry of polynomials from Harvard, and globalization technique from IHES, he had everything he needed to solve the problem.[3]/nIn 2017 he posted to his personal webpage a manuscript that claims to prove the existence of a resolution of singularities in positive characteristic.[10]/nHironaka received a Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, at the International Congress at Nice in 1970 at 39, just under the 40 year age limit./nList of Awards:/nHironaka has been active in promoting mathematical education, particularly in Japan and South Korea. Hironaka wrote or co-authored 26 books on mathematics and other topics.[4]/nIn 1980, he started a summer seminar for Japanese high school students, and later created a program for Japanese and Amerian college students. In 1984 he established the Japanese Association for Mathematical Sciences (JAMS) to fund these seminars, serving as executive director.[3] Additional funding was received from corporations and the Japanese government. Harvard emeritus math professor Shing-Tung Yau noted that \"In the 1980s there were few domestic grant opportunities for foreign travel or exchange [...] today, one can see the fruits of Hironaka\u2019s efforts in the number of former JAMS fellows who have become professors of mathematics across the United States and Japan.\"[4]/nAs visiting professor at Seoul National University in 2008-2009, Hironaka mentored undergraduate student June Huh, a former high school drop-out and aspiring poet, encouraging his interest in pursuing math for graduate school. Huh won a fields medal in 2022 for the linkages he found between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.[15]/nHironaka married Wakako Kimoto  in 1960, a Brandeis Wien International Scholar who entered Japanese politics through her election to the House of Councillors in 1986. They have a son Jo, and daughter Eriko, who is also a mathematician.[2][16]/nOn his love for mathematics, Hironaka said \"I accumulate anything to do with numbers. For instance, I have more than 10,000 photos of flowers and leaves. I like to just count the numbers and compare them. I am so pleased to be a mathematician, because I can see the mathematical interest in things.\"[3]", "7681535": "Nicholas Ian Shepherd-Barron, FRS (born 17 March 1955), is a British mathematician working in algebraic geometry.

His polls-only model gave Donald Trump only a 28.6% chance of victory in the 2016 presidential election,[4] but this was higher than many other forecasting competitors.[5]/nMuch of Silver's approach can be characterized by using probabilistic and statistical modeling to try and understand complex social systems, such as professional sports, the popularity of political platforms, and elections./nSilver was born in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of Sally (n\u00e9e Thrun), a community activist, and Brian David Silver, a former chair of the political science department at Michigan State University.[6][7] Silver's mother's family was of English and German descent. His maternal great-grandfather, Harmon Lewis, was president of the Alcoa Steamship Company, Inc.[8] Silver's father's family includes two uncles\u2014Leon Silver and Caswell Silver\u2014who were distinguished geologists. Silver has described himself as \"half-Jewish\".[8][9]/nSilver showed a proficiency in math from a young age.[10] According to journalist William Hageman, \"Silver caught the baseball bug when he was 6.... It was 1984, the year the Detroit Tigers won the World Series. The Tigers became his team and baseball his sport. And if there's anything that goes hand in glove with baseball, it's numbers, another of Silver's childhood interests (\"It's always more interesting to apply it to batting averages than algebra class\")\".[11]/nAs a student at East Lansing High School, Silver won first place in the State of Michigan in the 49th annual John S. Knight Scholarship Contest for senior high school debaters in 1996.[12] Silver first showed his journalism skills as a writer and opinion page editor for The Portrait, East Lansing High School's student newspaper, from 1993\u20131996.[13]/nIn 2000, Silver graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from the University of Chicago. He also wrote for the Chicago Weekly News and the Chicago Maroon. He spent his third year at the London School of Economics.[14]/nAfter college graduation in 2000, Silver worked for three and a half years as a transfer pricing consultant with KPMG in Chicago. When asked in 2009, \"What is your biggest regret in life?\" Silver responded, \"Spending four years of my life at a job I didn't like\".[15] While employed at KPMG, Silver continued to nurture his lifelong interest in baseball and statistics, and on the side he began to work on his PECOTA system for projecting player performance and careers. He quit his job at KPMG in April 2004 and for a time earned his living mainly by playing online poker.[16] According to Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff, over a three-year period Silver earned $400,000 from online poker.[17]/nIn 2003, Silver became a writer for Baseball Prospectus (BP), after having sold PECOTA to BP in return for a partnership interest. After resigning from KPMG in 2004, he took the position of Executive Vice-President, later renamed Managing Partner of BP. Silver further developed PECOTA and wrote a weekly column under the heading \"Lies, Damned Lies\". He applied sabermetric techniques to a broad range of topics including forecasting the performance of individual players, the economics of baseball, metrics for the valuation of players, and developing an Elo rating system for Major League baseball.[18]/nBetween 2003 and 2009, Silver co-authored the Baseball Prospectus annual book of Major League Baseball forecasts,[19] as well as other books, including Mind Game: How the Boston Red Sox Got Smart, Won a World Series, and Created a New Blueprint for Winning,[20] Baseball Between the Numbers,[21] and It Ain't Over 'til It's Over: The Baseball Prospectus Pennant Race Book.[22]/nHe contributed articles about baseball to ESPN.com, Sports Illustrated, Slate, the New York Sun, and The New York Times.[23]/nSilver wrote more than 200 articles for Baseball Prospectus.[24]/nPECOTA (Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm) is a statistical system that projects the future performance of hitters and pitchers. It is designed primarily for two users: fans interested in fantasy baseball, and professionals in the baseball business trying to predict the performance and valuation of major league players. Unlike most other baseball projection systems, PECOTA relies on matching a given current player to a set of \"comparable\" players whose past performance can serve as a guide to how the given current player is likely to perform in the future. Unlike most other such systems, PECOTA also calculates a range of probable performance levels rather than a single predicted value on a given measure such as earned run average or batting average./nPECOTA projections were first published by Baseball Prospectus in the 2003 edition of its annual book as well as online by BaseballProspectus.com. Silver produced the PECOTA forecasts for each Major League Baseball season from 2003 through 2009.[25]/nOn November 1, 2007, while still employed by Baseball Prospectus, Silver began publishing a diary under the pseudonym \"Poblano\" on the progressive political blog Daily Kos.[26] Silver set out to analyze quantitative aspects of the political game to enlighten a broader audience. Silver reports that \"he was stranded in a New Orleans airport when the idea of FiveThirtyEight.com came to him. 'I was just frustrated with the analysis. ... I saw a lot of discussion about strategy that was not all that sophisticated, especially when it came to quantitative things like polls and demographics'\".[27] His forecasts of the 2008 United States presidential primary elections drew a lot of attention, including being cited by The New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol.[28]/nOn March 7, 2008, while still writing as \"Poblano\", Silver established his own blog, FiveThirtyEight.com. Often colloquially referred to as just 538, the website takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college.[29]/nOn May 30, 2008, Poblano revealed his identity to FiveThirtyEight.com readers.[30] On June 1, 2008, Silver published a two-page op-ed in the New York Post outlining the rationale underlying his focus on the statistical aspects of politics.[31] He first appeared on national television on CNN's American Morning on June 13, 2008.[32]/nSilver described his partisan orientation as follows in the FAQ on his website: \"My state [Illinois] has non-partisan registration, so I am not registered as anything. I vote for Democratic candidates the majority of the time (though by no means always). This year, I have been a supporter of Barack Obama\".[33] With respect to the impartiality of his electoral projections, Silver stated, \"Are [my] results biased toward [my] preferred candidates? I hope not, but that is for you to decide. I have tried to disclose as much about my methodology as possible\".[33]/nShortly after the November 4 election, ESPN writer Jim Caple observed, \"Forget Cole Hamels and the Phillies. No one in baseball had a more impressive fall than Nate Silver.... [R]ight now Silver is exhausted. He barely slept the last couple weeks of the campaign\u2014'By the end, it was full-time plus'\u2014and for that matter, he says he couldn't have kept it up had the campaign lasted two days longer.

In March 2009, he stepped down as Managing Partner of Baseball Prospectus and handed over responsibility for producing future PECOTA projections to other Baseball Prospectus staff members.[25] In April 2009, he appeared as an analyst on ESPN's Baseball Tonight. After March 2009, he published only two \"Lies, Damned Lies\" columns on BaseballProspectus.com./nIn November 2009, ESPN introduced a new Soccer Power Index (SPi),[42] designed by Nate Silver, for predicting the outcome of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[43] He published a post-mortem after the tournament, comparing his predictions to those of alternative rating systems.[44]/nIn April 2010, in an assignment for New York magazine, Silver created a quantitative index of \"The Most Livable Neighborhoods in New York\".[45]/nOn June 3, 2010, Silver announced on FiveThirtyEight/nIn the near future, the blog will \"re-launch\" under a NYTimes.com domain.

Silver's Times Sunday Magazine feature first appeared on November 19, 2010, under the heading \"Go Figure\".[50] It was later titled \"Acts of Mild Subversion\".[51]/nWhile blogging for The Times, Silver also worked on his book about prediction, which was published in September 2012. At that time, Silver began to drop hints that after 2012 he would turn his attention to matters other than detailed statistical forecasting of elections. As reported in New York magazine: \" 'I view my role now as providing more of a macro-level skepticism, rather than saying this poll is good or this poll is evil,' he says. And in four [years], he might be even more macro, as he turns his forecasting talents to other fields. 'I'm 97 percent sure that the FiveThirtyEight model will exist in 2016,' he says, 'but it could be someone else who's running it or licensing it.'\"[52]/nDuring the last year of FiveThirtyEight's license to The New York Times, it drew a very large volume of online traffic to the paper:/nThe Times does not release traffic figures, but a spokesperson said yesterday that Silver's blog provided a significant\u2014and significantly growing, over the past year\u2014percentage of Times pageviews. This fall, visits to the Times' political coverage (including FiveThirtyEight) have increased, both absolutely and as a percentage of site visits. But FiveThirtyEight's growth is staggering: where earlier this year, somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of politics visits included a stop at FiveThirtyEight, last week that figure was 71 percent./nBut Silver's blog has buoyed more than just the politics coverage, becoming a significant traffic-driver for the site as a whole. Earlier this year, approximately 1 percent of visits to the New York Times included FiveThirtyEight. Last week, that number was 13 percent. Yesterday, it was 20 percent. That is, one in five visitors to the sixth-most-trafficked U.S. news site took a look at Silver's blog.[53]/nIn an online chat session a week after the 2012 election Silver commented: \"As tempting as it might be to pull a Jim Brown/Sandy Koufax and just mic-drop/retire from elections forecasting, I expect that we'll be making forecasts in 2014 and 2016. Midterm elections can be dreadfully boring, unfortunately. But the 2016 G.O.P. primary seems almost certain to be epic.\"[54] In late November 2012, Times executive editor Jill Abramson declared her wish to keep Silver and his blog: \"We would love to have Nate continue to be part of the New York Times family, and to expand on what he does\", she said. \"We know he began in sports anyway, so it is not an exclusively political product. I am excited to talk to Nate when he finishes his book tour about ways to expand that kind of reporting.\"[55]/nOn July 22, 2013, ESPN (a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company) announced that it had acquired ownership of the FiveThirtyEight website and brand, and that \"Silver will serve as editor-in-chief of the site and will build a team of journalists, editors, analysts and contributors in the coming months.\"[56]/nThe New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote of Silver's decision to leave for ESPN:/nI don't think Nate Silver ever really fit into the Times culture and I think he was aware of that. He was, in a word, disruptive. Much like the Brad Pitt character in the movie \"Moneyball\" disrupted the old model of how to scout baseball players, Nate disrupted the traditional model of how to cover politics.[57]/nShe added, \"A number of traditional and well-respected Times journalists disliked his work.\"[58] Later, Sullivan wrote in The Times that \"I don't feel so good about not being able to investigate every complaint from every individual reader fully, or about making some misjudgments in individual posts \u2014 my Nate Silver commentary, among others, has probably been off-base...\".[59]/nNew York magazine reported that executive editor Jill Abramson \"put on a full-court press\" to keep Silver at The Times and that \"for Abramson, Silver was a tentpole attraction for her favorite subject, national politics, and brought the kind of buzz she thought valuable\", but the company's CEO and President Mark Thompson \"confirmed that keeping Silver was not at the top of his agenda.\" The article stated that \"the major reason Silver left was because he felt it was Thompson who had not committed to building his franchise. The mixed signals from Thompson and Abramson\u2014his lack of enthusiasm for committing resources to Silver, her desire to keep a major star\u2014frustrated Silver and his lawyer.\"[60]/nWhen FiveThirtyEight was relaunched under Disney's ESPN on March 17, 2014, Silver outlined the scope of topics that would be covered under the rubric of \"data journalism\":[61]/nWe've expanded our staff from two full-time journalists to 20 and counting. Few of them will focus on politics exclusively; instead, our coverage will span five major subject areas \u2014 politics, economics, science, life and sports.\nOur team also has a broad set of skills and experience in methods that fall under the rubric of data journalism. These include statistical analysis, but also data visualization, computer programming and data-literate reporting. So in addition to written stories, we'll have interactive graphics and features. Within a couple of months we'll launch a podcast, and we'll be collaborating with ESPN Films and Grantland to produce original documentary films./nIn 2018, the Walt Disney Company transferred the FiveThirtyEight site from the ESPN division to the ABC News division. In April 2023, amid widespread layoffs at Disney and ABC affecting FiveThirtyEight, Silver announced that his contract with ABC would not be extended. After Silver's departure in May, a smaller FiveThirtyEight continues to operate under the data analytics division of ABC News.[2]/nIn March 2008, Silver established his blog FiveThirtyEight.com, in which he developed a system for tracking polls and forecasting the outcome of the 2008 general election. At the same time, he continued making forecasts of the 2008 Democratic primary elections. That several of his forecasts based on demographic analysis proved to be substantially more accurate than those of the professional pollsters gained visibility and professional credibility for \"Poblano\", the pseudonym that Silver was then using.[62]/nAfter the North Carolina and Indiana primaries on May 6, the popularity of FiveThirtyEight.com surged. Silver recalls the scenario: \"I know the polls show it's really tight in NC, but we think Obama is going to win by thirteen, fourteen points, and he did. ... Any time you make a prediction like that people give you probably too much credit for it.... But after that [Silver's and the website's popularity] started to really take off. It's pretty nonlinear, once you get one mention in the mainstream media, other people [quickly follow suit]\".[63]/nAs a CNET reporter wrote on election eve, \"Even though Silver launched the site as recently as March, its straightforward approach, daring predictions, and short but impressive track record has put it on the map of political sites to follow.\"[64]/nSilver's final 2008 presidential election forecast accurately predicted the winner of 49 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, missing only the prediction for Indiana. As his model predicted, the races in Missouri and North Carolina were particularly close. He also correctly predicted the winners of every U.S. Senate race. The accuracy of his predictions won him further acclaim, including abroad,[65] and added to his reputation as a leading political prognosticator.[66]/nBarack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign signed off on a proposal to share all of its private polling with Silver. After signing a confidentiality agreement, Silver was granted access to hundreds of polls the campaign had conducted.[67][68]/nShortly after FiveThirtyEight relocated to The New York Times, Silver introduced his prediction models for the 2010 elections to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state governorships. Each of these models relied initially on a combination of electoral history, demographics, and polling. Silver eventually published detailed forecasts and analyses of the results for all three sets of elections. He correctly predicted the winner in 34 of the 37 contested Senate races. His 2010 congressional mid-term predictions were not as accurate as those made in 2008, but were still within the reported confidence interval. Silver predicted a Republican pickup of 54 seats in the House of Representatives; the GOP won 63 seats. Of the 37 gubernatorial races, FiveThirtyEight correctly predicted the winner of 36.[69]/nAlthough throughout 2011 Silver devoted a lot of attention on his blog to the 2012 Republican party primaries, his first effort to handicap the 2012 presidential general election appeared as the cover story in The New York Times Magazine a year prior to the election: \"Is Obama Toast? Handicapping the 2012 Election\".[70] Accompanying the online release of this article, Silver also published \"Choose Obama's Re-Election Adventure\", an interactive toy that allowed readers to predict the outcome of the election based on their assumptions about three variables: President Obama's favorability ratings, the rate of GDP growth, and how conservative the Republican opponent would be.[71] This analysis stimulated a lot of critical discussion.[72]/nWhile publishing numerous stories on the Republican primary elections, in mid-February 2012 Silver reprised and updated his previous Magazine story with another one, \"What Obama Should Do Next\".[73] This story painted a more optimistic picture of President Obama's re-election chances. A companion article on his FiveThirtyEight blog, \"The Fundamentals Now Favor Obama\", explained how the model and the facts on the ground had changed between November and February.[74]/nSilver published the first iteration of his 2012 general election forecasts on June 7, 2012. According to the model, at that time Barack Obama was projected to win 291 electoral votes\u201421 more than the 270 required for a majority. Obama then had an estimated 61.8% chance of winning a majority.[75]/nOn the morning of the November 6, 2012, presidential election, the final update of Silver's model at 10:10 A.M. gave President Barack Obama a 90.9% chance of winning a majority of the 538 electoral votes.[76] Both in summary tables and in an electoral map, Silver forecast the winner of each state. At the conclusion of that day, when Mitt Romney had conceded to Barack Obama, Silver's model had correctly predicted the winner of every one of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.[77][78] Silver, along with at least three[79] academic-based analysts\u2014Drew Linzer,[80] Simon Jackman,[81] and Josh Putnam[82]\u2014who also aggregated polls from multiple pollsters\u2014thus was not only broadly correct about the election outcome, but also specifically predicted the outcomes for the nine swing states.[83] In contrast, individual pollsters were less successful. For example, Rasmussen Reports \"missed on six of its nine swing-state polls\".[84][85][86]/nIn the week leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the FiveThirtyEight team predicted that Hillary Clinton had a 64.5% chance of winning the election. Their final prediction on November 8, 2016, gave Clinton a 71% chance to win the 2016 United States presidential election,[87] while other major forecasters had predicted Clinton to win with at least an 85% to 99% probability.[88][89] Donald Trump won the election. FiveThirtyEight argued it projected a much higher chance (29%) of Donald Trump winning the presidency than other modelers,[88] a projection which was criticized days before the election by Ryan Grim of The Huffington Post as \"unskewing\" too much in favor of Trump.[90]/nIn their final prediction of the 2020 United States presidential election, FiveThirtyEight predicted that Joe Biden had an 89% chance of winning the election;[91] Biden won both the Electoral College and the popular vote. FiveThirtyEight only missed Florida, North Carolina, and Maine's 2nd congressional district in their projections. Donald Trump prevailed in each of these contests, in which FiveThirtyEight forecasted the better chances for Biden to win./nSilver has been criticized for inaccurate predictions. In January 2010, journalist and blogger Colby Cosh criticized Silver's performance during the Massachusetts special Senate election, saying he was \"still arguing as late as Thursday afternoon that [Martha] Coakley was the clear favourite; he changed his mind at midnight that evening and acknowledged that Scott Brown had a puncher's chance.\" (Brown won the election.)[92]/nSilver's quantitative focus on polling data, without insight from experience in political organizing or journalism, has been a recurring critique from experienced commentators. Huffington Post columnist Geoffrey Dunn described Silver as someone who \"has never organized a precinct in his life, much less walked one, pontificating about the dynamics in the electoral processes as if he actually understood them.\"[93]/nConsiderable criticism during the 2012 elections came from political conservatives, who argued that Silver's election projections were politically biased against Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president.[94] For example, Silver was accused of applying a double standard to his treatment of Rasmussen Reports polls, such as a 2010 analysis asserting a statistical bias in its methodology.[95] Josh Jordan wrote in National Review that Silver clearly favored Obama and adjusted the weight he gave polls \"based on what [he] think[s] of the pollster and the results and not based on what is actually inside the poll\".[96]/nOn MSNBC's Morning Joe, host Joe Scarborough stated that Silver's prediction that day of a 73.6% chance of a win for Obama greatly exceeded the confidence of the Obama campaign itself, which Scarborough equated to that of the Romney campaign, both believing \"they have a 50.1 percent chance of winning\", and calling Silver an \"ideologue\" and a \"joke\". Silver responded with the offer of a $1,000 wager (for charity) over the outcome of the election. The New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, while defending Silver's analysis, characterized the wager as \"a bad idea\" as it gave the appearance of a partisan motive for Silver, and \"inappropriate\" for someone perceived as a Times journalist (although Silver was not a member of the newspaper's staff).[97][98]/nAfter a post-election appearance by Silver on Joe Scarborough's Morning Joe, Scarborough published what he called a \"(semi) apology\", in which he concluded:/n\"I won't apologize to Mr. Silver for predicting an outcome that I had also been predicting for a year. But I do need to tell Nate I'm sorry for leaning in too hard and lumping him with pollsters whose methodology is as rigorous as the Simpsons' strip mall physician, Dr. Nick. For those sins (and a multitude of others that I'm sure I don't even know about), I am sorry./nPolitics is a messy sport. And just as ball players who drink beer and eat fried chicken in dugouts across America can screw up the smartest sabermetrician's forecast, Nate Silver's formula is sure to let his fervent admirers down from time to time. But judging from what I saw of him this morning, Nate is a grounded guy who admits as much in his book. I was too tough on him and there's a 84.398264% chance I will be less dismissive of his good work in the future.\"[99]/nSilver's nondisclosure of the details of his analytical model has resulted in some skepticism. Washington Post journalist Ezra Klein wrote: \"There are good criticisms to make of Silver's model, not the least of which is that, while Silver is almost tediously detailed about what's going on in the model, he won't give out the code, and without the code, we can't say with certainty how the model works.\"[100] Colby Cosh wrote that the model \"is proprietary and irreproducible. That last feature makes it unwise to use Silver's model as a straw stand-in for \"science\", as if the model had been fully specified in a peer-reviewed journal\".[101]/nThe Signal and The Noise was published in the United States on September 27, 2012. It reached the New York Times Best Sellers List as #12 for non-fiction hardback books after its first week in print. It dropped to #20 in the second week, before rising to #13 in the third, and remaining on the non-fiction hardback top 15 list for the following 13 weeks, with a highest weekly ranking of #4.[102] Sales increased after the election on November 6, jumping 800% and becoming the second best seller on Amazon.com.[103]/nThe book describes methods of mathematical model-building using probability and statistics. Silver takes a big-picture approach to using statistical tools, combining sources of unique data (e.g., timing a minor league ball player's fastball using a radar gun), with historical data and principles of sound statistical analysis; Silver argues that many of these are violated by many pollsters and pundits who nonetheless have important media roles. Case studies in the book include baseball, elections, climate change, the financial crash, poker, and weather forecasting. These different topics illustrate different statistical principles. As a reviewer in The New York Times notes: \"It's largely about evaluating predictions in a variety of fields, from finance to weather to epidemiology. We learn about a handful of successes: when, for instance, meteorologists predict a hurricane's landfall 72 hours in advance.... But mostly we learn about failures. It turns out we're not even close to predicting the next catastrophic earthquake or the spread of the next killer bird flu, despite the enormous amounts of brainpower trained on these questions in the past few decades\".[104]/nSilver's self-unmasking at the end of May 2008 brought him a lot of publicity focused on his combined skill as both baseball statistician-forecaster and political statistician-forecaster, including articles about him in The Wall Street Journal,[105] Newsweek,[106] Science News,[107][108] and his hometown Lansing State Journal.[109]/nIn early June he began to cross-post his daily \"Today's Polls\" updates on \"The Plank\" in The New Republic.[110] Also, Rasmussen Reports began to use the FiveThirtyEight.com poll averages for its own tracking of the 2008 state-by-state races.[111]/nIn 2009 through 2012, Silver appeared as a political analyst on MSNBC,[112] CNN[113] and Bloomberg Television,[114][115] PBS,[116] NPR,[117] Democracy Now!,[118] The Charlie Rose Show,[119] ABC News,[120] and Current TV.[121]/nSilver also appeared on The Colbert Report (October 7, 2008 and November 5, 2012),[122] The Daily Show (October 17, 2012 and November 7, 2012),[123] and Real Time with Bill Maher (October 26, 2012).[124]/nThat Silver accurately predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential race, in the face of numerous public attacks on his forecasts by critics, inspired many articles in the press, ranging from Gizmodo,[125] to online and mainstream newspapers,[126] news and commentary magazines,[127] business media,[128] trade journals,[129] media about media,[130] and Scientific American,[131] as well as a feature interview on The Today Show,[132] a return appearance on The Daily Show,[133] and an appearance on Morning Joe.[134]/nSilver's first appearance on ABC News as Editor-in-Chief of the new FiveThirtyEight.com was on George Stephanopoulos's This Week on November 3, 2013.[135]/nSilver is referenced in the Syfy channel show The Magicians as an earth wizard who uses polling spells.[136]/nIn 2015, Silver appeared on the podcast Employee of the Month, where he criticized Vox Media for \"recycling Wikipedia entries\" in their content.[137]/nSilver is a great-nephew of geologists Caswell Silver and Leon Silver. He is a great-grandson of Harmon Lewis, the President of Alcoa Steamship Company,[147] as well as a great-great-nephew of the embryologist Warren Harmon Lewis and his wife, biologist Margaret Reed Lewis.[citation needed]/nSilver is gay.[148] \"I've always felt like something of an outsider. I've always had friends but I've always come from an outside point of view. I think that's important. If you grow up gay, or in a household that's agnostic, when most people are religious, then from the get-go, you are saying there are things that the majority of society believes that I don't believe\", he told an interviewer in 2012.[149] When asked \"what made you feel more of a misfit, being gay or being a geek\", he replied, \"Probably the numbers stuff since I had that from when I was six.\"[149] When asked in 2008 if he had noticed people looking at him as a \"gay icon\", he responded, \"I've started to notice it a little bit, although so far it seems like I'm more a subject of geek affection than gay affection\".[150]/nSilver discussed his sexuality in the context of growing up in East Lansing, in an article about the Supreme Court ruling Obergefell v. Hodges in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage on the date of its announcement. He analyzed the speed of the change of public sentiment, pointing out that the change over only several decades has been palpable to the current generations.[151]/nSilver has long been interested in fantasy baseball, especially Scoresheet Baseball.[152] While in college he served as an expert on Scoresheet Baseball for BaseballHQ.[153] When he took up political writing, Silver abandoned his blog, The Burrito Bracket,[154] in which he ran a one-and-done competition among the taquerias in his Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago.[155]/nSilver plays poker semi-professionally.[156][41] He has $811,142 in total tournament earnings, including an 87th place finish in the 2023 World Series of Poker Main Event.[157][158]/nIn a 2012 interview with Charlie Rose, Silver said, \"I'd say I'm somewhere in between being a libertarian and a liberal. So if I were to vote, it would be kind of a Gary Johnson versus Mitt Romney decision, I suppose.\"[159] In a 2023 newsletter, Silver said that he misspoke during that interview, and meant to say that he would have chosen between Johnson and Barack Obama. He added that he has voted Democratic in every presidential election he voted in, though he voted for John Kasich in the 2016 New York Republican presidential primary, as he believed \"the difference between a Kasich-led GOP and a Trump-led GOP would make a large difference to the future of the country\". Silver also criticized \"the progressive political class\", believing that it had become \"more left and less liberal\".[160]", "37271047": "William Ludlam (1717\u20131788) was an English clergyman and mathematician./nBorn at Leicester, he was elder son of the physician Richard Ludlam (1680\u20131728), who practised there; Thomas Ludlam, the clergyman, was his youngest brother. (His son was also called Thomas Ludlam, see below.) His mother was Anne, daughter of William Drury of Nottingham. His uncle, Sir George Ludlam, was Chamberlain of the city of London, and died in 1726. One of his sisters became stepmother of Joseph Cradock, and one of his first cousins, Isabella, daughter of John Ludlam, married Gerrard Andrewes, and was mother of Gerrard Andrewes the dean of Canterbury.[1]/nLudlam, after attending Leicester grammar school, became scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge, and was elected to a fellowship in 1744. He matriculated in 1734 and graduated B.A. 1738, M.A. 1742, and B.D. 1749. In 1749 he was instituted to the vicarage of Norton-by-Galby in Leicestershire, on the nomination of Bernard Whalley. From 1754 to 1757 he was junior dean of his college, and from 1767 to 1769 he was Linacre lecturer in physic.[1]/nIn 1760 Ludlam unsuccessfully contested the Lucasian chair of mathematics with Edward Waring.[1] This was despite the negative campaigning of William Samuel Powell, who attacked Waring's work.[2] In 1765 Ludlam was one of \"three gentlemen skilled in mechanics\" appointed to report to the Board of Longitude on the merits of John Harrison's watch; His report is given in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1765, pt. i. p.\u00a0412.

At first he lived with his brother Thomas in Wigston's Hospital, but in 1772 he married.  In 1773 he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.[3] He appears in the Life of Thomas Robinson (1749\u20131813) by Edward Thomas Vaughan, who was then vicar of St. Mary's, Leicester.[1]/nIn Memory of William Ludlam, B.D.many years fellow of St. John's college, Cambridge,(son of Richard Ludlam, M.

His Rudiments of Mathematics (1785) became a standard Cambridge text-book, passed through several editions, and was still in vogue in 1815[citation needed]. In Essay on Newton's Second Law of Motion (1780),[5] Ludlam suggested an explicit statement of the physical independence of forces. It was rejected by the Royal.[citation needed] It was noticed in the issue of the Monthly Review for November, 1780, Art. 32. p.\u00a0390[6] (the notice comes after the usual digest of the Royal's Philosophical Transactions) and reprinted as the third essay in the second edition of Mathematical Essays (1787).[7] Other publications were:/nLudlam contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine in 1772 (pt. i. p.\u00a0562) \"A Short Account of Church Organs.\" There are also some papers in the Royal's Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appear papers by him.[note 1]\nHe was also the author of Four Theological Essays on the Scripture Metaphors and other Subjects, 1787, and Two Essays on Justification and the Influence of the Holy Spirit, 1788.

If not for the hand of God, \"natural law\" would have allowed the Earth to remain in that form. Biancani believed, however, that God had created the depths of the sea and formed the mountains of the Earth./nMoreover, if left to \"natural law,\" the Earth would be consumed in water, in imitation of how it was created. However, the hand of God would intervene in order to cause the Earth to be destroyed entirely by fire./nThe contents of the book are described in Latin as: Sphaera Mundi seu Cosmographia.

Novum instrumentum ad horologia describenda./nAs evidenced in the table of contents, this work also presented a summary of the discoveries made with the telescope by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus, and others. The censorship of Biancani's previous work affected the manner in which he wrote Sphaera mundi. \"But that this opinion [heliocentrism] is false,\" Biancani wrote, during his discussion on Copernican and Keplerian theories, \"and should be rejected (even though it is established by better proofs and arguments) has nevertheless become much more certain in our day when it has been condemned by the authority of the Church as contrary to Sacred Scripture\" (Sphaera, IV, 37).[7]/nThe work not only included studies on the natural phenomenon of the echo and on sundials, but also included a diagram of the Moon. Giuseppe Biancani's map was not drawn up in support of new Copernican ideas but those berthed in traditional geocentric cosmology and in support of Aristotelian thought. Biancani disagreed with Galileo, who believed in the existence of lunar mountains. In a 1611 letter to Christoph Grienberger (after whom the Gruemberger crater is named), Biancani wrote of his certainty that there could not be any mountains on the Moon.[8]/nBiancani opined that the Copernican system was an opinionem falsam... ac rejeciendam.

He arrived in New York City in November 1938.[3]/nWith the onset of World War II in Europe, Kac was able to stay in America, while his parents and brother, who had remained in Kremenets, were murdered by the Germans in mass executions in August 1942.[3]/nFrom 1939 to 1961, Kac taught at Cornell University, first as an instructor, then from 1943 as an assistant professor and from 1947 as a full professor.[4] While there, he became a naturalized US citizen in 1943. From 1943 to 1945, he also worked in the MIT Radiation Laboratory, together with George Uhlenbeck.[3] During the 1951\u20131952 academic year, Kac was on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study.[5] In 1952, Kac, with Theodore H. Berlin, introduced the spherical model of a ferromagnet (a variant of the Ising model)[6] and, with J. C. Ward, found an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method.[7] In 1961, Kac left Cornell and went to The Rockefeller University in New York City.

The answer was negative, meaning two different resonators can have identical set of eigenfrequencies./nIn 1956, he introduced a simplified mathematical model known as the Kac ring, which features the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from completely time-symmetric microscopic laws. Using the model as an analogy to molecular motion, he provided an explanation for Loschmidt's paradox.[9]/nFor a number of years, Kac was the co-chair of the Committee of Concerned Scientists.[12] He was a co-author of a letter which publicized the case of the scientist Vladimir Samuilovich Kislik[13] and a letter which publicized the case of the applied mathematician Yosif Begun.[14]", "308764": "Arthur Norman Prior (4 December 1914 \u2013 6 October 1969), usually cited as A.\u00a0N. Prior, was a New Zealand\u2013born logician and philosopher. Prior (1957) founded tense logic, now also known as temporal logic, and made important contributions to intensional logic, particularly in Prior (1971)./nPrior was born in Masterton, New Zealand, on 4 December 1914, the only child of Australian-born parents: Norman Henry Prior (1882\u20131967) and his wife born Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague (1889\u20131914). His mother died less than three weeks after his birth and he was cared for by his father's sister. His father, a medical practitioner in general practice, after war service at Gallipoli and in France\u2014where he was awarded the Military Cross\u2014remarried in 1920. There were three more children: Elaine, the epidemiologist Ian Prior, and Owen. Arthur Prior grew up in a prominent Methodist household. His two Wesleyan grandfathers, the Reverends Samuel Fowler Prior and Hugh Henwood Teague, were sent from England to South Australia as missionaries in 1875.[7] The Prior family first moved to New Zealand in 1893./nAs the son of a doctor, Prior at first considered becoming a biologist, but ended up focusing on theology and philosophy, graduating from the University of Otago in 1935 with a B.A. in philosophy. While studying for his B.A., Prior attended the seminary at Dunedin's Knox Theological Hall but decided against entering the Presbyterian ministry. John Findlay, Professor of Philosophy at Otago, first opened up the study of logic for Prior.[8] In 1936, Prior married Clare Hunter, a freelance journalist, and they spent several years in Europe, during which they tried to earn a living as writers. Daunted by the prospect of an invasion of Britain, he and Clare returned to New Zealand in 1940.[1]\nAt this point in his life he was a devout Presbyterian, though he became an atheist later in life.[9][10]/nAfter divorce from his first wife, he remarried in 1943 to Mary Wilkinson, with whom he would have two children. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force from 1943 to 1945 before embarking on an academic career at Canterbury University College in February 1946.\nHis first position was a lectureship which had become available when Karl Popper left the university.[11]/nAfter returning to New Zealand following a year at Oxford as a visiting lecturer he took up a professorship in 1959 at Manchester University where he remained until he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford in 1966 and appointed a Reader. He continued his Manchester practice of accepting visiting professorships.[11]/nArthur Prior went to give lectures at Norwegian universities in September 1969 and on 6 October 1969, the night before he was to deliver a lecture there, he died from a heart attack at Trondheim, Norway.[11]/nPrior was educated entirely in New Zealand, where he was fortunate to have come under the influence of J.\u00a0N. Findlay,[1] under whom he wrote his M.A. thesis on 'The Nature of Logic'.[12] While Prior was very fond of the theology of Karl Barth, his early criticism of Barth's adherence to Philosophical Idealism, is a mark of Findlay's influence on Prior.[12]/nHe began teaching philosophy and logic at Canterbury University College in February 1946, filling the vacancy created by Karl Popper's resignation. In 1951 Prior met J.\u00a0J.\u00a0C. Smart, also known as \"Jack\" Smart, at a philosophical conference in Australia and the two developed a life-long friendship. Their correspondence was influential on Prior's development of tense logic. Smart adhered to the tenseless theory of time and was never persuaded by Prior's arguments, though Prior was influential in making Smart skeptical about Wittgenstein's view on pseudo-relations.[13] He became Professor in 1953. Thanks to the good offices of Gilbert Ryle, who had met Prior in New Zealand in 1954, Prior spent the year 1956 on leave at the University of Oxford, where he gave the John Locke lectures in philosophy. These were subsequently published as Time and Modality (1957). This is a seminal contribution to the study of tense logic and the metaphysics of time, in which Prior championed the A-theorist view that the temporal modalities of past, present and future are basic ontological categories of fundamental importance for our understanding of time and the world. Prior was several times warned by J.\u00a0J.\u00a0C. Smart against making tense-logic the topic of his John Locke lectures. Smart feared that tense-logic would get Prior \"involved in side issues, even straight philosophy, and not in the stuff that will do Oxford most good.\"[14] Prior was however convinced that tense-logic had the potential to benefit logic, as well as philosophy, and thus he considered his lectures an \"expression of a conviction that formal logic and general philosophy have more to bring to one another than is sometimes supposed\".[15]/nDuring his time at Oxford, Prior met Peter Geach and William Kneale, influenced John Lemmon, and corresponded with the adolescent Saul Kripke. Logic in the United Kingdom was then in a rather low state, being \"deeply out of fashion and its practitioners were isolated and somewhat demoralized.\"[16]  Prior arranged Logical a Colloquium which brought together such Logicians as John Lemmon, Peter Geach, Czes\u0142aw Lejewski and more.[17] The colloquiums were a great success and, together with Prior's John Locke lecture and his visits around the country, he helped revitalize British logic.[17] From 1959 to 1966, he was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, having taught Osmund Lewry. From 1966 until his death he was Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford. His students include Max Cresswell, Kit Fine, and Robert Bull./nAlmost entirely self-taught in modern formal logic, Prior published four major papers on logic in 1952,[18] when he was 38 years of age, shortly after discovering the work of J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski and Jan \u0141ukasiewicz,[19] despite very little of \u0141ukasiewicz's work being translated into English.[20][21] He went so far as to read untranslated Polish texts without being able to speak Polish claiming \"the symbols are so illuminating that the fact that the text is incomprehensible doesn\u2019t much matter\".[20] He went on to employ Polish notation throughout his career.[22] Prior (1955) distills much of his early teaching of logic in New Zealand. Prior's work on tense logic provides a systematic and extended defense of a tensed conception of reality in which propositional statements can change truth value over time.[23]/nPrior stood out by virtue of his strong interest in the history of logic. He was one of the first English-speaking logicians to appreciate the nature and scope of the logical work of Charles Sanders Peirce, and the distinction between de dicto and de re in modal logic. Prior taught and researched modal logic before Kripke proposed his possible worlds semantics for it, at a time when modality and intensionality commanded little interest in the English speaking world, and had even come under sharp attack by Willard Van Orman Quine./nHe is now said to be the precursor of hybrid logic.[24] Undertaking (in one section of his book Past, Present, and Future (1967)) the attempt to combine binary (e.g., \"until\") and unary (e.g., \"will always be\") temporal operators to one system of temporal logic, Prior\u2014as an incidental result\u2014builds a base for later hybrid languages./nHis work Time and Modality explored the use of a many-valued logic to explain the problem of non-referring names./nPrior's work was both philosophical and formal and provides a productive synergy between formal innovation and linguistic analysis.[citation needed] Natural language, he remarked, can embody folly and confusion as well as the wisdom of our ancestors. He was scrupulous in setting out the views of his adversaries, and provided many constructive suggestions about the formal development of alternative views./nThe following books were either written by Prior, or are posthumous collections of journal articles and unpublished papers that he wrote:/nThe nearest thing to a biography of Prior is:/nAn excellent survey of Prior's life and achievement is:/nOngoing research on the importance of Prior's philosophy and logic:", "3782172": "Bernard Lamy (15 June 1640 \u2013 29 January 1715) was a French Oratorian, mathematician and theologian./nLamy was born in Le Mans, France.

As a child, he witnessed the murder of his uncle in a pogrom. In 1894, the family followed Akiva to the East End of London, to where he had migrated a year earlier. Brodetsky attended the Jews' Free School, where he excelled at his studies. He was awarded a scholarship, which enabled him to attend the Central Foundation Boys' School of London[2] and subsequently, in 1905, Trinity College, Cambridge./nIn 1908, he completed his studies with highest honours being Senior Wrangler, to the distress of the conservative press, which was forced to recognise that a son of immigrants surpassed all the local students.

He passed the next two years in Padua and spent 1606\u201307 studying in Piacenza before completing three years (1607\u201310) of study in philosophy at Parma.  He spent another four years (1612\u20131616) studying theology in Parma and another year\u2019s apprenticeship at Mantua. He then taught theology and mathematics in Parma, then in 1622 he became a preacher. For a time he received patronage of the Dukes of Mantua and the Este in Ferrara. During this time he was involved in hydraulics projects. He would later return to teach mathematics again in Genoa, the city where he would die in 1650./nHe is noted for his contributions to physics experiments and observations. He observed the experiments of Giovanni Battista Baliani regarding falling objects, and he wrote about these experiments noting that two different objects fall in the same amount of time regardless of the medium. He also performed experiments with pendulums and observed that an electrically charged body can attract non-electrified objects. He also noted that two charged objects repelled each other./nHis observations were published in the works, Philosophia magnetica (1629) and In quatuor libros meteorologicorum Aristotelis commentaria (1646). The first of these works examined the cause of the Earth's magnetism and was devoted to a study of the work of William Gilbert. Cabeo thought the Earth immobile, and so did not accept its motion as the cause of the magnetic field. Cabeo described electrical attraction in terms of electrical effluvia, released by rubbing certain materials together. These effluvia pushed into the surrounding air displacing it. When the air returned to its original location, it carried light bodies along with it making them move towards the attractive material. Both Accademia del Cimento and Robert Boyle performed experiments with vacuums in attempts to confirm or refute Cabeo's ideas./nCabeo's second publication was a commentary on Aristotle's Meteorology. In this work, he carefully examined a number of ideas proposed by Galileo Galilei, including the motion of the earth and the law of falling bodies. Cabeo was opposed to Galileo's theories. Cabeo also discussed the theory of water flow proposed by Galileo's student, Benedetto Castelli. He and Castelli were involved over a dispute in northern Italy about the rerouting of the Reno River. The people of Ferrara were on one side of the dispute and Cabeo was their advocate. Castelli favored the other side of the dispute and was acting as an agent of the Pope, Urban VIII. Cabeo also discussed some ideas about alchemy in this book./nThe crater Cabeus on the Moon is named after him.

In 1641 he published his first book, a volume of epigrams.[1]/nUrquhart's father died in 1642, leaving behind a large estate encumbered by larger debts. As the eldest son, Urquhart was from that time on harassed by creditors. He left for the Continent in order to economize, but returned in 1645 and published Trissotetras, a mathematical treatise.[1]/nIn 1648, Urquhart participated in the Royalist uprising at Inverness. He was declared a traitor by Parliament, though he doesn't seem to have suffered any other consequences. Two years later he marched with Charles II and fought in the Battle of Worcester. The Royalist forces were decisively defeated and Urquhart was taken prisoner. He lost all his manuscripts, which he had brought with him for safekeeping, and he had to forfeit all his property. He was held first at the Tower of London and later at Windsor, but he was given considerable freedom by his captors. The following year he published Pantochronachanon, a work of genealogy, and The Jewel, a defense of Scotland. In 1652, he was paroled by Cromwell and returned to Cromarty. Soon after he published Logopandecteision, his plan for a universal language, and his most celebrated work, his translation of Rabelais.[1]/nUrquhart returned to the Continent some time after 1653, perhaps as a condition of his release by Cromwell.[1] Little is known of his life after this time.

Green was the first person to create a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and others. His work on potential theory ran parallel to that of Carl Friedrich Gauss./nGreen's life story is remarkable in that he was almost entirely self-taught. He received only about one year of formal schooling as a child, between the ages of 8 and 9./nGreen was born and lived for most of his life in the English town of Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, now part of the city of Nottingham. His father, also named George, was a baker who had built and owned a brick windmill used to grind grain.[1]/nIn his youth, Green was described as having a frail constitution and a dislike for doing work in his father's bakery. He had no choice in the matter, however, and as was common for the time he likely began working daily to earn his living at the age of five./nDuring this era it was common for only 25\u201350% of children in Nottingham to receive any schooling.[citation needed] The majority of schools were Sunday schools, run by the Church, and children would typically attend for one or two years only.\nRecognizing the young Green's above average intellect, and being in a strong financial situation due to his successful bakery, his father enrolled him in March 1801 at Robert Goodacre's Academy in Upper Parliament Street. Robert Goodacre was a well-known science populariser and educator of the time. He published Essay on the Education of Youth, in which he wrote that he did not \"study the interest of the boy but the embryo Man\". To a non-specialist, he would have seemed deeply knowledgeable in science and mathematics, but a close inspection of his essay and curriculum revealed that the extent of his mathematical teachings was limited to algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. Thus, Green's later mathematical contributions, which exhibited knowledge of very modern developments in mathematics, could not have resulted from his tenure at the Robert Goodacre Academy. He stayed for only four terms (one school year), and it was speculated by his contemporaries that he had exhausted all they had to teach him./nIn 1773 George's father moved to Nottingham, which at the time had a reputation for being a pleasant town with open spaces and wide roads. By 1831, however, the population had increased nearly five times, in part due to the budding industrial revolution, and the city became known as one of the worst slums in England. There were frequent riots by starving workers, often associated with special hostility towards bakers and millers on the suspicion that they were hiding grain to drive up food prices./nFor these reasons, in 1807, George Green senior bought a plot of land in Sneinton. On this plot of land he built a \"brick wind corn mill\", now referred to as Green's Windmill. It was technologically impressive for its time, but required nearly twenty-four-hour maintenance, which was to become Green's burden for the next twenty years./nJust as with baking, Green found the responsibilities of operating the mill annoying and tedious. Grain from the fields was arriving continuously at the mill's doorstep, and the sails of the windmill had to be constantly adjusted to the windspeed, both to prevent damage in high winds, and to maximise rotational speed in low winds. The millstones that would continuously grind against each other, could wear down or cause a fire if they ran out of grain to grind. Every month the stones, which weighed over a ton, would have to be replaced or repaired./nIn 1823 Green formed a relationship with Jane Smith, the daughter of William Smith, hired by Green Senior as mill manager. Although Green and Jane Smith never married, Jane eventually became known as Jane Green and the couple had seven children together; all but the first had Green as a baptismal name. The youngest child was born 13 months before Green's death. Green provided for his common-law wife and children in his will.[4]/nWhen Green was thirty, he became a member of the Nottingham Subscription Library. This library exists today, and was likely the main source of Green's advanced mathematical knowledge. Unlike more conventional libraries, the subscription library was exclusive to a hundred or so subscribers, and the first on the list of subscribers was the Duke of Newcastle. This library catered to requests for specialised books and journals that satisfied the particular interests of their subscribers./nIn 1828, Green published An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism, which is the essay he is most famous for today. It was published privately at the author's expense, because he thought it would be presumptuous for a person like himself, with no formal education in mathematics, to submit the paper to an established journal. When Green published his Essay, it was sold on a subscription basis to 51 people, most of whom were friends who probably could not understand it./nThe wealthy landowner and mathematician Sir Edward Bromhead bought a copy and encouraged Green to do further work in mathematics. Not believing the offer was sincere, Green did not contact Bromhead for two years./nBy the time Green's father died in 1829, the senior Green had become one of the gentry due to his considerable accumulated wealth and land owned, roughly half of which he left to his son and the other half to his daughter. The young Green, now thirty-six years old, consequently was able to use this wealth to abandon his miller duties and pursue mathematical studies./nMembers of the Nottingham Subscription Library who knew Green repeatedly insisted that he obtain a proper University education. In particular, one of the library's most prestigious subscribers was Sir Edward Bromhead, with whom Green shared many correspondences; he insisted that Green go to Cambridge./nIn 1832, aged nearly forty, Green was admitted as an undergraduate at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.[5] He was particularly insecure about his lack of knowledge of Greek and Latin, which were prerequisites, but it turned out not to be as hard for him to learn these as he had envisaged, as the degree of mastery required was not as high as he had expected. In the mathematics examinations, he won the first-year mathematical prize. He graduated with a BA in 1838 as a 4th Wrangler (the 4th highest scoring student in his graduating class, coming after James Joseph Sylvester who scored 2nd).[5]/nFollowing his graduation, Green was elected a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Even without his stellar academic standing, the Society had already read and made note of his Essay and three other publications, so Green was welcomed./nThe next two years provided an unparalleled opportunity for Green to read, write, and discuss his scientific ideas. In this short time he published an additional six publications with applications to hydrodynamics, sound, and optics./nIn his final years at Cambridge, Green became rather ill, and in 1840 he returned to Sneinton, only to die a year later. There are rumours that at Cambridge, Green had \"succumbed to alcohol\", and some of his earlier supporters, such as Sir Edward Bromhead, tried to distance themselves from him./nGreen's work was not well known in the mathematical community during his lifetime. Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton Robert Murphy (1806\u20131843) in his 1833 work.[6] In 1845, four years after Green's death, Green's work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as Lord Kelvin, who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book \"George Green\" by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy's citation of Green's 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green's 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green's 1828 work from William Hopkins in 1845./nIn 1871 N. M. Ferrers assembled The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green for publication.[7]/nGreen's work on the motion of waves in a canal (resulting in what is known as Green's law) anticipates the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics, while his research on light-waves and the properties of the Aether produced what is now known as the Cauchy-Green tensor. Green's theorem and functions were important tools in classical mechanics, and were revised by Schwinger's 1948 work on electrodynamics that led to his 1965 Nobel prize (shared with Feynman and Tomonaga). Green's functions later also proved useful in analysing superconductivity. On a visit to Nottingham in 1930, Albert Einstein commented that Green had been 20 years ahead of his time. The theoretical physicist Julian Schwinger, who used Green's functions in his ground-breaking works, published a tribute entitled \"The Greening of Quantum Field Theory: George and I\" in 1993.[8]/nThe George Green Library at the University of Nottingham is named after him, and houses the majority of the university's science and engineering Collection. The George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research, a research group in the University of Nottingham engineering department, is also named after him.[9] In 1986, Green's Windmill was restored to working order. It now serves both as a working example of a 19th-century windmill and as a museum and science centre dedicated to Green./nWestminster Abbey has a memorial stone for Green in the nave adjoining the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin.[10]/nHis work and influence on 19th-century applied physics had been largely forgotten until the publication of his biography by Mary Cannell in 1993./nRecent historical research[11] suggests that the pivotal figure in Green's mathematical education was John Toplis (c1774-1857), who graduated in mathematics from Cambridge as 11th Wrangler before becoming headmaster of the forerunner of Nottingham High School 1806\u20131819, and lived in the same neighbourhood as Green and his family. Toplis was an advocate of the continental school of mathematics, and fluent in French, having translated Laplace's celebrated work on celestial mechanics. \nThe possibility that Toplis played a role in Green's mathematical education would resolve several long-standing questions about the sources of Green's mathematical knowledge. For example, Green made use of \"the Mathematical Analysis\", a form of calculus derived from Leibniz which was virtually unheard of, or even actively discouraged, in England at the time (due to Leibniz being a contemporary of Newton, who had his own methods that were championed in England). This form of calculus, and the developments of mathematicians such as the French mathematicians Laplace, Lacroix and Poisson, were not taught even at Cambridge, let alone Nottingham, and yet Green not only had heard of these developments, but improved upon them.[12]", "68040337": "Aline Huke Frink (March 2, 1904 \u2013 March 14, 2000) was an American mathematician, and a professor on the faculty of the Pennsylvania State University from 1930 to 1969./nAline Huke was born in Torrington, Connecticut[1] and raised in Massachusetts, the daughter of Allen Johnson Huke and Mary Evelyn Feustel Huke.

He was a scientist and philosopher affiliated with the Pythagorean school and famous for being the reputed founder of mathematical mechanics and a friend of Plato.[4]/nAs a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that arithmetic (logistic), rather than geometry, provided the basis for satisfactory proofs,[5] and developed the most famous argument for the infinity of the universe in antiquity.[6]/nArchytas was born in Tarentum, a Greek city that was part of Magna Graecia, and was the son of Hestiaeus. He was presumably taught by Philolaus, and taught mathematics to Eudoxus of Cnidus and to Eudoxus' student, Menaechmus.[6]/nPolitically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to Pericles in Athens a half-century earlier.[7] The Tarentines elected him strategos (\"general\") seven years in a row, a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. Archytas was allegedly undefeated as a general in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors.[8]/nIn his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. The Seventh Letter, traditionally attributed to Plato, asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with Dionysius II of Syracuse.[9] Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato's philosopher king, and that he influenced Plato's political philosophy as expressed in The Republic and other works.[6]/nArchytas is said to be the first ancient Greek to have spoken of the sciences of arithmetic (logistic), geometry, astronomy, and harmonics as kin, which later became the medieval quadrivium.[10][11] He is thought to have written a number of works in the sciences but only four genuine fragments are extant.[12]/nAccording to Eutocius, Archytas was the first to solve the problem of doubling the cube (the so-called Delian problem) with an ingenious geometric construction.[13][14] Hippocrates of Chios before had reduced this problem to the finding of two mean proportionals, equivalent to the extraction of cube roots. Archytas' demonstration uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes and was, according to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the first in which mechanical motions entered geometry.[15] The topic of proportions, which Archytas seems to have worked on extensively, is treated in book VIII of Euclid's Elements, where the construction for two proportional means can also be found./nArchytas named the harmonic mean, important much later in projective geometry and number theory, though he did not discover it.[16] He proved that ratios of the form (n + 1): n cannot be divided by a mean proportional, an important result in ancient harmonics.[6] Ptolemy considered Archytas the most sophisticated Pythagorean music theorist, and scholars believe Archytas gave a mathematical account of the musical scales used by practicing musicians of his day.[17]/nLater tradition regarded Archytas as the founder of mathematical mechanics.[18] Vitruvius includes him in a list of twelve authors who wrote works on mechanics.[19] Thomas Nelson Winter presents evidence that the pseudo-Aristotelian Mechanical Problems might have been authored by Archytas and later misattributed.[20] As described in the writings of Aulus Gellius five centuries after him, Archytas was reputed to have designed and built some kind of bird-shaped, self-propelled flying device known as the pigeon, said to have flown some 200 meters.[21][22]", "56473258": "Karen Saxe is an American mathematician who specializes in functional analysis,[1] and in the mathematical study of issues related to social justice.[2] She is DeWitt Wallace Professor of Mathematics, Emerita at Macalester College,[2][3].

He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics.[3] His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the airplane wing.[4][5]/nDaniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, in the Netherlands, into a family of distinguished mathematicians.[6] \nThe Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp, at that time in the Spanish Netherlands, but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Protestants. After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland./nDaniel was the son of Johann Bernoulli (one of the early developers of calculus) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli (an early researcher in probability theory and the discoverer of the mathematical constant e).[6] He had two brothers, Niklaus and Johann II. Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as \"by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis\".[7] He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father. Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris, Johann, unable to bear the \"shame\" of being compared  Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house. Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica. Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death.[8]/nAround schooling age, his father, Johann Bernoulli, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician. However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics. He later gave in to his father's wish and studied business. His father then asked him to study in medicine, and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time.[8]  Daniel studied medicine at Basel, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721.[9]/nHe was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler.[10] He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics, but was very unhappy there. A temporary illness[8] together with the censorship by the Russian Orthodox Church[11] and disagreements over his salary gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg in 1733.[12] He returned to the University of Basel, where he successively held the chairs of medicine, metaphysics, and natural philosophy until his death.[13]/nIn May, 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[14]/nHis earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes (Mathematical Exercises), published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach.  Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation.  His chief work is Hydrodynamica, published in 1738. It resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange's M\u00e9canique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle, namely, conservation of energy.  This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides, to which, conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin, a prize was awarded by the French Academy: these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre-Simon Laplace.  Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions, especially on problems connected with vibrating strings, and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert.[7]/nTogether Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids. In particular, they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure. To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe.[15]/nSoon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries. It was not until about 170 years later, in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today. However, Bernoulli's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane; that is its air speed./nTaking his discoveries further, Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy. It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height. Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its specific kinetic energy for pressure, the former being the kinetic energy per unit volume. Mathematically this law is now written:/nwhere P is pressure, \u03c1 is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity./nIn his 1738 book Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis (Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk),[16] Bernoulli offered a solution to the St. Petersburg paradox as the basis of the economic theory of risk aversion, risk premium, and utility.[17]  Bernoulli often noticed that when making decisions that involved some uncertainty, people did not always try to maximize their possible monetary gain, but rather tried to maximize \"utility\", an economic term encompassing their personal satisfaction and benefit. Bernoulli realized that for humans, there is a direct relationship between money gained and utility, but that it diminishes as the money gained increases.  For example, to a person whose income is $10,000 per year, an additional $100 in income will provide more utility than it would to a person whose income is $50,000 per year.[18]/nOne of the earliest attempts to analyze a statistical problem involving censored data was Bernoulli's 1766 analysis of smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of inoculation.[19]/nIn Hydrodynamica (1738) he laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases, and applied the idea to explain Boyle's law.[7]/nHe worked with Euler on elasticity and the development of the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation.[20] Bernoulli's principle is of critical use in aerodynamics.[13]/nAccording to L\u00e9on Brillouin, the principle of superposition was first stated by Daniel Bernoulli in 1753: \"The general motion of a vibrating system is given by a superposition of its proper vibrations.\"[21]/nIn 2002, Bernoulli was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.[22]", "49067714": "R\u016bsi\u0146\u0161 M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Freivalds (10 November 1942 \u2013 4 January 2016) was a Latvian computer scientist and mathematician.

He was a pioneer of mathematical and theoretical biology, travelled on expeditions to the Bering Strait and held the position of Professor of Natural History at University College, Dundee for 32 years, then at St Andrews for 31 years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, was knighted, and received the Darwin Medal and the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal./nThompson is remembered as the author of the 1917 book On Growth and Form, which led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals./nThompson's description of the mathematical beauty of nature, and the mathematical basis of the forms of animals and plants, stimulated thinkers as diverse as Julian Huxley, C. H. Waddington, Alan Turing, Ren\u00e9 Thom, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Eduardo Paolozzi, Le Corbusier, Christopher Alexander and Mies van der Rohe./nThompson was born at 3 Brandon Street[1] in Edinburgh to Fanny Gamgee (sister of Sampson Gamgee) and D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1829\u20131902), Classics Master at Edinburgh Academy and later Professor of Greek at Queen's College, Galway.[2] His mother, Fanny Gamgee (1840\u20131860), died 9 days after his birth[3] as a result of complications[4] and he was brought up by his maternal grandfather Joseph Gamgee (1801\u20131895),[5] a veterinary surgeon.[4] He lived with his grandfather and uncle, John Gamgee, at 12 Castle Terrace, facing north onto Edinburgh Castle.[6]/nFrom 1870 to 1877 he attended The Edinburgh Academy and won the 1st Edinburgh Academical Club Prize in 1877.[7] In 1878, he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Two years later, he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge to study zoology.[8] As a student at Cambridge, D'Arcy Thompson was first a sizar, and then received a scholarship.[4] To earn money to support his education he translated Hermann M\u00fcller's work on the fertilisation of flowers,[9] because the topic appealed to him. His translation was published in 1883, and included an introduction by Charles Darwin. He speculated later, that if he had chosen to translate Wilhelm Olbers Focke's hybridisation of flowers, he \"might have anticipated the discovery of Mendel by twenty years\".[5] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science in 1883.[2]/nFrom 1883 to 1884, Thompson stayed in Cambridge as a Junior Demonstrator in physiology, teaching students.[2] In 1884, he was appointed Professor of Biology (later Natural History) at University College, Dundee, a post he held for 32 years.[10] One of his first tasks was to create a Zoology Museum for teaching and research, now named after him.[11]/nIn 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Patrick Geddes, Frank W. Young, William Evans Hoyle and Daniel John Cunningham. He served as vice president to the Society from 1916 to 1919 and as president from 1934 to 1939.[12]/nIn 1896 and 1897, he went on expeditions to the Bering Straits, representing the British Government in an international inquiry into the fur seal industry to assess the fur seal's declining numbers. \"Thompson's diplomacy avoided an international incident\" between Russia and the United States which both had hunting interests in this area.[13]/nHis final report for the government drew attention also to the near extinction of the sea otter and whale populations. He became one of the first to press for conservation agreements, and his recommendations contributed to the issuing of species protection orders. He subsequently was appointed Scientific Adviser to the Fisheries Board of Scotland and later, representative to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.[13]/nHe took the opportunity to collect many valuable specimens for his museum, one of the largest in the country at the time, specialising in Arctic zoology, through his links to the Dundee whalers. The D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum still has (in 2012) the Japanese spider crab that he collected,[14] and the rare skeleton of a Steller's Sea Cow.[15]/nWhilst in Dundee, Thompson sat on the committee of management of the Dundee Private Hospital for Women.[17] He was a founder member of the Dundee Social Union and pressed for it \"to buy four slum properties in the town\", which they renovated so that \"the poorest families of Dundee could live there.\"[4]  He encouraged and supported the social reformer Mary Lily Walker in her work with the social union.[18][page\u00a0needed]/nIn 1917, aged 57, Thompson was appointed to the Chair of Natural History at the University of St Andrews, where he remained for the last 31 years of his life.[2] In 1918 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Fish of the Sea.[19] The German British mathematician Walter Ledermann described in his memoir how, as an assistant in Mathematics, he met the biology Professor Thompson at St Andrews in the mid 1930s and how Thompson \"was fond of exercising his skills as an amateur of mathematics\", that \"he used quite sophisticated mathematical methods to elucidate the shapes that occur in the living world\" and \"[...] differential equations, a subject which evidently lay outside d'Arcy Thompson's fields of knowledge at that time.\" Ledermann wrote how on one occasion he helped him, working and writing out the answer to his question.[20]/nIn Country Life magazine in October 1923, he wrote:/n\"This is but a little town, and our lives are somewhat narrow who dwell therein; but its traditions are not lost, nor the lessons of its long history thrown away.... the stones cry out to us as we pass.... only last week I went down to the little ancient church of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre in Paris, and passed through it to stand for a moment (as I often do) in the deserted garden whence one looks across the river and gets the finest view of all of Notre Dame.... here have been civilization, religion and learning for a few short centuries longer than in St Andrews.... yet these two spots have a like influence on my mind and rejoice my heart with a train of shadowy memories.\"/nOn 4 July 1901 Thompson married Maureen, elder daughter of William Drury, of Dublin.[2] His wife and three daughters survived him.[8]/nHe died at his home in St Andrews after flying home from India in 1948, at the age of 87, having attended the Science Congress at Delhi, and staying in India for some months. Upon returning, \"he suffered a breakdown in health, from which he never fully recovered.\"[8] He is buried with his maternal grandparents, the Gamgees, and half-sisters in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh./nIn 1910, Thompson published his translation of Aristotle's History of Animals. He had worked on the enormous task intermittently for many years. It was not the first translation of the book into English, but the earlier attempts by Thomas Taylor (1809) and Richard Cresswell (1862) were inaccurate, and criticised at the time as showing \"not only an inadequate knowledge of Greek, but an extremely imperfect acquaintance with zoology\".[22] Thompson's version benefited from his excellent Greek, his expertise in zoology, his \"full\" knowledge of Aristotle's biology, and his command of the English language, resulting in a fine translation, \"correct, free and .. idiomatic\".[22] More recently, the evolutionary biologist Armand Leroi admired Thompson's translation:[23]/nIn Thompson's hands, Aristotle's worried prose acquires a subdued grandeur. 'All viviparous quadrupeds, then, are furnished with an oesophagus and a windpipe, situated as in man; the same statement is applicable to oviparous quadrupeds and birds, only that the latter present diversities in the shapes of these organs.'[23]/nThompson's most famous work, On Growth and Form, led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals. It was written in Dundee, mostly in 1915, though wartime shortages and his many last-minute alterations delayed publication until 1917.[24][25] The central theme of the book is that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. \nHe had previously criticized Darwinism in his paper Some Difficulties of Darwinism in an 1884 meeting for the British Association for the Advancement of Science.[26] On Growth and Form explained in detail why he believed Darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form.[27] Instead, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with a hint that vitalism was the unseen driving force.[28]/nOn the concept of allometry, the study of the relationship of body size and shape, Thompson wrote:[29]/nAn organism is so complex a thing, and growth so complex a phenomenon, that for growth to be so uniform and constant in all the parts as to keep the whole shape unchanged would indeed be an unlikely and an unusual circumstance. Rates vary, proportions change, and the whole configuration alters accordingly./nUsing a mass of examples, Thompson pointed out correlations between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described phyllotaxis (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) and its relationship to the Fibonacci sequence.[30]/nPerhaps the most famous part of the work is chapter XVII, \"The Comparison of Related Forms,\" where Thompson explored the degree to which differences in the forms of related animals could be described by means of relatively simple mathematical transformations.[31]/nThe book is a work in the \"descriptive\" tradition; Thompson did not articulate his insights in the form of experimental hypotheses that can be tested. He was aware of this, saying that \"This book of mine has little need of preface, for indeed it is 'all preface' from beginning to end.\"[32]/nElected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1916,[33] elected an International honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928,[34] knighted in 1937 and received the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society in 1938.[2] In 1941, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[35] \nHe was awarded the Darwin Medal in 1946.[36]\nFor his revised On Growth and Form, he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1942.[37] He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1885, and was active in the Society over many years,\nserving as president from 1934 to 1939.[38]/nOn Growth and Form has inspired thinkers including the biologists Julian Huxley, Conrad Hal Waddington and Stephen Jay Gould, the mathematicians Alan Turing and Ren\u00e9 Thom,[39] the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and artists including Richard Hamilton,[40][41] Eduardo Paolozzi,[40] and Ben Nicholson with his ideas on the mathematical basis of the forms of animals, and perhaps especially on morphogenesis.[40] Jackson Pollock owned a copy.[42] Waddington and other developmental biologists were struck particularly by the chapter on Thompson's \"Theory of Transformations\", where he showed that the various shapes of related species (such as of fish) could be presented as geometric transformations, anticipating the evolutionary developmental biology of a century later.[43]\nThe book led Turing to write a famous paper \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" on how patterns such as those seen on the skins of animals can emerge from a simple chemical system.[44]\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss cites Thompson in his 1963 book Structural Anthropology.[45]/nOn Growth and Form is seen as a classic text in architecture and is admired by architects \"for its exploration of natural geometries in the dynamics of growth and physical processes.\"[46] The architects and designers Le Corbusier, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and Mies van der Rohe were inspired by the book.[42] Peter Medawar, the 1960 Nobel Laureate in Medicine, called it \"the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue\".[47]/nIn 2010, the 150th anniversary of his birth was celebrated with events and exhibitions at the Universities of Dundee and St Andrews; the main lecture theatre in the University of Dundee's Tower Building was renamed in his honour, a publication exploring his work in Dundee and the history of his Zoology Museum was published by University of Dundee Museum Services, and an exhibition on his work was held in the city.[48]/nThe original Zoology Museum at Dundee became neglected after his move to St Andrews. In 1956 the building, which it was housed in, was scheduled for demolition and the museum collection was dispersed, with some parts going to the British Museum. A teaching collection was retained and forms the core of the University of Dundee's current D'Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum.[49]\nIn 2011, the University of Dundee was awarded a \u00a3100,000 grant by The Art Fund to build a collection of art inspired by his ideas and collections, much of it displayed in the Museum.[49]/nSpecial Collections at the University of St Andrews hold Thompson's personal papers which include over 30,000 items.[50] Archive Services at the University of Dundee hold records of his time at Dundee, and a collection of papers relating to Thompson collected by Professor Alexander David Peacock, a later holder of the chair of Natural History at University College, Dundee.[51][52]/nIn 1892 D'Arcy Thompson donated Davis Straits specimens of crustaceans, pycnogonids, and other invertebrates to the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology.[53]/nD'Arcy Wentworth Thompson published around 300 articles and books during his career.[13]", "58701508": "Anne Marie Leggett (born May 28, 1947) is an American mathematical logician.

In 1946, Lagerstrom was recruited by Hans Liepmann to the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech.[5] He was later promoted to Professor of Aeronautics in 1952 and Professor of Applied Mathematics in 1967,[5] having departed only briefly to the University of Paris in 1960-1961 as visiting professor on a Guggenheim Fellowship.[1]/nHe died on February 16, 1989.[8]/nHis book \"Laminar flow theory\", initially published in 1964 in the Theory of Laminar flows, edited by F.K.Moore, is still considered as the standard textbook for fluid mechanics.", "22296309": "James Burton Serrin  (1 November 1926, Chicago, Illinois \u2013 23 August 2012, Minneapolis, Minnesota) was an American mathematician, and a professor at University of Minnesota.[1]/nHe received his doctorate from Indiana University in 1951 under the supervision of David Gilbarg.[2]  From 1954 till 1995 he was on the faculty of the University of Minnesota.[2][3][4]/nHe is known for his contributions to continuum mechanics, nonlinear analysis,[5] and partial differential equations.[6][7][8]/nHe was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1980.", "58472183": "Richard W. Cottle (29 June 1934) is an American mathematician. He was a professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, starting as an Acting Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering in 1966 and retiring in 2005. He is notable for his work on mathematical programming/optimization, \u201cNonlinear programs\u201d, the proposal of the linear complementarity problem, and the general field of operations research./nCottle was born in Chicago on 29 June 1934 to Charles and Rachel Cottle. He started his elementary education in the neighboring village of Oak Park, Illinois, and graduated from Oak Park-River Forest High School. After that, admitted to Harvard, Cottle began by studying government (political science) and taking premedical courses. After the first semester, he changed his major to mathematics in which he earned his bachelor's (cum laude) and master's degrees. Around 1958, he became interested in teaching secondary-level mathematics. He joined the Mathematics Department at the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he spent two years. Midway through the latter period, he married his wife, Suzanne.[1]/nWhile teaching at Middlesex School, he applied and was admitted to the PhD program in mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley, with the intention of focusing on geometry. Meanwhile, he also received an offer from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley as a part-time computer programmer. Through that work, some of which involved linear and quadratic programming, he became aware of the work of George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe. Soon thereafter he became a member of Dantzig's team at UC Berkeley Operations Research Center (ORC). There he had the opportunity to investigate quadratic and convex programming. This developed into his doctoral dissertation under the guidance of Dantzig and Edmund Eisenberg. Cottle's first research contribution, \"Symmetric Dual Quadratic Programs,\" was published in 1963. This was soon generalized in the joint paper \"Symmetric Dual Nonlinear Programs,\" co-authored with Dantzig and Eisenberg. This led to the consideration of what is called a \"composite problem,\" the first-order optimality conditions for symmetric dual programs. This in turn, was named \"the fundamental problem\" and still later (in a more general context) \"the complementarity problem.\" A special case of this, called \"the linear complementarity problem\",[4] is a major part of Cottle's research output. Also in 1963, he was a summer consultant at the RAND Corporation working under the supervision of Philip Wolfe. This resulted in the RAND Memo, RM-3858-PR, \"A Theorem of Fritz John in Mathematical Programming.\"/nIn 1964, upon completion of his doctorate at Berkeley, he worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey. In 1965, he was invited to visit Stanford's OR Program, and in 1966, he became an Acting Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering at Stanford. The next year he became an Assistant Professor in Stanford's new Department of Operations Research. He became an Associate Professor in 1969 and Full Professor in 1973. He chaired the department from 1990 to 1996. During 39 years on the active faculty at Stanford he had over 30 leadership roles in national and international conferences. He served on the editorial board of 8 scholarly journals, and was Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Mathematical Programming. He served as the associate chair of the Engineering-Economic Systems & Operations Research Department (EES & OR) after the merger of the two departments. In 2000, EES & OR merged again, this time with the Industrial Engineering & Engineering Management Department to form Management Science and Engineering (MS&E). During his sabbatical year at Harvard and MIT (1970-1971), he wrote \u201cManifestations of the Schur Complement\u2019\u2019, one of his most cited papers. In 1974, he started working on \u201cThe Linear Complementarity Problem,\u201d one his most noted publications. In the mid 1980s, two of his former students, Jong-Shi Pang and Richard E. Stone, joined him as co-authors of this book which was published in 1992. \u201cThe Linear Complementarity Problem\u201d won the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) in 1994. \u201cThe Linear Complementarity Problem\u201d was republished by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in the series \u201cClassics in Applied Mathematics series\u201d in 2009. During 1978\u20131979, he spent a sabbatical year at the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne. There he wrote the paper \u201cObservations on a Class of Nasty Linear Complementarity Problems\u2019\u2019 which relates the celebrated Klee-Minty result on the exponential time behavior of the simplex method of linear programming with the same sort of behavior in Lemke's algorithm for the LCP and hamiltonian paths on the n-cube with the binary Gray code representation of the integers from 0 to 2^n - 1. Also during this time he solved the problem of minimally triangulating the n-cube for n = 4 and worked with Mark Broadie to solve a restricted case for n = 5.  In 2006 he was appointed a fellow of INFORMS[5] and in 2018 received the Saul I. Gass Expository Writing Award./nCottle is best known for his extensive publications on the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). This work includes analytical studies, algorithms, and the interaction of matrix theory and linear inequality theory with the LCP. Much of this is an outgrowth of his doctoral dissertation supervised by George Dantzig, with whom he collaborated in some of his earliest papers. The leading example is \"Complementary pivot theory of mathematical programming,\" published in 1968./nThe standard form of the LCP is a mapping:/nf\n:\n\nR\n\nn\n\n\n\u2192\n\nR\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\u2423\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\nq\n+\nM\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f:R^{n}\\rightarrow R^{n}\\mathrm {\\textvisiblespace} f(x)=q+Mx}\n\n (1)/nGiven \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n, find a vector \n\n\n\nx\n\u2208\n\nR\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x\\in R^{n}}\n\n , such that \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}\\geq 0}\n\n, \n\n\n\n\nf\n\ni\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f_{i}(x)\\geq 0}\n\n and  \n\n\n\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n\nf\n\ni\n\n\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}f_{i}(x)=0}\n\n, for  \n\n\n\ni\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i=1,2,...,n}/nBecause the affine mapping f is specified by vector and matrix, the problem is ordinarily denoted LCP(q, M) or sometimes just (q, M).

This is the triangular case of Poncelet's closure theorem, which applies more generally to polygons of any number of sides and to conics other than circles. It is the first known mathematical publication on pairs of inscribed and circumscribed circles of polygons, and significantly predates Poncelet's own 1822 work in this area.[3]/nIn 1749, Chapple published the first known proof of the existence of the orthocentre of a triangle, the point where the three perpendiculars from the vertices to the sides meet.

Just like Augustin-Louis Cauchy before him, Liouville studied engineering at \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es after graduating from the Polytechnique, but opted instead for a career in mathematics. After some years as an assistant at various institutions including the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, he was appointed as professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1838. He obtained a chair in mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1850 and a chair in mechanics at the Facult\u00e9 des Sciences in 1857./nBesides his academic achievements, he was very talented in organisational matters. Liouville founded the Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es which retains its high reputation up to today, in order to promote other mathematicians' work. He was the first to read, and to recognize the importance of, the unpublished work of \u00c9variste Galois which appeared in his journal in 1846. Liouville was also involved in politics for some time, and he became a member of the Constituting Assembly in 1848. However, after his defeat in the legislative elections in 1849, he turned away from politics./nLiouville worked in a number of different fields in mathematics, including number theory, complex analysis, differential geometry and topology, but also mathematical physics and even astronomy. He is remembered particularly for Liouville's theorem. In number theory, he was the first to prove the existence of transcendental numbers by a construction using continued fractions (Liouville numbers).[5] In mathematical physics, Liouville made two fundamental contributions: the Sturm\u2013Liouville theory, which was joint work with Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm, and is now a standard procedure to solve certain types of integral equations by developing into eigenfunctions, and the fact (also known as Liouville's theorem) that time evolution is measure preserving for a Hamiltonian system. In Hamiltonian dynamics, Liouville also introduced the notion of action-angle variables as a description of completely integrable systems. The modern formulation of this is sometimes called the Liouville\u2013Arnold theorem, and the underlying concept of integrability is referred to as Liouville integrability. Additionally, Liouville developed the Riemann-Liouville integral to consider differentiation and integration of a fractional order./nIn 1851, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

This was due to a \"misinterpretation\" of one of Bachelier's papers by Professor Paul L\u00e9vy, who\u2014to Bachelier's understandable fury\u2014knew nothing of Bachelier's work, nor of the candidate that L\u00e9vy recommended above him. L\u00e9vy later learned of his error, and reconciled himself with Bachelier.[5]/nAlthough Bachelier's work on random walks predated Einstein's celebrated study of Brownian motion by five years, the pioneering nature of his work was recognized only after several decades, first by Andrey Kolmogorov who pointed out his work to Paul L\u00e9vy, then by Leonard Jimmie Savage who translated Bachelier's thesis into English and brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. The arguments Bachelier used in his thesis also predate Eugene Fama's efficient-market hypothesis, which is very closely related, as the idea of a random walk is suited to predict the random future in a stock market where everyone has all the available information.

He is best remembered for his association with the poet Charles Wolfe and as the subject of a ghost story related in True Irish Ghost Stories and Memorials to the Dead./nBorn at Templerany House, County Wicklow, he was the eldest son of Ralph Meredith (1748\u20131799), Attorney Exchequer and Justice of the Peace for County Dublin; and his wife Martha (1752\u20131834), daughter of Thomas Chaytor (1728\u20131797) of Charlemont Place, Dublin; the owner of extensive lands in County Clare.[1] Meredith's father, a member of the Royal Dublin Society, had chosen a legal career in Dublin and passed the management of Templerany (where his family had made their home since the late seventeenth century) to his younger brother, William Meredith (1752\u20131791), who lived there with his wife, Sarah Garrett (1758\u20131822) of Janeville & Mount Pleasant House, County Carlow; niece of John Cole, 1st Baron Mountflorence, of Florence Court. Thomas Meredith was a grandson of the John Meredith (1711\u20131786) of Templerany, who c.1750 had two portraits (one large, one small) painted with his whippet by William Hoare at Bath.[2]/nFrom his childhood home in Dublin on Harcourt Street, he was tutored by a relative, Samuel Crumpe, a first cousin of the better known Dr Samuel Crumpe. Meredith's father signed him into Trinity College, Dublin, as a pensioner in 1791 (spelling his name 'Meredyth'). Two years later, in 1793, he was elected a scholar of the college, and in 1795 he graduated with a BA degree. Following university he spent the next few years managing his property in counties Wicklow, Wexford and Dublin, but using his spare time to work on new mathematical theories.[3] In 1805, he took his M.A. and in the same year was elected a Fellow of Trinity College,[4] where he is remembered as a distinguished mathematician and according to the biography of Charles Dickinson was, \"reckoned by many as the best lecturer and tutor of his time in college\".[5] At his Dublin home, 1 Fitzwilliam Square, he kept a collection of books and maps./nIn 1842, an article was written for the Dublin University Magazine by Mrs Meredith's cousin, Robert Perceval Graves (brother of Charles Graves). It celebrated the achievements of Graves' friend Sir William Rowan Hamilton, stating that Thomas Meredith was astonished by Hamilton's extraordinary intellectual abilities: \"We well remember to have heard, long before we ever saw our friend, of Dr Meredith\u2026 a man of great learning and ability, reporting with expressions of astonishment, that he had examined in the country a child of six or seven, who read, translated and understood Hebrew better than many candidates for fellowship; this child was young Hamilton\"./nIn 1811, Meredith took a Bachelor of Divinity degree, and the following year he was awarded as a Doctor of Divinity. He retired his fellowship in 1813 to take the living of Ardtrea, County Tyrone, which was open exclusively to those who had held fellowships at Trinity College. The parish tithes amounted to \u00a3738 a year, but in addition to this the rector of Ardtrea also held stewardship over the manor of Ardtrea, making the living a particularly valuable one. Ardtrea House, the Rectory or Glebe house where he took up residence with his family, was described as \"a large and handsome house built of hewn freestone\" with a small Palladian-style Gate Lodge at the foot of the driveway. Meredith was remembered at Ardtrea for never turning a man away from his door, always having a silver coin for those who came to him in need./nHe was Rector of Ardtrea for six years, until his untimely death in 1819 at the age of forty two. His father-in-law, Richard Graves, wrote, \"...and now another apparently most calamitous visitation presents itself, in the sudden death of my beloved and excellent son-in-law, by apoplexy, a disorder of which of all men he seemed least liable.\" The Freeman's Journal of Dublin reported, \"Learned, amiable, and unassuming, Thomas Meredith was unfeignedly respected and sincerely beloved by his numerous acquaintance and friends, all of whom deeply deplore his premature departure. He has left behind him an amiable and disconsolate widow and a family of seven children, most of whom are yet too young to feel the irreparable loss which they have sustained\".  He was succeeded at Ardtrea by the orientalist, Edward Hincks./nThe poet, Charles Wolfe, was much attached to, and a great admirer of Thomas Meredith. He was the Curate of nearby Donaghmore, County Tyrone and a frequent guest of the Merediths at Ardtrea.[6] Chiefly remembered today for his poem The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna, brought to the attention of the public by Lord Byron, Wolfe was also the author of the inscription on Meredith's memorial at the Church of Ardtrea and a previously unpublished epitaph for his tomb. The memorial is made of black and white marble and is surmounted by the Meredith family crest and coat of arms:/nSacred to the memory of THOMAS MEREDITH D.D., Formerly Fellow of Trinity College Dublin, And 6 years Rector of this Parish. A man who gave to learning a beauty not its own, And threw over Science and Literature the lustre of the Gospel And the sweet influence of Christianity. The talents which he clothed in humility And his silent and unobtrusive benevolence Were unable to escape the respect and admiration of society: But those who witnessed him in the bosom of his family And shared the treasures of his conversation Seldom failed to find the ways of wisdom more pleasant than before And to discover fresh loveliness in that Gospel Upon which his hopes and his ministry were founded He was summoned from a family of which he was the support and delight And from the flock to which he was eminently endeared On 2nd May 1819 in the 42nd year of his age By a sudden and awful visitation but he knew That his Redeemer lived. \u2018Erected by his Sons\u2019./nCharles Wolfe wrote a poem for Meredith, meant as a second epitaph intended for the tomb itself:/nHere lies in this lone spot, this holy shade,\nOne less for earth than heavens high mansions made,\nWhose virtues all in paths untrodden moved,\nToo little known, alas! Too much beloved!\nWhom talent, science, wisdom, goodness crowned,\nWith wreaths as gentle as these flowers around,\nWhose modest beauty shun all common eyes,\nTo bless this sacred spot, these purer skies,\nAnd like his bloom in home's sequestered Vale,\nTo him who gave them all their sweets exhale,\nBut us't to human praise he sought not such,\nUnheeding all but his he loved so much,\nThen be our task to fit our minds to raise\nIn purer Worlds a fitter song of praise,\nFor them alone to know his worth is given\nWho lived on earth as Saints shall live in Heaven./nIn 1817, Wolfe wrote a letter demonstrating how he valued Meredith\u2019s friendship,/nI am surrounded by grandees, who count their income by thousands, and by clergymen innumerable; however, I have kept out of their reach; I have preferred my turf-fire, my books, and the memory of the friends I have left, to all the society that Tyrone can furnish\u2026 with one bright exception. At Meredith\u2019s I am indeed every way at home; I am at home in friendship and hospitality, in science and literature, in our common friends and acquaintance, and in topics of religion./nIn a brief memoir to Charles Wolfe's life, published in 1842, The Ven. John A. Russell (Archdeacon of Clogher), introduces Meredith as follows,/nThe following letter (quoted below) gives an affecting account of the death of a valued friend, to whom he (Wolfe) had lately become particularly attached, the Rev. Dr Meredith, formerly a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and then rector of Ardtrea. He was esteemed one of the most distinguished scholars in the university to which he belonged. His genius for mathematical acquirements especially, was universally allowed to be of the first order; and his qualifications as a public examiner and lecturer were so eminent, as to render his early retirement from the duties of a fellowship a serious loss to the college. Of our author's talents he entertained the highest opinion; and his congeniality of disposition soon led him to appreciate fully the still higher qualities of his heart./nThe letter was headed \u2018Castle Caulfield, 4 May 1819\u2019, where Wolfe was presumably staying, and it expresses his anguish at Meredith\u2019s death as well as the deep respect he held for his friend,/nMy Dear\u00a0... I am just come from the house of mourning! Last night I helped to lay poor Meredith in his coffin, and followed him this morning to his grave. The visitation was truly awful. Last Tuesday (this day week) he was struck to the ground by a fit of apoplexy, and from that moment until the hour of his death, on Sunday evening, he never articulated. I did not hear of his danger until Sunday evening, and yesterday morning I ran ten miles [16 km], like a madman, and was only in time to see his dead body. It will be a cruel and bitter thought to me for many a day, that I had not one farewell from him, while he was on the brink of the world. Oh\u2026 one of my heart-strings is broken\u00a0! The only way I have of describing my attachment to that man, is by telling you, that next to you and Dickinson, he was the person in whose society I took the greatest delight. A visit to Ardtrea was often in prospect to sustain me in many of my cheerless labours. My gems are falling away; But I do hope and trust, it is because 'God is making up his jewels'. Dr Meredith was a man of a truly Christian temper of mind. We used naturally to fall upon religious subjects; And I now revert, with peculiar gratification, to the cordiality with which we took sweet counsel together upon these topics. You know that he was possessed of the first and most distinguishing characteristic of a Christian disposition, humility. He preached the Sunday before for _, and the surmon was unusually solemn and impressive, and in the true spirit of the Gospel. Indeed, from several circumstances, he seems to have had some strange presentiments of what was to happen. His air and look some time before his dissolution had, as _ told me, an expression of the most awful and profound devotion./nIn regards to the 'sudden and awful visitation' that took his life, referred to on Meredith's memorial at Ardtrea, there are two curious stories told about him shooting at a ghost with a silver bullet. The first appeared in a book called Memorials to the Dead (published 1903, page 462). In 1924, the Rev. (William) Ernest Richard Scott (born 1874) was the Rector of Ardtrea. Coincidentally, he was married to Adelaide Creed Meredith (1878\u20131968), sister of James Creed Meredith, and one of Thomas Meredith's great granddaughters. Scott wrote a letter to Lt.-Colonel Colborne Powell Meredith[7] of Ottawa, one of Meredith's grandchildren. The letter is kept at the National Archives of Canada, and is based on the account of Meredith's death as recorded in Memorials to the Dead:/nIn the parish of Ardtrea, in the County of Tyrone, stands the big rectory in which I took up my abode, with my family, on my appointment to the living in 1914. It is a curious house, with a curious history \u2013 a huge, grim, rambling building standing in the midst of forty-five acres of grounds. Erected over a century ago (1805) for a wealthy incumbent (the man who Meredith succeeded), at a time when parochial values were very different from what they are today, the atmosphere of the place seems to be impregnated with that peculiar blend of mystery and superstition which surrounds so many old houses of the kind. The rectory of Ardtrea, however, would appear to have more justification than most for the mixed feelings with which it is regarded by the simple country folk around./nIts very situation lends itself to thoughts of the mysterious. Magnificent beech trees stand upon the lawn (which it is said were planted by the sons of Thomas Meredith), and other forest giants and mournful yews are ringed about the grey old mansion. The long carriage-drive, too, is guarded by a noble avenue of great trees, and thick masses of ivy cluster upon the walls which flank the great wooden door enclosing the courtyard./nIf its situation and appearance bears the impress of the unusual, so likewise do its traditions. One of its first inhabitants (the second), Dr Thomas Meredith, a former Fellow of Trinity College Dublin, Rector of Ardtrea for six years, and great-grandfather of my wife, died within its doors in 1819 from a 'sudden and awful visitation', as his tombstone states./nExactly what this was no one seems to know, but the story runs that a governess employed by Dr Meredith was troubled by a ghost, which took the form of a lady arrayed in white \u2013 possibly, averred local tradition, the Virgin Saint Trea, who lived hereabout in the fifth century. This apparition greatly troubled the good doctor, and on the advice of a friend he charged a gun with a solid silver bullet and lay in wait for the midnight visitor. In due course a report (shot) was heard, and next day the Rector lay dying upon the flagged floor of a basement room. From that hour the country-people looked a skant upon the 'haunted' house, and avoided it whenever possible./nThe second variation of the event appeared in True Irish Ghost Stories (published in 1926) by St. John Drelincourt Seymour, a relative of Meredith's wife, under the chapter 'Legendary and Ancestral ghosts'.[8]/nIn the Parish Church of Ardtrea, near Cookstown, is a marble monument and inscription in memory of Thomas Meredith, D.D., who had been a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and for six years rector of the parish. He died, according to the words of the inscription, on 2nd May 1819, as a result of \"a sudden and awful visitation.\" A local legend explains this \"visitation,\" by stating that a ghost haunted the rectory, the visits of which had caused his family and servants to leave the house./nThe rector had tried to shoot it but failed; then he was told to use a silver bullet; he did so, and next morning was found dead at his hall-door while a hideous object like a devil made horrid noises out of any window the servant man approached. This man was advised by some Roman Catholic neighbours to get the priest, who would \"lay\" the thing. The priest arrived, and with the help of a jar of whisky the ghost became quite civil, till the last glass in the jar, which the priest was about to empty out for himself, whereupon the ghost or devil made himself as thin and long as a Lough Neagh eel, and slipped himself into the jar to get the last drops. But the priest put the cork into its place and hammered it in, and, making the sign of the Cross on it, he had the evil thing secured. It was buried in the cellar of the rectory, where on some nights it can still be heard calling to be let out./nAt Dublin on 7 July 1807, Thomas Meredith married Elizabeth Maria (1791\u20131855), the eldest daughter of Richard Graves, by his wife, Elizabeth Maria (1767\u20131827), the eldest daughter of the Rev. James Drought (1738\u20131820) of Ridgemount House, Ballyboy, King's Co. (Co. Offaly) and Ferbans, County Wicklow, a nephew of the 'learned savage', his mother's brother, Theaker Wilder. Mrs Meredith, sister of Robert James Graves, was described as 'a lady of much culture and refinement, and possessed also of great energy and force of character.' They were the parents of seven children, first cousins of John Walsingham Cooke Meredith and Sir James Creed Meredith,/nAfter Meredith's death, his widow moved their family back to Harcourt Street, Dublin. In 1824, but without the approval of her parents, she remarried her mother's widowed cousin, the Rev. (James) Edmund Burton (1776\u20131850), \"who wasted every farthing of his Irish property before having the sense to migrate to Canada\". According to Burton's nephew, Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, Eliza had originally been his first choice of wife, but she had preferred Thomas Meredith to him. He was the son of the Rev. Edward Burton (b.1747) of Newgarden House, Annaghdown, County Galway, by his wife Maria Margaretta Campbell, Eliza Meredith's great aunt. Edmund Burton was also the uncle of Lady Henry William Stisted./nSeemingly after Burton had squandered his property in Ireland, at the invitation of the 'Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts', he went to Terrebonne, Quebec, becoming the county's first Anglican minister. The attraction may have been that with the job he was also granted 1,000 acres (4\u00a0km2) of land. By the time he returned to Ireland, he had added another 1,447 acres (5.9\u00a0km2) to his property, perhaps in an attempt to regain what he had lost in Ireland. After the death of his first wife, he returned home to find a new bride for his ten motherless children. On marrying the widowed Eliza Meredith, he waited until the summer of that year (1824) to return with his new wife and four of her children to his house and farm, 'Burtonville' (where the village of Sainte-Julienne, Quebec is found today), outside the village of Rawdon, Quebec, which was then a four-day journey north of Montreal./nThey lived there until 1833 before settling at Cloyne, Co. Cork. Eliza 'conveniently' left all the Burton children by her husband's first marriage in Canada, according to them, 'in an unconcerned manner'. By Mr Burton she had a further six children, though it was noted by her son Edmund Allen Meredith to one of his brothers, that \"all the Graves' (underlined) entertain such a decided antipathy to Mr Burton that I do not think they would feel disposed to undertake the charge in anyway of one of his children\". However, the Meredith children were said to have taken a great interest in the education and welfare of their younger half brothers and sisters. Thomas Meredith's widow died at 84 Great King Street, Edinburgh, the home of Major Robert Graves Burton M.D., of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, one of her sons by her second marriage, on 31 March 1855.", "14432157": "Wladimir P.

From 1926 to 1927 he was a Rockefeller Fellow in Copenhagen and Stockholm.[1] On 1 April 1928 Walther became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt and director of the Institute for Applied Mathematics, which he built.[2][4] In 1955, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[1]/nAlwin Walther, Heinz Billing, Helmut Schreyer, Konrad Zuse and Alan Turing met in G\u00f6ttingen in 1947. In the form of a colloquium, British experts (including John R. Womersley, Arthur Porter and Alan Turing) interviewed Walther, Billing, Schreyer and Zuse.[5]/nWalther retired on 30 September 1966.[2] A few months later he died after a short illness at the age of 68 years in Darmstadt.[2]/nWalther attached great importance to questions of the practical application of mathematics. Alwin Walther was one of the first to adapt the mathematics to the requirements of the engineers.[6] In the early 1930s he developed the slide rules \"System Darmstadt\", which was widely used in engineering.[2]/nOn his initiative, the German Computing Centre in Darmstadt and the International Computing Centre in Rome were built.[1]/nWalter was a nominator in two nominations for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Peter Debye (1930) and Enrico Fermi (1936).[7]/nPeter Schnell, founder of Software AG, Rudolf Zurm\u00fchl and Helmut Hoelzer, the inventor and constructor of the world's first electronic analog computer, were his students.[2]/nFrom 1952 to 1955 he was chairman of the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (GAMM).[2] From 1958 he was board member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and from 1959 to 1962 he was vice president of the newly founded International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP).[2]/nAlwin Walther was active for many years in the Association of Friends of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt. In March 1933 he became deputy secretary. In the following year, until the late 1940s, he was their treasurer. In 1950, the general assembly appointed him as honorary member of the Association./nIn 1928, Alwin Walther built the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt.[4] It was the first Institute for Applied Mathematics in Germany.[6] The focus of the institute was on the development of electronic arithmetic. Already at the end of the thirties, he set up a computing station in his institute.[2] The computing capacity was unique in Europe at the time.[2] At the computing station two decades before the invention of programming languages, algorithms were tested and used successfully in the processing of problems from industry.[2]/nIn Germany, the beginnings of computer science go back to the Institute for Applied Mathematics of the TH Darmstadt.[4] In 1956, the first programming lectures and internships in Germany were offered at the TH Darmstadt.[4]/nThe Institute for Applied Mathematics contributed to Zuse's Z4 by providing parts and components.[6]/nIn 1951, the development of the digital electronic computing machine \"Darmst\u00e4dter Elektronischer Rechenautomat (DERA)\" in tube technology was started.[2] Around the same time, Walther procured a computer of the highest performance class, an IBM 650, for the TH Darmstadt.[2] The TH Darmstadt was thus the first university in Germany to have a mainframe computer.[4][8]/nDue to the reputation that the TH Darmstadt had at the time in computer science research, the first international congress on computer science held in German-speaking countries took place in October 1955 at the TH Darmstadt.[4]/nFrom 1997 to 2010, the departments of computer science and mathematics at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt awarded an Alwin-Walther-Medal for outstanding achievements, as well as for exceptional research and development work in the fields of computer science or applied mathematics.", "145319": "Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar FRS (/\u02cct\u0283\u00e6ndr\u0259\u02c8\u0283e\u026ak\u0259r/;[3] 19 October 1910 \u2013 21 August 1995)[4] was an Indian-American theoretical physicist who spent his professional life in the United States. He shared the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics with William A. Fowler for \"...theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars\". His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and black holes.[5][6] Many concepts, institutions, and inventions, including the Chandrasekhar limit and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, are named after him.[7]/nChandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of problems in physics during his lifetime, contributing to the contemporary understanding of stellar structure, white dwarfs, stellar dynamics, stochastic process, radiative transfer, the quantum theory of the hydrogen anion, hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability, turbulence, equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, general relativity, mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves.[8] At the University of Cambridge, he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun \u2013 the Chandrasekhar limit. Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by Jan Oort and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Way on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed \"dynamical friction\", which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly./nChandrasekhar studied at Presidency College, Madras (now Chennai) and the University of Cambridge.  A long-time professor at the University of Chicago, he did some of his studies at the Yerkes Observatory, and served as editor of The Astrophysical Journal from 1952 to 1971. He was on the faculty at Chicago from 1937 until his death in 1995 at the age of 84, and was the Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics.[9]/nChandrasekhar was born in Lahore on 19 October 1910 of the British Raj (present-day Pakistan) in a Tamil Brahmin family,[10] to Sita Balakrishnan (1891\u20131931) and Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar (1885\u20131960)[11] who was stationed in Lahore as Deputy Auditor General of the Northwestern Railways at the time of Chandrasekhar's birth. He had two elder sisters, Rajalakshmi and Balaparvathi, three younger brothers, Vishwanathan, Balakrishnan, and Ramanathan, and four younger sisters, Sarada, Vidya, Savitri, and Sundari. His paternal uncle was the Indian physicist and Nobel laureate Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman. His mother was devoted to intellectual pursuits, had translated Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House into Tamil and is credited with arousing Chandra's intellectual curiosity at an early age.[12] The family moved from Lahore to Allahabad in 1916, and finally settled in Madras in 1918./nChandrasekhar was tutored at home until the age of 12.[12] In middle school his father taught him mathematics and physics and his mother taught him Tamil. He later attended the Hindu High School, Triplicane, Madras during the years 1922\u201325. Subsequently, he studied at Presidency College, Madras (affiliated to the University of Madras) from 1925 to 1930, writing his first paper, \"The Compton Scattering and the New Statistics\", in 1929 after being inspired by a lecture by Arnold Sommerfeld.[13] He obtained his bachelor's degree, BSc (Hon.), in physics, in June 1930. In July 1930, Chandrasekhar was awarded a Government of India scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the University of Cambridge, where he was admitted to Trinity College, secured by R. H. Fowler with whom he communicated his first paper. During his travels to England, Chandrasekhar spent his time working out the statistical mechanics of the degenerate electron gas in white dwarf stars, providing relativistic corrections to Fowler's previous work (see Legacy below)./nIn his first year at Cambridge, as a research student of Fowler, Chandrasekhar spent his time calculating mean opacities and applying his results to the construction of an improved model for the limiting mass of the degenerate star. At the meetings of the Royal Astronomical Society, he met E. A. Milne. At the invitation of Max Born he spent the summer of 1931, his second year of post-graduate studies, at Born's institute at G\u00f6ttingen, working on opacities, atomic absorption coefficients, and model stellar photospheres. On the advice of P. A. M. Dirac, he spent his final year of graduate studies at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, where he met Niels Bohr./nAfter receiving a bronze medal for his work on degenerate stars, in the summer of 1933, Chandrasekhar was awarded his PhD degree at Cambridge with a thesis among his four papers on rotating self-gravitating polytropes. On 9 October, he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College for the period 1933\u20131937, becoming only the second Indian to receive a Trinity Fellowship after Srinivasa Ramanujan 16 years earlier. He had been so certain of failing to obtain the fellowship that he had already made arrangements to study under Milne that autumn at Oxford, even going to the extent of renting a flat there.[13]/nDuring this time, Chandrasekhar became acquainted with British physicist Sir Arthur Eddington./nIn 1935, Chandrasekhar was invited by the director of the Harvard Observatory, Harlow Shapley, to be a visiting lecturer in theoretical astrophysics for a three-month period. He travelled to the United States in December. During his visit to Harvard, Chandrasekhar greatly impressed Shapley, but declined his offer of a Harvard research fellowship. At the same time, Chandrasekhar met Gerard Kuiper, a noted Dutch astrophysical observationalist who was then a leading authority on white dwarfs. Kuiper had recently been recruited by Otto Struve, the director of the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin, which was run by the University of Chicago, and the university's president, Robert Maynard Hutchins. Having known of Chandrasekhar, Struve was then considering him for one of three faculty posts in astrophysics, along with Kuiper; the other opening had been filled by Bengt Stromgren, a Danish theorist.[13] Following a recommendation from Kuiper, Struve invited Chandrasekhar to Yerkes in March 1936 and offered him the job. Though Chandrasekhar was keenly interested, he initially declined the offer and left for England; after Hutchins sent a radiogram to Chandrasekhar during the voyage, he finally accepted, returning to Yerkes as an assistant professor of Theoretical Astrophysics in December 1936.[13] Hutchins also intervened on an occasion where Chandra's participation on teaching a course organised by Struve, was vetoed by the dean Henry Gale based on a racial prejudice; Hutchins said \"By all means have Mr.Chandrasekhar teach\".[14]/nChandrasekhar remained at the University of Chicago for his entire career. He was promoted to associate professor in 1941 and to full professor two years later at the age of 33.[13] In 1946, when Princeton University offered Chandrasekhar a position vacated by Henry Norris Russell with a salary double that of Chicago's, Hutchins incremented his salary matching with that of Princeton's and persuaded Chandrasekhar to stay in Chicago. In 1952, he became Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics and Enrico Fermi Institute, upon Enrico Fermi's invitation. In 1953, he and his wife, Lalitha Chandrasekhar, took American citizenship.[15]/nAfter the Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research (LASR) was built by NASA in 1966 at the university, Chandrasekhar occupied one of the four corner offices on the second floor.  (The other corners housed John A. Simpson, Peter Meyer, and Eugene N. Parker.) Chandrasekhar lived at 4800 Lake Shore Drive after the high-rise apartment complex was built in the late 1960s, and later at 5550 Dorchester Building./nAfter graduating from Cambridge, Chandrasekhar, who was in close contact with Arthur Eddington, presented a full solution to his stellar equation at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting in 1935. Eddington booked a talk right after Chandrasekhar, where he openly criticized Chandrasekhar's theory. This depressed Chandrasekhar and sparked a scientific dispute. Eddington refused to accept a limit for the mass of a star and was proposing an alternative model.[16]/nChandrasekhar sought support from prominent physicists like L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, Niels Bohr and Christian M\u00f8ller who found Eddington's arguments lacking. The tension persisted through 1930s, as Eddington continued to openly criticize Chandrasekhar during meetings and the two compared each other's theories in publications. Chandrasekhar ultimately completed his theory of white dwarfs in 1939, receiving praise from others in the field. Eddington died in 1944, and despite their disagreements, Chandrasekhar continued to state that he admired Eddington's and considered him a friend.[16]/nDuring World War II, Chandrasekhar worked at the Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.  While there, he worked on problems of ballistics, resulting in reports such as 1943's On the decay of plane shock waves, Optimum height for the bursting of a 105mm shell, On the Conditions for the Existence of Three Shock Waves,[17] On the Determination of the Velocity of a Projectile from the Beat Waves Produced by Interference with the Waves of Modified Frequency Reflected from the Projectile[18] and The normal reflection of a blast wave.[19][8] Chandrasekhar's expertise in hydrodynamics led Robert Oppenheimer to invite him to join the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, but delays in the processing of his security clearance prevented him from contributing to the project. It has been rumoured that he visited the Calutron project./nHe wrote that his scientific research was motivated by his desire to participate in the progress of different subjects in science to the best of his ability, and that the prime motive underlying his work was systematization. \"What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain, a certain aspect, or a certain detail, and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme which has form and coherence; and, if not, to seek further information which would help him to do that\".[20]/nChandrasekhar developed a unique style of mastering several fields of physics and astrophysics; consequently, his working life can be divided into distinct periods. He would exhaustively study a specific area, publish several papers in it and then write a book summarizing the major concepts in the field. He would then move on to another field for the next decade and repeat the pattern. Thus he studied stellar structure, including the theory of white dwarfs, during the years 1929 to 1939, and subsequently focused on stellar dynamics, theory of Brownian motion from 1939 to 1943. Next, he concentrated on the theory of radiative transfer and the quantum theory of the negative ion of hydrogen from 1943 to 1950. This was followed by sustained work on turbulence and hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability from 1950 to 1961. In the 1960s, he studied both the equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, and general relativity. During the period, 1971 to 1983 he studied the mathematical theory of black holes, and, finally, during the late 80s, he worked on the theory of colliding gravitational waves.[8]/nChandra worked closely with his students and expressed pride in the fact that over a 50-year period (from roughly 1930 to 1980), the average age of his co-author collaborators had remained the same, at around 30. He insisted that students address him as \"Prof. Chandrasekhar\" until they received their PhD degree, after which time they (as other colleagues) were encouraged to address him as \"Chandra\". When Chandrasekhar was working at the Yerkes Observatory in 1940s, he would drive 150 miles (240\u00a0km) to and from every weekend to teach a course at the University of Chicago. Two of the students who took the course, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, won the Nobel prize before he could get one for himself. Regarding classroom interactions during his lectures, noted astrophysicist Carl Sagan stated from firsthand experience that \"frivolous questions\" from unprepared students were \"dealt with in the manner of a summary execution\", while questions of merit \"were given serious attention and response\".[21]/nFrom 1952 to 1971 Chandrasekhar was editor of The Astrophysical Journal.[22] When Eugene Parker submitted a paper on his discovery of solar wind in 1957, two eminent reviewers rejected the paper. However, since Chandra as an editor could not find any mathematical flaws in Parker's work, he went ahead and published the paper in 1958.[23]/nDuring the years 1990 to 1995, Chandrasekhar worked on a project devoted to explaining the detailed geometric arguments in Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica using the language and methods of ordinary calculus.  The effort resulted in the book Newton's Principia for the Common Reader, published in 1995. Chandrasekhar was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science.[citation needed]/nChandrasekhar also worked on collision of gravitational waves,[24] and algebraically special perturbations.[25]/nChandrasekhar was the nephew of C. V. Raman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930./nChandrasekhar married Lalitha Doraiswamy in September 1936. He met her as a fellow student at Presidency College.  He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1953. Many considered him as warm, positive, generous, unassuming, meticulous, and open to debate, while some others as private, intimidating, impatient and stubborn regarding non-scientific matters,[21] and unforgiving to those who ridiculed his work.[26]/nChandrasekhar died of a heart attack at the University of Chicago Hospital in 1995, having survived a prior heart attack in 1975.[21] He was survived by his wife, who died on 2 September 2013 at the age of 102.[27] She was a serious student of literature and western classical music.[26]/nOnce when involved in a discussion about the Bhagavad Gita, Chandrasekhar said, \"I should like to preface my remarks with a personal statement in order that my later remarks will not be misunderstood. I consider myself an atheist\".[28] This was also confirmed many times in his other talks.[29] In an interview with Kevin Krisciunas at the University of Chicago, on 6 October 1987, Chandrasekhar commented: \"Of course, he (Otto Struve) knew I was an atheist, and he never brought up the subject with me\".[30]/nChandrasekhar was a vegetarian.[31]/nChandrasekhar was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for his studies on the physical processes important to the structure and evolution of stars. Chandrasekhar accepted this honour, but was upset the citation mentioned only his earliest work, seeing it as a denigration of a lifetime's achievement. He shared it with William A. Fowler./nChandrasekhar's most notable work is on the astrophysical Chandrasekhar limit. The limit gives the maximum mass of a white dwarf star, ~1.44 solar masses, or equivalently, the minimum mass that must be exceeded for a star to collapse into a neutron star or black hole (following a supernova). The limit was first calculated by Chandrasekhar in 1930 during his maiden voyage from India to Cambridge, England for his graduate studies. In 1979, NASA named the third of its four \"Great Observatories\" after Chandrasekhar. This followed a naming contest which attracted 6,000 entries from fifty states and sixty-one countries. The Chandra X-ray Observatory was launched and deployed by Space Shuttle Columbia on 23 July 1999. The Chandrasekhar number, an important dimensionless number of magnetohydrodynamics, is named after him. The asteroid 1958 Chandra is also named after Chandrasekhar. The Himalayan Chandra Telescope is named after him. In the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London, R. J. Tayler wrote: \"Chandrasekhar was a classical applied mathematician whose research was primarily applied in astronomy and whose like will probably never be seen again.\"[1]/nChandrasekhar supervised 45 PhD students.[42] After his death, his wife Lalitha Chandrasekhar made a gift of his Nobel Prize money to the University of Chicago towards the establishment of the Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar Memorial Fellowship. First awarded in the year 2000, this fellowship is given annually to an outstanding applicant to graduate school in the PhD programs of the department of physics or the department of astronomy and astrophysics.[43] S. Chandrasekhar Prize of Plasma Physics is an award given by Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPS) to outstanding plasma physicists, started in the year 2014.[44]/nThe Chandra Astrophysics Institute (CAI) is a program offered for high school students who are interested in astrophysics mentored by MIT scientists[45] and sponsored by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.[46] Carl Sagan praised him in the book The Demon-Haunted World: \"I discovered what true mathematical elegance is from Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.\" On 19 October 2017, Google showed a Google Doodle in 28 countries honouring Chandrasekhar's 107th birthday and the Chandrasekhar limit.[47][48]/nIn 2010, on account of Chandra's 100th birthday, University of Chicago conducted a symposium titled Chandrasekhar Centennial Symposium 2010 which was attended by leading astrophysicists such as Roger Penrose, Kip Thorne, Freeman Dyson, Jayant V. Narlikar, Rashid Sunyaev, G. Srinivasan, and Clifford Will. Its research talks were published in 2011 as a book titled Fluid flows to Black Holes: A tribute to S Chandrasekhar on his birth centenary.[49][50][51]/nChandrasekhar published around 380 papers[53][1] in his lifetime. He wrote his first paper in 1928 when he was still an undergraduate student about Compton effect[54] and last paper which was accepted for publication just two months before his death was in 1995 which was about non-radial oscillation of stars.[55] The University of Chicago Press published selected papers of Chandrasekhar in seven volumes.", "571304": "Benjamin Robins (1707\u00a0\u2013 29 July 1751) was a pioneering British scientist, Newtonian mathematician, and military engineer./nHe wrote an influential treatise on gunnery, for the first time introducing Newtonian science to military men, was an early enthusiast for rifled gun barrels, and his work had substantive influence on the development of artillery during the latter half of the eighteenth century \u2013 and directly stimulated the teaching of calculus in military academies./nBenjamin Robins was born in Bath.[1] His parents were Quakers in poor circumstances, and as a result, he received very little formal education.[1] Having come to London on the advice of Dr. Henry Pemberton (1694\u20131771), who had recognised Robins's talents,[1] for a time he maintained himself by teaching mathematics, but soon devoted himself to engineering and the study of fortification.[2]/nIn particular he carried out an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, embodying his results in his famous treatise on New Principles of Gunnery (1742),[3] which contains a description of his ballistic pendulum (see chronograph).[2]/nRobins also made a number of important experiments on the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles,[4][5][6] and on the force of gunpowder, with computation of the velocities thereby communicated to projectiles. He compared the results of his theory with experimental determinations of the ranges of mortars and cannon, and gave practical maxims for the management of artillery. He also made observations on the flight of rockets, and wrote on the advantages of rifled gun barrels. His work on gunnery was translated into German by Leonhard Euler, who added a critical commentary of his own.[2] However, the work of Robins still served as an important piece of technical information that helped the later advancement of the Prussian artillery, especially of its improvement in accuracy, a big step forwards that the book turned out to be a shot in the arm of the ambitious Frederick the Great who determined to vault the status and power of Prussian artillery to the top among other European armies./nOf less interest nowadays are Robins's more purely mathematical writings, such as his Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton's Methods of Fluxions and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios (1735), A Demonstration of the Eleventh Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton's Treatise of Quadratures (Phil. Trans., 1727),[7] and similar works.[2]/nBesides his scientific labours, Robins took an active part in politics. He wrote pamphlets in support of the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, and was secretary of a committee appointed by the House of Commons to enquire into the conduct of that minister. He also wrote a preface to the Report on the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the Conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope, in which he gave an apology for the battle of Prestonpans.[2]/nIn 1749, he was appointed engineer general to the East India Company, and went out to superintend the reconstruction of their forts. However, his health soon failed, and he died at Fort St David in India. His works were published in two volumes in 1761.[2]", "1652651": "Michael George Aschbacher (born April 8, 1944) is an American mathematician best known for his work on finite groups. He was a leading figure in the completion of the classification of finite simple groups in the 1970s and 1980s. It later turned out that the classification was incomplete, because the case of quasithin groups had not been finished. This gap was fixed by Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith in 2004, in a pair of books comprising about 1300 pages. Aschbacher is currently the Shaler Arthur Hanisch Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology./nAschbacher received his B.S. at the California Institute of Technology in 1966 and his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1969.[1] He joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology in 1970 and became a full professor in 1976. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1978\u201379.[2] He was awarded the Cole Prize in 1980, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. In 1992, Aschbacher was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3] He was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize for Mathematics by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2011.[4] In 2012 he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5]/nIn 1973, Aschbacher became a leading figure in the classification of finite simple groups. Aschbacher considered himself somewhat of an outsider in the world of conventional group theory, claiming that he was not \"plugged into the system at that point in time\".[6] \nAlthough he had access to several preprints that were shared among the practitioners of the field, he reproduced many proofs that had already been discovered by other researchers and published them in his early papers. Aschbacher only became interested in finite simple groups as a postdoctorate. He wrote his dissertation in combinatorics and was able to utilize many techniques developed in this area to make early contributions to the study of finite simple groups, which surprised the community of researchers. In particular, Daniel Gorenstein, another leader of the classification of finite simple groups, said that Aschbacher's entrance was \"dramatic\".[7]/nIn fact, the rate of Aschbacher's results proved so astounding that many other mathematicians decided to leave the field to pursue other problems. Aschbacher was proving one major result after another and when he announced his progress at the Duluth conference, mathematicians were convinced that the problem was almost solved. This conference represented a turning point for the problem as many mathematicians (in particular those relatively new to the field) decided to leave the field to pursue other problems.[8]/nHowever, Aschbacher's entrance into the field did not come without difficulties. His papers, beginning with the first he wrote in the field for publication, were very difficult to read. Some commented that his proofs lacked explanations of very sophisticated counting arguments. As Aschbacher's proofs became longer, it became even more difficult for others to understand his proofs. Even some of his own coauthors had trouble reading their own papers. From that point on, researchers no longer read papers as independent documents, but rather ones that required the context of its author. As a result, responsibility of finding errors in the classification problem was up to the entire community of researchers rather than just peer-reviewers alone. That Aschbacher's proofs were hard to read was not due to a lack of ability, but rather to the astounding complexity of the ideas he was able to produce.[9]", "35272621": "Paul Fritz Helmuth Gericke (1909\u20132007) was a German mathematician and a historian of mathematics./nGericke was born in Aachen on 7 May 1909.

With S\u00fcss, he attained his habilitation in pure mathematics in 1941.\nAfter 1945, he helped S\u00fcss to further develop the Mathematical Research Institute Oberwolfach.

In 1958 he and Nazarova transferred to Saint Petersburg State University (then named Leningrad State University). They married and began a lifelong collaboration on representation theory. He received in 1960 his Diploma (M.S.) and in 1963 his Candidate of Sciences degree (PhD).[3] His PhD thesis was supervised by Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev,[4] who also supervised Ludmila Nazarova's PhD.[5] A. V. Roiter was hired in 1961 as a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, where he worked until his death in 2006 and since 1991 was Head of the Department of Algebra. He received his Doctor of Sciences degree (habilitation) in 1969.[3] In 1978 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki.[6]/nIn his first published paper, Roiter in 1960[7] proved an important result that eventually led several other mathematicians to establish the theorem that for any finite group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n, \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n has only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable integral representations if and only if, for each prime p, its Sylow p-subgroup is cyclic of order at most p2.[8][3]/nIn a 1966 paper[9] he proved an important theorem in the theory of the integral representation of rings.[3] In a famous 1968 paper[10] he proved the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture.[11][3]/nRoiter proved the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture for finite-dimensional algebras; his paper[10] never mentioned Artin algebras, but his techniques work for Artin algebras as well. There is an important line of research inspired by the paper[10] and started by Maurice Auslander and Sverre Olaf Smal\u00f8 in a 1980 paper.[12] Auslander and Smal\u00f8's paper and its follow-ups by several researchers introduced, among other things, covariantly and contravariantly finite subcategories of the category of finitely generated modules over an Artin algebra, which led to the theory of almost split sequences in subcategories.[13]/nAccording to Auslander and Smal\u00f8:/n... it is perhaps surprising that the original impetus for our work did not come from the theory of hereditary artin algebras or those stably equivalent to hereditary artin algebras. Rather, the research came from an effort to explain a much older result of Gabriel and Roiter ... concerning artin algebras of finite representation type in terms of the technics and ideas developed by Auslander and Reiten in connection with almost split sequences and irreducible morphisms ...[12]/nRoiter did important research on p-adic representations,[3] especially his 1967 paper with Yuriy Drozd and Vladimir V. Kirichenko on hereditary and Bass orders[14][15][16] and the Drozd-Roiter criterion for a commutative order to have finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.[17] An important tool in this research was his theory of divisibility of modules.[18][19]/nIn 1972 Nazarova and Roiter[20] introduced representations of partially ordered sets, an important class of matrix problems with many applications in mathematics, such as the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. (In 2005 they with M. N. Smirnova proved a theorem about antimonotone quadratic forms and partially ordered sets.[21]) Also in the 1970s Roiter in three papers, two of which were joint work with Mark Kleiner,[22][23][24][25] introduced representations of bocses, a very large class of matrix problems.[3]/nThe monograph by Roiter and P. Gabriel (with a contribution by Bernhard Keller), published by Springer in 1992 in English translation, is important for its influence on the theory of representations of finite-dimensional algebras and the theory of matrix problems.[26][3][27] There is a 1997 reprint of the English translation.[28]/nIn the years shortly before his death, Roiter did research on representations in Hilbert spaces.[29] In two papers,[30][31] he with his wife and Stanislav A. Kruglyak introduced the notion of locally scalar representations of quivers (i.e. directed multigraphs) in Hilbert spaces. In their 2006 paper they constructed for such representations Coxeter functors analogous to Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev functors[32] and applied the new functors to the study of locally scalar representations. In particular, they proved that a graph has only finitely many indecomposable locally scalar representations (up to unitary isomorphism) if and only if it is a Dynkin graph. Their result is analogous to that of Gabriel[33] for the \u201cusual\u201d representations of quivers.[3]/nIn 1961 Roiter started in Kyiv a seminar on the theory of representations. The seminar became the foundation of the highly esteemed Kyiv school of the representation theory. He was the supervisor for 13 Candidate of Sciences degrees (PhDs). In 2007 A. V. Roiter was posthumously awarded the State Prize of Ukraine in Science and Technology for his research on representation theory.[3]", "42481586": "Professor Alfred Lodge MA (1854 \u2013 1 December 1937), was an English mathematician, author, and the first president of The Mathematical Association./nAlfred Lodge was born in 1854 at Penkhull, Staffordshire, one of nine children to Oliver Lodge (1826\u20131884) and Grace, n\u00e9e Heath (1826\u20131879).

His research deals with the kinetic theory of gases, probability theory, statistical mechanics, and oscillation theory. He studied the works of the Russian mathematician A. A. Markov and drew attention to them. Hostinsk\u00fd's work on transition probabilities and Markov chains was then further developed by many foreign experts. Laurent Mazliak gave an analysis of the letters exchanged between Hostinsk\u00fd  and Wolfgang Doeblin.[7]/nIn a note submitted to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1928, Hostinsk\u00fd introduced an elementary version of the ergodic theorem for a Markov chain with continuous state [Hostinsk\u00fd 1928]. Hostinsk\u00fd's work on this topic came before the spectacular development of the 1930s at the hands of Andrei N. Kolmogorov and others. Upon reading Hostinsk\u00fd's article, Jacques Hadamard plunged into probability for the first and only time of his life, a period referred to as his \"ergodic spring\" which ended at the Bologna ICM in September 1928 where Hadamard gave a talk on the ergodic principle [Bru 2003, pp. 158\u2013159]. Between February and June 1928, Hostinsk\u00fd and Hadamard exchanged many letters, published several notes responding to one another, and also met during Hadamard\u0159s journey to Czechoslovakia in May. From this moment, Hostinsk\u00fd acquired real international prestige, and in the 1930s, his little school in Brno became an active research center on Markovian phenomena.[8]/nBohuslav Hostinsk\u00fd was four times an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians \u2014 in Cambridge, England in 1912,[9] in Strasbourg in 1920,[10] in Bologna in 1928,[11] and in Zurich in 1932.[12] He published about 140 papers and several monographs./nFrom the establishment of the Faculty of Science in Masaryk University until 1948 (with an interruption from 1934 to 1939), he was the editor of the Spis\u016f (research journal) published by this faculty.

In turn, the Talagrand inequality triggered the development a whole field, which I explored with Otto, McCann, Lott and others, involving entropy, concentration, transport, Ricci curvature, with very far reaching geometric consequences.\"/nIn 2013, Marton was also awarded the J\u00f3zsef E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Wreath\u00a0[hu] by the Hungarian Academy of Science.[2]", "16955407": "William Wallace FRSE MInstCE FRAS LLD (23 September 1768\u00a0\u2013 28 April 1843) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer who invented the eidograph (an improved pantograph)./nWallace was born at Dysart in Fife, the son of Alexander Wallace, a leather manufacturer, and his wife, Janet Simson.[1] He received his school education in Dysart and Kirkcaldy./nIn 1784 his family moved to Edinburgh, where he himself was set to learn the trade of a bookbinder.[2] In 1790 he appears as \"William Wallace, bookbinder\" living and trading at Cowgatehead, at the east end of the Grassmarket.[3]/nHis taste for mathematics had already developed itself, and he made such use of his leisure hours that before the completion of his apprenticeship he had made considerable acquirements in geometry, algebra and astronomy. He was further assisted in his studies by John Robison (1739\u20131805) and John Playfair, to whom his abilities had become known.[2]/nAfter various changes of situation, dictated mainly by a desire to gain time for study, he became assistant teacher of mathematics in the Perth Academy in 1794. This post he exchanged in 1803 for a mathematical mastership in the Royal Military College at Great Marlow, in which post he continued after it moved to Sandhurst, with a recommendation by Playfair.[2]/nIn 1804 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[2] His proposers were John Playfair, Thomas Charles Hope and William Wright.[4]/nIn 1819 he was chosen to succeed John Playfair in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh. Playfair's second chair (in Natural Philosophy) was taken by John Leslie./nWallace developed a reputation for being an excellent teacher. Among his students was Mary Somerville. In 1838 he retired from the university due to ill health.[2] In his final years he lived at 6 Lauriston Lane on the south side of Edinburgh.[5]/nHe died in Edinburgh aged 74 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The grave lies on the north-facing retaining wall in the centre of the northern section./nIn his earlier years Wallace was an occasional contributor to Leybourne's Mathematical Repository and the Gentleman's Mathematical Companion. Between 1801 and 1810 he contributed articles on \"Algebra\", \"Conic Sections\", \"Trigonometry\", and several others in mathematical and physical science to the fourth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, and some of these were retained in subsequent editions from the fifth to the eighth inclusive. He was also the author of the principal mathematical articles in the Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia, edited by David Brewster. He also contributed many important papers to the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[2]/nHe mainly worked in the field of geometry and in 1799 became the first to publish the concept of the Simson line, which erroneously was attributed to Robert Simson.[6] In 1807 he proved a result about polygons with an equal area, that later became known as the Bolyai\u2013Gerwien theorem.[7] His most important contribution to British mathematics however was, that he was one of the first mathematicians introducing and promoting the advancement of the continental European version of calculus in Britain.[6]/nWallace also worked in astronomy and invented the eidograph, a mechanical device for scaling drawings.[6][8]/nWallace was married to Janet Kerr (1775\u20131824)./nHis daughter, Margaret Wallace, married the mathematician Thomas Galloway.

In matrix theory he is visible today in having his name on the Smith normal form of a matrix.  Smith was also first to discover the Cantor set.[2][3][4]/nSmith was born in Dublin, Ireland, the fourth child of John Smith (1792\u20131828), a barrister, who died when Henry was two. His mother, Mary Murphy (d.1857) from Bantry Bay,[5] very soon afterwards moved the family to England. He had thirteen siblings, including Eleanor Smith, who became a prominent educational activist.  He lived in several places in England as a boy. His mother did not send him to school but educated him herself until age 11, at which point she hired private tutors. At age 15 Smith was admitted in 1841 to Rugby School in Warwickshire, where Thomas Arnold was the school's headmaster. This came about because his tutor Henry Highton took up a housemaster position there.[6][7]/nAt 19 he won an entrance scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated in 1849 with high honours in both mathematics and classics. Smith was fluent in French having spent holidays in France, and he took classes in mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris during the 1846\u20137 academic year. He was unmarried and lived with his mother until her death in 1857. He then brought his sister, Eleanor Smith, to live with him as housekeeper at St Giles.[5]/nSmith remained at Balliol College as a mathematics tutor following his graduation in 1849 and was soon promoted to Fellow status./nIn 1861, he was promoted to the Savilian Chair of Geometry at Oxford. In 1873, he was made the beneficiary of a fellowship at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and gave up teaching at Balliol./nIn 1874 he became Keeper of the University Museum and moved (with his sister) to the Keeper's House on South Parks Road in Oxford.[5]/nOn account of his ability as a man of affairs, Smith was in demand for academic administrative and committee work: he was Keeper of the Oxford University Museum; a Mathematical Examiner for the University of London; a member of a Royal Commission to review scientific education practice; a member of the commission to reform University of Oxford governance; chairman of the committee of scientists overseeing the Meteorological Office; twice president of the London Mathematical Society; etc./nHe died in Oxford on 9 February 1883. He is buried in St Sepulchre's Cemetery in Oxford./nAn overview of Smith's mathematics contained in a lengthy obituary published in a professional journal in 1884 is reproduced at NumberTheory.Org.[8] The following is an extract from it./nSmith's two earliest mathematical papers were on geometrical subjects, but the third concerned the theory of numbers. Following the example of Gauss, he wrote his first paper on the theory of numbers in Latin: \"De compositione numerorum primorum form\u00e6 \n\n\n\n4\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4n+1}\n\n ex duobus quadratis.\" In it he proves in an original manner the theorem of Fermat---\"That every prime number of the form \n\n\n\n4\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 4n+1}\n\n (\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n being an integer) is the sum of two square numbers.\" In his second paper he gives an introduction to the theory of numbers./nIn 1858, Smith was selected by the British Association to prepare a report upon the Theory of Numbers. It was prepared in five parts, extending over the years 1859\u20131865. It is neither a history nor a treatise, but something intermediate. The author analyzes with remarkable clearness and order the works of mathematicians for the preceding century upon the theory of congruences, and upon that of binary quadratic forms. He returns to the original sources, indicates the principle and sketches the course of the demonstrations, and states the result, often adding something of his own./nDuring the preparation of the Report, and as a logical consequence of the researches connected therewith, Smith published several original contributions to the higher arithmetic. Some were in complete form and appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London; others were incomplete, giving only the results without the extended demonstrations, and appeared in the Proceedings of that Society. One of the latter, entitled \"On the orders and genera of quadratic forms containing more than three indeterminates,\" enunciates certain general principles by means of which he solves a problem proposed by Eisenstein, namely, the decomposition of integer numbers into the sum of five squares; and further, the analogous problem for seven squares. It was also indicated that the four, six, and eight-square theorems of Jacobi, Eisenstein and Liouville were deducible from the principles set forth./nIn 1868, Smith returned to the geometrical researches which had first occupied his attention. For a memoir on \"Certain cubic and biquadratic problems\" the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin awarded him the Steiner prize./nIn February, 1882, Smith was surprised to see in the Comptes rendus that the subject proposed by the Paris Academy of Science\nfor the Grand prix des sciences math\u00e9matiques was the theory of the decomposition of integer numbers into a sum of five squares; and that the attention of competitors was directed to the results announced without demonstration by Eisenstein, whereas nothing was said about his papers dealing with the same subject in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He wrote to M. Hermite calling his attention to what he had published; in reply he was assured that the members of the commission did not know of the existence of his papers, and he was advised to complete his demonstrations and submit the memoir according to the rules of the competition. According to the rules each manuscript bears a motto, and the corresponding envelope containing the name of the successful author is opened. There were still three months before the closing of the concours (1 June 1882) and Smith set to work, prepared the memoir and despatched it in time./nTwo months after Smith's death, the Paris Academy made their award. Two of the three memoirs sent in were judged worthy of the prize. When\nthe envelopes were opened, the authors were found to be Smith and Minkowski, a young mathematician of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia. No notice was taken of Smith's previous publication on the subject, and M. Hermite on being written to, said that he forgot to bring the matter to the notice of the commission./nIn 1875 Smith published the important paper (Smith 1875) on the integrability of discontinuous functions in Riemann's sense.[9] In this work, while giving a rigorous definition of the Riemann integral as well as explicit rigorous proofs of many of the results published by Riemann,[10] he also gave an example of a meagre set which is not negligible in the sense of measure theory, since its measure is not zero:[11] a function which is everywhere continuous except on this set is not Riemann integrable. Smith's example shows that the proof of sufficient condition for the Riemann integrability of a discontinuous function given earlier by Hermann Hankel was incorrect and the result does not hold:[11] however, his result remained unnoticed until much later, having no influence on successive developments.[12] In an 1875 paper, he discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line, an early version of the Cantor set, now known as the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set.", "2996246": "Alfred Enneper (June 14, 1830, Barmen \u2013 March 24, 1885 Hanover) was a German mathematician.

His most notable contribution came in his publication of Essai sur un nouveau mode d\u2019exposition des principes du calcul diff\u00e9rentiel (Essay on a system of exposition of the principles of differential calculus) in 1814, where he first introduced the mathematical terms for commutative and distributive.[1]/nServois was born on 18 July 1767 in Mont-de-Laval, France to Jacques-Ignace Servois, a local merchant, and Jeanne-Marie Jolliet. Not much is known about his early life except that he had at least one sibling, a sister with which he would eventually move in with after his retirement.[2] He attended several religious schools in both Mont-de-Laval and Besan\u00e7on with the intention of becoming a priest. He was ordained at Besan\u00e7on near the beginning of the French Revolution. His life as a priest was short lived though. As tensions in France, prior to the French Revolution, began to escalate, he left the priesthood to join the French Army in 1793. He officially entered \u00c9cole d'Artillerie (Artillery School) at Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne on 5 March 1794, and was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the First Foot Artillery Regiment by 13 November of that same year.[3] During his time in the Army, Servois was actively involved in many battles, including the crossing of the Rhine, the Battle of Neuwied, and the Battle of Paris./nIt was during his leisure time in the army that he began to seriously devote himself to the study of Mathematics. He suffered from poor health during his years as an officer and this led to him requesting a non-active military position as a professor of mathematics. He gained the attention of Adrien-Marie Legendre with some of his work and through Legendre's recommendation, he was assigned to his first academic position, as a professor at the \u00c9cole d'Artillerie in Besan\u00e7on in July 1801.[4] He would go on to teach at a number of different artillery schools through France, including ones in Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne (March 1802 - December 1802), Metz (December 1802 - February 1808, 1815\u20131816), and La F\u00e8re (February 1808 \u2013 1814, 1814\u20131815)./nLike many of his colleagues who taught at the military schools in France, Servois closely followed the developments in mathematics and sought to make original contributions to the subject. Through his experience in the military, his first publication, Solutions peu connues de diff\u00e9rents probl\u00e8mes de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie pratique (Little-known Solutions to Various Problems in Practical Geometry), where he drew on notions of modern geometry and applied them to practical problems, was well received and prominent French mathematician, Jean-Victor Poncelet, considered it to be/n\"a truly original work, notable for presenting the first applications of theory of transversals to the geometry of the ruler or surveyor's staff, thus revealing the fruitfulness and utility of this theory\"[5]/nServois presented several memoirs to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences at this time including one on the principles of differential calculus and the development of functions in series. He would further publish papers to the Annales de math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es, where his friend, Joseph Diaz Gergonne was the editor, where he started to formalize his position on the foundations of calculus. As a disciple of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, he strongly believed that structure of calculus should be based on power series as opposed to limits or infinitesimals./nIn late 1814, he consolidated his ideas on an algebraic formalization of calculus in his most celebrated work, Essai sur un nouveau mode d'exposition des principes du calcul diff\u00e9rential (Essay on a New Method of Exposition of the Principles of Differential Calculus).[6] It was in this paper, when considering abstract functional equations of differential calculus, that he proposed the terms \"commutative\" and \"distributive\" to describe properties of functions./nServois' 1814 Essai was published well before the modern definitions of functions, identities and inverses, so in his paper, he attempted to formalize these ideas by defining their behavior. In many occasions throughout the document, he discusses operations on functions to not only describe ordinary functions of an independent variable but also to describe operators, such as difference and differential operators.[7] It is here where we first see a formal definition of the distributive property. Servois asserts the following statement:/n\"Functions which, like\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n, are such that the function of the (algebraic) sum of any number of quantities is equal to the sum of the same function of each of these quantities, are called distributive\"[8]/nHe goes on to further describe the commutative function as follows:/n\"Functions, which like f and \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n, are such that they give identical results, no matter in which order we apply them to the subject, are called commutative between themselves.\"[8]/nServois went on to publish two more articles in the Annales des math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es, but they were far less influential than his previous papers. He was assigned to his final position as the curator of the Artillery Museum in Paris on 2 May 1817, where he stayed until 1 June 1827. During his time as the curator, Servois was made a Knight of Saint-Louis for distinguished service to the military on 17 August 1822.[2]/nAfter his retirement, he returned to his hometown of Mont-de-Laval and resided with his sister and his two nieces until his death on 17 April 1847 at the age of 79.[2]", "3160110": "Robert Martin Solovay (born December 15, 1938) is an American mathematician specializing in set theory./nSolovay earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1964 under the direction of Saunders Mac Lane, with a dissertation on A Functorial Form of the Differentiable Riemann\u2013Roch theorem.[1] Solovay has spent his career at the University of California at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include W.

Her father was a prosperous merchant who specialized in costume jewelry.  In 1936, when the Nazis were gaining strength in Germany and it was no longer possible for Jews to attend public school, she and her sister, Ellen, were sent to a Jewish boarding school called Landschulheim Herrlingen in the village of Herrlingen, a suburb of Ulm.  The book Education towards spiritual resistance: The Jewish Landschulheim Herrlingen, 1933 to 1939 by Lucie Schachne documents this remarkable school, which was closed in 1939.[4]/nOn March 15, 1939, Marion and Ellen Walter were sent on a Kindertransport to England, where they attended a Church of England boarding school in Eastbourne, on the southeastern coast of England.[4][5] Marion and Ellen Walter were reunited with their parents in England.  After England entered World War II, in 1940 her father was sent to internment on the Isle of Man.  He died there in 1943.[4]/nEastbourne was in the path of a possible German invasion of England and all students at the boarding school were evacuated. Walter was sent to a school in the hamlet of Wykey in Shropshire, which was in a large country house where they bred cocker spaniels. She slept on an air mattress in a white-washed kennel. She was moved two more times. The last place she resided in was Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, which was acquired by Sir Kenneth Crossley.[4] After Walter completed her schooling at the age of sixteen in December 1944, the school's only mathematics teacher resigned. Since it was difficult to find a replacement during the war period, Walter was asked to teach math, in part because she had earned a mark of distinction on her Cambridge University School Certificate exam. She taught for two terms and found she enjoyed teaching.[6]/nWalter attended college in England for two years before leaving for the United States in 1948 with her mother and sister. The family arrived in New York City in January 1948.  She then attended Hunter College, majoring in mathematics and minoring in education, graduating with a B.A. in 1950. Ellen Walter returned to England to get married./nAfter graduating from Hunter, Walter taught at Hunter College High School and George Washington High School./nIn the summers of 1952 and 1953, Walter was awarded a National Bureau of Standards summer scholarship to study at the Institute of Numerical Analysis at UCLA. The main purpose of the Institute, sponsored by the National Bureau of Standards and funded by the Office of Naval Research, was to work towards the further development of high-speed automatic digital computing machinery. The senior staff at the Institute included D.H. Lehmer (director), Mark Kac, Irving Kaplansky, and A Adrian Albert.  During the second summer at the institute, she met Olga Taussky-Todd who became her mentor and encouraged her to complete her master's degree.  Marshall Hall Jr. joined the senior staff of the Institute in 1953.  Walter took many photographs of prominent mathematicians during her summers at the Institute. These photographs are now part of the Marion Walter Collection at the Archives of American Mathematics on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin.[7][8]/nWalter took evening classes for a master's degree in mathematics at New York University. In order to support herself during this time, she worked as a research assistant, mainly doing computing work at what became the Courant Institute. She earned her M.S. in mathematics from New York University in 1954./nIn 1954, Walter accepted a teaching assistantship in the mathematics department at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; she  remained at Cornell until 1956. In 1956, she took a one-year appointment at Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts; she ended up staying at Simmons for nine years. Back in 1956, the college did not have a major in mathematics or a formal math department. Walter created both the math major and the mathematics department at Simmons.[9] She stepped down as department chair after four years, remaining there teaching until 1965 when she left to concentrate on her doctorate at Harvard Graduate School of Education.   She retained close relationships with her students from Simmons over the years; several of the first math majors stayed in touch with her until her death. One of those students was Lenore Blum, who was a distinguished career professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.[10] Simmons will archive Walter's personal papers./nIn 1960, during her tenure at Simmons, Walter received a fellowship to attend the National Science Foundation Summer Program at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. At Stanford, she met and was taught by the mathematician George P\u00f3lya. Walter considered these summer programs to be one of the highlights of her career.[11]/nAlso during her years at Simmons, Walter began working on her doctoral degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She earned her Ed.D. in mathematics education from HGSE in 1967.[12]  After completing her doctorate, she accepted an appointment at HGSE to teach prospective teachers of mathematics at the elementary and high school level in the Master of Arts in Teaching Program./nIn 1967, Dr. Walter formed a group called the Boston Area Math Specialist (BAMS) which gives monthly workshops for practicing teachers. The members of the group share methods, techniques, new learnings and their successes.[13][14]  She was a mathematics consultant to the project that became Sesame Street.[15][11]/nThe Master of Arts in Teaching Program at HGSE was terminated in 1972.

In Eugene, Oregon, she started the Philomorphs West which met for several years.[17]/nIn 1977, Dr. Walter accepted a teaching position at University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, where she remained until her retirement in 1994.[18] At Oregon, Walter focused on preparing prospective elementary school teachers to teach mathematics.  She stressed the discovery approach and used hands-on/experiment methods.  She refused to teach in a classroom with individual desks for students, but rather had tables in the classroom where students could conduct activities in groups. You can get an idea of what Dr. Walter stressed by looking at the titles of her journal publications.

He was professor of mathematics at the University of Detroit Mercy in Detroit, Michigan. Nemeth was blind and is known for developing Nemeth Braille, a system for blind people to read and write mathematics./nNemeth was born in New York City on the Lower East Side of Manhattan into a large family of Hungarian Jewish immigrants who spoke Yiddish. He was blind from birth from a combination of macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa./nHe attended public schools at first but did most of his primary and secondary education at the Jewish Guild for the Blind school in Yonkers, New York. His undergraduate studies were at Brooklyn College where he studied psychology. He earned a Master of Arts degree in psychology from Columbia University./nNemeth studied mathematics and physics at Brooklyn College. He did not major in mathematics because his academic advisors discouraged him. However, tired of what he felt were unfulfilling jobs at agencies of the blind, and with the encouragement of his first wife Florence, he decided to continue his education in mathematics.[1] He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Wayne State University./nNemeth taught part-time at various colleges in New York. Though his employers were sometimes reluctant to hire him knowing that he was blind, his reputation grew as it became apparent that he was a capable mathematician and teacher. Nemeth distinguished himself from many other blind people by being able to write visual print letters and mathematical symbols on paper and blackboards just like sighted people, a skill he learned as a child. Nemeth says that this skill allowed him to succeed in mathematics, during an era without much technology, when even Braille was difficult to use in mathematics. During the 1950s he moved to Detroit, Michigan to accept a position at the University of Detroit working with Keith Rosenberg. He remained there for 30 years, retiring in 1985. During the late 1960s he studied computer science and began the university's program in that subject./nAs the coursework became more advanced, he found that he needed a braille code that would more effectively handle the kinds of math and science material he was tackling.  Ultimately, he developed the Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation, which was published in 1952.[2]  The Nemeth Code has gone through 4 revisions since its initial development, and continues to be widely used today./nNemeth is also responsible for the rules of MathSpeak, a system for orally communicating mathematical text.  In the course of his studies, Nemeth found that he needed to make use of sighted readers to read otherwise inaccessible math texts and other materials.  Likewise, he needed a method for dictating his math work and other materials for transcription into print. The conventions Nemeth developed for efficiently reading mathematical text out loud have evolved into MathSpeak./nNemeth was instrumental in the development of Unified English Braille (UEB) from 1991 to at least 2001, though he eventually parted ways with others developing that code, and instead worked on a parallel effort called the Universal Braille System (sometimes abbreviated as NUBS with his name appended to the front).  As of 2012, UEB was officially adopted by BANA as the standard for literary braille, but Nemeth Code was also fully retained as an optional official coding system.  Work on NUBS may continue, or it might be merged into a future rules-update to the official Nemeth Code (the most recent official rules-update to Nemeth Code was in 2013)./nNemeth was still working on the Nemeth code when he died. Nemeth had been active in the Jewish community since childhood, and since his retirement from academic mathematics he had been transcribing Hebrew prayer books into Braille./nNemeth was an active member of the National Federation of the Blind. He has written several short stories and made speeches for the NFB about his life as a blind mathematician. On February 11, 2006, Nemeth had a massive heart attack, but recovered and was well enough to attend the July 2006 NFB convention and accept the 2006 Louis Braille award which the organization gave him. On July 9, 2009, he was honored by the NFB as a co-recipient of the Dr. Jacob Bolotin award./nNemeth's obituary was prematurely published twice in Jewish and blindness-related magazines, when workers at the magazines believed he had died when in fact his brother and wife had actually died./nNemeth was a member of the United States Democratic Party but was appointed by a Republican governor of Michigan as chairman of the state commission for the blind, a position in which he served for two years, though he said that he did not like politics./nHe was a proficient pianist who loved entertaining others, had an amazing memory for dates and information and enjoyed telling jokes and stories that he could match to almost any subject or occasion.[3]", "42743923": "Frank Ayres, Jr. (/\u025b\u0259rz/; 10 December 1901, Rock Hall, Maryland \u2013 June 1994) was a mathematics professor, best known as an author for the popular Schaum's Outlines./nAyres earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Washington College, Maryland and his master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago.

According to Witzel, this leaves Kak's approach attempt to date the text flawed, because this process of redaction took place long after the composition of the individual hymns during the samhita prose period.[5] Witzel concludes that the entire issue boiled down to an over-interpretation of some facts that were internally inconsistent and more, to the creativeness of Kak who was pre-motivated to find evidence of astronomy at every verse of Rig Veda.[5][30] Meera Nanda criticized the arbitrary and absurd nature of Kak's analysis at length and noted his method to be \"breathtakingly ad hoc\" which \"reads like numerology.\"[25] M A Mehendale, in a review over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, criticized the book for its many shortcomings which did not stand the scrutiny of rigor and remarked it to contain inaccurate and misleading statements.[31] S. G. Dani, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar prize recipient rejected Kak's hypothesis as unscientific and highly speculative with extremely vague details and whose results were statistically insignificant.[32]/nKlaus Klostermaier in his book A Survey of Hinduism praised Kak, for opening up an \"entirely new approach to the study of Vedic cosmology from an empirical astronomical/mathematical viewpoint\".[33] Klostermaier's books have been heavily criticized for offering pro-Hindu views that have little currency in scholarship.[34][35][36]/nKak's work influenced Raja Ram Mohan Roy's 1999 book Vedic Physics: Scientific Origin of Hinduism, which sought to prove that the RigVeda was coded per the laws of quantum and particle physics.[26] Kak wrote the foreword to this book commending Roy's interpretations as a new way of looking at Vedic Physics.[26][37] Meera Nanda, one of Kak's foremost critics, noted the result to be a \"shameful demeaning of physics as well as the Vedas\" and resembling \"ravings of mad men\".[26]/nKak co-authored In Search of the Cradle of Civilization with Georg Feuerstein and David Frawley, equating the Vedic Aryans with the Harappans and thus, participating in the political controversy around the \"Indigenous Aryans\" theory.[38][39] The chronology espoused in this book is based on the archaeoastronomical readings obtained by correlating textual references and archaeological remains./nA review by Indian archaeologist M. K. Dhavalikar over Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute noted it to be a \"beautifully printed\" contribution that made a strong case for their indigenous theory against the supposed migratory hypotheses, but chose to remain silent on certain crucial aspects which need to be convincingly explained.[39] Guy Beck showered glowing praises on the book in his review over the Yoga Journal.[40] Klostermaier et al. praised the book.[41] Prema Kurien noted that the book sought to distinguish expatriate Hindu Americans from other minority groups by demonstrating their superior racial and cultural ties with the Europeans.[42]/nEdwin Bryant calls him a well read and articulate spokesman for the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis and for other issues concerning ancient Indian science and culture.[43]/nScholars have rejected his theories in entirety and his writings have been heavily criticized.[5] Acute misrepresentation of facts coupled with wrong observations, extremely flexible and often self-contradictory analysis, cherry picking of data and forwarding of easily disprovable hypotheses have been located.[5][6][44][45] His understanding of linguistics and subsequent assertion have been challenged.[5][46] Romila Thapar calls Kak an amateur historian whose views on the Indus Civilization were fringe and who was part of a group that had more to do with waging political battles at the excuse of history.[47] Michael Witzel noted him to be a revisionist and part of a \"closely knit, self-adulatory group\", members of which often write together and/or profusely copy from and cite one another, thus rendering the whole scene into a virtually indistinguishable hotchpotch.[5] Garrett G. Fagan, a noted critic of pseudoarchaeology has concurred with Witzel.[20] Meera Nanda writes about Kak being revered as a stalwart of Hindutva and one of the leading \"intellectual Kshatriyas\".[26] Similar concerns of his being a Hindutva-based revisionist have been echoed by other writers.[6][48] In a critique of faulty scientific reasoning in Hindutva ideologies and theories, Alan Sokal sarcastically criticized Kak as \"one of the leading intellectual luminaries of the Hindu-nationalist diaspora\".[37] Koertge as well as Meera Nanda have remarked that Kak's work advances a Hindutva-based esoteric pseudoscience narrative that seeks to find relatively advanced abstract physics in Vedic texts and assign Indian indigenousness to the Sanskrit-speaking Indic Aryans in a bid to prove the superiority of the ancient Hindu civilization.[22][23]", "69974138": "Vilma Mar\u00eda Mesa Narv\u00e1ez (born 1963)[1] is a Colombian-American mathematics educator whose research topics have included secondary-school curriculum development, college-level calculus instruction, mathematics in community colleges, international perspectives in mathematics education, and inquiry-based learning.[2] She is a professor of education and mathematics at the University of Michigan, where she is affiliated with the Center for the Study of Higher and Post-secondary Education.[3]/nMesa earned her bachelor's degrees in computer science and mathematics at the University of Los Andes (Colombia) in 1986 and 1987, respectively,[4] and became a computer programmer for the Colombian government and in the private sector.[3] From 1988 to 1995 she worked as a researcher at the University of Los Andes,[4] working in mathematics education and authoring textbooks on mathematics and statistics for applications including engineering and social sciences.[3]/nIn 1996, she began graduate study in mathematics education at the University of Georgia, where she earned her master's degree in 1996 and completed her Ph.D. in 2000.[4] Her dissertation, Conceptions of Function Promoted by Seventh- and Eighth-Grade Textbooks from Eighteen Countries, was jointly advised by Jeremy Kilpatrick and Edward Arthur Azoff.[5]/nAfter postdoctoral research at the University of Michigan, she stayed on at the University of Michigan as a coordinator for the master's program in curriculum development and as an instructional consultant until she was hired in 2005 as an assistant professor of mathematics education in the School of Education.

He has made seminal contributions in motivic cohomology, moduli theory, intersection theory and enumerative geometry. A 2002 study of 891 academic collaborations in enumerative geometry and intersection theory covered by Mathematical Reviews found that he was not only the most prolific author in those areas, but also the one with the most collaborative ties, and the most central author of the field in terms of closeness centrality; the study's authors proposed to name the collaboration graph of the field in his honor.[2]/nIn 1989 the University of Copenhagen awarded him an honorary doctorate[3] and in May 2002 the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters hosted a conference in honor of his 60th birthday and elected him as a foreign member.[4] In 1992 Kleiman was elected foreign member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters./nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5] He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematics at Nice in 1970.[6]", "14694547": "Acheson Johnston Duncan (September 24, 1904 \u2013 January 7, 1995) was a 20th-century statistician and an acknowledged authority in the field of quality control.[1]/nA native of Leonia, New Jersey, he attended Princeton University, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1925, a master's degree in 1927 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1936.

He started his higher education at the School of Mechanics and Mathematics at the National University of Kharkov in 1968. He graduated with a Master of Science degree in Mathematics in 1973. In 1977,[1] he earned a Candidate of Sciences, an equivalent to a Ph.D. Chueshov earned a Doctorate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1990 with his dissertation, \"Mathematical Description of the Non-regular Dynamics of the Elastic Shell\". Upon graduation, he joined Kharkiv University's department of Mechanics and Mathematics./nChueshov became Professor of the Department of Mathematical Physics and Computational Mathematics in 1992. In February 2000, he was named the head of the department. In February 2009, Chueshov was elected as one of the Correspondent Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine for the Section of Mathematics, specializing in Probability Theory and Mathematical Physics. He was also a laureate of the State Prize of Ukraine in the field of science and technology, which he received in 2010. He remained at the Mechanics and Mathematics department of Kharkiv University, living with his wife Galina and two sons, Constantin (born in 1979, Kharkiv) and Gennadiy (born in 1983, Kharkiv), both now live in California, until his death on 23 April 2016 from acute leukemia./nChueshov authored a number of papers in the field of fundamental mathematics. He made significant contributions to mathematical physics and influenced the development of modern infinite-dimensional dynamical systems theory.[2] He solved a number of important problems associated with non-linear partial differential equations that arise in mechanics and physics, initiating the development of several areas in the qualitative theory of dissipative systems. Chueshov's investigations were related to the well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of the evolutionary von Karman equations, describing nonlinear oscillations of a thin elastic shell under the influence of non-conservative loads. One of Chueshov's theorems provided a solution to a well-known problem posed by I.V. Vorovich in the 1950s. The results became an essential step in understanding the structure of attractors for dynamical systems. Chueshov was also a pioneer in the field of nonlinear fluid-structure interactions models, especially those arising in aeroelasticity (for instance, the nonlinear model of a fluttering [link here] panel studied by Earl Dowell)./nChueshov succeeded in developing a new effective method for the analysis of general infinite-dimensional dissipative systems generated by non-linear second-order in time equations.[3][4] Quasi-stability allows one to resolve many important questions that arise in the hyperbolic dynamics with nonlinear internal or boundary dissipation, relying only on a single estimate. Chueshov also obtained important results on the uniqueness of invariant measures for stochastic perturbations of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in thin regions.[clarification needed] The results provided a fundamental opportunity to use methods of two-dimensional stochastic hydrodynamics to describe the phenomenon of turbulence in some three-dimensional systems./nIgor Dmitrievich was one of the founders of the theory of monotone stochastic dynamical systems. Together with Professor L.

He is portrayed by David Krumholtz./nEppes is portrayed as a young mathematical genius  and professor of applied mathematics at the fictional California Institute of Science, CalSci (primarily based on Caltech, where some filming and mathematics consulting is done). As a world-class mathematician, Charlie helps his brother Don Eppes solve many of his perplexing FBI cases, sometimes with the help of his best friend, mentor and colleague Larry Fleinhardt, and his on-again/off-again girlfriend, former student and now wife, Amita Ramanujan, who further refines Charlie's approach and helps him stay focused. Charlie has consulted for the National Security Agency (NSA), in part as a cryptanalyst, for nearly five years, having attained TS/SCI security clearance. It was revoked at the end of season four after he transmitted information to Pakistan, but was later re-instated./nAccording to Eppes' father, he could multiply four-digit numbers mentally at age three and at the age of four required special teachers. In the second grade, he attempted to find a 70-digit narcissistic number in base 12\u2014Eppes has described himself as \"quixotic\" in elementary school. A prodigy, he attended Princeton University at the age of 13 after graduating from high school at the same time as his brother who is five years his senior (\"Soft Target\"), and took Professor Lawrence Fleinhardt's quantum physics course in his first year. They became fast friends, with Fleinhardt establishing his academic connections. Eppes published his first mathematical treatise at the age of 14 (in the American Journal of Mathematics) and graduated at the age of 16. In fact, he was the youngest person to ever write a paper of importance./nIt was his paper on the Eppes Convergence, which concerned asymptotics of Hermitian random matrices, that made him a star in his field. Following a seminar that heavily criticized this seminal piece many years after its initial publication, Charlie realized that his work with the FBI has prevented him from doing research significant to other mathematicians and now hopes to spend decades on cognitive emergence theory (\"the mathematics of the brain\") to rectify this certain inequity, which has delighted Fleinhardt. Although he was a child prodigy, Charlie now laments the fact that his best years in his research will never come ahead of schedule again./nEppes is a multiple Ph.D. (\"Decoy Effect\"), a recipient of the Milton Prize and a nominee for the Fields Medal. Following his five-year research on random matrices, Charlie worked on sequences with orthogonal symmetry. He has also provided insights for possibly solving the P vs. NP problem and published works on H-infinity control of nonlinear systems and computational fluid dynamics, while his current research is in cognitive emergence theory. He has presented seminars on harmonic analysis and the zeros of random orthogonal polynomials and given lectures on group theory and Kac\u2013Moody algebras. Eppes has taught courses on calculus, chaos theory, fluid dynamics, game theory and probability at CalSci in addition to giving guest lectures on applied probability. The lecture in which he converted the classroom into a miniature casino for analyzing probabilities is considered an \"Eppes Classic\". Also, Eppes has taken over Fleinhardt's computational physics class when he was asked to do so, and has given a joint lecture on circular motion and the Coriolis effect with Fleinhardt. Professor Otto Bahnoff took over Eppes' mathematical physics grad seminar on the day he got married./nCharlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and frequently enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants to understand how the world works.[1] His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses a big heart and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is \"a talented theoretician with an ego problem\" and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a pragmatist. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of Occam's razor) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as \"audience visions\" or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, \"those cute little analogies.\") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes equations, often covering several chalkboards with a staccato clacking and the aid of a red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted\u2014he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive (\"one part exuberance, two parts obsession\"), especially when it comes to work, but he's rather na\u00efve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times./nHe is extremely talented in chess, as it requires both his father and brother to play against him and a distraction to defeat him. Charlie also has a vast understanding of theoretical physics, often assisting Larry with his multi-dimensional supergravity theory and papers on gravity waves, and biology, extending to knowledge of ciliate protozoa and the spread of infectious diseases. While brilliant in some areas, he is lacking in others. Dr. Fleinhardt has stated that it is a good thing he went into applied mathematics as opposed to engineering, as machines malfunction in his presence, though he was able to take apart and rebuild his father's cell phone to analyze its GPS transceiver. He is apparently a bad speller (e.g., he misspells \"anomaly\" and \"conceited\") and does not know the meaning of \"defenestration\" (for which Larry chastises him stating that the idealization is to be a Renaissance man and that even math and physics majors had to have a course on English). Thus, his father likes playing Scrabble with him./nCharlie is a rationalist.[2]  He is skeptical of UFOs,[3] psychic ability,[4][5] and gematria[6]\u2014all considered to be pseudosciences.  He also does not like illusions.[7]  He, however, is also fairly open-minded in terms of faith and religion.[2]/nThe episode \"Uncertainty Principle\" is significant for the backstory it gives on the familial relationships, particularly Charlie's difficulty in dealing with his mother's death from cancer. While it's unclear how Don reacted, Charlie spent the last three months of his mother's life isolated in the garage, incessantly working on one of the Millennium Prize Problems, specifically P vs NP; it's a point of contention between the brothers. Also, Charlie doesn't think Don understood what he went through during their school years, especially how he was treated as \"Don's brainiac little brother\" by his peers in high school, and how he often left him to his own resources as a child, though he was not as inept as Don had reasoned. However, Charlie's relationship with Don remains strong, as he has begun to increasingly fear for his brother's safety on the job and still looks to his older brother for acceptance. Charlie and his father worry about Don committing to relationships, and for a time, fear that he had been cheating on Robin Brooks. Ironically, Charlie has similar problems with women himself. After a couple dozen murder cases, Charlie is somewhat jaded and world-weary like his brother. FBI agent David Sinclair of Don's team even comments that he has never seen two brothers so similar and yet so different. In \"The Janus List\", the brothers seem to take on each other's tendencies a bit. Though, in season five, Charlie is dismayed that Don does not reveal to him his newfound religious faith./nIn \"Prime Suspect,\" Charlie purchases the beautiful Craftsman family home from his father, who continues to live with him. Now 30 years old, Charlie wants to be responsible and take care of his father but still believes that much of the pressures involving their dad has been put on his shoulders as Don doesn't seem to have enough time. Realizing this, Alan sets his sights on moving out to accomplish things on his own, with Charlie seemingly supporting the idea, but has since chosen to stay as he favors his son's company. Recently, Charlie is bothered by his father trying to impose his will on him with maintaining the house, as he is a full tenured professor at one of the most prestigious institutions in the country working on \"life-altering\" mathematics, i.e., in solving crimes. Alan just wants him to be responsible and not end up like Larry, though Mr. Eppes respects Fleinhardt. Even he has thought of this possibility and decides to do more around the home. After Charlie compares his own situation to that of Einstein his father looks into information on the physicist and understands his son's predicament. Charlie also feels guilty about the amount of time his parents, particularly his mother, who always was attuned to his way of thinking, spent with him as a child; he even asks his mother (JoBeth Williams) in a dream if she regrets the time away from Don and Alan because of the special attention he needed growing up./nCharlie's research often interferes with his relationships: as with Amita on their first date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt says that it is a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but by the middle of the third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about the men she dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her./nUnforeseen complications with his work emerge as the new Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, Dr. Mildred Finch, in the episode \"Waste Not\", makes Charlie head of the Ph.D. admissions committee against his wishes, bogging him down with more work, and gives him pressures about using the school's supercomputer for FBI work or missing classes for such. This leads to Charlie being confrontational, but she calms him when she says she just wants him to be \"the Sean Connery of the mathematics department.\" In the episode \"Take Out\", Charlie and Millie attend a black tie reception for CalSci fundraising and bond. Soon after, Charlie is asked by Millie to meet with Macmillan Pharmaceuticals, which according to Amita has a reputation for exploiting third-world countries. Amita serves as his conscience in this matter, and he goes to see Dr. Finch about it. With \"Pythagorean wit,\" he dazzles Macmillan and is to serve as a mathematical consultant for the pharmaco-kinetic modelling project, only under the provision that CalSci will administer the trials and monitor the drug at every step, all computational analyses are conducted by Charlie and his team, and 5% of the gross will go to third-world AIDS organizations chosen by Professors Eppes and Ramanujan . In \"Democracy\", as part of his duties, he recruits the young fantasy baseball and sabermetrics fanatic Oswald Kittner (Jay Baruchel), who shows great promise, to attend CalSci./nWhen Larry announces his leave of absence to board the International Space Station (in the episode \"Brutus\"), Charlie is shocked and upset. He is in denial about Larry's ambitions and he thinks reason of the risks involved will assert itself firmly in Larry's mind. He reasons that apparently Larry wouldn't do such a thing. Larry remands his few prized possessions to him, and he is grateful for the gesture. When he tells him his concerns, Larry is angered. Amita says to Larry, \"[Charlie] has never dreamt of something he couldn't reach, so he has no idea what it is like to want something he is not able to get. So how could he understand how much [Larry] you would give up when this chance comes along?\" Larry understands and decides to ignore Charlie's protestations. Though neither apologize, they are on good terms. Charlie says to Amita that he does not know what he would do without him, as he peruses through Larry's precious items that were bestowed upon him. In \"Killer Chat\", he says that he was glad that Larry's dream could come true, but feels conflicted about being relieved when he discovers that Larry might have been scrapped from the mission when NASA learned of his eccentric indulgences such as sleeping in the campus steam tunnels. However, Charlie agrees with Megan in wanting to help Larry and personally vouches for him. Eppes' words and affiliation with the NSA gets him back on the mission, thus, repaying a debt as Larry helped launch him into the academic firmament. Earlier, he had given him back his lucky T-shirt./nIn \"The Art of Reckoning\", Charlie is initially overjoyed to see his friend Larry return, but Charlie is dismayed with Larry's lack of enthusiasm in life, so Charlie doesn't object to him readjusting at a monastery. His concern is apparent, and he says he just wants his friend back./nSince then, in \"Trust Metric\", Charlie is pleased to see his friend doing well, feeling that he needed a friend, and is glad to have focused on teaching while Don did not include him with FBI work; though, on previous occasions, he expressed the desire to be involved. Granger's escape from the prison bus causes him to become active in helping his brother once more, allowing him a chance to use set covering deployment./nDr. Finch tells him to publish, and so he has renewed interest in old research, having decided to publish one of his eleventh-grade papers he started at nine years old, \"The Mathematics of Friendship,\" with an addendum. A publishing company has turned his work into a classic book for those not mathematically inclined, while opting for a title with more pizazz, \"Friendship, As Easy as Pi.\" Charlie takes joy in the belief that this book will allow his thoughts to reach a much wider audience than before. By the episode \"In Security,\" the published book appears with the title \"The Attraction Equation\" and a dapper photo on the back cover of him holding a sculpture of a stellated icosidodecahedron with bevelled edges. A decision theoretic approach to relationships is covered in the book. His proud father hands copies to friends and Larry sells signed copies on eBay. He apparently has some fans and gives into a televised interview./nIn \"Checkmate\", Charlie is training in weapons and tactics in LA's FBI school, where he is shown to have a high skill in marksmanship at the range, impressing many of his FBI training peers as well as his instructor, which he credits to following Wyatt Earp's preference for careful accuracy instead of rapid firing. He is given a certificate of marksmanship by the FBI. In the episode \"Pay to Play\", Charlie convinces Don to let him join the team when they go to arrest a suspect, mentioning that he passed the FBI course./nIn the season four finale \"When Worlds Collide\", Charlie helps an innocent colleague accused of terrorism by sending genetic research to scientists at Pakistani universities which is prohibited, with full cognizance of the consequences. As a result, Charlie is arrested, loses his security clearance and ultimately loses his ability to help Don on FBI cases. Once again, Charlie holds strong to his ideals. In the previous season's \"Burn Rate\", Charlie has strong opinions concerning genetic engineering, believing bomb suspect, fellow prodigy, and former Feynman student Emmett Glaser's ideas about genetic predeterminism are rational, not incendiary, and helps to clear his name./nThe charges against Dr. Eppes are dropped. For a time, Don Eppes' team is attempting to make do with Fleinhardt's and Amita's expertise, but Charles' assistance is sorely missed to the point of consulting him secretly.  For his part, Charles has been convinced by his lawyer and father to attempt to have his clearance restored. Even Don supports the idea and stands up to security clearance investigator Carl McGowan (Keith Carradine), stating to go after him, not his brother. Temporarily, Charlie works as a LAPD consultant until the fiasco with his security clearance can be resolved. He later gets his clearance back and is working with his brother and the FBI again. He is trying to assert himself in the methodology used to solve a crime, having struggled with not being included, but some friction arises with Amita and Larry./nCharlie works once again with rival Marshall Penfield, as they settle their differences (\"Frienemies\"). Also, he is chosen to be the head of the think tank model comprising himself, Larry, Alan, and Amita (\"Jacked\"). As Dr. Eppes applies the Turing Test to a seemingly unique artificial intelligence, he is tricked only to come to the realization that the computer only uses a recursive algorithm to apply the most human responses, while simultaneously being tempted by an offer to work for DARPA. Head of DARPA special projects Jane Karellen (Nancy Travis) knows that he has a limited window to use his genius and tells Charlie that he is one of the top five minds on the planet. Amita's life is even threatened by the advanced computer (\"First Law\")./nLate in season five, Charlie moves into a new office.  While moving, he gets some inspiration for his cognitive emergence theory, which causes him to momentarily set aside his work on a series of home invasions for Don.  Don is stabbed while attempting to arrest the home invaders (\"The Fifth Man\").  Charlie blames himself for Don being stabbed and throws himself into his FBI consultation work as a result (\"Disturbed\").  This worries everyone, especially Don, who tells him to \"do whatever you want to do\" (\"Greatest Hits\") while visiting Charlie in his new office. Around this time, Charlie is also presented with a series of letters from previous successive holders of this prestigious office, wherein each celebrated mathematician writes of accomplishments they intend to achieve, passing down the torch to the next in line to do the same. At first Charlie is hesitant, until the very determined Amita convinces him to write the corresponding letter and eases his burdens, as Charlie fears he cannot meet his destiny with so much weight to succeed being placed on his shoulders his entire life./nAt the end of the season, while leaving for dinner, Charlie is attacked, and Amita is kidnapped.  Charlie is so emotionally distraught that he cannot think of the math needed to find Amita. With the help of Don, Alan, and David, Charlie snaps out of it to locate Amita.  Amita is rescued.  He realizes that he did not want to lose Amita, and he proposes to her (\"Angels and Devils\")./nAt the end the premiere episode of the program's sixth season, it was revealed that Amita has accepted Charlie's proposal. The issue was skirted throughout the episode, as the two were waiting until Amita officially received permission from her parents. He and Amita discuss the number of children that they want to have, and they both decide that they may need to participate in the Big Brother/Big Sister program for some practical experience before having children. He and Amita attempt to find a wedding date that is suited to their and their families' schedules; Alan suggests that they should take his and Margaret's anniversary date as Charlie and Amita's date. Charlie and Amita have since pushed the date forward as his academic fantasy has come to light, being a visiting professor at Cambridge University. In the season finale, after the wedding ceremony presided over by Larry, he is happy but worries about disconnecting with Don and offers to have the garage renovated into a guest house for his father. He toasts his friends and family and amazes at the prospect of staying in England with his wife./nLong intrigued by mathematicians and scientists, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nick Falacci created a show with one as the protagonist.[8]  Inspiration for Charlie came specifically from Richard Feynman.[9]  Finding the actor who would portray Charlie would be a challenge.  Over one hundred actors auditioned for the role of Charlie Eppes.[10]  One of the actors was David Krumholtz, who later admitted in an interview with TVGuide.com and in an interview with USA Weekend's Lorrie Lynch to failing math in high school.[11][12]  Krumholtz was cast as Charlie because of his ability to make math sound natural.[13]/nTo prepare for his role of Charlie Eppes, Krumholtz spent some time at Caltech talking to professors and walking the Caltech campus,[14] attempting to understand both the basics of the math and the mathematician's mind.[1]  He even spoke with Dr. Tony Chan of UCLA about mathematicians\u2019 work while filming the first pilot.[15]  Math consultants helped Krumholtz understand the basics of the equations on the show.[16]  Early on, Professor Rick Wilson's graduate student, David Grynkiewicz, showed Krumholtz how to write his own equations and even filled in for his hand in several episodes.[14]  Krumholtz later frequently wrote the equations himself.[1]/nKrumholtz memorizes the pages of mathematical equations and concepts that are a part of the script.[17]  When doing scenes involving audience-visions, Krumholtz prefers to recite his lines as the cameras are rolling; producers went along with this because they reasoned that if the cameras weren't rolling, the lines wouldn't make it into the show.[10]  (Audience visions are Charlie's visually-aided explanations of the mathematics involved in a case.[18])/nEarly reception of Charlie varied according to the audience in question. Due to television production's traditional approach of utilizing only two worlds for filming, production staff initially opposed the idea of Charlie being a college professor.[19] Some even unsuccessfully suggested to Heuton and Falacci that Charlie should be working with the FBI full-time as an employee.[20]/nWhen the pilot was previewed, the reception was more positive.  CBS executive Nina Tassler liked Charlie.[20]  The focus group that watched the original pilot for Numb3rs loved him.[8][21]/nWhen Numb3rs was previewed for the TV critics, the reception was different.  Melanie McFarland, TV critic for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, stated that Charlie was not original as of the Pilot.[22] According to Lauren Aaronson of Popular Science, Charlie's expertise seems a little bit incredible.[23]  Robert Bianco of USA Today, however, called Krumholtz, as Charlie, \"appealing\".[24]  Toni Fitzgerald of Media Life Magazine stated that Krumholtz, as Charlie, \"stands out\".[25]/nSince the early days of the series, the character of Charlie Eppes has become more widely accepted.  Krumholtz appeared at the 2005 National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) convention in Anaheim.[26] Since then, Krumholtz receives cheers when he attends math conventions.[11]  In a public service announcement, Krumholtz congratulated the Federal Bureau of Investigation on their 100th anniversary.[27] Charlie was one of the first geeks on primetime television who paved the way for other shows starring geeks such as Bones, Chuck and The Big Bang Theory.[28]  Charlie was a runner-up in the category of \"Sexiest Brainiac\" in TV Guide's poll in 2007.[29]/nCharlieVision (as labeled by the show's creators) is the mode in which Charlie's insights are displayed on-screen. It consists of fast-paced visions or cutscenes often characterized by false-color images that integrate his analogies and mathematical models, usually followed by him rushing off to tell Don about his new insights.

Amongst many others, he was involved in the first Soviet nuclear bomb (RDS-1) and the design of the first Soviet two-stage hydrogen bomb (RDS-37)./nZababakhin was born in Moscow. After completing seven-year school in 1931, he joined the Moscow College of Food Industry. The focus of this technical college changed to the manufacture of ball bearings. He graduated in 1936, and was sent to the Sharikopodshipnik factory, eventually becoming the senior foreman operating lathes. In 1938, he enrolled at the Moscow State University to study physics before leading a Komsomol platoon from 1941, building defences against Nazi Germany in Roslavl, Smolensk Oblast. In September that year he was sent as a new recruit to the Air Force Engineering Academy in Zhukovsky. He graduated with honours in 1944 - as a captain - and went to the department of ballistics, teaching. He submitted a postgraduate thesis on converging shock waves in 1947. That year, he was also elected a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (until 1952) and took part in the 13th, 14th and 15th congresses of the Communist Party. Professor D.A. Ventsel, his dissertation supervisor, recommended that he go to the Institute of Chemical Physics as an assistant in Yakov Zeldovich's laboratory, part of the Soviet atomic bomb project. Zel'dovich noted the 30-year-old as a modest and shy, but talented and strong-willed. He saw how close the dissertation was to his own laboratory's work - his notes were classified and destroyed by the authorities, but Zababakhin welcomed an able physicist.[1][2][3]/nHe was transferred to the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod to KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11', also known as Arzamas-16 or the 'Installation'), the new centre of Soviet nuclear weapons design. After the test of the first Soviet nuclear weapon in 1949, the RDS-1, he received the first of his national awards, the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize, for his contribution. His original theoretical work helped to produce the next device, the RDS-2, tested in 1951 and improvements and primary theoretical work in many further devices including the first Soviet hydrogen bomb, the RDS-37. Under Igor Kurchatov he completed his thesis to become a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences.[1][4]/nSoviet authorities instigated a second weapons design installation at Chelyabinsk-70 (now Snezhinsk) in 1955, NII-1011 (Scientific Research Institute-1011), with Zababakhin as head of the theoretical department and deputy supervisor. Developments here led to the first of the Soviet army's weaponised nuclear charges in 1957. Further weapons were created here. He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in 1958 and he became the supervisor of NII-1011 in 1960, a role he remained in for the rest of his life.[1][5]/nIn Autumn 1962, Andrei Sakharov, who had been supervising Boris Kozlov's team producing a hydrogen bomb for atmospheric testing at KB-11, considered there was no justifiable reason for a similar device created by Zababakhin's team at NII-1011. Concerned that the fallout would eventually kill thousands of people unnecessarily, he appealed first to Yulii Khariton (in charge of Soviet weapons design, who thought the appeal was invidious and divisive considering poor relations between the groups), then to premier Nikita Khrushchev (who said he felt ill), then to Efim Slavsky\u00a0[ru], minister of medium machine building (who initially supported him). Sakharov visited NII-1011. Zababakhin delivered a stiff response, insisting that his device must be tested. Sakharov shouted that this was tantamount to murder, but Zababakhin and his team were unmoved. Both devices were detonated, Zababakin's one first.[6]/nHe performed experiments in the usage of nuclear charges for civilian enterprises with Boris Litvinov\u00a0[ru] such as extinguishing gas flares and ore and fossil fuel production. In 1968, he was elected a full member of the Academy of Sciences. He supervised many graduate and postgraduate students of Science.

He did his undergraduate studies in physics at Queens College, City University of New York, graduating in 1943. He taught mathematics briefly at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign but then moved to the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he designed radar antennas from 1944 to 1946. He finished a Ph.D. in physics at MIT in 1948, with a dissertation entitled Asymptotic Solution of Relaxation Oscillation Problems under the supervision of Norman Levinson, and took a job at Bell Laboratories where he remained for the rest of his career.

The main idea is that in a maximal code (one to which no additional codeword can be added), the Hamming balls of the given distance must cover the entire codespace, so the number of codewords must at least equal the total volume of the codespace divided by the volume of a single ball.[5] For 30 years, until the invention of algebraic geometry codes in 1982, codes constructed in this way were the best ones known.[6]/nThe Gilbert\u2013Elliott model, developed by Gilbert in 1960 and E. O. Elliot in 1963,[G60][7] is a mathematical model for the analysis of transmission channels in which the errors occur in bursts. It posits that the channel may be in either of two different states, with different error rates, that errors occur independently of each other once the state is known, and that the changes from one state to the other are governed by a Markov chain. It is \"very convenient and often used\" in the analysis of modern communications systems such as data links to mobile telephones.[8]/nCentral to the theory of random graphs is the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model, in which edges are chosen randomly for a fixed set of n vertices. It was introduced in two forms in 1959 by Gilbert, Paul Erd\u0151s, and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi.[G59][9] In Gilbert's G(n, p) form, each potential edge is chosen to be included in the graph or excluded from it, independently of the other edges, with probability p. Thus, the expected number of edges is pn(n \u2212 1)/2, but the actual number of edges can vary randomly and all graphs have a nonzero probability of being selected. In contrast, in the G(n, M) model introduced by Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi, the graph is chosen uniformly at random among all M-edge graphs; the number of edges is fixed, but the edges are not independent of each other, because the presence of an edge in one position is negatively correlated with the presence of an edge in a different position. Although these two models end up having similar properties, the G(n, p) model is often more convenient to work with due to the independence of its edges.[10]/nIn the mathematics of shuffling playing cards, the Gilbert\u2013Shannon\u2013Reeds model, developed in 1955 by Gilbert and Claude Shannon[G55] and independently in unpublished work in 1981 by Jim Reeds, is a probability distribution on permutations of a set of n items that, according to experiments by Persi Diaconis, accurately models human-generated riffle shuffles. In this model, a deck of cards is split at a point chosen randomly according to a binomial distribution, and the two parts are merged with the order of merging chosen uniformly at random among all possible mergers. Equivalently, it is the inverse of a permutation formed by choosing independently at random for each card whether to put it into one of two piles (maintaining the original order of the cards within each pile), and then stacking the two piles on top of each other.[11]/nGilbert tessellations are a mathematical model of crack formation introduced by Gilbert in 1967.[G67] In this model, fractures begin at a set of random points, with random orientations, chosen according to a Poisson process, and then grow at a constant rate until they terminate by running into previously formed cracks.[12]/nIn 1961, Gilbert introduced the random plane network[13] (more commonly referred to now as a random geometric graph (RGG), or Gilbert Disk model) where points are placed on the infinite plane using a suitable Point Process and nodes connect if and only if they are within some critical connection range R; wireless communication networks were suggested as the main the application for this work. From this formulation a simple result follows that for a stationary Poisson point process in \u211d2 with density \u03bb the expected degree of each node is the number of points found within the connectivity range, namely, \u03c0\u03bbR2. A natural question to ask after formulating such a graph is what is the critical mean degree to ensure there is a giant component; in essence this question gave rise to the field of continuum percolation theory. By using a branching process Gilbert was able to provide an initial lower bound for the critical mean degree (equivalently the critical transmission range). By choosing an arbitrary point in the process (call this the zeroth generation), find all points within a connection distance R (first generation). Repeat the process for all points in the first generation ignoring any previously found and continue this process until it dies out. The associated branching process is one where the mean number of offspring is a Poisson random variable with intensity equal to the mean degree in the original RGG (\u03c0\u03bbR2). From here only standard branching process techniques need be applied to obtain a lower bound. Furthermore, Gilbert showed that by reframing the problem into one about bond percolation, an upper bound for the giant component can obtained. The method consists of discritizing the plane such that any two nodes in adjacent squares are connected; and allowing each square to represents an edge on the lattice. By construction, if there is a giant component in the bond percolation problem then there must be a giant component in the RGG./nGilbert did important work on the Steiner tree problem in 1968, formulating it in a way that unified it with network flow problems.[G68] In Gilbert's model, one is given a flow network in which each edge is given both a cost and a capacity, and a matrix of flow amounts between different pairs of terminal vertices; the task is to find a subnetwork of minimum cost whose capacities are sufficient to support a flow with the given flow amounts between any pair of terminals. When the flow amounts are all equal, this reduces to the classical Steiner tree problem.[14]/nGilbert discovered Costas arrays independently of and in the same year as Costas,[G65][15] and is also known for his work with John Riordan on counting necklaces in combinatorics.[16] He collaborated with Fan Chung, Ron Graham, and Jack van Lint on partitions of rectangles into smaller rectangles.[CGG]", "37009604": "Katsumi Nomizu (\u91ce\u6c34 \u514b\u5df1, Nomizu Katsumi, December 1, 1924\u00a0\u2013 November 5, 2008) was a Japanese-American mathematician known for his work in differential geometry./nNomizu was born in Osaka, Japan on the first day of December, 1924.

He also authored the books Lady Luck: The Theory of Probability, first published in 1963 and republished in 1982, Elementary Mathematical Analysis, and an autobiography called Scene of Change.[4]/nThe home of the Courant Institute at New York University is Warren Weaver Hall./nOne naturally wonders if the problem of translation could conceivably be treated as a problem in cryptography. When I look at an article in Russian, I say: 'This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I will now proceed to decode./nWeaver had first mentioned the possibility of using digital computers to translate documents between natural human languages in March 1947 in a letter to the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener. In the following two years, he had been urged by his colleagues at the Rockefeller Foundation to elaborate on his ideas. The result was a memorandum, entitled simply \"Translation\", which he wrote in July 1949 at Carlsbad, New Mexico.[8]/nSaid to be probably the single most influential publication in the early days of machine translation, it formulated goals and methods before most people had any idea of what computers might be capable of, and was the direct stimulus for the beginnings of research first in the United States and then later, indirectly, throughout the world. The impact of Weaver's memorandum is attributable not only to his widely recognized expertise in mathematics and computing, but also, and perhaps even more, to the influence he enjoyed with major policy-makers in U.S. government agencies.[9]/nWeaver's memorandum was designed to suggest more fruitful methods than any simplistic word-for-word approach, which had grave limitations. He put forward four proposals. The first was that the problem of multiple meanings might be tackled by the examination of immediate context.  For example, the English word fast has at least two meanings which we can paraphrase as rapid or motionless.  If we wish to translate an English text, it is likely that these two senses of fast correspond to different words in the target language, and in order to translate the word correctly one needs to know which sense is intended.  Weaver proposed that this problem could be solved by looking at the words that occur in the vicinity of the word to be translated, and he conjectured that the number of context words that would be required is fairly small./nThe second proposal in the memorandum was inspired by work on an early type of neural networks by McCulloch and Pitts. Weaver interpreted these results as meaning that given a set of premises, any logical conclusion could be deduced automatically by computer. To the extent that human language has a logical basis, Weaver hypothesized that translation could be addressed as a problem of formal logic, deducing \"conclusions\" in the target language from \"premises\" in the source language./nThe third proposal was that cryptographic methods were possibly applicable to translation.  If we want to translate, say, a Russian text into English, we can take the Russian original as an encrypted version of the English plaintext.  Weaver was especially impressed with the potential of Shannon's classified work on cryptography and Information theory from World War II./nFinally, the fourth proposal was that there may also be linguistic universals underlying all human languages which could be exploited to make the problem of translation more straightforward.  Weaver argued for this position using a metaphor: \"Think, by analogy, of individuals living in a series of tall closed towers, all erected over a common foundation. When they try to communicate with one another, they shout back and forth, each from his own closed tower. It is difficult to make the sound penetrate even the nearest towers, and communication proceeds very poorly indeed. But, when an individual goes down his tower, he finds himself in a great open basement, common to all the towers. Here he establishes easy and useful communication with the persons who have also descended from their towers\". He was inspired by Erwin Reifler,[10] who in 1948 presented a paper entitled \"the Chinese Language in the Light of Comparative Semantics\" at the American Philosophical Society annual conference. The abstract of the paper was published by Science in the same year, which was referred to in the memorandum./nWeaver's memorandum triggered immediate action from the part of other MT specialists. One of the first people on the scene was Erwin Reifler, mentioned in the memorandum itself.[11] In a study published in January 1950, he put forward the idea of pre- and post-editing with the assumption that fully automated translation can only be done on the basis of word-for-word substitutions, which would cause inadequacies and errors in the generated translation. His suggestion for eliminating the problem was implementing a human pre-editor with the knowledge of the output language, who would add additional symbols for grammatical, lexical and logical correctness. The post editor, in turn, would have the task of rendering the text generated by MT reasonable and logical; ideally, he would have the knowledge of the source language.[11]/nWeaver understood how greatly the tools and techniques of physics and chemistry could advance knowledge of biological processes, and used his position in the Rockefeller Foundation to identify, support, and encourage the young scientists who years later earned Nobel Prizes and other honours for their contributions to genetics or molecular biology./nWeaver was awarded the Public Welfare Medal by the National Academy of Sciences in 1957.[12] In 1965 he was awarded the first Arches of Science Medal for outstanding contributions to the public understanding of the meaning of science to contemporary men and women, and UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for distinguished contributions to the popular understanding of science./nHe also received the Medal for Merit, a position as an officer in the Legion of Honour, and the King's Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom.[4]/nWeaver was fascinated by Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In 1964, having built up a collection of 160 versions in 42 languages, Weaver wrote a book about the translation history of Alice, called Alice in Many Tongues: The Translations of Alice in Wonderland.[13] Among other features, it provides excerpts from the business correspondence of the author, Lewis Carroll (the Reverend Charles Dodgson), dealing with publishing royalties and permissions as Alice's fame snowballed worldwide. Ever the scientist, even in the area of literature, Weaver devised a design for evaluating the quality of the various translations, focusing on the nonsense, puns and logical jokes in the Mad Tea-Party scene. His range of contacts provided an impressive if eccentric list of collaborators in the evaluation exercise, including anthropologist Margaret Mead (for the South Pacific Pidgin translation), longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, and Nobel laureate biochemist Hugo Theorell (Swedish). The book Alice in a World of Wonderlands (2015) continues and updates Weaver's endeavour, analyzing Alice translations in 174 languages in a similar vein.[14]", "39368907": "Robin Lyth Hudson (4 May 1940 \u2013 12 January 2021) was a British mathematician notable for his contribution to quantum probability./nHudson received his Ph.D. from the University of Oxford in 1966 under John T.

He published over one hundred scholarly papers, 35 with coauthors, and wrote book reviews.[1][2][3]/nIn 1930 Brenner earned a B.A. degree with major in chemistry from Harvard University. In graduate study there he was influenced by Hans Brinkmann, Garrett Birkhoff, and Marshall Stone. He was granted the Ph.D. in February 1936.[3] Brenner later described some of his reminiscences of his student days at Harvard and of the state of American mathematics in the 1930s in an article for American Mathematical Monthly.[4]/nIn 1951 Brenner published his findings about matrices with quaternion entries.[5] He developed the idea of a characteristic root of a quaternion matrix (an eigenvalue) and shows that they must exist. He also shows that a quaternion matrix is unitarily-equivalent to a triangular matrix./nIn 1956 he became a Senior Mathematician at Stanford Research Institute.\nBrenner, in collaboration with Donald W. Bushaw and S. Evanusa, assisted in the translation and revision of Felix Gantmacher's Applications of the Theory of Matrices (1959).[6]/nBrenner translated Nikolaj Nikolaevi\u010d Krasovskii's book Stability of motion: applications of Lyapunov's second method to differential systems and equations with delay (1963). He also translated and edited the book Problems in differential equations by Aleksei Fedorovich Filippov./nBrenner translated Problems in Higher Algebra[7] by D. K. Faddeev and I.S. Sominiski. The exercises in this book covered complex numbers, roots of unity, as well as some linear algebra and abstract algebra./nIn 1959 Brenner generalized propositions by Alexander Ostrowski and G. B. Price on minors of a diagonally dominant matrix.[8] His work is credited with stimulating a reawakening of interest in the permanent of a matrix.[9]/nOne of the challenges in linear algebra is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix of complex numbers. In 1931 S. A. Gershgorin described geometric bounds on the eigenvectors in terms of the matrix elements. This result known as the Gershgorin circle theorem has been used as a basis for extension. In 1964 Brenner reported on Theorems of Gersgorin Type.[10] In 1967 at University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison, working in the Mathematics Research Center, he produced a technical report New root-location theorems for partitioned matrices.[11]/nIn 1968 Brenner, following Alston Householder, published \"Gersgorin theorems by Householder\u2019s proof\".[12] In 1970 he published the survey article (21 references) \"Gersgorin theorems, regularity theorems, and bounds for determinants of partitioned matrices\".[13] The article was extended with \"Some determinantal identities\".[14]/nIn 1971 Brenner extended his geometry of the spectrum of a square complex matrix deeper into abstract algebra with his paper \"Regularity theorems and Gersgorin theorems for matrices over rings with valuation\".[15] He writes, \"Theorems can be extended to non-commutative domains, in particular to quaternion matrices. Secondly, the ring of polynomials has a valuation ... a different type of regularity ...\"/nJoel Lee Brenner was a member of the American Mathematical Society from 1936./nBeasley relates that he/nIn 1981 Brenner and Roger Lyndon collaborated to polish an idea due to H. W. Kuhn for proving the fundamental theorem of algebra. In the solution by Eric S. Rosenthal to a problem in the American Mathematical Monthly posted by Harry D. Ruderman,[16] Kuhn's work from 1974 was cited. A query was made and prompted an article by Brenner and Lyndon.[17] The version of the fundamental theorem stated was as follows:/nBrenner ultimately acquired 35 coauthors in his publications./nGiven an ordered set \u03a9 with n elements, the even permutations on it determine the alternating group An. In 1960 Brenner proposed the following research problem in group theory:[18] For which An does there exist an element an such that every element g is similar to a commutator of an? Brenner states that the property is true for 4 < n < 10; in symbols it may be expressed/nThe alternating groups are simple groups, and in 1971 Brenner began a series of articles titled \"Covering theorems for finite simple groups\". He was interested in the cycle type of cyclic permutations, and when An \u2282 C C, where C is a conjugacy class of a certain type.[19][20][21]/nIn 1977 he posed the question, \"What permutations in An can be expressed as a product of permutations of periods k and l\"\u00a0?[22]/nIn 1987 Linear Algebra and its Applications published a list of 111 articles by J.L.

His pioneering book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, consolidated many previous results and established classical mechanics.[8][9] Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.[10][11] He is considered one of the greatest and most influential scientists in history.[7][12][13][14][15]/nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.[16] He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems./nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves./nNewton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. He refused to take holy orders in the Church of England, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689\u20131690 and 1701\u20131702. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696\u20131699) and Master (1699\u20131727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703\u20131727)./nIsaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643[a]) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.[17] His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug.[18] When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (n\u00e9e Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\"[19] Newton's mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.[20]/nFrom the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School in Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.[21] He was removed from school and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.[22] Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,[23] distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.[24]/nIn June 1661, Newton was admitted to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. His uncle Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a subsizar, paying his way by performing valet duties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his MA.[25] At the time, Cambridge's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo Galilei and Thomas Street. He set down in his notebook a series of \"Quaestiones\" about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague./nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,[26] Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the next two years saw the development of his theories on calculus,[27] optics, and the law of gravitation.[28][29]/nIn April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.[30][31] Fellows were required to take holy orders and be ordained as Anglican priests, although this was not enforced in the Restoration years, and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient. He made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7\u00a0years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\"[32] Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the Thirty-nine Articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.[33]/nHis academic work impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. The terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church \u2013 presumably[weasel\u00a0words] to leave more time for science. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.[34]/nNewton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.[1]/nNewton's work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\".[35] His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers.[36] His work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".[37] Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.[10][11][38] Leibniz's notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.[citation needed]/nHis work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\"[39] and explained why he put his expositions in this form,[40] remarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"[41] Because of this, the Principia has been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times[42] and in Newton's time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\"[43] His use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his De motu corporum in gyrum of 1684[44] and in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".[45]/nNewton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.[46] He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz.[47] In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.[48] Starting in 1699, other members[who?] of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism.[49] The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.[50]/nNewton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.[51]/nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.[53][54] This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light \u2013 a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate./nFrom 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.[55] During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism.[56] Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.[57]/nHe showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.[58]/nFrom this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem.[59][60] Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope,[60] involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,[61] he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope.[62] Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours,[63] which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679\u201380, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,[64] which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.[65]/nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave\u2013particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light./nIn his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived his interest in alchemy.[66] He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that \"Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians.\"[67] Newton's contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.[66] This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science, and had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity./nIn 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another,\u00a0... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"[68] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.[69]/nIn his book Opticks, Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays.[70] Some 278 years after Newton's discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.[70]/nSubsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Young and Fresnel discarded Newton's particle theory in favour of Huygens' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour,\u00a0... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.\"[71]/nNewton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.[28][29] In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679\u201380 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions.[64] Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680\u20131681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed.[72] After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684.[73] This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia./nThe Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.[74]/nIn the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.[74] Newton's biographer David Brewster reported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton's health: \"[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep\" during his work on the problem in 1692\u201393, and told the astronomer John Machin that \"his head never ached but when he was studying the subject\". According to Brewster, Edmund Halley also told John Conduitt that when pressed to complete his analysis Newton \"always replied that it made his head ache, and kept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more\". [Emphasis in original][75]/nNewton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System\u2014developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.[76] For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)[77]/nNewton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing \"occult agencies\" into science.[78] Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression \"hypotheses non-fingo\".[79])/nWith the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised.[80] He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.[81]/nIn 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types.[82] In 1717, and probably with Newton's help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.[83]/nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7\u2014the Johannine Comma\u2014and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.[84]/nNewton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.[85] He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.[86]/nNewton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30\u00a0years of his life.[87][88] These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters./nAs Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20\u00a0percent of the coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.[89]/nDisguised as a habitu\u00e9 of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself.[90] For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a justice of the peace in all the home counties. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton's personal first edition of Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which he must have been amending at the time.[91] Then he conducted more than 100\u00a0cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28\u00a0coiners.[92]/nNewton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies.[94]/nIn April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.[95] Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon.[96]/nAs a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21\u00a0silver shillings.[97] This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not.[98] It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.[99]/nNewton was invested in the South Sea Company and lost some \u00a320,000 (\u00a34.4\u00a0million in 2020[100]) when it collapsed in around 1720.[101]/nToward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with his niece and her husband, until his death.[102] His half-niece, Catherine Barton,[103] served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her \"very loving Uncle\",[104] according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox./nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727).[a] He was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens. He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey.[105] Voltaire may have been present at his funeral.[106] A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate.[107] His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton.[108]/nShortly after his death, a plaster death mask was moulded of Newton. It was used by Flemish sculptor John Michael Rysbrack in making a sculpture of Newton.[109] It is now held by the Royal Society,[110] who created a 3D scan of it in 2012.[111][112]/nNewton's hair was posthumously examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.[107]/nAlthough it was claimed that he was once engaged,[b] Newton never married. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton's funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women\u2014a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments\".[114] There exists a widespread belief that Newton died a virgin, and writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton,[115] economist John Maynard Keynes,[116] and physicist Carl Sagan have commented on it.[117]/nNewton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around 1689[81]\u2014some of their correspondence has survived.[118][119] Their relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown,[120] which included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends Samuel Pepys and John Locke. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke \"endeavoured to embroil me with woemen\".[121]/nNewton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\"[122] Two writers think that the sentence, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than\u2014or in addition to\u2014a statement of modesty.[123][124] On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his Jacula Prudentum (1651), had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the 'dwarf'./nIn a later memoir, Newton wrote, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"[125]/nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity,[126] with one historian labelling him a heretic.[127]/nBy 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972.[128] Over half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed.[128] His writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early Church writings and show that in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined the Creed, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\"[129] He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the great apostasy was trinitarianism.\"[130]/nNewton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.[131]/nIn Newton's eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to him the fundamental sin.[132] In 1999, historian Stephen D. Snobelen wrote, \"Isaac Newton was a heretic. But\u00a0... he never made a public declaration of his private faith\u2014which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.\"[127] Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.[127]/nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun\".[134]/nAlong with his scientific fame, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John.[135] He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.[136]/nHe believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the Principia \"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\".[137] He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.[138] For this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"[139]/nNewton's position was vigorously defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace's work Celestial Mechanics had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.[140] The contrast between Laplace's mechanistic worldview and Newton's one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave Napoleon, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste: \"Sire, j'ai pu me passer de cette hypoth\u00e8se\" (\"Sir, I didn't need this hypothesis\").[141]/nScholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the Trinity. His first biographer, David Brewster, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.[142] In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes (among others) were deciphered[67] and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.[127]/nNewton and Robert Boyle's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.[143] The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism,[144] and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\"./nThe attacks made against pre-Enlightenment \"magical thinking\", and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle's ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.[145]/nNewton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage./n\u2013John Maynard Keynes, \"Newton, the Man\"[146]/nOf an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton's papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of Newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations.[108] Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets.[147] Some of the content contained in Newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the church.[108]/nIn 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloguing Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's.[148] The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about \u00a39,000.[149] John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.[108][148][150]/nAll of Newton's known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University: \"The Chymistry of Isaac Newton\"[151] and summarised in a book.[152][153]/nNewton's fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton's involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"[151]/nIn June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton's notes on Jan Baptist van Helmont's book on plague, De Peste,[154] were being auctioned online by Bonhams. Newton's analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London's 1665\u20131666 infection, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".[155]/nThe mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\"[156] English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:/nNature, and Nature's laws lay hid in night.\nGod said, Let Newton be! and all was light./nBut this was not allowed to be inscribed in the monument. The epitaph in the monument is as follows:[157]/nH. S. E. ISAACUS NEWTON Eques Auratus, / Qui, animi vi prope divin\u00e2, / Planetarum Motus, Figuras, / Cometarum semitas, Oceanique Aestus.

He was born on 25th December 1642, and died on 20th March 1726./nIn a 2005 survey of members of Britain's Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein, the members deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contribution.[158] In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of the day's leading physicists voted Einstein the \"greatest physicist ever,\" with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists by the site PhysicsWeb gave the top spot to Newton.[159][160] New Scientist called Newton \"the supreme genius and most enigmatic character in the history of science\".[15] Einstein kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell.[161]/nThe SI derived unit of force is named the newton in his honour./nWoolsthorpe Manor is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through being his birthplace and  \"where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light\".[162]/nIn 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold for \u00a3730[163] in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring.[164] Guinness World Records 2002 classified it as the most valuable tooth in the world, which would value approximately \u00a325,000 (US$35,700) in late 2001.[164] Who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed./nNewton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree.[165][166] The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton's niece, to Voltaire.[167] Voltaire then wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), \"Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.\"[168][169]/nAlthough it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any single moment,[170] acquaintances of Newton (such as William Stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton's head. Stukeley recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:[171][172][173]/nwe went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought he to him self: occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"/nJohn Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:[174]/nIn the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition./nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.[175] The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\"./nVarious trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree[176] can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale in Kent[177] can supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.[178]/nNewton's monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694\u20131770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent.[179] The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism.[180] The Latin inscription on the base translates as:/nHere is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced.

Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the Solar System.[181]/nA statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. A large bronze statue, Newton, after William Blake, by Eduardo Paolozzi, dated 1995 and inspired by Blake's etching, dominates the piazza of the British Library in London. A bronze statue of Newton was erected in 1858 in the centre of Grantham where he went to school, prominently standing in front of Grantham Guildhall./nThe still-surviving farmhouse at Woolsthorpe By Colsterworth is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through being his birthplace and  \"where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light\".[162]/nEnlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors\u2014Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally\u2014as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.[182]/nIt is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton's publication of the Principia was a turning point in the Scientific Revolution and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton's conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology.[183] Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.", "4995366": "Daniel Santbech (fl. 1561) was a Dutch mathematician and astronomer.

These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right-angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines.
