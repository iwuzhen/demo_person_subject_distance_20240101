She had three sons by her first husband and the family responsibilities resulted in Scott becoming a mathematics coach (his first interest had always been in mathematics). He built up a useful connections at the university and later published a small textbook on plane co-ordinate geometry./nIn April 1856 Scott took the position of colonial astronomer in New South Wales. Scott arrived with his family in Sydney in October 1856 to find the astronomical works were somewhat neglected. He supervised the building of the Sydney Observatory at Dawes Point, ensured the appointment of an observatory board and established the keeping of meteorological records throughout the colony./nBy 1859 Scott was making systematic observations and in 1861 the acquisition of an equatorial telescope enabled him to expand his work. Scott planned a magnetic survey of the colony and reported that, despite the shortage of staff and equipment, 'the establishment is now complete in every respect'./nOn 31 October 1862 Scott resigned as astronomer giving the reason as ill health, also reported as failing eyesight.[2] However, it seems likely that the reasons were the departure of his patron Governor Denison and public criticism of his refusal to produce 'showy results'. He found it difficult to adapt to colonial life but succeeded the Rev. W. H. Savigny as headmaster of the Cook's River collegiate school, which he removed to Elswick House, Leichhardt,[2] and in 1865 took over from Savigny as warden of St Paul's College, Sydney (Australia's oldest University College). It was a quiet time at the college and his plans were hampered by the slow rate of university expansion, the competition of the new Presbyterian College of St Andrew and the Church's refusal to recognize education at St Paul's as sufficient training for the ministry. He continued as mathematical examiner for the university and twice deputized for the professor of mathematics. In 1867\u201374 he was honorary secretary of the Royal Society of New South Wales and treasurer in 1874\u201378. In 1874 he read a paper to the society on 'The transit of Venus as Observed at Eden' which was published in its Proceedings. In the 1870s he preached frequently on the relation of religion to new scientific ideas but his public activities were not matched by any considerable energy at St Paul's. In 1878 criticism by the college council caused him to resign./nScott had earlier expressed an element of scepticism about revealed religion and had criticized the Sydney clergy. However, he took eagerly to a country ministry at Gunning, Bungendore and Queanbeyan and later became a canon of St Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn, and examining chaplain for Bishop Thomas.

He returned to Kristiania in 1900 as a research fellow in mathematics, visited the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1902, and returned to Kristiania in 1903, where he was appointed as a professor of mathematics, a position he held for 43 years. After he received a permanent position in Kristiania, St\u00f8rmer published his subsequent writings under a shortened version of his name, Carl St\u00f8rmer. In 1918, he was elected as the first president of the newly formed Norwegian Mathematical Society. He participated regularly in Scandinavian mathematical congresses, and was president of the 1936 International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo (from 1924 the new name of Kristiania). St\u00f8rmer was also affiliated with the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, which was founded in 1934. He died on 13 August 1957, at Blindern.[1][3][4][5]/nHe was also an amateur street photographer,[6] beginning in his student days. Near the age of 70 he put on an exhibition in Oslo of the photographs of celebrities that he had taken over the years. For instance it included one of Henrik Ibsen strolling down Karl Johans gate, the main road in Oslo.[1] He was also a supervisory council member of the insurance company Forsikringsselskapet Norden.[7]/nIn February 1900 he married consul's daughter Ada Clauson (1877\u20131973), with whom he eventually had five children.[4] Their son Leif St\u00f8rmer became a professor of historical geology at the University of Oslo.[2] His daughter Henny married landowner Carl Otto L\u00f8venskiold.[8] Carl St\u00f8rmer is also the grandfather of the mathematician Erling St\u00f8rmer.[9][10]/nSt\u00f8rmer's first mathematical publication, published when he was a beginning student at the age of 18, concerned trigonometric series generalizing the Taylor expansion of the arcsine function. He revisited this problem a few years later. Next, he systematically investigated Machin-like formula by which the number \u03c0 may be represented as a rational combination of the so-called \"Gregory numbers\" of the form arctan 1/n. Machin's original formula,/nis of this type, and St\u00f8rmer showed that there were three other ways of representing \u03c0 as a rational combination of two Gregory numbers. He then investigated combinations of three Gregory numbers, and found 102 representations of \u03c0 of this form, but was unable to determine whether there might be additional solutions of this type.[3] These representations led to fast algorithms for computing numerical approximations of \u03c0. In particular, a four-term representation found by St\u00f8rmer,/nwas used in a record-setting calculation of \u03c0 to 1,241,100,000,000 decimal digits in 2002 by Yasumasa Kanada.[11] St\u00f8rmer is also noted for the St\u00f8rmer numbers, which arose from the decomposition of Gregory numbers in St\u00f8rmer's work.[12]/nSt\u00f8rmer's theorem, which he proved in 1897, shows that, for any finite set P of prime numbers, there are only finitely many pairs of consecutive integers having only the numbers from P as their prime factors. In addition, St\u00f8rmer describes an algorithm for finding all such pairs. The superparticular ratios generated by these consecutive pairs are of particular importance in music theory.[13] St\u00f8rmer proves this theorem by reducing the problem to a finite set of Pell equations, and the theorem itself can also be interpreted as describing the possible factorizations of solutions to Pell's equation. Chapman quotes Louis Mordell as saying \"His result is very pretty, and there are many applications of it.\"[1]/nAdditional subjects of St\u00f8rmer's mathematical research included Lie groups, the gamma function, and Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers and of the transcendental numbers arising from elliptic functions. From 1905 St\u00f8rmer was an editor of the journal Acta Mathematica, and he was also an editor of the posthumously-published mathematical works of Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie.[1][3]/nFrom 1903, when St\u00f8rmer first observed Kristian Birkeland's experimental attempts to explain the aurora borealis, he was fascinated by aurorae and related phenomena. His first work on the subject attempted to model mathematically the paths taken by charged particles perturbed by the influence of a magnetized sphere, and St\u00f8rmer eventually published over 48 papers on the motion of charged particles.[14] By modeling the problem using differential equations and polar coordinates, St\u00f8rmer was able to show that the radius of curvature of any particle's path is proportional to the square of its distance from the sphere's center. To solve the resulting differential equations numerically, he used Verlet integration, which is therefore also known as St\u00f6rmer's method.[3] Ernst Br\u00fcche and Willard Harrison Bennett verified experimentally St\u00f8rmer's predicted particle motions; Bennett called his experimental apparatus \"St\u00f6rmertron\" in honor of St\u00f8rmer.[1] St\u00f8rmer's calculations showed that small variations in the trajectories of particles approaching the earth would be magnified by the effects of the Earth's magnetic field, explaining the convoluted shapes of aurorae.[15] St\u00f8rmer also considered the possibility that particles might be trapped within the geomagnetic field, and worked out the orbits of these trapped particles. St\u00f8rmer's work on this subject applies to what are today called the magnetospheric ring current[1] and Van Allen radiation belts.[16]/nAs well as modeling these phenomena mathematically, St\u00f8rmer took many photographs of aurorae, from 20 different observatories across Norway. He measured their heights and latitudes by triangulation from multiple observatories, and showed that the aurora are typically as high as 100 kilometers above ground. He classified them by their shapes, and discovered in 1926 the \"solar-illuminated aurora\", a phenomenon that can occur at twilight when the upper parts of an aurora are lit by the sun; these aurorae can be as high as 1000\u00a0km above ground.[17][18]/nSt\u00f8rmer's book, From the Depths of Space to the Heart of the Atom, describing his work in this area, was translated into five different languages from the original Norwegian.[3] A second book, The Polar Aurora (Oxford Press, 1955), contains both his experimental work on aurorae and his mathematical attempts to model them. In his review of this book, Canadian astronomer John F. Heard calls St\u00f8rmer \"the acknowledged authority\" on aurorae.[19] Heard writes, \"The Polar Aurora will undoubtedly remain for many years a standard reference book; it belongs on the desk of anyone whose work or interest is involved with aurorae.\"[19]/nOther astrophysical phenomena investigated by St\u00f8rmer include pulsations of the earth's magnetic field, echoing in radio transmissions, nacreous clouds and luminous night clouds, zodiacal light, meteor trails, the solar corona and solar vortices, and cosmic rays.[1]/nSt\u00f8rmer was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS)[1] and a Corresponding Member of the French Academy of Sciences.[1] He was also a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1900.[2] He was given honorary degrees by Oxford University (in 1947), the University of Copenhagen (1951), and the Sorbonne (1953), and in 1922 the French Academy awarded him their Janssen Medal.[1][4][2] Three times St\u00f8rmer was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians (1908 in Rome, 1924 in Toronto, and 1936 in Oslo);[20] he was an invited speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg[21] and in 1932 in Zurich.[20] In 1971, the crater St\u00f6rmer on the far side of the Moon was named after him.[22]/nIn 1902, St\u00f8rmer was decorated with King Oscar II's Medal of Merit in gold. He was also decorated as a Knight, First Order of the Order of St. Olav in 1939. He was upgraded to Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1954.[2]", "18421597": "Ronald Fagin (born 1945) is an American mathematician and computer scientist, and IBM Fellow at the IBM Almaden Research Center.

The Division trained students, performed independent research, and supported clinical research associated with Columbia University's health sciences divisions.[2][3][4]/nOne of Fleiss's chief concerns was mental health statistics, particularly assessing the reliability of diagnostic classifications, and the measures, models, and control of errors in categorization. He was among the first to notice the equivalence of weighted kappa and the intraclass correlation coefficient as measures of reliability in categorical data (see Fleiss' kappa).[3]/nIn an influential 1974 paper co-authored with Robert Spitzer, Fleiss demonstrated that the second edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II) was an unreliable diagnostic tool.[5] They found that different practitioners using the DSM-II were rarely in agreement when diagnosing patients with similar problems. In reviewing previous studies of 18 major diagnostic categories, Fleiss and Spitzer concluded that \"there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high. Reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories: mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (but not its subtypes), and alcoholism. The level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and schizophrenia and is poor for the remaining categories.\"[6]/nFleiss wrote two textbooks that are considered classics in biostatistics.

In 1804 after the dissolution of the flax-spinning company of which he was manager, he obtained one of the mathematical chairs in the Royal Military College, Great Marlow (afterwards removed to Sandhurst); and until the year 1816, when failing health obliged him to resign, he discharged his professional duties with remarkable success./nDuring this period he published in the Philosophical Transactions several important memoirs, which earned for him the Copley Medal in 1814 and ensured his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815. Of special importance in the history of attractions is the first of these earlier memoirs (Phil. Trans., 1809), in which the problem of the attraction of a homogeneous ellipsoid upon an external point is reduced to the simpler case of the attraction of another but related ellipsoid upon a corresponding point interior to it. This theorem is known as Ivory's theorem. He also published anonymously an edition of Euclid's Elements, which was described as having brought the difficult problems \"more within the reach of ordinary understandings.\"[3] His later papers in the Philosophical Transactions treat of astronomical refractions, of planetary perturbations, of equilibrium of fluid masses, etc. For his investigations in the first named of these he received a royal medal in 1826 and again in 1839./nIn 1831, on the recommendation of Lord Brougham, King William IV granted him a pension of \u00a3300 per annum, and appointed him Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order, but was not subsequently made a knight bachelor to entitle him to the prefix Sir, which often came with appointments to that order. Besides being directly connected with the chief scientific societies of his own country, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Irish Academy, etc., he was corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences both of Paris and Berlin, and of the Royal Society of G\u00f6ttingen./nIn 1839, the University of St. Andrews conferred on him an honorary degree as a Doctor of Laws (LLD).[4]/nHe died in Hampstead in north London on 21 September 1842.[5]", "50009984": "Mary Wynne Warner (n\u00e9e Davies;[1] 22 June 1932 \u2013 1 April 1998) was a Welsh mathematician, specializing in fuzzy mathematics.[2][3] Her obituary in the Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society noted that fuzzy topology was \"the field in which she was one of the pioneers and recognized as one of the leading figures for the past thirty years.\"[4]/nMary Wynne Davies was born in Carmarthen, Wales, the elder daughter of Sydney and Esther Davies (n\u00e9e Jones),[1] where the family resided until she was six years old. She was raised and received the first ten years of her education in Llandovery, where her father was a schoolmaster at the local grammar school. Attaining ten Distinctions in her School Certificate exams, she received the remainder of her secondary education at Howell's Boarding School, Denbigh in order to facilitate her study of physics.[4]/nBoth a Draper's Company Exhibition and an Open Scholarship were awarded to Warner following academic distinction at Howell's. This facilitated her undergraduate study of mathematics at Somerville College, Oxford, commencing in 1951 and from which she graduated in 1953 with a second-class degree.[5]/nWarner had acquired various academic prizes at both the college and university level during her undergraduate degree, allowing her to progress to doctoral work in Oxford via a Research Scholarship. In 1956 her earliest research paper, 'A note on Borsuk's antipodal point theorem in the Oxford Quarterly Journal of Mathematics'  was published under the supervision of the Waynflete Chair of Pure Mathematics, J.H.C Whitehead. During this period, Warner was initiated into his notable and prolific algebraic topology research group.[6]/nAmid her academic study, Warner began a romantic relationship with Gerald Warner, who had read history at Oxford, and after graduating in 1954 had embarked upon a career in the Diplomatic Service's Intelligence Branch. She would marry Warner in 1956 before his assignment to Beijing, China. The transient nature of his occupation disrupted her ability to participate formally in academia and terminated her doctoral studies at Oxford, but she continued to dedicate herself to mathematical research to the extent that the demands of being a diplomat's wife would allow.[4]/nThe trajectory of Warner's career was shaped by her husband's overseas diplomatic assignments./nWhilst stationed in Beijing between 1956 and 1958 Warner continued her involvement with Oxford's Whitehead research group, working alongside prominent Chinese topologist Chang Su-chen until escalating political tensions forced them to terminate communication in 1958.[6]/nThe family subsequently returned to London, England for a period between 1958 and 1960 during which Mary lectured part-time at Bedford College; this was followed by a year overseas in Rangoon, Burma. Under her instruction and direction as Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at Rangoon University, its first MSc Mathematics program was developed. Prior to this full-time employment was unheard of for the wives of Britain's diplomats; Mary was the first woman in this position to violate this convention.[1] Two years (1962-1964) were then spent in London, where Mary resumed her lectureship at Bedford College.[4]/nWarner's association with the Whitehead research group resumed in Warsaw, Poland between 1964 and 1966. At the University of Warsaw a dynamic and industrious research circle, concerned primarily with topology, flourished under Karol Borsuk. In these intellectually stimulating conditions, Mary took a position as a Visiting Research Fellow, recommencing work on her doctoral thesis under the supervision of Andrzej Bialynicki-Birula.[4] This thesis - 'The homology of Cartesian product spaces' - would be completed during a two-year assignment in Geneva, Switzerland, and examined by Borsuk and Kuratowski. Warner was then awarded her doctorate by the Polish Academy of Sciences.[6] This accomplishment was also notable for it being the first instance of a diplomatic wife acquiring a doctorate abroad.[1]/nA relocation to London in 1968 permitted Mary to take up a long-term position as a lecturer at City University, an institution which would constitute the home of her future academic career. Accounting to her time abroad, Warner was now on the margins of her Oxford-era interest of homotopy theory research, much of her knowledge obsolete due to significant advancements in her absence. Accordingly, she diverted her efforts towards publishing research in the newly emergent field of fuzzy topology.[4] In 1969, 'The homology of tensor products' was published.[6]/nA final, brief interruption before Warner could apply herself entirely to mathematics, was a relocation to Malaysia in 1974 for a two-year duration. She was distinguished by being the sole person to have taught at Kuala Lumpur's Chinese and Malaysian universities, and her academic career continued on its upwards trajectory upon returning to her lectureship at City University in 1976, her research now of sufficient novelty and quality as to attract international attention and invitations to major conferences - a seminal point.[4]/nWarner's output between 1980 and 1985 of 20 papers on the subjects of tolerance spaces and automata, and her conceptualisation of the 'lattice-valued relation' towards the end of this period rendered her eminent in the field of fuzzy topology, and these achievements culminated in her promotion to a readership at the City University in 1983, and then a professorship in 1996.[6] During her tenure at the university's Mathematics department, she developed a curriculum for and implemented an MSc in mathematics, and her aptitude in teaching at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level was noted.[4]/nWarner is generally acknowledged as having been imperative in providing early fuzzy topology research with a stabilising foundation, from which new results could be found, which were not purely descriptive of existing topological definitions. The quantity of people with whom she co-authored papers is indicative of her role in bolstering the profile of the field of fuzzy topology.[4]/nThe broader application of Mary's work in fuzzy topology involves the prediction of real-world events which are always imprecise \u2013 nuclear reactor failure and the occurrence of earthquakes.[1]/nMary Wynne Davies married diplomat and intelligence officer Sir Gerald Warner in 1956. They had three children, Sian (b. 1958), Jonathan (b. 1959), and Rachel (b. 1961), who were born in Beijing, London, and Rangoon, Burma, respectively.[4]/nMary's interests outside mathematics included Asian pottery, having a study collection exhibited at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford after her time in the continent in the mid-Seventies. Also important to Warner was the poetry of her native Wales.[4]/nThe improvement of education was also of significance to Warner, who served on the Court of the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, as the vice-chairman of the Governing Body of Geneva's International School, and as the Governor of Lindisfarne College.[4]/nIll health had compelled Warner to retire a year early from her position at the City University, but she did not abandon either her postgraduate teaching or her research,[6] which was still ongoing when she died in Spain in 1998, aged 65. She was buried in the Kemerton churchyard in Tewksbury, England, where two of her children were already interred.[4]", "37721996": "Norman J.

He was born at Thurso Castle, Caithness. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh.[2]/nAfter studying law at the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow and Trinity College, Oxford, he completed his legal studies at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1774. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland in 1775, and also called to the English bar, although he never practised. He had inherited his father's estates in 1770 and had no financial need to work./nIn 1780, he was returned to the House of Commons for the Caithness constituency, and subsequently represented several English constituencies, his parliamentary career extending, with few interruptions, until 1811.

Together they had two daughters, Hannah and Janet, who became a religious writer.[9] His first wife died in 1785./nIn 1788, Sinclair married Diana MacDonald, daughter of Alexander Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald, and together they had 13 children. His eldest son, Sir George Sinclair, 2nd Baronet (1790\u20131868), was a writer and a Member of Parliament, representing Caithness at intervals from 1811 until 1841, and married Lady Catherine Camilla Tollemache. His son, Sir John George Tollemache Sinclair, 3rd Baronet, was a member for the same constituency from 1869 to 1885.

This became known as the \"Old Statistical Account.\" In volume XX (p. xiii) Sinclair explained the choice of name and the purpose of the inquiry:/n\"Many people were at first surprised at my using the words \"statistical\" and \"statistics\", as it was supposed that some term in our own language might have expressed the same meaning. But in the course of a very extensive tour through the northern parts of Europe, which I happened to take in 1786, I found that in Germany they were engaged in a species of political enquiry to which they had given the name \"statistics,\" and though I apply a different meaning to that word\u2014for by \"statistical\" is meant in Germany an inquiry for the purposes of ascertaining the political strength of a country or questions respecting matters of state\u2014whereas the idea I annex to the term is an inquiry into the state of a country, for the purpose of ascertaining the quantum of happiness enjoyed by its inhabitants, and the means of its future improvement; but as I thought that a new word might attract more public attention, I resolved on adopting it, and I hope it is now completely naturalised and incorporated with our language.\"/nFor Sinclair, statistics involved collecting facts, but these were not necessarily, or even typically, numerical./nSinclair was a proponent of new agricultural methods, and large tracts of land on his Caithness estate were let out to tenants who kept new breeds of livestock such as Cheviot sheep. This plan meant evicting the sitting tenants and giving them smaller plots of land to work, often in harsh coastal areas such as Badbea. Eventually many of the displaced tenants emigrated.[12]/nSinclair was a member of most of the continental agricultural societies, a fellow of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, as well as of the Antiquarian Society of London, a member and sometimes president of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and sat as president of the Highland Society of London in 1796. Also, in 1796, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797.[13]/nOriginally a supporter of Pitt's war policy, Sinclair later joined the party of \"armed neutrality.\" In 1805 he was appointed by Pitt a commissioner for the construction of roads and bridges in the north of Scotland, in 1810 he was made a member of the privy council and, next year, received the lucrative sinecure office of Commissioner of excise./nWhen the Statistical Society of London (now the Royal Statistical Society) was founded in 1834, Sinclair at 80 was the oldest original member. In the same year he presented a paper on agriculture to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, but this was found to lack \"facts which can be stated numerically.\"/nAround 1790 he wrote about analysing the \"quantum of happiness\" in the people of Scotland.[14]/nSinclair's works sometimes were the first recording of details of archaeological monuments of Scotland.

Then he changes the equations a little bit in order to increase the resemblance of the accidentally found shapes to real life objects.[40][41][42] For example, by using this method, he found some shapes that resemble birds, fishes and sailing boats.[43][44][45][46] In the second method, he draws a real life object with a step-by-step process. In each step, he tries to find out which mathematical formulas will produce the drawing.[47][4] For example, by using this method, he drew birds in flight, butterflies, human faces and plants using trigonometric functions.[48][49][50][47][51][52] Naderi Yeganeh says: \"In order to create such shapes, it is very useful to know the properties of the trigonometric functions\".[53][48] In 2018, in an interview with the Sharif University of Technology Public Relations Naderi Yeganeh said: I use mathematical concepts in a work of art in a way that it could be thoroughly explained in a paragraph. That makes the understanding of an artwork's scientific underpinning easier.[54]/nAn instance of drawing real things by using Yeganeh's methods is A Bird in Flight, which is the name of a number of bird-like geometric shapes introduced by Naderi Yeganeh. Yeganeh created those drawings by using the two methods mentioned above. An example of A Bird in Flight that was created by his first method is made of 500 segments defined in a Cartesian plane  where for each \n\n\n\nk\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n\u2026\n,\n500\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=1,2,3,\\ldots ,500}\n\n the endpoints of the \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n-th line segment are:/nand/nThe 500 line segments defined above together form a shape in the Cartesian plane that resembles a flying bird. Looking at the line segments on the wings of the bird causes an optical illusion and may trick the viewer into thinking that the line segments are curved lines. Therefore, the shape can also be considered as an optical artwork.[49][8][13][55][52][56]  Another version of A Bird in Flight that was designed by Naderi Yeganeh's second method is the union of all of the circles with center \n\n\n\n\n(\n\nA\n(\nk\n)\n,\nB\n(\nk\n)\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\left(A(k),B(k)\\right)}\n\n and radius \n\n\n\nR\n(\nk\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R(k)}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nk\n=\n\u2212\n10000\n,\n\u2212\n9999\n,\n\u2026\n,\n9999\n,\n10000\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k=-10000,-9999,\\ldots ,9999,10000}\n\n, and/nThe set of the 20,001 circles defined above form a subset of the Cartesian plane that resembles a flying bird.

His work is primarily in the topics of knot theory and its connections with statistical mechanics, quantum theory, algebra, combinatorics, and foundations.[2] In topology, he introduced and developed the bracket polynomial and Kauffman polynomial./nIn the mathematical field of knot theory, the bracket polynomial, also known as the Kauffman bracket, is a polynomial invariant of framed links.  Although it is not an invariant of knots or links (as it is not invariant under type I Reidemeister moves), a suitably \"normalized\" version yields the famous knot invariant called the Jones polynomial.  The bracket polynomial plays an important role in unifying the Jones polynomial with other quantum invariants.  In particular, Kauffman's interpretation of the Jones polynomial allows generalization to state sum invariants of 3-manifolds.  Recently, the bracket polynomial formed the basis for Mikhail Khovanov's construction of a homology for knots and links, creating\na stronger invariant than the Jones polynomial and such that the graded Euler characteristic of the Khovanov homology is equal to the original\nJones polynomial. The generators for the chain complex of the Khovanov homology are states of the bracket polynomial decorated with elements\nof a Frobenius algebra./nThe Kauffman polynomial is a 2-variable knot polynomial due to Louis Kauffman.

Abbo was there during the period 985 to 987, and became a large influence on Byhrtferth who was interested in the same studies, such as history, logic, astronomy, and mathematics.[6] We do not have contemporary biographies of Byrhtferth, and the only information we have is that given in his Manual and his Preface.[7]/n/nByrhtferth's signature appears on only two unpublished works, his Latin and Old English Manual, and Latin Preface. He also composed a Latin life of St. Egwin, compiled a chronicle of Northumbrian history in the 990s, wrote a Latin life of Oswald of Worcester (the Vita Oswaldi) about the year 1000, and it is suggested that he is responsible for the early sections of the Historia regum, or History of the Kings, attributed to Simeon of Durham.  This last attribution is based on the similarity of the style between Simeon and Byrhtferth.[3][6] An unsigned fragment of Old English text on computus in the Manuscript BL Cotton Caligula A.xv[8] is attributed to him because of the stylistic similarity to the Old English that he wrote in the Manual.[3] Cyril Roy Hart also tentatively identifies him as the author of the verse Menologium preserved as a preface to a manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,[9][10] although Kazutomo Karasawa believes it more likely to have been written by an older contemporary.[11]/nByrhtferth has also been credited with Latin commentaries on Bede's De natura rerum and De temporum ratione (first attributed to him by John Herwagen) and a Vita S. Dunstani signed \"B\" (first attributed to him by Jean Mabillon).[4] However, many scholars argue that these works were not written by Byrhtferth, but instead were a compilation of material by several writers in the late ninth and early tenth centuries.  This is argued because of the smooth, polished style of these works in comparison with the styles of the only signed works, the Manual and the Preface.[4]/nSt John's College, Oxford MS 17 [13] contains several computistical works by Bede and Helperic, and a computus which includes the Latin Epilogus (\"Preface\") by Byrhtferth.  He also constructed a full-page diagram showing the harmony of the universe, and suggesting correspondences among cosmological, numerological, and physiological aspects of the world.  Other items in the manuscript may in fact have been written by Byrhtferth, but this cannot be proved.  Also, he may have compiled most of this material from works that Abbo of Fleury left behind at Ramsey Abbey after his death.[3]", "202719": "Liu Hui (fl.\u2009 3rd century CE) was a Chinese mathematician who published a commentary in 263 CE on Jiu Zhang Suan Shu (The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art).[2] He was a descendant of the Marquis of Zixiang of the Eastern Han dynasty and lived in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period (220\u2013280 CE) of China.[3]/nHis major contributions as recorded in his commentary on The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art include a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, theorems in solid geometry, an improvement on Archimedes's approximation of \u03c0, and a systematic method of solving linear equations in several unknowns. In his other work, Haidao Suanjing (The Sea Island Mathematical Manual), he wrote about geometrical problems and their application to surveying. He probably visited Luoyang, where he measured the sun's shadow.[3]/nLiu Hui expressed mathematical results in the form of decimal fractions that utilized metrological units (i.e., related units of length with base 10 such as 1 ch\u01d0 = 10 c\u00f9n, 1 c\u00f9n = 10 f\u0113n, 1 f\u0113n = 10 l\u00ed, etc.); this led Liu Hui to express a diameter of 1.355 feet as 1 ch\u01d0, 3 c\u00f9n, 5 f\u0113n, 5 l\u00ed.[4] Han Yen (fl. 780-804 CE) is thought to be the first mathematician that dropped the terms referring to the units of length and used a notation system akin to the modern decimal system  and Yang Hui (c. 1238\u20131298 CE) is considered to have introduced a unified decimal system.[5]/nLiu provided a proof of a theorem identical to the Pythagorean theorem.[3] Liu called the figure of the drawn diagram for the theorem the \"diagram giving the relations between the hypotenuse and the sum and difference of the other two sides whereby one can find the unknown from the known.\"[6]/nIn the field of plane areas and solid figures, Liu Hui was one of the greatest contributors to empirical solid geometry. For example, he found that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge.[7] He also found that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid.[7] He computed the volume of solid figures such as cone, cylinder, frustum of a cone, prism, pyramid, tetrahedron, and a wedge.[2] However, he failed to compute the volume of a sphere and noted that he left it to a future mathematician to compute.[2]/nIn his commentaries on The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, he presented:/nLiu Hui also presented, in a separate appendix of 263 AD called Haidao Suanjing or The Sea Island Mathematical Manual, several problems related to surveying.

The cartographer and state minister Pei Xiu (224\u2013271) outlined the advancements of cartography, surveying, and mathematics up until his time. This included the first use of a rectangular grid and graduated scale for accurate measurement of distances on representative terrain maps.[15] Liu Hui provided commentary on the Nine Chapter's problems involving building canal and river dykes, giving results for total amount of materials used, the amount of labor needed, the amount of time needed for construction, etc.[16]/nAlthough translated into English long beforehand, Liu's work was translated into French by Guo Shuchun, a professor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who began in 1985 and took twenty years to complete his translation.", "36837348": "David Conlon (born 1982) is an Irish mathematician who is a Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology.

C.\u00a0I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\" For Peirce, logic also encompassed much of what is now called epistemology and the philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics or study of signs, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Peirce's study of signs also included a tripartite theory of predication./nAdditionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulating mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. He was one of the founders of statistics. As early as 1886, he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.[13]/nFor metaphysics, Peirce was an \"objective idealist\" in the tradition of German philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as a scholastic realist about universals. He also held a commitment to the ideas of continuity and chance as real features of the universe, views he labeled synechism and tychism respectively. Peirce believed an epistemic fallibilism and anti-skepticism went along with these views./nPeirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of mathematics and astronomy  at Harvard University.[a] At age\u00a012, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's Elements of Logic, then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning.[14]/nHe suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as \"facial neuralgia\", which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain \"he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper\".[15] Its consequences may have led to the social isolation of his later life./nPeirce went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree (1862) from Harvard. In 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a Bachelor of Science degree, Harvard's first summa cum laude chemistry degree.[16] His academic record was otherwise undistinguished.[17] At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James.[18] One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard (1869\u20131909\u2014a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life), repeatedly vetoed Peirce's employment at the university.[19]/nBetween 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey, which in 1878 was renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,[20] where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection until the latter's death in 1880.[21] At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth's gravity.[20]/nThis employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy.[22] No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted.  Peirce grew up in a home where white supremacy was taken for granted, and slavery was considered natural.[23] Peirce's father had described himself as a secessionist until the outbreak of the war, after which he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity./nPeirce liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic (for the first premise arguably assumes the conclusion):[24]/nAll Men are equal in their political rights.\nNegroes are Men.\nTherefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites./nHe was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867.[25] The Survey sent him to Europe five times,[26] first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse. There, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford,[27] British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own./nFrom 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way.[28] In 1872 he founded the Metaphysical Club, a conversational philosophical club that Peirce, the future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the philosopher and  psychologist William James, amongst others, formed in January 1872 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and dissolved in December 1872. Other members of the club included Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Nicholas St. John Green, and Joseph Bangs Warner.[29]  The discussions eventually birthed Peirce's notion of pragmatism./nOn April 20, 1877, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.[31] Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency,[32] the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983./nIn 1879 Peirce developed Peirce quincuncial projection, having been inspired by H. A. Schwarz's 1869 conformal transformation of a circle onto a polygon of n sides (known as the Schwarz\u2013Christoffel mapping)./nDuring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months.[according to whom?] Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands, during 1883\u20131909 on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic Century Dictionary.[33] In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds.[34] In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request.[35]/nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their Ph.D.s at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J.\u00a0J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell,[36] several of whom were his graduate students.[7] Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held./nBrent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb.[37] Newcomb had been a favourite student of Peirce's father; although \"no doubt quite bright\", \"like Salieri in Peter Shaffer\u2019s Amadeus he also had just enough talent to recognize he was not a genius and just enough pettiness to resent someone who was\". Additionally \"an intensely devout and literal-minded Christian of rigid moral standards\", he was appalled by what he considered Peirce's personal shortcomings.[38] Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as \"his difficult personality\".[39] In contrast, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.[40]/nPeirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875,[41] Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai,[42] and nationality (she spoke French)[43] remains uncertain.[44] When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette.[45] That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884.[46] Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success.[47] He had no children by either marriage.[48]/nIn 1887, Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy 2,000 acres (8\u00a0km2) of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return.[49] There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design.[50] The Peirces named the property \"Arisbe\". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives,[51] Charles writing prolifically, with much of his work remaining unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties.[52] Charles spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while.[53] Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce[54] and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.[55]/nPeirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for The Nation (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley's instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing.[56] He began but did not complete several books.[57] In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.[58]/nFrom 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago,[59] who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal The Monist, which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce.[60] He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology (1901\u20131905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision.[61] He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book describing his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Carnegie Institution executive committee, and its president had been president of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.[62]/nThe one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his Will to Believe (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903).[63] Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him.[64] It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used \"Santiago\" (\"St. James\" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references)./nPeirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce's ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot arranged for Juliette's burial in Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce's ashes was interred with Juliette.[65]/nBertrand Russell (1959) wrote \"Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\".[66] Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce (Peirce's work was not widely known until later).[67] A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own \"process\" thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964.[28]) Karl Popper viewed Peirce as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all times\".[68] Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah Royce[69] admired him and Cassius Jackson Keyser, at Columbia and C. K. Ogden, wrote about Peirce with respect but to no immediate effect./nThe first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings entitled Chance, Love, and Logic (1923), and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings.[70] John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins.[7] From 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 Logic: The Theory of Inquiry is much influenced by Peirce.[71] The publication of the first six volumes of Collected Papers (1931\u20131935), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds,[72] did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 PhD thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its Transactions, an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce's pragmatism and American philosophy has appeared since 1965.[73] (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism.)/nBy 1943 such was Peirce's reputation, in the US at least, that Webster's Biographical Dictionary said that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\".[74]/nIn 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902\u20132000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her forty years of research on Peirce, \u201cthe mathematician and scientist,\u201d culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and historian of ideas Max Fisch (1900\u20131995) emerged as an authority on Peirce (Fisch, 1986).[75] He includes many of his relevant articles in a survey (Fisch 1986: 422\u2013448) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983./nPeirce has gained an international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP), Finland (HPRC and Commens), Germany (Wirth's group, Hoffman's and Otte's group, and Deuser's and H\u00e4rle's group[76]), France (L'I.R.S.C.E.), Spain (GEP), and Italy (CSP). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirce scholars of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto, thanks in part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) \u2013, and Pennsylvania State University./nCurrently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce's ideas by researchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy. The interest comes from industry, business, technology, intelligence organizations, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence of a substantial number of agencies, institutes, businesses, and laboratories in which ongoing research into and development of Peircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken./nIn recent years, Peirce's trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks./nJohn Deely writes that Peirce was the last of the \"moderns\" and \"first of the postmoderns\". He lauds Peirce's doctrine of signs as a contribution to the dawn of the Postmodern epoch. Deely additionally comments that \"Peirce stands...in a position analogous to the position occupied by Augustine as last of the Western Fathers and first of the medievals\".[77]/nPeirce's reputation rests largely on academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, The Monist, Popular Science Monthly, the American Journal of Mathematics, Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, The Nation, and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime[78] was Photometric Researches (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited Studies in Logic (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879\u20131884) as lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce./nAfter Peirce's death, Harvard University obtained from Peirce's widow the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)[79] catalogued this Nachlass did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1,650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000\u00a0pages,[80] mostly still unpublished except on microfilm. On the vicissitudes of Peirce's papers, see Houser (1989).[81] Reportedly the papers remain in unsatisfactory condition.[82]/nThe first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays, edited by Morris Raphael Cohen, 1923, still in print. Other one-volume anthologies were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions[83] of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:/n1931\u20131958: Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes.[84] Edited (1\u20136) by Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss and (7\u20138) by Arthur Burks, in print and online./n1975\u20131987: Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to The Nation, 4 volumes, includes Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869\u20131908 in The Nation.

Moore, in print./nPeirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity./nHe worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections, and was especially active in probability and statistics.[86]/nPeirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:/nIn 1860[87] he suggested a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers, years before any work by Georg Cantor (who completed his dissertation in 1867) and without access to Bernard Bolzano's 1851 (posthumous) Paradoxien des Unendlichen./nIn 1880\u20131881[88] he showed how Boolean algebra could be done via a repeated sufficient single binary operation (logical NOR), anticipating Henry M. Sheffer by 33\u00a0years. (See also De Morgan's Laws.)/nIn 1881[89] he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic, a few years before Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as \"Dedekind-finite\", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets./nIn 1885[90] he distinguished between first-order and second-order quantification.[91][92] In the same paper he set out what can be read as the first (primitive) axiomatic set theory, anticipating Zermelo by about two decades (Brady 2000,[93] pp.\u00a0132\u2013133)./nIn 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches,[13] anticipating Claude Shannon by more than 50 years. \nBy the later 1890s[94] he was devising existential graphs, a diagrammatic notation for the predicate calculus. Based on them are John F. Sowa's conceptual graphs and Sun-Joo Shin's diagrammatic reasoning./nPeirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title The New Elements of Mathematics, that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared[86] in The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele./nPeirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science about drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.[95]/nPeirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (absolute chance) is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization.[96] Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the \"propensity\" theory of probability before Karl Popper.[97][98] Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, \"perhaps the very first\" elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.[2]/nPeirce was one of the founders of statistics. He formulated modern statistics in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884[99] (Hacking 1990:205)[1] (before Ronald A. Fisher).[2] He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he \"corrected the means\". He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father.[2] He introduced terms \"confidence\" and \"likelihood\" (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler's historical books and Ian Hacking 1990.[1])/nIt is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce's career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies./nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy,[28] metrology,[3] geodesy, experimental psychology,[4] economics,[5] linguistics,[6] and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems./nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system: belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways\u2014including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method\u2014and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,[100] and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453\u2013457)./nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.[101] He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below./nPeirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called pragmatism and, later, pragmaticism, is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called pragmatic maxim. Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:/nConsider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object./nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877) and especially \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878) as foundational to pragmatism.[102] Peirce (CP 5.11\u201312), like James (Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking, 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods./nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F.C.S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini's declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.[103]/nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"How to Make Our Ideas Clear\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:/nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion\u2014a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.[104] Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability./nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception\u2014that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?\u2014the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection[105] arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances\u2014a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.[106]/nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry,[107] which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic.[108] He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work./nIn \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877), Peirce gives his take on the psychological origin and aim of inquiry. On his view, individuals are motivated to inquiry by desire to escape the feelings of anxiety and unease which Peirce takes to be characteristic of the state of doubt. Doubt is described by Peirce as an \"uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to free ourselves and pass into the state of belief.\"  Peirce uses words like \"irritation\" to describe the experience of being in doubt and to explain why he thinks we find such experiences to be motivating.  The irritating feeling of doubt is appeased, Peirce says, through our efforts to achieve a settled state of satisfaction with what we land on as our answer to the question which led to that doubt in the first place.  This settled state, namely, belief, is described by Peirce as \"a calm and satisfactory state which we do not wish to avoid.\"  Our efforts to achieve the satisfaction of belief, by whichever methods we may pursue, are what Peirce calls \"inquiry\".  Four methods which Peirce describes as having been actually pursued throughout the history of thought are summarized below in the section after next./nCritical common-sensism,[109] treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all./nIn \"The Fixation of Belief\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:/nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,[110] which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\"[111] is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive\u2014eventually\u2014at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth per se but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method./nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or rationalism; and induction from experiential phenomena, or empiricism./nBased on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:/nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization simpliciter, which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions./nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists./nPeirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning./nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components./nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in \u00a7III\u2013IV of \"A Neglected Argument\"[112] is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments)./n1. Abductive (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\".[113] Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.[114] In 1903, Peirce called pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\".[115] Coordinative method leads from abducting a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability[116] and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.[117] The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, or incomplexity.[118] One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.[117]/n2. Deductive phase. Two stages:/n3. Inductive phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\";[104] in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in\", will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree\". Three stages:/nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities\u2014no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable\u2014to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:[119]/nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life.[20] Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"How To Make Our Ideas Clear\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work./n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.[122] In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience.[123]/n*Note: An interpretant is an interpretation (human or otherwise) in the sense of the product of an interpretive process./nIn 1918 the logician C.\u00a0I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\"[130]/nBeginning with his first paper on the \"Logic of Relatives\" (1870), Peirce extended the theory of relations pioneered by Augustus De Morgan.[b] Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra./nRelational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral student[131] of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in Social Choice and Individual Values, following Arrow's association with Tarski at City College of New York./nOn Peirce and his contemporaries Ernst Schr\u00f6der and Gottlob Frege, Hilary Putnam (1982)[91] documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\"[90] (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schr\u00f6der, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics./nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schr\u00f6der:/nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982);[91] the Introduction in Nathan Houser et al. (1997);[133] and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).[134]/nPeirce regarded logic per se as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,[111] and as \"the art of devising methods of research\".[135] More generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.[136] Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) \"mathematics of logic\" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply \"logic\". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought./nPeirce argued that logic is formal semiotic: the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\",[137] along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs[138] and sign processes (\"semiosis\") such as the inquiry process. He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic,[108] the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism./nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, to learn, one needs to desire to learn and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.[111] So, the first rule is, to wonder. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:/n...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\nDo not block the way of inquiry./nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical)./nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of fallibilism, which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).[100]/nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic; presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.[139]/nIn three articles in 1868\u20131869,[138][119][140] Peirce rejected mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and first or ultimate principles, and argued that we have (as he numbered them[119]):/n(The above sense of the term \"intuition\" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)/nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,[140] and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below)./nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself[119] and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.[141]/nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.[135] Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such loci as: the basic terminology of psychology in On the Soul; the founding description of sign relations in On Interpretation; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as abduction, deduction, and induction, in the Prior Analytics, as well as inference by analogy (called paradeigma by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes./nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both semiotic and semeiotic. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined semiosis as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\".[142] As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: \"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.\"[138]/nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where sign is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or quasi-mind, that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees[143]\u2014the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued)./nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:/nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:/nOn the Definition of Logic. Logic is formal semiotic. A sign is something, A, which brings something, B, its interpretant sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, C, its object, as that in which itself stands to C. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of Weierstrassian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word \"formal\" in the definition is also defined.[144]/nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign\u2014not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The sign relation is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its object, and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its interpretant (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible triadic relation, according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants./nExtension \u00d7 intension = information. Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of extension (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of intension (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of information, including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.[145] For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies./nDetermination. A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object\u2014the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object\u2014an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something as a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience[146] with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", bestimmt,[147] involving variable amount, like an influence.[148] Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.[149] The object determines the sign to determine another sign\u2014the interpretant\u2014to be related to the object as the sign is related to the object, hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.[148]/nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):/nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.[146]/nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.[154]/nI. Qualisign, sinsign, legisign (also called tone, token, type, and also called potisign, actisign, famisign):[155] This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category\u2014the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\"./nII. Icon, index, symbol: This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant./nIII. Rheme, dicisign, argument (also called sumisign, dicisign, suadisign, also seme, pheme, delome,[155] and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional term, proposition, argument): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference./nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) and within (II) and within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis./nBorrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference\u2014abduction, deduction, and induction\u2014in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878).[156] He does this by rearranging the rule (Barbara's major premise), the case (Barbara's minor premise), and the result (Barbara's conclusion):/nDeduction./nRule: All the beans from this bag are white. \nCase: These beans are beans from this bag. \n\n\n\u2234\n\\therefore\n\n Result: These beans are white./nInduction./nCase: These beans are [randomly selected] from this bag.\nResult: These beans are white.\n\n\n\u2234\n\\therefore\n\n Rule: All the beans from this bag are white./nHypothesis (Abduction)./nRule: All the beans from this bag are white.\nResult: These beans [oddly] are white.\n\n\n\u2234\n\\therefore\n\n Case: These beans are from this bag./nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (Studies in Logic) equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before[119]). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:[157]/nThe surprising fact, C, is observed;/nThe logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something must be; Induction shows that something actually is operative; Abduction merely suggests that something may be.\"[158] Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.[159] In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing/nPeirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics,[160] but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences.[161] He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.[162]/nPeirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) psychical or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics./nOn the issue of universals, Peirce was a scholastic realist, declaring the reality of generals as early as 1868.[163] According to Peirce, his category he called \"thirdness\", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities. Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 \"The Logic of Relatives\" he wrote:/nI formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information (real or feigned) we do not know not to be true. But this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which, by means of two negatives, conceals an anacoluthon. We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible./nPeirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they would behave under certain circumstances.[164]/nContinuity and synechism are central in Peirce's philosophy: \"I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy\".[165]/nFrom a mathematical point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum;[166] that a true continuum is the real subject matter of analysis situs (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds\u2014and within any lapse of time has room for\u2014any Aleph number (any infinite multitude as he called it) of instants.[167]/nIn 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Havenel (2008): \"It is on 26\u00a0May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.\"[168]/nPeirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits\u2014and it is a belief in God not as an actual or existent being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a real being.[169] In \"A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God\" (1908),[112] Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will \"stand or fall with the hypothesis\"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an \"infinitely incomprehensible\" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be more false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free[170] and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality./nPeirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\".[171] Peirce observed that \"Berkeley's metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop\".[172]/nPeirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called \"sporting\"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called \"tychasm\", \"anancasm\", and \"agapasm\")[173] of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity,[174] especially of space, time, and law.[175]/nPeirce outlined two fields, \"Cenoscopy\" and \"Science of Review\", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science. In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus:[101]/nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time./nConsequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations./nThus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do./nNow logical terms are of three grand classes. The first embraces those whose logical form involves only the conception of quality, and which therefore represent a thing simply as \"a \u2014.\" These discriminate objects in the most rudimentary way, which does not involve any consciousness of discrimination. They regard an object as it is in itself as such (quale); for example, as horse, tree, or man. These are absolute terms. (Peirce, 1870. But also see \"Quale-Consciousness\", 1898, in CP 6.222\u2013237.)/n...\u00a0death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. ... logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. ... Logic is rooted in the social principle./nI define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of \"upon a person\" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood./nI will also take the liberty of substituting \"reality\" for \"existence.\" This is perhaps overscrupulosity; but I myself always use exist in its strict philosophical sense of \"react with the other like things in the environment.\" Of course, in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God \"exists.\" The word \"reality,\" on the contrary, is used in ordinary parlance in its correct philosophical sense. [....] I define the real as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have thought them to be, or ever will have thought them to be, here using thought to include, imagining, opining, and willing (as long as forcible means are not used); but the real thing's characters will remain absolutely untouched.", "32577513": "Vikram Bhagvandas Mehta (August 15, 1946 \u2013 June 4, 2014) was an Indian mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry and vector bundles.

Gauss ranks among history's most influential mathematicians.[4] He has been referred to as the \"Prince of Mathematicians\".[5][6]/nGauss was a child prodigy in mathematics. While still a student at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, he propounded several mathematical theorems. Gauss completed his masterpieces Disquisitiones Arithmeticae and Theoria motus corporum coelestium as a private scholar. Later he was director of the G\u00f6ttingen Observatory and professor at the university for nearly half a century, from 1807 until his death in 1855./nGauss published the second and third complete proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, made contributions to number theory and developed the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms. He is credited with inventing the fast Fourier transform algorithm and was instrumental in the discovery of the dwarf planet Ceres.[7] His work on the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets led to the introduction of the Gaussian gravitational constant and the method of least squares, which he discovered before Adrien-Marie Legendre published on the method,[8][9][10][11] and which is still used in all sciences to minimize measurement error. He also anticipated non-Euclidean geometry, and was the first to analyze it, even coining the term.[12][13][14] He is considered one of its discoverers alongside Nikolai Lobachevsky and J\u00e1nos Bolyai.[15]/nGauss invented the heliotrope in 1821,[16] a magnetometer in 1833 and, alongside Wilhelm Eduard Weber, invented the first electromagnetic telegraph in 1833.[17]/nGauss was a careful author. He refused to publish incomplete work. Although he published extensively during his life, he left behind several works to be published posthumously./nAlthough Gauss was known to dislike teaching, some of his students became influential mathematicians. He believed that the act of learning, not possession of knowledge, provided the greatest enjoyment./nJohann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), to a family of lower social status.[18] His father Gebhard Dietrich Gauss (1744\u20131808) worked in several jobs, as butcher, bricklayer, gardener, and as treasurer of a death-benefit fund. Gauss characterized his father as an honourable and respected man, but rough and dominating at home. He was experienced in writing and calculating, but his wife Dorothea (1743\u20131839), Carl Friedrich's mother, was nearly illiterate. Carl Friedrich was christened and confirmed in a church[a] near the school that he attended as a child.[19] He had one elder brother from his father's first marriage./nGauss was a child prodigy in the field of mathematics. When the elementary teachers noticed his intellectual abilities, they brought him to the attention of the Duke of Brunswick, who sent him to the local Collegium Carolinum,[b] which he attended from 1792 to 1795 with Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann as one of his teachers. Thereafter the Duke granted him the resources for studies of mathematics, sciences, and classical languages at the Hanoverian University of G\u00f6ttingen until 1798.[4] It is not known why Gauss went to G\u00f6ttingen and not to the University of Helmstedt near his native Brunswick, but it is assumed that the large library of G\u00f6ttingen, where students were allowed to borrow books and take them home, was the decisive reason.[20] One of his professors in mathematics was Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner, whom Gauss called \"the leading mathematician among poets, and the leading poet among mathematicians\" because of his epigrams.[21] Gauss depicted him in a drawing showing a lecture scene where he produced errors in a simple calculation. Astronomy was taught by Karl Felix von Seyffer (1762\u20131822), with whom Gauss stayed in correspondence after graduation; Olbers and Gauss mocked him in their correspondence. On the other hand, he thought highly of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, his teacher of physics, and of Christian Gottlob Heyne, whose lectures in classics Gauss attended with pleasure.[22] Fellow students of this time were Johann Friedrich Benzenberg, Farkas Bolyai, and Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes./nThough being a registered student at university, it is evident that he was a self-taught student in mathematics, since he independently rediscovered several theorems.[23] He succeeded with a breakthrough in a geometrical problem that had occupied mathematicians since the days of the Ancient Greeks when he determined in 1796 which regular polygons can be constructed by compass and straightedge. This discovery was the subject of his first publication and ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career.[24] Gauss' mathematical diary shows that, in the same year, he was also productive in number theory. He made advanced discoveries in modular arithmetic, found the first proof of the quadratic reciprocity law, and dealt with the prime number theorem. Many ideas for his mathematical magnum opus Disquisitiones arithmeticae, published in 1801, date from this time./nGauss graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy in 1799. He did not graduate from G\u00f6ttingen, as is sometimes stated,[c][25] but rather, at the Duke of Brunswick's special request, from the University of Helmstedt, the only state university of the duchy. There, Johann Friedrich Pfaff assessed his doctoral thesis, and Gauss got the degree in absentia without the further oral examination that was usually requested. The Duke then granted him his cost of living as a private scholar in Brunswick. Gauss showed his gratitude and loyalty for this bequest when he refused several calls from the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Peterburg and from Landshut University. Later, the Duke promised him the foundation of an observatory in Brunswick in 1804. Architect Peter Joseph Krahe made preliminary designs, but one of Napoleon's wars cancelled those plans:[26] the Duke was mortally wounded in the battle of Jena in 1806. The duchy was abolished in the following year, and Gauss's financial support stopped. He then followed a call to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, an institution of the newly founded Kingdom of Westphalia under J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, as full professor and director of the astronomical observatory./nStudying the calculation of asteroid orbits, Gauss established contact with the astronomical community of Bremen and Lilienthal, especially Wilhelm Olbers, Karl Ludwig Harding and Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, an informal group of astronomers known as the Celestial police.[27] One of their aims was the discovery of further planets, and they assembled data on asteroids and comets as a basis for Gauss's research. Gauss was thereby able to develop new, powerful methods for the determination of orbits, which he later published in his astronomical magnum opus Theoria motus corporum coelestium (1809)./nGauss arrived at G\u00f6ttingen in November 1807, and in the following years he was confronted with the demand for two thousand francs from the Westphalian government as a war contribution. Without having yet received his salary, he could not raise this enormous amount. Both Olbers and Laplace wanted to help him with the payment, but Gauss refused their assistance. Finally, an anonymous person from Frankfurt, later discovered to be Prince-primate Dalberg,[28] paid the sum./nGauss took on the directorate of the 60-year-old observatory, founded in 1748 by Prince-elector George II and built on a converted fortification tower,[29] with usable, but partly out-of-date instruments.[30] The construction of a new observatory had been approved by Prince-elector George III in principle since 1802, and the Westphalian government continued the planning,[31] but the building was not finished until October 1816. It contained new up-to-date instruments, for instance two meridian circles from Repsold[32] and Reichenbach,[33] and a heliometer from Fraunhofer.[34]/nThe scientific activity of Gauss, besides pure mathematics, can be roughly divided into three periods: in the first two decades of the 19th century astronomy was the main focus, in the third decade geodesy, and in the fourth decade he occupied himself with physics, mainly magnetism.[35]/nGauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while suffering from gout and general unhappiness. His last observation was the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851.[36] On 23 February 1855, Gauss died of a heart attack in G\u00f6ttingen;[21] he is interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Heinrich Ewald, Gauss's son-in-law, and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, Gauss's close friend and biographer, gave eulogies at his funeral./nThe day after Gauss's death his brain was removed, preserved and studied by Rudolf Wagner, who found its mass to be slightly above average, at 1,492 grams (52.6\u00a0oz).[37][38] The cerebral area was determined by Wagner's son Hermann in his doctoral thesis to be 219,588 square millimetres (340.362\u00a0sq\u00a0in).[39] Highly developed convolutions were also found, which in the early 20th century were suggested as the explanation for his genius.[40] After various previous investigations, a magnetic resonance study of 1998, done at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen, gave no results which could be used to explain his mathematical abilities.[41]/nIn 2013, a neurobiologist at the same institute discovered that Gauss's brain had been mixed up, due to mislabelling, with that of the physician Conrad Heinrich Fuchs\u00a0[de], who died in G\u00f6ttingen a few months after Gauss.[42] A further investigation showed no remarkable anomalies in the brains of either person. Thus, all investigations on Gauss's brain until 1998, except the first ones of Rudolf and Hermann Wagner, actually refer to the brain of Fuchs.[43]/nGauss married Johanna Osthoff (1780\u20131809) on 9 October 1805.[44] They had two sons and a daughter: Joseph (1806\u20131873), Wilhelmina (1808\u20131840) and Louis (1809\u20131810). Johanna died on 11 October 1809 one month after the birth of Louis, who himself died a few months later./nGauss remarried within a year, on 4 August 1810, to Wilhelmine (Minna) Waldeck (1788\u20131831), a friend of his first wife. They had three more children: Eugen (later Eugene) (1811\u20131896), Wilhelm (later William) (1813\u20131879) and Therese Staufenau\u00a0[de] (1816\u20131864). Minna Gauss died on 12 September 1831 after being seriously ill for more than a decade.[45] Therese then took over the household and cared for Gauss for the rest of his life; after her father's death she married the actor Constantin Staufenau.[46] Her sister Wilhelmina married the orientalist Heinrich Ewald.[47] Gauss' mother Dorothea lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.[4]/nThe eldest son Joseph, whilst still a schoolboy, helped his father as an assistant during his survey campaign in summer 1821. After a short time at university, in 1824 Joseph joined the Hanoverian army and assisted in surveying again in 1829. In the 1830s he was responsible for the enlargement of the survey network to the western parts of the kingdom. With his geodetical qualifications he left the service and engaged in the construction of the railway network as director of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. In 1836 he studied the railroad system in the US for some months.[48][d]/nEugen left G\u00f6ttingen in September 1830 and emigrated to the United States, where he joined the army for five years. He then worked for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, where he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to Missouri and became a successful businessman.[48] Wilhelm married a niece of the astronomer Friedrich Bessel and also moved to Missouri in 1837,[51] starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in St. Louis.[52] Eugene and William have numerous descendants in America, but the descendants left in Germany all derive from Joseph, as the Gauss daughters had no children.[48]/nAt the end of the 18th century, German academic mathematics was in a poor condition: the prolific mathematicians of that time worked in France and other European countries.[e] The mathematical mainstream was orientated at solving practical problems in mechanics, astronomy, geodesy, etc.[54] In this scientific environment, Gauss can be seen, following Felix Klein, as typical of both 18th and 19th-century mathematicians. His interest in practical applicability, for example in geodesy and astronomy, qualified Gauss to be taken as a typical applied mathematician of the century of enlightenment. On the other hand, he began research in numerous parts of mathematics without defined links to practical purposes, and thus showed himself as a pioneer of what was later called \"pure mathematics\". In contrast to earlier mathematicians, such as Leonhard Euler\u2014who let their readers take part in their reasoning as they developed new ideas, and included certain erroneous deviations from the correct path\u2014Gauss developed a new style of direct and complete explanation that did not attempt to show the reader the author's train of thought.[55][56]/nBut for himself, he propagated a quite different ideal, given in a letter to Farkas Bolyai on 2 September 1808 as follows:[58]/nIt is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again./nGauss refused to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This perfectionism was in keeping with the motto of his personal seal Pauca sed Matura (\"Few, but Ripe\"). His personal diary indicates that he had made several mathematical discoveries years or decades before contemporaries published them. \nHe put down new ideas in writing to his colleagues, who encouraged him to publish, and sometimes rebuked him if he hesitated too long, in their opinion. Gauss defended himself, claiming that the initial discovery of ideas was easy, but preparing a publishable elaboration was a demanding matter for him, for either lack of time or \"serenity of mind\".[59] Nevertheless, he published many short communications of urgent content in various journals, but his \"Collected Works\" contain a considerable literary estate, too.[60][61] Eric Temple Bell said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.[6]/nOn certain occasions, Gauss claimed that a finding published by another scholar had already been in his possession previously. Thus his concept of priority as \"the first to discover, not the first to publish\" differed from that of his scientific contemporaries.[62] In contrast to his perfectionism in presenting mathematical ideas, he was criticized for his negligent way of quoting. He justified himself with a very special view of correct quoting: if he gave references, then only in a quite complete way, with respect to the previous authors of importance, which no one should ignore; but quoting in this way needed knowledge of the history of science and more time than he wished to spend.[59]/nThough Gauss is seen as a master of axiomatic presentation, it became obvious from his posthumously published papers, his diary, and short glosses in his own textbooks, that he worked to a great extent in an empirical way. Gauss was a lifelong busy and enthusiastic calculator. He coped with the enormous workload by using skillful tools.[63] Gauss used a lot of mathematical tables, examined their qualities[clarification needed], and constructed new tables on various matters for personal use.[64] He developed new tools for effective calculation, for example the Gaussian elimination. It has been taken as a curious feature of his working style that he carried out calculations with a high degree of precision, much more than required.[65] Very likely, this method gave him a lot of material which he used in finding theorems in number theory.[63]/nIt was well known to his close colleagues that Gauss disliked giving academic lectures. He first stated this to Olbers in 1802, so this aversion was not the result of bad experience. Thus he refused to accept any academic position with teaching duties during his years as a private scholar. But from the start of his academic career at G\u00f6ttingen in 1807, he continuously gave lectures until 1854.[66] He often complained about the efforts of teaching, feeling that it was a waste of his time, but on the other hand he occasionally described one or other student as talented. In all these 47 years of teaching he gave only three lectures on subjects of pure mathematics, whereas most of his lectures dealt with astronomy, geodesy, and applied mathematics. However, many of Gauss' students went on to become renowned mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers: Moritz Cantor, Dedekind, Dirksen, Encke, Gould,[f] Heine, Klinkerfues, Kupffer, Listing, M\u00f6bius, Nicolai, Riemann, Ritter, Schering, Scherk, Schumacher, Seeber, von Staudt, Stern, Ursin; as geoscientists Sartorius von Waltershausen and Wapp\u00e4us.[68]/nGauss wrote no textbooks, and (unlike his friends Bessel, Humboldt, and Olbers) he disliked the popularization of scientific matters. His only attempts at popularization were his works on the date of Easter[69] and the essay Erdmagnetismus und Magnetometer of 1836.[59]/nGauss published his papers and books exclusively in Latin or in German.[g]/nAt G\u00f6ttingen University, Gauss was accompanied by a staff of other lecturers in his disciplines, who completed the educational program: for instance the brilliant Thibaut in mathematics, in physics Weber and Mayer, well known for his successful textbooks, and Harding, who took the main part of lectures in astronomy. When the observatory was completed, Gauss took his living accommodation in the western wing of the new observatory and Harding in the eastern one. Once they had been on friendly terms with another, but in the course of time they became alienated, possibly \u2013 as some biographers presume \u2013 because Gauss had wished the equal-ranked Harding to be no more than his assistant or observer.[h] The years since 1820 were evaluated[who?] as a \"period of lower astronomical activity\".[71] The new, well-equipped observatory did not work as effectively as others; Gauss' astronomical research had the character of a one-man enterprise, and the university established a place for an assistant only after Harding's death in 1834. But nevertheless Gauss twice refused the opportunity to solve the problem by accepting offers from Berlin in 1810 and 1825 to become a full member of the Prussian Academy, without no great lecturing duties, as well as from Leipzig University in 1810 and from Vienna University in 1842. Perhaps the reason was the difficult situation of his family.[72] In his later years, Gauss was one of the best-paid professors of the university.[48]/nWhen Gauss was asked for help by his friend Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1810, who was in trouble at K\u00f6nigsberg University because of his lack of an academic title,[i] Gauss provided a doctorate honoris causa for Bessel from the Philosophy Faculty of G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811. Gauss gave another recommendation for an honorary degree for Sophie Germain, but only shortly before her death, so she never received it.[73] He also gave successful support for the talented mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein in Berlin./nAfter King William IV's death in 1837, the personal union between the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland and Hanover ceased. In the same year, the new Hanoverian king Ernest Augustus annulled the constitution given to the state by his brother in 1833. Seven prominent professors, later known as the \"G\u00f6ttingen Seven\", protested against this, among them Gauss' friend and collaborator Wilhelm Weber and Gauss' son-in-law Heinrich Ewald. All of them were dismissed, three of them were expelled, but Ewald and Weber could stay in G\u00f6ttingen. Ewald took a position the University of T\u00fcbingen in 1838, where Gauss' daughter Wilhelmina died soon afterwards in 1840, and with Weber went to Leipzig in 1843; but both of them returned to their G\u00f6ttingen positions in 1849 as the only ones of the G\u00f6ttingen Seven. Gauss was deeply affected by this quarrel, but saw no possibility to help them.[74]/nGauss took part in academic administration: three times he was elected as dean of the Philosophy Faculty.[75] Being entrusted with the widow's pension fund of the university, he dealt with actuarial science and wrote a report on the strategy for stabilizing the benefits. He was appointed director of the Royal Academy of Sciences in G\u00f6ttingen for nine years, even in his last year of life.[75]/nSoon after Gauss' death, his friend Sartorius published the first biography (1856), written in a rather enthusiastic style. Sartorius saw Gauss as a serene and forward-striving man with childlike modesty,[76] but also of \"iron character\"[77] with an unshakeable strength of mind.[78] He was noted for a sense of justice[79] and religious tolerance.[80] Apart from his closer circle, others regarded him as reserved and unapproachable, \"like an Olympian sitting enthroned on the summit of science\".[81] His close contemporaries agreed that Gauss was a man of difficult character. He often refused to accept compliments. His visitors were occasionally irritated by grumpy behaviour, but a short time later his mood could change, and he became a charming, open-minded host.[59]/nGauss' life was overshadowed by severe problems in his family. When his first wife Johanna suddenly died shortly after the death of their third child, he plunged into a depression from which he never fully recovered. Soon after her death he wrote a last letter to her in the style of an ancient threnody, the most personal surviving document of Gauss'.[82][83] The situation worsened when tuberculosis afflicted, and ultimately destroyed the health of, his second wife Minna over 13 years;  both his daughters later suffered from the same disease.[84] Both younger sons were educated for some years in Celle far from G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss himself gave only slight hints of his personal distress: in a letter to Bessel dated December 1831 he described himself as \"the victim of the worst domestic sufferings\".[59]/nGauss grew to dominate his children and eventually had conflicts with his sons, because he did not want any of them to enter mathematics or science for \"fear of lowering the family name\", as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements. The military career of his elder son Joseph ended after more than two decades with the rank of a poorly paid first lieutenant, although he had acquired a considerable knowledge of geodesy. He needed financial support from his father even after he was married.[48] The second son Eugen shared a good measure of Gauss' talent in computation and languages, but had a vivacious and sometimes rebellious character. He wanted to study philology, whereas Gauss wanted him to become a lawyer. Having run up debts and caused a scandal in public,[85] he suddenly left G\u00f6ttingen under dramatic circumstances in September 1830 and emigrated via Bremen to the United States. He wasted the little money he had taken for starting, after which his father refused further financial support. The youngest son Wilhelm wanted to qualify for agricultural administration, but had difficulties to get an appropriate education, and emigrated as well. Only Gauss' youngest daughter Therese accompanied him in his last years of life./nCollecting numerical data on very different things, useful or useless, became a habit in his later years, for example the number of paths from his home to certain places in G\u00f6ttingen, or the numbers of living days of persons; he congratulated Humboldt in December 1851, when he had reached the same age as Isaac Newton at his death, calculated in days.[86]/nGauss had a good knowledge of Latin as well as of modern languages. At the age of 62, he began to teach himself Russian, very likely to understand scientific writings from Russia, among them those of Lobachevsky on non-Euclidean geometry.[87] Gauss read both classical and modern literature, the English and French in the original languages.[j] His favorite English author was Walter Scott, his favorite German Jean Paul.[89] Gauss liked singing and went to concerts.[90] He was a busy newspaper reader, and in his last years he used to visit an academic press salon of the university every noon.[91] Gauss did not care much for philosophy, and mocked the \"splitting hairs of the so-called metaphysicians\", by which he meant proponents of the contemporary school of Naturphilosophie.[92]/nGauss' religious beliefs have been a subject of speculation by some of his biographers. He sometimes said: \"God is calculating.\"[93] Gauss was a member of the Lutheran church, like most of the population in northern Germany, but it seems that he did not believe all dogmas or understand the Holy Bible to be true quite literally.[94] Sartorius mentioned Gauss' religious tolerance, and estimated his \"insatiable thirst for truth\" and his sense of justice as motivated by religious convictions.[80]/nGauss had an \"aristocratic and through and through conservative nature\", with little respect for people's intelligence and morals, in accordance with the motto \"mundus vult decipi\". As far as the political system is concerned, he had a low estimation of the constitutional system; he criticized parliamentarians of his time for a lack of knowledge and logical errors.[91] Gauss was loyal to the House of Hanover, disliked Napoleon and his system, and all kind of violence and revolution caused horror to him. Thus he condemned the methods of the Revolutions of 1848, though he agreed with some of their aims, such as the idea of a unified Germany.[77][k]/nGauss was a successful investor and accumulated considerable wealth with stocks and securities, but he disapproved of the idea of paper money.[95] After his death a great sum of money was found hidden in his rooms.[96]/nIn his doctoral thesis from 1799 Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss' dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. He subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.[97]/nThe entries in Gauss' Mathematical diary indicate that he was busy with the subject of number theory at least since 1796. A detailed study of previous researches showed him that some of his findings had been already done by other scholars. In the years 1798 and 1799 Gauss wrote a voluminous compilation of all these results in the famous Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801, that was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and covered both elementary and algebraic number theory. Therein he introduces, among other things, the triple bar symbol (\u2261) for congruence and uses it in a clean presentation of modular arithmetic. It deals with the unique factorization theorem and primitive roots modulo n. In the main chapters, Gauss presents the first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, which allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic, and develops the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms./nHighlights of these theories include the remarkable Gauss composition law for binary quadratic forms, as well as his enumeration of the number of representations of an integer as sum of three squares. As an almost immediate corollary of his theorem on three squares, he proves the triangular case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem for n = 3. From several remarkable analytic results on class numbers that Gauss gives without proof towards the end of the fifth chapter, it appears that Gauss already knew the class number formula in 1801.[98]/nIn the last chapter Gauss gives his proof for the constructibility of a regular heptadecagon (17-sided polygon) with straightedge and compass by reducing this geometrical to an algebraic problem. He shows that a regular polygon is constructible if the number of its sides is a product of distinct Fermat primes and a power of 2. In the same chapter, he gives a result on the number of solutions of certain cubic polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which amounts to counting integral points on an elliptic curve. Some 150 years later, Andre Weil remarked that this particular result, together with some other unpublished results of Gauss, led him to formulate what is now called Weil conjectures.[99][l]/nGauss intended to include an eighth chapter that would treat the topic of higher congruences modulo a prime number in its full generality, but the unfinished chapter was found among his papers only after his death, consisting of work done during the years 1797\u20131799. It contains a systematic theory of finite fields, among other things; one particular result of special importance is a counting formula for the number of irreducible polynomials of a given degree over a finite field.[m] He also makes use of the powerful tool of the Frobenius automorphism to explore the subfields of finite fields. Gauss finishes the chapter by indicating possible generalizations of his investigations, and proves an early version of \"Hensel lemma\", which enables to lift modular properties with respect to a prime p into ever growing powers of the same prime.[101]/nIt is unclear how much Gauss was aware of the importance of the last result, but there are indications he was aware of some sort of a p-adic method, such as his motive to prove his lemma on polynomials[102] or his method of deriving Hensel's lemma.[101] In the beginning of the 20th century, Kurt Hensel introduced p-adic numbers, and in this way shed light on these investigations and brought them to conceptual maturity./nIn 1831, Ludwig August Seeber published a book on the theory of reduction of positive ternary quadratic forms,[103] with accordance with the program outlined in Gauss's Disquisitiones. However, he did not prove a central theorem of his theory, so it remained a mere conjecture. In his review of Seeber's book, Gauss simplified many of Seeber's lengthy arguments, proved this central conjecture, and remarked that this theorem is equivalent to Kepler conjecture for regular arrangements.[104]/nGauss proved Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 3 and sketchingly proved it for n = 5 in his unpublished writings. The particular case of n = 3 was proved much earlier by Leonhard Euler, but Gauss developed a more streamlined proof which made use of Eisenstein integers; though more general, the proof was simpler than in the real integers case./nAmong his published number theoretical works, his two papers on biquadratic residues (published in 1828 and 1832) are considered second in importance only to Disquisitions Arithmeticae. In these papers Gauss introduces the ring of Gaussian integers \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n[\ni\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} [i]}\n\n, and shows that this ring is a unique factorization domain. Furthermore, he generalizes into this ring many key arithmetic concepts, such as Fermat's little theorem and Gauss's lemma. The main objective of  introducing this ring was to formulate the law of biquadratic reciprocity \u2013 as Gauss discovered, rings of complex integers are the natural setting for such higher reciprocity laws./nIn the second paper, he states the general law of biquadratic reciprocity and proves several special cases of it, but proof of the general theorem is lacking, despite Gauss's statements that he found such a proof around 1814. He promised a third paper with a general proof, but this never appeared. In an earlier publication from 1818 containing his fifth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity, he claims the techniques of these proofs (Gauss sums) can be applied to prove higher reciprocity laws. In his posthumous papers, two proofs of the general case were found: one is believed to be not original of Gauss but rather based in its principles on Gotthold Eisenstein's proof, while the other was a highly original proof based on geometrical considerations involving counting lattice points in certain geometric figures. Despite its originality, the geometric proof is very long and cumbersome, and this may be the reason why he withheld its publication after he saw Eisenstein's much more direct proof./nGauss's publications on biquadratic residues opened the way for boundless enlargement of the theory of numbers, and are memorable for the wealth of investigations in \"higher arithmetic\" that they led to./nOne of Gauss's first independent discoveries was the notion of the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers; his systematic investigations on the AGM led him to discover an unusually rich mathematical landscape, and to obtain plenty of new results associated with it. He discovered its relation to elliptic integrals in the years 1798-1799 through the so-called Landen's transformation, and in a diary entry recorded his discovery of the connection of Gauss's constant to lemniscatic elliptic functions, a result that Gauss stated that \"will surely open a new area of analysis\". He also made early inroads into the more formal issues of the foundations of complex analysis, and from a letter to Bessel in 1811 it is clear that he knew the so-called \"fundamental theorem of complex analysis\" - Cauchy's integral theorem - and understood the notion of complex residues when integrating around poles./nAnother source of inspiration for Gauss's early work in analysis was his acquaintance with Euler's pentagonal numbers theorem. This theorem together with his other researches on the AGM and lemniscatic functions led him to plenty of results on Jacobi theta functions, work which culminated with his discovery in 1808 of the very general Jacobi triple product identity, which includes Euler's theorem as a special case.[105] In his publication from 1811 on the determination of the sign of quadratic Gauss sum, Gauss solved the problem by introducing Gaussian binomial coefficients and by using a line of reasoning that somehow \"hides\" its origin in theta function theory, as later mathematicians have shown. All this work was done several decades before the publication of Jacobi's \"Fundamenta nova\" in 1829; however, Gauss never found the time to systematically write and organize all his thoughts and theorems of this kind, and his contemporaries never knew the scope of his work./nSeveral mathematical fragments in his Nachlass indicate that he knew quite well parts of the modern theory of modular forms of Felix Klein and Robert Fricke. In his work on the multivalued AGM of two complex numbers, he discovered a very deep connection between the infinitely many values of the AGM to its two \"simplest values\".[106] His unpublished writings include several drawings that show he was quite aware of the geometric side of the theory; in the context of his work on the complex AGM he recognized and made a sketch of the key concept of fundamental domain for the modular group.[n] Perhaps the most remarkable of Gauss's sketches of this kind was his drawing of a tessellation of the unit disk by \"equilateral\" hyperbolic triangles with all angles equal to \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n/\n\n4\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi /4}\n\n./nIn his lifetime Gauss published almost nothing about those more modern theories of elliptic functions, but he did publish most of his results on the related theme of the hypergeometric function. In his work \"Disquisitiones generales circa series infinitam...\" (1812), he provided the first systematic treatment of the general hypergeometric function \n\n\n\nF\n(\n\u03b1\n,\n\u03b2\n,\n\u03b3\n,\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F(\\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma ,x)}\n\n, and showed that many of the functions known to science at the time, such as the elementary functions and some special functions, are a special case of the hypergeometric function.[107] This work was the first one with an exact inquiry of convergence of infinite series in the history of mathematics.[108] Furthermore, it dealt with infinite continued fractions arising as ratios of hypergeometric functions./nIn 1822 Gauss published his prize winning essay on conformal mappings, which contains several developments that pertain to the field of complex analysis. In this essay, Gauss made explicit the insight that angle-preserving mappings in the complex plane must be complex analytic functions, and used the so-called Beltrami equation to prove the existence of isothermal coordinates on analytic surfaces. The essay concludes with examples of conformal mappings into a sphere and an ellipsoid of revolution. In addition, in unpublished fragments from the years 1834-1839 he investigated and solved the more difficult task of explicitly constructing a conformal mapping from the interior of an ellipse to the unit disk.[109] His solution, which combined his early work on elliptic functions and his later ideas on potential theory, reveals his mastery of the theory of logarithmic potential, and his final results corresponded to the formula found by Hermann Schwarz in 1870./nGauss often deduced theorems inductively from numerical data he had collected in an empirical way. As such, the use of efficient algorithms to facilitate calculations was vital to his researches, and he made many contributions to numeric analysis. In 1815, he published an article on numeric integration, in which he described his method of Gaussian quadrature, that greatly improved existing methods and inspired much of the work made by later mathematicians./nIn a private letter to Gerling from 1823,[110] he described a solution of a certain 4X4 system of linear equations by using Gauss-Seidel method \u2013 an \"indirect\" iterative method for the solution of linear systems, that in some cases converges very rapidly to the exact solution. Gauss recommended it over the usual method (the so-called \"direct elimination\") for systems of more than 2 equations, stating that it can be done \"while half asleep, or while thinking about other things\".[111] As such, it was an early contribution to numerical linear algebra./nGauss invented an algorithm for calculating discrete Fourier transforms, sometimes called \"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime\", when calculating the orbits of Pallas and Juno in 1805, 160 years before Cooley and Tukey published their similar Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm.[112] He developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method, but his paper Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata was published only posthumously in 1866,[113] preceded by the first presentation by Joseph Fourier on the subject in 1807.[114]/nThe first publication following the doctoral thesis dealt with the determination of the date of Easter (1800), a very elementary matter of mathematics. Gauss aimed to present a most convenient algorithm for people without any knowledge in ecclesiastical or even astronomical chronology, and thus avoided the usually required terms of golden number, epact, solar cycle, and domenical letter, and any religious connotations.[115] Biographers speculated on the reason why Gauss dealt with this matter, but it is likely comprehensible by the historical background. The replacement of the Julian calendar by the Gregorian calendar had caused great confusion to the hundreds of states of the Holy Roman Empire since the 16th century, and was finished in Germany not until the year 1700, when the difference of eleven days was deleted, but the difference in calculating the date of Easter remained between Protestant and Catholic territories. A further agreement of 1776 equalized the confessional way of counting, thus in the Protestant states like the Duchy of Brunswick the Easter of 1777, five weeks before Gauss' birth, was the first one calculated in the new manner.[116] The public difficulties of replacement may be the historical background for the confusion on this matter in the Gauss family (see chapter: Anecdotes). For being connected with the Easter regulations, an essay on the date of Pesach followed soon in 1802./nOn 1 January 1801, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the dwarf planet Ceres.[117] Piazzi could track Ceres for only somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky, less than 1% of the total orbit, until it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data. Gauss tackled the problem within three months of intense work, and predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801. This turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by Franz Xaver von Zach on 7/31 December at Gotha, and independently by Heinrich Olbers on 1/2 January in Bremen.[118][o] This confirmation eventually led to the classification of Ceres as minor-planet designation 1 Ceres; that was taken as the predicted planet between Mars and Jupiter by the most speculative Titius\u2013Bode law.[25]/nGauss's method involved determining a conic section in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.[119] Zach noted that \"without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again\"./nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum. In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.[120] It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant./nSince the new asteroids had been discovered, Gauss occupied himself with the perturbations of their orbital elements. Firstly he examined Ceres with analytical methods similar to those of Laplace, but his favorite object was Pallas, because of its great eccentricity and orbital inclination, whereby Laplace's method did not work. Gauss used his own tools\u00a0: the arithmetic\u2013geometric mean, the hypergeometric function, and his method of interpolation.[121] He found an orbital resonance with Jupiter in proportion 18\u00a0: 7 in 1812; Gauss published this result as cipher, and gave the explicit meaning only in letters to Olbers and Bessel.[122][123][p] However, after long years he finished his work in 1816 without a result that seemed sufficient to him. This marked the end of his activities in theoretical astronomy, too.[125]/nOne fruit of Gauss's research on Pallas perturbations was his article Determinatio Attractionis... (1818) on a method of theoretical astronomy that later became known as the \"elliptic ring method\". This method introduced a useful averaging conception in which a planet in orbit is replaced by a fictitious ring with mass density proportional to the time taking the planet to follow the corresponding orbital arcs.[126] Gauss presents his method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of such an elliptic ring, which includes several complicated steps; one such step involves a direct application of the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) algorithm to calculate an elliptic integral.[q] In the late 19th century Gauss's method was adapted by American astronomer George William Hill, who applied it directly to the problem of secular perturbation induced by Venus on Mercury orbit.[127]/nIt is likely that Gauss used the method of least squares for calculating the orbit of Ceres to minimize the impact of measurement error.[10] The method was published first by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss claimed in Theoria motus (1809) that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795.[9] In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares\".[62] Gauss proved the method under the assumption of normally distributed errors (Gauss\u2013Markov theorem) in his paper Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae from 1821./nIn this paper, which was relatively little known in the English speaking world in the first century after its publication, he stated and proved Gauss's inequality (a Chebyshev-type inequality) for unimodal distributions, and stated without proof another inequality for moments of the fourth order (a special case of Gauss-Winckler inequality).[128] He derived lower and upper bounds for the variance of sample variance.[r] In a supplement to this paper Gauss described recursive least squares methods that went unnoticed until 1950, when his work was rediscovered as a consequence of the growing demand of quick estimation for various new technologies. Gauss's work on the theory of errors was extended in several directions by the geodesist Friedrich Robert Helmert, and the Gauss-Helmert theory is considered today as the \"classical\" theory of errors./nGauss made several striking contributions to problems in probability theory that are not directly concerned with the theory of errors, but offer a glimpse into his broad minded view on the applicability of probabilistic thinking. One remarkable example appears as a note in his diary and is concerned with a very unusual problem that came to his mind: to describe the asymptotic distribution of entries in the continued fraction expansion of a random number uniformly distributed in (0,1). He derived this distribution, now known as the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution, as a by-product of his discovery of the ergodicity of the Gauss map for continued fractions. Gauss's solution is the first ever result in the metrical theory of continued fractions./nGauss was busy with geodetic problems since 1799, when he helped Karl Ludwig von Lecoq with calculations during his survey in Westphalia.[129] Later since 1804, he taught himself some geodetic practise with a sextant in Brunswick,[130] and G\u00f6ttingen.[131]/nSince 1816, his former student Heinrich Christian Schumacher, then professor in Copenhagen, but living in Altona (Holstein) near Hamburg, made a triangulation of the Jutland peninsula from Skagen in the north to Lauenburg in the south.[s] The aim was not only the foundation of map production, but also the determination of the geodetic arc of that distance. Schumacher asked Gauss to continue this work further to the south and said he could find support for this project directly from the government of Hanover. Finally in May 1820, King George IV gave the order to Gauss.[132]/nGauss and Schumacher had yet determined some angles between L\u00fcneburg, Hamburg, and Lauenburg for the geodetic connection in October 1818.[133] During the summers of 1821 until 1825 Gauss directed the triangulation personally, that reached from Thuringia in the south to the river Elbe in the north. The triangel between Hoher Hagen, Gro\u00dfer Inselsberg in the Thuringian Forest, and Brocken in the Harz mountains was the largest one Gauss had ever measured with a maximum side of 107\u00a0km (66.5 miles). In the thin populated L\u00fcneburg Heath, without significant natural summits or artificial buildings, he had great difficulties to find suitable triangulation points, sometimes cutting lanes through the vegetation was necessary or even the erection of signal towers.[134]/nFor pointing signals, Gauss invented a new instrument with movable mirrors and a small telescope that reflects the sunbeams to the triangulation points, and named it heliotrope. Another suitable construction for the same purpose was a sextant with an additional mirror which he named vice heliotrope.[135] Gauss got assistance by soldiers of the Hanoveran army, among them his eldest son Joseph. Gauss took part in the baseline measurement (Braak Base Line) of Schumacher in the village Braak near Hamburg in 1820, and used the result for the evaluation of his triangulation.[136]/nThe arc measurement needed a precise astronomical determination of two points in the network. Gauss and Schumacher used the favourite occasion that both observatories in G\u00f6ttingen and in Altona, in the garden of Schumacher's house, laid nearly in the same longitude. The latitude was measured with both their own instruments and a zenith sector of Ramsden that was transported to both observatories.[137][t]/nAn additional result was a better value of flattening of the approximative earth ellipsoid.[138][u] Gauss developed the universal transverse Mercator projection of the ellipsoidal shaped earth (what he named conform projection)[140] for representing geodetical data in plane charts./nWhen the arc measurement was finished, Gauss intended the enlargement of the triangulation to the west to get a survey of the whole Kingdom of Hanover. The practical work was directed by three army officers, among them Lieutenant Joseph Gauss. The complete data evaluation laid in the hands of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who applied his mathematical inventions as the method of least squares and his elimination method to it. The project was finished in 1844, but Gauss did not publish a final report of the project and his method of projection; this work was not done until 1866.[141][142]/nIn 1828, when studying differences in latitude, Gauss first defined a physical approximation for the figure of the Earth as the surface everywhere perpendicular to the direction of gravity;[143] later his doctoral student Johann Benedict Listing called this the geoid.[144]/nThe geodetic survey of Hanover fueled Gauss' interest in differential geometry and topology, fields of mathematics dealing with curves and surfaces. This led him in 1828 to the publication of a memoir that marks the birth of modern differential geometry of surfaces, as it departed from the traditional ways of treating surfaces as cartesian graphs of functions of two variables, and instead pioneered a revolutionary approach that initiated the exploration of surfaces from the \"inner\" point of view of a two-dimensional being constrained to move on it. Its crowning result, the Theorema Egregium (remarkable theorem), established a property of the notion of Gaussian curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface. That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space./nThe Theorema Egregium leads to the abstraction of surfaces as doubly-extended manifolds - it makes clear the distinction between the intrinsic properties of the manifold (the metric) and its physical realization (the embedding) in ambient space. A consequence is the impossibility of an isometric transformation between surfaces of different Gaussian curvature. This means practically that a sphere or an ellipsoid cannot be transformed to a plane without distortion, what causes a fundamental problem in designing projections for geographical maps./nAn additional significant portion of his essay is dedicated to a profound study of geodesics. In particular, Gauss proves the local Gauss-Bonnet theorem on geodesic triangles, and generalizes Legendre's theorem on spherical triangles to geodesic triangles on arbitrary surfaces with continuous curvature; he found that the angles of a \"sufficiently small\" geodesic triangle deviate from that of a planar triangle of the same sides in a way that depends only on the values of the surface curvature at the vertices of the triangle - regardless of the behaviour of the surface in the triangle interior./nOne key differential geometric conception was lacking from Gauss's memoir, that of geodesic curvature. However, his posthumous papers show that this notion did not escape his mind, and in the years of composing his memoir he also wrote up a manuscript in which he introduced it and referred to it as \"side curvature\" (in German: \"Seitenkr\u00fcmmung\"). More importantly, he proved its invariance under isometric transformations, a result later obtained by Ferdinand Minding. Based on this evidence and the announcement in his memoir of further investigations on the curvature integral, it is very likely that he knew the more general version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem proved by Pierre Ossian Bonnet in 1848, which is closer in spirit to the global version of this theorem.[145][v]/nGauss was undoubtedly the first to discover and analyze non-Euclidean geometries,[12][14] despite never publishing.[146] He is the one who coined the term \"non-Euclidean geometry\".[13] This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory. Research on these geometries led to, among other things, Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean./nGauss' friend Farkas Bolyai with whom he had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry. Bolyai's son Janos discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829 and published his work in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work\u00a0... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"[147] This statement put a strain on his relationship with Janos Bolyai who thought that Gauss was stealing his idea.[148]/nLetters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. Dunnington argues that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by Bolyai, but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.[149][4]/nIn 1854, Gauss selected the topic for Bernhard Riemann's inaugural lecture \u00dcber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen from three proposals.[150][151] On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.[152]/nOne of the lesser known aspects of Gauss's work is that he was also an early pioneer of topology, or as it was called in his lifetime, Geometria Situs. His first proof of the fundamental theorem of the algebra contained an essentially topological argument; fifty years later, he further developed the topological argument in his fourth proof of this theorem (in 1849)./nHis earliest \"serious\" encounter with topological notions occurred to him in the course of his astronomical work, and in a small article from 1804 he determined the limits of the region on the celestial sphere in which comets and asteroids might appear, region which he termed \"Zodiacus\". He determined this region, and observed that if the Earth's and comet's orbits are linked, then by topological reasons the Zodiacus is the entire sphere. In 1848, in the context of the discovery of the asteroid 7 Iris, he  published another short article in which he further elaborated the qualitative discussion of the Zodiacus.[153]/nFrom Gauss's letters during the period of 1820\u20131830, one can learn that he thought intensively on topics with close affinity to Geometria Situs, and became gradually conscious of semantic difficulty in this field. Fragments from this period reveal that he tried to classify \"Tractfigurens\", which are closed plane curves with a finite number of transverse self-intersections, that may also be planar projections of knots. To do so he devised a symbolical scheme, the so-called Gauss code, that in a sense captured the characteristic features of tract figures. He unsuccessfully attempted to find a method that enables to determine which tract figures actually represent knot projections.[w]/nIn a fragment from 1833, Gauss defined the linking number of two space curves by a certain double integral, and in doing so provided for the first time an analytical formulation of a topological phenomenon. In the same note, he lamented on the little progress made in Geometria Situs, and remarked that one of its central problems will be \"to count the intertwinings of two closed or infinite curves\". His notebooks from that period reveal that he was also thinking about other topological objects such as braids and tangles.[153]/nIn his later years Gauss held the emerging field of topology in a very high esteem and expected great future developments for it, but since there is so few written material by Gauss from this period, his influence was made mainly through occasional remarks and oral communications.[x] For example, an indirect report by  Mobius referred to a surface constructed by Gauss, which Gauss called \"double ring\" and sayed something about its connectivity properties.[154] This report is consistent with a fragment of Gauss, written around 1840, which sketched a theory of the order of connectivity of surfaces.[155] Finally, it is worth mentioning that in the introduction to Listing's book \"Vorstudien zur Topologie\" (1847), Listing expressed his indebtness to Gauss's influence./nGauss's work did not only initiate significant mathematical theories, as he was also the author of many little \"gems\" in mathematics, especially in elementary geometry and algebra. In his way, he helped spread the new mathematical ideas of his time by demonstrating how they illuminate and shorten the solution of small mathematical problems./nFor example, he was a vivid spirit in applying complex numbers to various problems, and used them in his work on perspective and projective geometry: in a short 1836 note on \"Projections of the Cube\", he stated the fundamental theorem of axonometry, which tells how to represent a 3D cube on a 2D plane with complete accuracy, via complex numbers.[156] In an unpublished 1819 note entitled \"the Sphere\", he conceived of the complex plane extended by a point at infinity as the stereographic projection of a sphere (the Riemann sphere), and described rotations of this sphere as the action of certain linear fractional transformations on the extended complex plane.[157]/nUnder the context of Gauss's heading of extended algebraic systems, it must be mentioned that there is solid evidence that he had in his foresight the algebraic system of quaternions, the discovery of the great William Rowan Hamilton. In 1819, Gauss drafted an unpublished short treatise on \"Rotations of Space\", in which he elaborated on the use of quadruples of real numbers (of which he called \"scales\") to describe 3D rotations.[158]/nIn elementary geometry, he contributed his solution to the problem of constructing the largest-area ellipse that can be inscribed in a given quadrilateral, which was published in 1810 as an addition to Schumacher's translation of Lazare Carnot's treatise G\u00e9om\u00e9trie de position.[159] He discovered a surprising result about the computation of area of pentagons. He made many contributions to spherical geometry, and in this context solved some practical problems about navigation by stars.[y]/nOne of his most remarkable investigations was concerned with John Napier's \"Pentagramma mirificum\" - a certain spherical pentagram whose properties intrigued and occupied Gauss's mind for several decades. In his studies of the Pentagramma he approached it from various points of view, and gradually gained a full understanding of its geometric, algebraic and analytic aspects. In particular, in 1843 he stated and proved several theorems connecting elliptic functions, Napier spherical pentagons and Poncelet pentagons in the plane.[160]/nGauss' interest in magnetism is obvious since the first decennium of the 19th century. Since 1826, when Alexander von Humboldt visited him in G\u00f6ttingen, both scientists began intensive research on geomagnetism, partly independent, partly in productive cooperation.[161] In 1828, Gauss was Humboldt's personal guest during the conference of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Berlin, where he got acquaintance with the physicist Wilhelm Weber.[162]/nWhen Weber got the chair for physics in G\u00f6ttingen as successor of Johann Tobias Mayer by Gauss' recommendation in 1831, both of them started a fruitful collaboration, leading to a new knowledge of magnetism with a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time.[163] They founded the Magnetic Association (German: \"Magnetischer Verein\"), an international working group of several observatories, which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world with equal methods at arranged dates in the years 1836 to 1841. In 1836, Humboldt was helpful to organize the worldwide spread of observatories including the British dominions with a letter to the Duke of Sussex, then president of the Royal Society, wherein he asked for support for a program of global research based on Gauss' methods.[164] Together with other instigators, this led to a global programm known as \"Magnetical crusade\" under directory of Edward Sabine. The dates, times, and intervalls of observations were determined in advance, the G\u00f6ttingen mean time was used as standard.[165] Finally 61 stations participated in this global program. Gauss and Weber founded a series for the publication of the results, six volumes were edited between 1837 and 1843. Weber's departure to Leipzig in 1843 as late effect of the G\u00f6ttingen Seven affair marked the end of Magnetic Assiciation activity.[166]/nFollowing Humboldt's example, Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of his observatory, but both scientists differed over instrumental equipment; Gauss preferred stationary instruments, which he thought to give more precise results, whereas Humboldt was accustomed to movable instruments. Gauss was interested in the temporal and spatial variation of magnetic declination, inclination, and intensity, but discriminated Humboldt's concept of magnetic intensity to the terms of \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" intensity. Together with Weber, he developed methods of measuring the components of intensity of the magnetic field, and constructed a suitable magnetometer to measure absolute values of the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, not more relative ones that depended on the apparatus.[166] The precision of the magnetometer was about ten times higher than of previous instruments. With this work, Gauss was the first one who derived a non-mechanical quantity by basic mechanical quantities.[165]/nGauss carried out a \"General Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism\" (1839), in what he believed to describe the nature of magnetic Force; following Felix Klein, this work is actually a presentation of observations by use of spherical harmonics rather than a physical theory.[167] The theory predicted the existence of exactly two magnetic poles on the earth, thus Hansteen's idea of four magnetic poles became obsolete,[168] and the data allowed to determine their location with rather good precision.[169] In his \"General theorems concerning the attractive and repulsive forces acting in reciprocal proportions of quadratic distances\" (1840) Gauss gave the baseline of a theory of the magnetic potential, based on Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson;[167] it seems rather unlikely that he had knowledge of the previous works of George Green on this subject.[170] However, Gauss could never give any reasons for magnetism, nor a theory of magnetism similar to Newton's work on gravitation, that enabled scientists to predict geomagnetic effects in the future.[165]/nGauss got a remarkable influence on the begin of geophysics in Russia, when Adolph Theodor Kupffer, one of his former students, founded a magnetic observatory in St. Petersburg, following the eample of the observatory in G\u00f6tttingen, and similar Ivan Simonov in Kazan.[168]/nThe discoveries of Hans Christian \u00d8rsted on electromagnetism and Michael Faraday on electromagnetic induction drew Gauss' attention to these matters.[170] Gauss and Weber found the rules for branched electric circuits, later benamed as Kirchhoff's circuit laws,[171] and made inquiries on electromagnetism. They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833, and Weber himself connected the observatory with the institute for physics in the town centre of G\u00f6ttingen,[z] but they did not care for any further development of this invention with regard to commercial purposes.[172][173][174]/nGauss's main theoretical interests in electromagnetism were reflected in his attempts to formulate quantitive laws governing electromagnetic induction. In his notebooks from these years, he recorded several innovative formulations; he discovered the idea of vector potential function (independently rediscovered by Franz Ernst Neumann in 1845), and in January 1835 he wrote down an \"induction law\" equivalent to Faraday's law, which stated that the electromotive force at a given point in space is equal to the instantaneous rate of change (with respect to time) of this function./nIn the same year Gauss had an insightful speculative thought, according to which electromagnetic interaction between two electric charges propagates in space in finite speed, in a manner similar to light, and that the magnitude of this interaction might depend on their relative velocity. In this way, he refuted the notion of immediate action at a distance. In unpublished fragments and in an 1845 letter to Weber, Gauss attempted to unite electricity and magnetism by forming a single expression for the interaction between two charges in relative motion, from which both Coulomb's law and the effects of magnetism could be derived./nHis unpublished insights in these directions eventually merged into the so-called Weber electrodynamics, a theory that became obsolete today due to some essential  difficulties to reconcile it with the undisputed Maxwell's theory. In retrospect, despite its incorrectness, the Gauss-Weber theory contained some of the germs of later ideas, such as the existence of an electromagnetic field that is in some sense independent of its point sources (Faraday's view), as well as the notion of retarded potential./nInstrument maker Johann Georg Repsold in Hamburg asked Gauss in 1807 for help to construct an achromatic lens system. Based on Gauss' calculations, Repsold succeeded with a new objective in 1810. A main problem, among other difficulties, was the non precise knowledge of the refractive index and dispersion of the used glass types. In a short article from 1817 Gauss dealt with the problem of removal of chromatic aberration in double lenses, and made calculations about adjustments of the shape and coefficients of refraction required to minimize it. His work was noted by the optician Carl August von Steinheil, who in 1860 indroduced the achromatic Steinheil doublet, based in part on Gauss's calculations.[175] Many results in geometrical optics are scattered in Gauss's correspondences and handnotes./nIn his influential Dioptrical Investigations (1840), Gauss gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a paraxial approximation (Gaussian optics).[176] Gauss demonstrated, that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its cardinal points,[177] and he derived the Gaussian lens formula, applicable without restrictions in respect to the thickness of the lenses.[178][179]/nGauss' first and last business in mechanics concerned the earth's rotation. When his university friend Benzenberg carried out experiments to determine the deviation of falling masses from the perpendicular in 1802, what today is known as an effect of the Coriolis force, he asked Gauss for a theory based calculation of the values for comparison with the experimental ones. Gauss elaborated a system of fundamental equations for the motion, and his results correspondent sufficiently with Benzenberg's data, who published Gauss' considerations as appendix to his book on falling experiments.[180]/nAfter Foucault had demonstrated his pendulum in public in 1851, Gerling questioned Gauss for further explanations. This instigated Gauss to design a new apparatus for demonstration with a much shorter length of pendulum than Foucault's one. The oscillations were observed with a reading telescope, with a vertical scale and a mirror fastened at the pendulum; the time of oscillation was 3.1 seconds. It is described in the Gauss\u2013Gerling correspondence, and Weber made some experiments with this obviously working apparatus in 1853, but no data were published.[181][182]/nGauss's principle of least constraint of 1829 was established as a general concept to overcome the division of mechanics into statics and dynamics, combining D'Alembert's principle with Lagrange's principle of Virtual Work, and showing analogies to the method of least squares.[183]/nIn 1828, Gauss was appointed to head of a Board for weights and measures of the Kingdom of Hanover. He provided the creation of standards of length and measures. Gauss himself took care of the time-consuming measures and gave detailed orders for the mechanical preparation.[116] In his correspondence with Schumacher, who was also working on this matter, he described new ideas for scales of high precision.[184] He gave his final reports on the Hanoveran foot and pound to the government in 1841. This work got more than regional importance by the order of a law of 1836, that connected the Hanoveran measures with the English ones.[116]/nSeveral stories of his early genius have been reported. Carl Friedrich Gauss' mother had never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the Feast of the Ascension, which occurs 39 days after Easter.[185] Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of finding the date of Easter, deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.[186] Gauss felt sorry for his new born daughter Wilhelmine, because she was born on the leap day in 1808 and thus would celebrate her birthday only every four years.[187]/nIn his memorial on Gauss, Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen tells a story about the three-years-aged Gauss, who corrected a math error his father made. The most popular story, also told by Sartorius, tells of a school exercise: the teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, and his assistant, Martin Bartels, ordered students to add an arithmetic series. Out of about a hundred pupils, Gauss was the first to solve the problem correctly by a significant margin.[188] Although (or because) Sartorius gave no details, in the course of time many versions of this story have been created, with more and more details regarding the nature of the series\u00a0\u2013 the most frequent being the classical problem of adding together all the integers from 1 to 100\u00a0\u2013 and the circumstances in the classroom.[189][aa]/nGauss' favorite English author was Walter Scott, but when he sometimes read the words \"the moon rises broad in the nord west\", he was very amused.[191]/nGauss referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\" and arithmetics as \"the queen of mathematics\",[192] and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.[193]/nThe first membership of a scientific society was given to Gauss in 1802 by the Russian Academy of Sciences. Further memberships (corresponding, foreign or full) were from the Academy of Sciences in G\u00f6ttingen (1802/ 1807),[194] the French Academy of Sciences (1804/ 1820),[195] the Royal Society of London (1804),[196] the Royal Prussian Academy in Berlin (1810),[197] the National Academy of Science in Verona (1810),[198] the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820),[199] the Bavarian Academy of Sciences of Munich (1820),[200] the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen (1821), the Royal Astronomical Society in London (1821),[201] the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1821), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston (1822),[202]  the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences in Prague (1833), the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium (1841/ 1845),[203] the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala (1843), the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin (1843), the Royal Institute of the Netherlands (1845/ 1851),[204] the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid (1850),[205] the Russian Geographical Society (1851), the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1848), the American Philosophical Society (1853),[206] the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and the Royal Hollandish Society of Sciences in Haarlem.[207]/nGauss was an honorary member of the University of Kazan and of the Philosophy Faculty of the University of Prague since 1849./nGauss received the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Science in 1809 for the theory of planets and the means of determining their orbits from only three observations,[208] the Danish Academy of Science prize in 1823 for \"his study of angle-preserving maps\", and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1838 for \"his inventions and mathematical researches in magnetism\".[207]/nGauss was appointed Knight of the French Legion of Honour[209] in 1837 and was one of the first members of the Prussian Order Pour le Merite (Civil class) when it was established in 1842.[210] Furthermore, he received the Order of the Crown of Westphalia (1810), the Danish Order of the Dannebrog (1817), the Hanoverian Royal Guelphic Order (1815), the Swedish Order of the Polar Star (1844), the Order of Henry the Lion (1849), and the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art (1853).[207]/nThe Kings of Hanover appointed him the honorary titles \"Hofrath\" (1816)[75]  and \"Geheimer Hofrath\"[ab] (1845).

He studied medicine, mathematics, and astronomy at Naples and taught mathematics at the Sapienza University of Rome from 1622 to 1627. Having lost his post because of his involvement with astrology, he was obliged to retire to Venice. The Venetian Senate recognizing his learning appointed him to the Chair of Mathematics at Padua in 1632.

Instead of publishing his ideas, he would only show them to a small, select group of friends and students./nIt is suspected that this is due to the practice of mathematicians at the time of publicly challenging one another. When a mathematician accepted another's challenge, each mathematician needed to solve the other's problems. The loser in a challenge often lost funding or his university position. Del Ferro was fearful of being challenged and likely kept his greatest work secret so that he could use it to defend himself in the event of a challenge./nDespite this secrecy, he had a notebook where he recorded all his important discoveries.

He wrote the book The Animate and the Inanimate, published in 1925 (written around 1920), in which he speculated about the origin of life in the context of thermodynamics./nHis father, the psychiatrist Boris Sidis, raised his son according to certain principles with the desire for his son to be gifted. Sidis became famous first for his precocity and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms. He entered Harvard University at age 11 and, as an adult, was said to have an IQ between 250 and 300, and to be conversant in about 25 languages and dialects. Some of these statements have not been verified, but many of his contemporaries, including Norbert Wiener, Daniel Frost Comstock, and William James, agreed that he was extremely intelligent./nSidis was born to Jewish emigrants from Ukraine,[1] on April 1, 1898, in New York City. His father, Boris Sidis, had emigrated in 1887 to escape political and antisemitic persecution.[2] His mother, Sarah (Mandelbaum) Sidis, and her family had fled the pogroms in the late 1880s.[3] She attended Boston University and graduated from its School of Medicine in 1897.[4] William was named after his godfather, Boris's friend and colleague, the American philosopher William James. Boris was a psychiatrist and published many books and articles, performing pioneering work in abnormal psychology. He was a polyglot, and his son William also became one at a young age./nSidis's parents believed in nurturing precocious and fearless love of knowledge, although their methods of parenting[clarification needed] were criticized in the media and retrospectively.[5][6] Sidis could read the New York Times at 18 months.[7] By age eight, he had reportedly taught himself eight languages (Latin, Greek, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Turkish, and Armenian) and invented another, which he called \"Vendergood\"./nAlthough the university had previously refused to let his father enroll him at age 9 because he was still a child, in 1909, at age 11, Sidis set a record by becoming the youngest person to enroll at Harvard University. In early 1910, Sidis's mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard Mathematical Club on four-dimensional bodies, attracting nationwide attention.[8][9] Notable child prodigy cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener, who attended Harvard at the time and knew Sidis, wrote in his book Ex-Prodigy: \"The talk would have done credit to a first or second-year graduate student of any age...talk represented the triumph of the unaided efforts of a very brilliant child.\"[10] MIT physics professor Daniel F. Comstock was full of praises: \"Karl Friedrich Gauss is the only example in history, of all prodigies, whom Sidis resembles. I predict that young Sidis will be a great astronomical mathematician. He will evolve new theories and invent new ways of calculating astronomical phenomena. I believe he will be a great mathematician, the leader in that science in the future.\"[11] Sidis began taking a full-time course load in 1910 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, on June 18, 1914, at age 16, earning a mixture of A, B and C grades.[12][13]/nShortly after graduation, Sidis told reporters: \"I want to live the perfect life. The only way to live the perfect life is to live it in seclusion\". He granted an interview to a reporter from the Boston Herald. The paper reported Sidis's vows to remain celibate and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for Martha Foley, and enrolled at Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[14]/nAfter a group of Harvard students physically threatened Sidis, his parents secured him a job at the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, as a mathematics teaching assistant. He arrived at Rice in December 1915 at age 17. He was a graduate fellow working toward his doctorate./nSidis taught three classes: Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and freshman math (he wrote a textbook for the Euclidean geometry course in Greek).[15] After less than a year, frustrated with the department, his teaching requirements, and his treatment by students older than himself, he left his post and returned to New England. When a friend later asked him why he had left, he replied, \"I never knew why they gave me the job in the first place\u2014I'm not much of a teacher. I didn't leave: I was asked to go.\" Sidis abandoned his pursuit of a graduate degree in mathematics and enrolled at Harvard Law School in September 1916, but withdrew in good standing in his final year in March 1919.[16]/nIn 1919, shortly after his withdrawal from law school, Sidis was arrested for participating in a socialist May Day parade in Boston that turned violent. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison under the Sedition Act of 1918 by Roxbury Municipal Court Judge Albert F. Hayden. Sidis's arrest featured prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status. During the trial, Sidis said he had been a conscientious objector to the World War I draft, was a socialist, and did not believe in a god like the \"big boss of the Christians\", but rather in something that is in a way apart from a human being.[17][18] He later developed his own libertarian philosophy based on individual rights and \"the American social continuity\".[19][20] His father arranged with the district attorney to keep Sidis out of prison before his appeal came to trial; instead, his parents held him in their sanatorium in New Hampshire for a year. They took him to California, where he spent another year. At the sanatorium, his parents set about \"reforming\" him and threatened him with transfer to an insane asylum.[21]/nAfter returning to the East Coast in 1921, Sidis was determined to live an independent and private life. He only took work running adding machines or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in New York City and became estranged from his parents. It took years before he was legally cleared to return to Massachusetts, and he was concerned for years about his risk of arrest. He obsessively collected streetcar transfers, wrote self-published periodicals, and taught small circles of interested friends his version of American history. In 1933, Sidis passed a Civil Service exam in New York, but scored a low ranking of 254.[22] In a private letter, Sidis wrote that this was \"not so encouraging\".[22] In 1935, he wrote an unpublished manuscript, The Tribes and the States, which traces Native American contributions to American democracy.[23]/nIn 1944, Sidis won a settlement from The New Yorker for an article published in 1937.[24] He had alleged it contained many false statements.[25] Under the title \"Where Are They Now?\", James Thurber pseudonymously described Sidis's life as lonely, in a \"hall bedroom in Boston's shabby South End\".[26] Lower courts had dismissed Sidis as a public figure with no right to challenge personal publicity. He lost an appeal of an invasion of privacy lawsuit at the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1940 over the same article. Judge Charles Edward Clark expressed sympathy for Sidis, who claimed that the publication had exposed him to \"public scorn, ridicule, and contempt\" and caused him \"grievous mental anguish [and] humiliation\", but found that the court was not disposed to \"afford to all the intimate details of private life an absolute immunity from the prying of the press\".[27]/nSidis died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1944 in Boston at age 46.[28]/nSidis's writing covered a broad range of subjects. He wrote about cosmology, Native American history, and rail transportation, and invented a language called Vendergood. In The Animate and the Inanimate (1925), Sidis predicted the existence of regions of space where the second law of thermodynamics operates in the reverse temporal direction of our local area. The Tribes and the States (c.\u20091935) purports to give a history of the settlement of the Americas from prehistoric times to 1828.[29] Sidis suggests that \"there were red men at one time in Europe as well as in America\".[30]/nSidis was a \"peridromophile\", a term he coined for people fascinated with transportation research and streetcar systems. He wrote a treatise on streetcar transfers, Notes on the Collection of Transfers, that identified means of increasing public transport usage.[31] In 1930, Sidis received a patent for a rotary perpetual calendar that took into account leap years.[32]/nFor this work,  he was invited to speak at the inaugural \"genius meeting\" in 1926, hosted by Winifred Sackville Stoner's League for Fostering Genius in Tuckahoe, New York.[33]/nSidis wrote The Animate and the Inanimate to elaborate his thoughts on the origin of life, cosmology, and the potential reversibility of the second law of thermodynamics through Maxwell's Demon, among other things. It was published in 1925, but it has been suggested that Sidis was working on the theory as early as 1916.[34] One motivation for the theory appears to be to explain psychologist and philosopher William James's \"reserve energy\" theory, which proposed that people subjected to extreme conditions could use \"reserve energy\". Sidis's own \"forced prodigy\" upbringing was a result of testing the theory. The work is one of the few that Sidis did not write under a pseudonym./nIn The Animate and the Inanimate, Sidis writes that the universe is infinite and contains sections of \"negative tendencies\" where[35] the laws of physics are reversed, juxtaposed with \"positive tendencies\", which swap over epochs of time. He writes that there was no \"origin of life\": life has always existed and has only changed through evolution. Sidis adopted Eduard Pfl\u00fcger's cyanogen-based life theory, and cites \"organic\" things such as almonds that have cyanogen that does not kill. Because cyanogen is normally highly toxic, almonds are a strange anomaly. Sidis describes his theory as a fusion of the mechanistic model of life and the vitalist model, as well as entertaining the notion that life came to earth from asteroids (as advanced by Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz). Sidis also writes that functionally speaking, stars are \"alive\" and undergo an eternally repeating light-dark cycle, reversing the second law in the dark portion of the cycle.[36]/nSidis's theory was ignored upon release,[24] only to be found in an attic in 1979. Upon this discovery, Buckminster Fuller (who was a classmate of Sidis) wrote in a letter to Gerard Piel:/nImagine my excitement and joy on being handed this xerox of Sidis's 1925 book, in which he clearly predicts the black hole. In fact, I find his whole book The Animate and the Inanimate to be a fine cosmological piece. I find him focusing on the same subjects that fascinate me, and coming to about the same conclusions as those I have published in SYNERGETICS, and will be publishing in SYNERGETICS Volume II, which has already gone to the press.\nAs a Harvard man of a generation later, I hope you will become as excited as I am at this discovery that Sidis did go on after college to do the most magnificent thinking and writing.[37]/nSidis created a constructed language called Vendergood in his second book, the Book of Vendergood, which he wrote at age 8. The language was mostly based on Latin and Greek, but also drew on German and French and other Romance languages. It distinguished between eight moods: indicative, potential, imperative absolute, subjunctive, imperative, infinitive, optative, and Sidis's own \"strongeable\".[38] One of its chapters is titled \"Imperfect and Future Indicative Active\". Other parts explain the origin of Roman numerals. It uses base 12 instead of base 10:/nMost of the examples are presented in the form of tests:/nThe Tribes and the States (c. 1935) is Sidis's history of the Native Americans, focusing on the Northeastern tribes and continuing to the mid-19th century. It was written around 1935 but never completed, and remained unpublished at the time of Sidis's death. He wrote it under the pseudonym \"John W. Shattuck\". Much of the history was taken from wampum belts; Sidis explained, \"The weaving of wampum belts is a sort of writing by means of belts of colored beads, in which the various designs of beads denoted different ideas according to a definitely accepted system, which could be read by anyone acquainted with wampum language, irrespective of what the spoken language is. Records and treaties are kept in this manner, and individuals could write letters to one another in this way.\"[40] Much of the book is centered on Native Americans' influence on migrating Europeans and the formation of the United States.  It describes the origin of the federations that were important to the Founding Fathers./nAfter his death, Sidis's sister Helena said that he had an IQ \"the very highest that had ever been obtained\", as reported in Abraham Sperling's 1946 book Psychology for the Millions.[41] Sperling wrote:/nHelena Sidis told me that a few years before his death, her brother Bill took an intelligence test with a psychologist. His score was the very highest that had ever been obtained. In terms of I. Q., the psychologist related that the figure would be between 250 and 300. Late in life William Sidis took general intelligence tests for Civil Service positions in New York and Boston. His phenomenal ratings are a matter of record.[41]/nSome of his biographers, such as Amy Wallace, may have exaggerated his IQ.[22][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] It has been acknowledged that Helena and William's mother Sarah had a reputation for exaggerated statements about her family. Helena may have falsely stated that the Civil Service exam William took in 1933 was an IQ test and that his ranking of 254 was an IQ score of 254.[22] It is speculated that the number \"254\" was actually William's placement on the list after he passed the Civil Service exam, as he wrote in a letter to his family.[42] Helena also said: \"Billy knew all the languages in the world, while my father only knew 27. I wonder if there were any Billy didn't know.\"[22] This statement was not backed by any source outside the Sidis family, and Sarah Sidis also made the improbable statement in her 1950 book The Sidis Story that William could learn a language in just one day.[22] Regardless of the exaggerations, contemporaries such as MIT physics professor Daniel Frost Comstock and American mathematician Norbert Wiener, who wrote about Sidis in his autobiography, judged him to have had genuine ability.[11][43]/nSidis's life and work, particularly his ideas about Native Americans, are extensively discussed in Robert M. Pirsig's book Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991).[44] Sidis is also discussed in Wiener's autobiography, Ex-Prodigy.[45]/nIn fiction, the Danish author Morten Brask's\u00a0[da] novel The Perfect Life of William Sidis (2011) is based on Sidis's life. Another novel based on Sidis's life was written by the German author Klaus Caesar Zehrer\u00a0[de] in 2017.[46]/nSidis's upbringing emphasized intellectual pursuits at the expense of other qualities. In 1909, The New York Times derisively portrayed Sidis as \"a wonderfully successful result of a scientific forcing experiment\".[5] His mother maintained that newspaper accounts of her son bore little resemblance to him./nCriticism of his father's child-rearing methods occurred within a larger discourse about the best way to educate children. Most educators of the day believed that schools should expose children to common experiences to create good citizens. Most psychologists thought intelligence was hereditary, a position that precluded early childhood education at home.[47]/nThe difficulties Sidis encountered in dealing with the social structure of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing such children to rapidly advance through higher education in his day. Research indicates that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional difficulties gifted children commonly experience.[48]", "62724173": "Ghaffar Farzadi (Persian: \u063a\u0641\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0631\u0632\u062f\u06cc) is an Iranian mathematician at University of Tabriz.

Cannon was born on January 30, 1943, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.[1] Cannon received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 1969, under the direction of C. Edmund Burgess./nHe was a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison from 1977 to 1985.[1] In 1986 Cannon was appointed an Orson Pratt Professor of Mathematics at Brigham Young University.[2] He held this position until his retirement in September 2012.[3]/nCannon gave an AMS Invited address at the meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Seattle in August 1977, an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki 1978, and delivered the 1982 Mathematical Association of America Hedrick Lectures in Toronto, Canada.[1][4]/nCannon was elected to the American Mathematical Society Council in 2003 with the term of service February 1, 2004, to January 31, 2007.[2][5] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6]/nIn 1993 Cannon delivered the 30-th annual Karl G. Maeser Distinguished Faculty Lecture at Brigham Young University.[7]/nJames Cannon is a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.[8]/nCannon's early work concerned topological aspects of embedded surfaces in R3 and understanding the difference between \"tame\" and \"wild\" surfaces./nHis first famous result came in late 1970s when Cannon gave a complete solution to a long-standing \"double suspension\" problem posed by John Milnor. Cannon proved that the double suspension of a homology sphere is a topological sphere.[9][10] R. D. Edwards had previously proven this in many cases./nThe results of Cannon's paper[10] were used by Cannon, Bryant and Lacher to prove (1979)[11] an important case of the so-called characterization conjecture for topological manifolds. The conjecture says that a generalized n-manifold \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nn\n\u2265\n5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\geq 5}\n\n, which satisfies the \"disjoint disk property\" is a topological manifold. Cannon, Bryant and Lacher established[11] that the conjecture holds under the assumption that \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n be a manifold except possibly at a set of dimension \n\n\n\n(\nn\n\u2212\n2\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (n-2)/2}\n\n. Later Frank Quinn[12] completed the proof that the characterization conjecture holds if there is even a single manifold point.  In general, the conjecture is false as was proved by John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and Shmuel Weinberger.[13]/nIn 1980s the focus of Cannon's work shifted to the study of 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry and Kleinian groups and he is considered one of the key figures in the birth of geometric group theory as a distinct subject in late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannon's 1984 paper \"The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups\"[14] was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of Mikhail Gromov.[15] Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the Cayley graphs of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the hyperbolic space. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit finite presentations where the Dehn algorithm solves the word problem. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being word-hyperbolic and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in word-hyperbolic groups is solvable by Dehn's algorithm.[16] Cannon's 1984 paper[14] also introduced an important notion a cone type of an element of a finitely generated group (roughly, the set of all geodesic extensions of an element). Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a rational function. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the word-hyperbolic group context.[15] Now standard proofs[17] of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a word-hyperbolic group is a regular language also use finiteness of the number of cone types./nCannon's work also introduced an important notion of almost convexity for Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups,[18] a notion that led to substantial further study and generalizations.[19][20][21]/nAn influential paper of Cannon and William Thurston \"Group invariant Peano curves\",[22] that first circulated in a preprint form in the mid-1980s,[23] introduced the notion of what is now called the Cannon\u2013Thurston map. They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M that fibers over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface S. In this case the universal cover of S, which is identified with the hyperbolic plane, admits an embedding into the universal cover of M, which is the hyperbolic 3-space. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous \u03c01(S)-equivariant surjective map (now called the Cannon\u2013Thurston map) from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space (the 2-sphere).\nAlthough the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of Mahan Mitra,[24][25] Erica Klarreich,[26] Brian Bowditch[27] and others./nCannon was one of the co-authors of the 1992 book Word Processing in Groups[17] which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of automatic groups. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from computer science to geometric group theory and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s./nA 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\"[28] that was motivated by the classic Riemann mapping theorem in complex analysis. The goal was to understand when an action of a group by homeomorphisms on a 2-sphere is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard Riemann sphere by M\u00f6bius transformations. The \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual conformal structure on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998[29] (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as Cannon's conjecture, regarding characterizing word-hyperbolic groups with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in [29]) states that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, then G admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the hyperbolic 3-space (so that G is essentially a 3-dimensional Kleinian group). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the Cayley graph of G, is quasisymmetric to the standard 2-sphere./nThe 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson[29] gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard \"disks\" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial \"conformal\" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper[28] played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.[30][31][32]/nCannon's conjecture motivated much of subsequent work by other mathematicians and to a substantial degree informed subsequent interaction between geometric group theory and the theory of analysis on metric spaces.[33][34][35][36][37][38] Cannon's conjecture was motivated (see [29]) by Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and by trying to understand why in dimension three variable negative curvature can be promoted to constant negative curvature. Although the Geometrization conjecture was recently settled by Perelman, Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in geometric group theory and geometric topology./nThe ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\",[28] were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.[39] Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same.[39] Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue.[39] They suggested that the \"negatively curved\" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar fractals.[39] In particular they suggested (see section 3.4 of [39]) that such \"negatively curved\" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.", "30546008": "William Bull (1738\u20131814) was an English independent minister./nBull was born at Irthlingborough, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the third son of John Bull.

In 1782 he founded the Newport Pagnell Theological College, also known as the Academy.[3] In 1783 the academy started with two students; it increased its numbers, and continued for many years.

In particular, the Mabuchi energy is a real-valued function on a K\u00e4hler class whose Euler-Lagrange equation is the constant scalar curvature equation. In the case that the K\u00e4hler class represents the first Chern class of the complex manifold, one has a relation to the K\u00e4hler-Einstein problem, due to the fact that constant scalar curvature metrics in such a K\u00e4hler class must be K\u00e4hler-Einstein./nOwing to the second variation formulas for the Mabuchi energy, every critical point is stable. Furthermore, if one integrates a holomorphic vector field and pulls back a given K\u00e4hler metric by the corresponding one-parameter family of diffeomorphisms, then the corresponding restriction of the Mabuchi energy is a linear function of one real variable; its derivative is the Futaki invariant discovered a few years earlier by Akito Futaki.[5] The Futaki invariant and Mabuchi energy are fundamental in understanding obstructions to the existence of K\u00e4hler metrics which are Einstein or which have constant scalar curvature./nA year later, by use of the \u2202\u2202-lemma, Mabuchi considered a natural Riemannian metric on a K\u00e4hler class, which allowed him to define length, geodesics, and curvature; the sectional curvature of Mabuchi's metric is nonpositive. Along geodesics in the K\u00e4hler class, the Mabuchi energy is convex.

He was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home.  When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School.  In his final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu School.  He passed his entrance examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of merit. He then joined the intermediate science course at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers included Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray./nBose received a Bachelor of Science in mixed mathematics from Presidency College,  standing first in 1913. Then he joined Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee's newly formed Science College where he again stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in 1915. His marks in the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.[12]/nAfter completing his MSc, Bose joined the Science College, Calcutta University as a research scholar in 1916 and started his studies in the theory of relativity. It was an exciting era in the history of scientific progress. Quantum theory had just appeared on the horizon and significant results had started pouring in.[12]/nHis father, Surendranath Bose, worked in the Engineering Department of the East Indian Railway Company. In 1914, at age 20, Satyendra Nath Bose married Ushabati Ghosh,[3][13] the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent Calcutta physician.[14] They had nine offspring, two of whom died in early childhood. When he died in 1974, he left behind his wife, two sons, and five daughters.[12]/nAs a polyglot, Bose was well versed in several languages such as Bengali, English, French, German and Sanskrit as well as the poetry of Lord Tennyson, Rabindranath Tagore and Kalidasa. He could play the esraj, an Indian instrument similar to a violin.[15] He was actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as the Working Men's Institute.[7][16]/nBose attended Hindu School in Calcutta, and later attended Presidency College, also in Calcutta, earning the highest marks at each institution, while fellow student and future astrophysicist Meghnad Saha came second.[7] He came in contact with teachers such as Jagadish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray and Naman Sharma who provided inspiration to aim high in life. From 1916 to 1921, he was a lecturer in the physics department of the Rajabazar Science College under University of Calcutta. Along with Saha, Bose prepared the first book in English based on German and French translations of original papers on Einstein's special and general relativity in 1919./nIn 1921, Satyendra Nath Bose joined as Reader in the Department of Physics of the recently founded University of Dhaka (in present-day Bangladesh).[17] Bose set up whole new departments, including laboratories, to teach advanced courses for MSc and BSc honours and taught thermodynamics as well as James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.[18]/nBose, along with Indian Astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, presented several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, whilst a Reader in the Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the important field of quantum statistics.[19] Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.[7][20][21][22]/nWhile presenting a lecture[23] at the University of Dhaka on the theory of radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe, Bose intended to show his students that the contemporary theory was inadequate, because it predicted results not in accordance with experimental results./nIn the process of describing this discrepancy, Bose for the first time took the position that the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution would not be true for microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle will be significant. Thus he stressed the probability of finding particles in the phase space, each state having volume h3, and discarding the distinct position and momentum of the particles./nBose adapted this lecture into a short article called \"Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta\" and sent it to Albert Einstein with the following letter:[24]/nRespected Sir, I have ventured to send you the accompanying article for your perusal and opinion. I am anxious to know what you think of it. You will see that I have tried to deduce the coefficient 8\u03c0 \u03bd2/c3 in Planck's Law independent of classical electrodynamics, only assuming that the ultimate elementary region in the phase-space has the content h3. I do not know sufficient German to translate the paper. If you think the paper worth publication I shall be grateful if you arrange for its publication in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik. Though a complete stranger to you, I do not feel any hesitation in making such a request. Because we are all your pupils though profiting only by your teachings through your writings. I do not know whether you still remember that somebody from Calcutta asked your permission to translate your papers on Relativity in English. You acceded to the request. The book has since been published. I was the one who translated your paper on Generalised Relativity./nEinstein agreed with him, translated Bose's papers \"Planck's Law and Hypothesis of Light Quanta\" into German, and had it published in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik under Bose's name, in 1924.[25]/nThe reason Bose's interpretation produced accurate results was that since photons are indistinguishable from each other, one cannot treat any two photons having equal energy as being two distinct identifiable photons. By analogy if, in an alternate universe, coins were to behave like photons and other bosons, the probability of producing two heads would indeed be one-third (tail-head = head-tail)./nBose's interpretation is now called Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of quantum statistics, and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac.[25] When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented a new type of statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked./nEinstein also did not at first realize how radical Bose's departure was, and in his first paper after Bose, he was guided, like Bose, by the fact that the new method gave the right answer. But after Einstein's second paper using Bose's method in which Einstein predicted the Bose-Einstein condensate (pictured left), he started to realize just how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn't behave exactly like particles.  Bose had already submitted his article to the British Journal Philosophical Magazine, which rejected it before he sent it to Einstein. It is not known why it was rejected.[27]/nEinstein adopted the idea and extended it to atoms. This led to the prediction of the existence of phenomena which became known as Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, a dense collection of bosons (which are particles with integer spin, named after Bose), which was demonstrated to exist by experiment in 1995./nAfter his stay in Europe, Bose returned to Dhaka in 1926. He did not have a doctorate, and so ordinarily, under the prevailing regulations, he would not be qualified for the post of Professor he applied for, but Einstein recommended him. He was then made Head of the Department of Physics at Dhaka University. He continued guiding and teaching at Dhaka University and was the Dean of the Faculty of Science there until 1945./nBose designed equipment himself for an X-ray crystallography laboratory. He set up laboratories and libraries to make the department a center of research in X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, magnetic properties of matter, optical spectroscopy, wireless, and unified field theories. He also published an equation of state for real gases with Meghnad Saha./nWhen the partition of India became imminent (1947), he returned to Calcutta (now known as Kolkata) and taught there until 1956. He insisted every student design their own equipment using local materials and local technicians. He was made professor emeritus on his retirement.[20][28][7] He then became Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan. He returned to the University of Calcutta to continue research in nuclear physics and complete earlier works in organic chemistry. In subsequent years, he worked in applied research such as extraction of helium in hot springs of Bakreshwar.[29]/nApart from physics, he did research in biotechnology and literature (Bengali and English). He made studies in chemistry, geology, zoology, anthropology, engineering and other sciences. Being Bengali, he devoted significant time to promoting Bengali as a teaching language, translating scientific papers into it, and promoting the development of the region.[21][30][6]/nIn 1937, Rabindranath Tagore dedicated his only book on science, Visva\u2013Parichay, to Satyendra Nath Bose. Bose was honoured with the title Padma Vibhushan by the Indian Government in 1954. In 1959, he was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years. In 1986, the S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences was established by an act of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.[31][32]/nBose became an adviser to the then newly formed Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. He was the president of the Indian Physical Society and the National Institute of Science. He was elected general president of the Indian Science Congress. He was the vice president and then the president of Indian Statistical Institute. In 1958, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.  He was nominated as member of Rajya Sabha./nPartha Ghose has stated that[7]/nBose's work stood at the transition between the 'old quantum theory' of Planck, Bohr and Einstein and the new quantum mechanics of Schr\u00f6dinger, Heisenberg, Born, Dirac and others./nBose was nominated by K. Banerjee (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N. Bagchi (1962), and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his contribution to Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and the unified field theory. Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: \"(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is found to be of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely to the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date, he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein's Unitary Field Theory.\" Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee, Oskar Klein, who deemed his work not worthy of a Nobel Prize.[33][34][35]/nBosons, a class of elementary subatomic particles in particle physics were named by Dirac after Satyendra Nath Bose to commemorate his contributions to science.[36][37]/nAlthough seven Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to S N Bose's concepts of the boson, Bose\u2013Einstein statistics and Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, Bose himself was not awarded a Nobel Prize./nIn his book The Scientific Edge, physicist Jayant Narlikar observed:/nSN Bose's work on particle statistics (c. 1922), which clarified the behaviour of photons (the particles of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.[38]/nWhen Bose himself was once asked that question, he replied, \"I have got all the recognition I deserve\" - probably because in the realms of science to which he belonged, what is important is not a Nobel, but whether one's name will live on in scientific discussions in the decades to come.[39]/nOne of the main academic buildings of University of Rajshahi, the No 1 science building has been named after him./nOn 4 June 2022, Google honoured Bose by featuring him on a Google Doodle[40] marking the 98th anniversary of Bose sending his quantum formulations to the German scientist Albert Einstein who recognised it as a significant discovery in quantum mechanics.[41][42]", "50141287": "Harvey P.

He is mentioned in the 13th Platonic Epistle,[1] and Theopompus even claimed in his Attack upon Plato that Plato stole many ideas for his dialogues from Bryson of Heraclea.[2] He is known principally from Aristotle, who criticizes his method of squaring the circle.[3] He also upset Aristotle by asserting that obscene language does not exist.[4] Diogenes La\u00ebrtius[5] and the Suda[6] refer several times to a Bryson as a teacher of various philosophers, but since some of the philosophers mentioned lived in the late 4th-century BCE, it is possible that Bryson became confused with Bryson of Achaea, who may have lived around that time.[7]/nBryson, along with his contemporary, Antiphon, was the first to inscribe a polygon inside a circle, find the polygon's area, double the number of sides of the polygon, and repeat the process, resulting in a lower bound approximation of the area of a circle. \"Sooner or later (they figured), ...[there would be] so many sides that the polygon ...[would] be a circle.\"[8] Bryson later followed the same procedure for polygons circumscribing a circle, resulting in an upper bound approximation of the area of a circle. With these calculations, Bryson was able to approximate \u03c0 and further place lower and upper bounds on \u03c0's true value. But due to the complexity of the method, he appears to have made little progress.[citation needed] Aristotle criticized this method,[9] but Archimedes would later use a method similar to that of Bryson and Antiphon to calculate \u03c0; however, Archimedes calculated the perimeter of a polygon instead of the area./nThe 13th-century English philosopher Robert Kilwardby described Bryson's attempt of proving the quadrature of the circle as a sophistical syllogism\u2014one which \"deceives in virtue of the fact that it promises to yield a conclusion producing knowledge on the basis of specific considerations and concludes on the basis of common considerations that can produce only belief.\"[10] His account of the syllogism is as follows:/nBryson's syllogism on the squaring of the circle was of this sort, it is said: In any genus in which one can find a greater and a lesser than something, one can find what is equal; but in the genus of squares one can find a greater and a lesser than a circle; therefore, one can also find a square equal to a circle. This syllogism is sophistical not because the consequence is false, and not because it produces a syllogism on the basis of apparently readily believable things-for it concludes necessarily and on the basis of what is readily believable. Instead, it is called sophistical and contentious [litigiosus] because it is based on common considerations and is dialectical when it should be based on specific considerations and be demonstrative.[11]", "33233022": "Henri Fehr (Zurich, 2 February 1870 \u2013 Geneva, 2 November 1954) was a Swiss mathematician.

Francis, and had just completed a cross-Siberian trip on behalf of the American Red Cross, examining living conditions in prisoner of war camps. This concluded with a trip to Japan in 1918, after which the family moved to Vladivostok. The United States had a large military and industrial presence in the Far East of Russia, with more than 3,000 troops on the ground under the command of General William S. Graves. During the six years that it took for the Bolshevik Revolution to make its way to Vladivostok, US embassies were slowly being shut down and their contents moved east. Many strategic records ended up in Tokyo and were destroyed in an earthquake and fire. Most of the remaining embassy documents made their way to Vladivostok./nThe Ansoffs lived in Vladivostok until the US Embassy closed in 1924, whereupon they returned to Moscow, with Ansoff, Sr., now a Soviet citizen. They travelled the 9,000\u00a0km (5592.3\u00a0mi) on the Trans-Siberian Railway, crossing Siberia in the middle of winter in a place where temperatures of -35 Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit) are common. The cattle cars of the trans-siberian were heated by coal burning stoves and the occupants slept on straw laid out on timber bunks./nWith his father's American origin and his mother's \"capitalist\" background (her father had owned a small samovar factory in the town of Tula some hundred miles south of Moscow), the Ansoffs were suspected members of the bourgeoisie, a group assumed to harbor \"counterrevolutionary\" hopes and tendencies./nIgor's life in Moscow engendered in him a distrust of any system (political or organizational) that claimed to be too perfect or too tidy.

Moving laterally within RAND, Igor become a Project Manager in the large-scale project activity focused on making recommendations to the U.S. Air Force on technology and weapon systems acquisition. His second major study at RAND addressed the vulnerability of NATO Air Forces. The inclusion of \"soft metrics\" was treated with disdain by RAND and the airforce, and Igor learned his first lesson in organizational myopia, which was to become one of his primary concerns some 20 years later./nIn 1957 Igor left RAND to join the Corporate Planning Department of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.[1] At Lockheed he became Vice President of Planning and Director of Diversification. His experience at Lockheed focused his attention and trained him to deal with the problem of managing organizations in the face of environmental discontinuities which became the central focus of his attention during the following 30 years./nOne morning while shaving Igor realized that he had no idea of what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. While on vacation at Cape Cod he developed a long-term plan to take early retirement from Lockheed and find a job in a school of management. Within a year he was approached by The Graduate School of Industrial Administration at the Carnegie Mellon University about joining the GSIA faculty. When he entered GSIA he was allowed a year free from teaching to enable him to finish his book, Corporate Strategy, which was published in 1965 and was an immediate success.

These acquaintances started Goldbach's interest in mathematics.[6] He briefly attended Oxford University in 1713 and, while he was there, Goldbach studied mathematics with John Wallis and Isaac Newton.[3] Also, Goldbach's travels fostered his interest in philology, archaeology, metaphysics, ballistics, and medicine.[6] Between 1717 and 1724, Goldbach published his first few papers which, while minor, credited his mathematical ability. Back in K\u00f6nigsberg, he became acquainted with Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and Jakob Hermann.[2]/nGoldbach followed Bilfinger and Hermann to the newly opened St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1725.[4] Christian Wolff had invited and had written recommendations for all the Germans who traveled to Saint Petersburg for the academy except Goldbach.[3] Goldbach wrote to the president-designate of the academy, petitioning for a position in the academy, using his past publications and knowledge in medicine and law as qualifications.[3][4] Goldbach was then hired to a five-year contract as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy.[3][4] As historian of the academy, he recorded each academy meeting from the opening of the school in 1725 until January 1728.[4] Goldbach worked with famous mathematicians like Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert.[5] Goldbach also played a part in Euler's decision to academically pursue mathematics instead of medicine, cementing mathematics as the premier research field of the academy in the 1730s.[3]/nIn 1728, when Peter II became Tsar of Russia, Goldbach became Peter II and Anna's, Peter II's cousin, tutor.[4] Peter II moved the Russian court from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1729, so Goldbach followed him to Moscow.[2][4] Goldbach started a correspondence with Euler in 1729, in which some of Goldbach's most important mathematics contributions can be found.[2][5] Upon Peter II's death in 1730, Goldbach stopped teaching but continued to assist Empress Anna.[4] In 1732, Goldbach returned to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and stayed in the Russian government when Anna moved the court back to St. Petersburg.[2][4] Upon return to the academy, Goldbach was named corresponding secretary.[3] With Goldbach's return, his friend Euler continued his teaching and research at the academy as well.[3] Then, in 1737, Goldbach and J.D. Schumacher took over the administration of the academy.[4] Also, Goldbach took on duty in Russian court under Empress Anna.[2][4] He managed to retain his influence in court after the death of Anna and the rule of Empress Elizabeth.[2] In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stepping away from the academy once more.[4] Goldbach was gifted land and increased salary for his good work and rise in the Russian government.[2] In 1760, Goldbach created new guidelines for the education of the royal children which would remain in place for 100 years.[2][4] He died on 20 November 1764, aged 74, in Moscow./nChristian Goldbach was multilingual \u2013 he wrote a diary in German and Latin, his letters were written in German, Latin, French, and Italian and for official documents he used Russian, German and Latin.[7]/nGoldbach is most noted for his correspondence with Leibniz, Euler, and Bernoulli, especially in his 1742 letter to Euler stating his Goldbach's conjecture. He also studied and proved some theorems on perfect powers, such as the Goldbach\u2013Euler theorem, and made several notable contributions to analysis.[1] He also proved a result concerning Fermat numbers that is called Goldbach's theorem./nIt is Goldbach and Euler's correspondence that contains some of Goldbach's most important contributions to mathematics, specifically number theory.[2] Goldbach and Euler's friendship survived Goldbach's move to Moscow in 1728 and communication ensued.[3] Their correspondence spanned 196 letters over 35 years written in Latin, German, and French.[6] These letters spanned a wide range of topics, including various mathematics topics.[2] Goldbach was the leading influence on Euler's interest and work in number theory.[3] Most of the letters discuss Euler's research in number theory as well as differential calculus.[3] Until the late 1750s, Euler's correspondence on his number theory research was almost exclusively with Goldbach.[3]/nGoldbach's earlier mathematical work and ideas in letters to Euler directly influenced some of Euler's work. In 1729, Euler solved two problems pertaining to sequences which had stumped Goldbach.[3] Ensuingly, Euler outlined the solutions to Goldbach.[3] Also, in 1729 Goldbach closely approximated the Basel problem, which prompted Euler's interest and concurring breakthrough solution.[3] Goldbach, through his letters, kept Euler focused on number theory in the 1730s by discussing Fermat's conjecture with Euler.[3] Euler subsequently offered a proof to the conjecture, crediting Goldbach with introducing him to the subfield.[3] Euler proceeded to write 560 writings, published posthumously in four volumes of Opera omnia, with Goldbach's influence guiding some of the writings.[3] Goldbach's famous conjecture and his writings with Euler prove him to be one of a handful of mathematicians who understood complex number theory in light of Fermat's revolutionary ideas on the topic.[8]", "30873747": "Godfried Wendelen or Govaert Wendelen, Latinized Godefridus Wendelinus, or sometimes Vendelinus and in French-language sources referred to as Godefroy Wendelin[1] (6 June 1580 \u2013 24 October 1667) was an astronomer and Catholic priest sometimes referred to as the Ptolemy of his time. He was a supporter of Copernican heliocentrism, the astronomical model which positioned the sun at the center of the universe, with earth and the other planets orbiting around it. He made more accurate measurements of the distance to the sun as previously made by the ancient Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos.  He is considered by some as a precursor of Kepler and Newton. He stayed in the Provence where he met Peiresc with whom he remained in contact throughout his life.[2] The crater Vendelinus on the Moon is named after him.[3]/nWendelen was born in Herk-de-Stad in the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge (now Belgian Limburg) on 6 June 1580. His parents were Nicolaas, an alderman of Herk-de-Stad, and Elisabeth Corneli.[4] By his own account, he first observed a lunar eclipse as a schoolboy, on 30 December 1591: it ended at quarter to six in the morning, giving him just time to get to school for his first class at six o'clock.[5]/nAfter studying at the Latin school in Herk he matriculated at the University of Leuven, where he studied the liberal arts under Justus Lipsius. He was a close personal friend of Lipsius's successor, Erycius Puteanus. Intending to study with Tycho Brahe Wendelen set off for Prague, but was stopped en route by an illness that necessitated his return to the Low Countries. He then spent several years in Provence. In 1599 he established the latitude of Marseille. In 1600 he travelled to Rome for the Holy Year, and then became a mathematics teacher in Digne. In 1604 he was a private tutor in the household of Andr\u00e9 d'Arnauld in Forcalquier.[6]/nIn 1612 he obtained the degree of Doctor of both laws from the University of Orange. In the same year he returned to Herk for family reasons and became head of the Latin school in the town. He also began to study for the priesthood, and he was ordained in Mechelen by Mathias Hovius on 4 April 1620. He was appointed parish priest of Geetbets, which he remained until 1632. His time as parish priest was marked by disputes concerning tithes with the abbot of Vlierbeek and the provost of the Church of St. Denis (Li\u00e8ge), and by the keeping of an unusually meticulous parish register.[7] It was while at Geetbets that he published Loxias seu de obliquitate solis (Antwerp, Hieronymus Verdussen, 1626), a critical overview of ancient and medieval astronomy./nAround 1630 he measured the distance between the Earth and the Sun using the method of Aristarchus of Samos. The value he calculated was 60% of the true value (243 times the distance to the Moon; the true value is about 384 times; Aristarchus calculated about 20 times)./nFrom 1633 to 1650, Wendelen was parish priest of his home town, Herk-de-Stad. In 1633 he was also assigned a prebend in the collegiate church of Cond\u00e9, to provide an income that would support his scientific work. This led to contacts with Douai University and to researches in early Christian chronology.[8] One of his main works, Eclipses lunares ab anno 1573 ad 1643 observatae (Lunar eclipses observed from the year 1573 to 1643), was published during this period./nIn 1648 he was appointed official of the ecclesiastical tribunal of the diocese of Tournai, taking up office in 1649. In 1652 his Teratologia Cometica, containing a defence of heliocentric astronomy, was printed in Tournai, dedicated to Jean-Jacques Chifflet./nDuring his lifetime Wendelen was recognised internationally as an astronomer, corresponding with Mersenne, Gassendi and Constantijn Huygens. He died in Ghent on 24 October 1667./nWendelen is credited with recognizing that Kepler's third law applied to the satellites of Jupiter. There is some ambiguity about exactly when. Pierre Costabel states that the scholarly world learned of Wendelen's discovery in 1651, when the Italian cleric and astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli (1598-1671) published his book Almagestum novum ... .[9] In volume 1 of his Astronomia Reformata, Riccioli discusses the position and motion of the moons of Jupiter (Situs & Motus Satellitum Jovis) and cites Wendelen as one of his sources:  \"\u2026 ex Vuendelini Epistola ad me, \u2026\" (... from Wendelen's letter to me, ...).  On the same page (center of right side), Riccioli again credits \"Vuendelinus\" with showing that Jupiter's moons obey Kepler's third law:  \"\u2026 ita Planetulorum Jovialium distantias a Jove, esse in ratione sequialtera suorum temporum periodicorum.\" (... so the three-halves power of the distances of Jupiter's satellites from Jupiter, to be in the ratio of their periodic times.)[10] On page 370 (near end of paragraph 4 on right side of page), during a discussion of the number of moons of Jupiter (De Numero Satellitum Jovis), he cites as a source:  \"Deniq; Vuendelinus in Epistola ad me anni 1647.\" (Finally; Wendelen in a letter to me in the year 1647.) This might suggest that Wendelen made his discovery in the 1640s.  However, Pierre Costabel states that Peiresc (1580-1637) made observations of Jupiter's moons in 1610,[11] a time when Wendelen was living near Peiresc, and that by 1624, Wendelen was using Peiresc's data to construct tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, so that navigators could determine their longitude[12] Johannes Kepler recognized at least as early as 1622 that Jupiter's moons obey his third law. He discussed Jupiter's moons in his Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Epitome of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, page 554.[13]/nOriginal\u00a0:  4) Confirmatur vero fides hujus rei comparatione quatuor Jovialium et Jovis cum sex planetis et Sole.

One tells about the form of the earth, the elements and the structure of the spheres.[14][7][15] Other works included papers on astrology, trigonometry, and music./nSome scholars think that the Magister Abraham who dictated De Astrolabio (probably at Toulouse) to Rudolf de Bruges (a work that the latter finished in 1143) was identical with Abraham bar \u1e24iyya.[16] Although the title \"Sephardi\" is always appended to his name, Barcelona was at the time no longer under Muslim rule, and therefore not part of Sepharad. Abraham Albargeloni (i.e., from Barcelona) thus belonged to the community of the Jews of Catalonia. Catalonia joined Provence in 1112 and Aragon in 1137, and thus the County of Barcelona became the capital of the Catalan-Aragonese Confederation called the Crown of Aragon. The kings of the Crown of Aragon extended their domains to the Occitan countries in what is now southern France. Abraham Albargeloni spent some time in Narbonne where he composed some works for the Jews of Provence, in which he complains of their Proven\u00e7al Jewry's ignorance of mathematics.[4]/nAbraham bar \u1e24iyya was one of the most important figures in the scientific movement which made the Jews of Provence, the Jews of Catalonia, Spain, and Italy the intermediaries between Arabic science and the Christian world, in both his original works and his translations.[4]/nBar \u1e24iyya's Yesode ha-Tebunah u-Migdal ha-Emunah (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05de\u05d2\u05d3\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4, lit.\u2009'The Foundations of Understanding and the Tower of Faith'), usually referred to as the Encyclopedia, was the first European attempt to synthesize Greek and Arabic mathematics.[12] Likely written in the first quarter of the 12th century, the book is said to elaborate on the interdependence of number theory, mathematical operations, business arithmetic, geometry, optics, and music.[17] The book draws from a number of Greek sources then available in Arabic, as well as the works of al-Khwarizmi and Al-Karaji.[12] Only a few short fragments of this work have been preserved.[4]/nBar \u1e24iyya's most notable work is his \u1e24ibbur ha-Meshi\u1e25ah ve-ha-Tishboret (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea, lit.\u2009'Treatise on Measurement and Calculation'), probably intended to be a part of the preceding work. This is the celebrated geometry translated in 1145 by Plato of Tivoli, under the title Liber embadorum a Savasordo in hebraico compositus.[2] Fibonacci made the Latin translation of the \u1e24ibb\u016br the basis of his Practica Geometriae, following it even to the sameness of some of the examples.[18]/nBar \u1e24iyya also wrote two religious works in the field of Judaism and the Tanach: Hegyon ha-Nefesh (\"Contemplation of the Soul\") on repentance, and Megillat ha-Megalleh (\"Scroll of the Revealer\") on the redemption of the Jewish people. The latter was  partly translated into Latin in the 14th century under the title Liber de redemptione Israhel.[2] Even these religious works contain scientific and philosophical speculation. His Megillat ha-Megalleh  was also astrological in nature, and drew a horoscope of favourable and unfavourable days. Bar \u1e24iyya forecasted that the Messiah would appear in AM 5118 (1358 CE).[19][20]/nAbraham bar \u1e24iyya wrote all his works in Hebrew, not in Judaeo-Arabic of the earlier Jewish scientific literature, which made him a pioneer in the use of the Hebrew language for scientific purposes./nAbraham bar \u1e24iyya co-operated with a number of scholars in the translation of scientific works from Arabic into Latin, most notably Plato of Tivoli with their translation of Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos in 1138 at Barcelona.[23] There remains doubt as to the particulars: a number of Jewish translators named Abraham existed during the 12th century, and it is not always possible to identify the one in question. Known translations of bar \u1e24iyya include:/nIn the preface to \u1e92urat ha-Are\u1e93, bar \u1e24iyya modestly states that, because none of the scientific works such as those which exist in Arabic were accessible to his brethren in France, he felt called upon to compose books which, though containing no research of his own, would help to popularize knowledge among Hebrew readers. His Hebrew terminology, therefore, occasionally lacks the clearness and precision of later writers and translators./nBar \u1e24iyya was a pioneer in the field of philosophy: as shown by Guttmann in refutation of David Kaufmann's assumption that the Hegyon ha-Nefesh was originally written in Arabic,[25][26] Abraham bar \u1e24iyya had to wrestle with the difficulties of a language not yet adapted to philosophic terminology./nWhether composed especially for the Ten Days of Repentance, as Rapoport and Rosin think, or not,[27] the object of the work was a practical, rather than a theoretical, one. It was to be a homily in four chapters on repentance based on the Haf\u1e6darot of the Day of Atonement and Shabbat Shuvah. In it, he exhorts the reader to lead a life of purity and devotion. At the same time he does not hesitate to borrow ideas from non-Jewish philosophers, and he pays homage to the ancient Greek philosophers who, without knowledge of the Torah, arrived at certain fundamental truths regarding the beginning of things, though in an imperfect way, because both the end and the divine source of wisdom remained hidden to them.[28] In his opinion the non-Jew may attain to as high a degree of godliness as the Jew.[29]/nAbraham bar \u1e24iyya's philosophical system is neoplatonic like that of ibn Gabirol and of the author of Torot ha-Nefesh ('Reflections on the Soul'), as Plotinus stated:/nSays Abraham bar \u1e24iyya, in common with Aristotle, and others:[citation needed]/nGreater is he who has succeeded in training himself to abandon every thought of worldly passion and longs only for the service and adoration of the Most High, than he who has still to wrestle with the appetites of the flesh, though he overcome them in the end./nFor after all, says he with Plato,[citation needed] the soul in this world of flesh is, as it were, imprisoned, while the animal soul craves for worldly pleasures, and experiences pain in foregoing them. Still, only the sensual man requires corrections of the flesh to liberate the soul from its bondage; the truly pious need not, or rather should not, undergo fasting or other forms of asceticism except such as the law has prescribed.[30] But, precisely as man has been set apart among his fellow creatures as God's servant, so Israel is separate from the nations,[31] the same three terms (bara, ya\u1e93ar, 'asah) being used by the prophet for Israel's creation as for that of man in Genesis.[citation needed]/nLike Ba\u1e25ya,[32] Abraham bar \u1e24iyya distinguishes three classes of pious men:/nIn accordance with these three classes of servants of God, he finds the laws of the Torah to be divided into three groups:/nGuttmann has shown that Na\u1e25manides read and used the Hegyon ha-Nefesh,[33] though occasionally differing from it; but while Saadia Gaon is elsewhere quoted by Abraham bar \u1e24iyya, he never refers to him in Hegyon.[34] Characteristic of the age is the fact that while Abraham bar \u1e24iyya contended against every superstition, against the te\u1e33ufah,[35] against prayers for the dead,[36] and similar practises,[citation needed] he was, nevertheless, like Ibn Ezra, a firm believer in astrology. In his Megillat ha-Megalleh he calculated from Scripture the exact time for the advent of the Messiah to be the year of the world 5118.[37] He wrote also a work on redemption, from which Isaac Abravanel appropriated many ideas. It is in defense of Judaism against Christian arguments, and also discusses Mohammed, \"the Insane\"; announcing the downfall of Islam, according to astrological calculation, for the year 4946 A.M./nBar \u1e24iyya's \u1e24ibbur ha-mesh\u012b\u1e25ah ve-ha-tishboret contains the first appearance of quadratic equations in the West.[11]/nBar \u1e24iyya proved by the method of indivisibles the following equation for any circle: \n\n\n\nA\n=\nC\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nR\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A=C\\times {\\tfrac {R}{2}}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A}\n\n is the surface area, \n\n\n\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C}\n\n is the circumference length and \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n is radius.[38] The same proof appears in the commentary of the Tosafists (12th century) on the Babylonian Talmud.[39]", "69605574": "Diallo M'Bodji S\u00e8ne (born July 1952) is a statistician and administrator from Mali who served as Mali's Minister for the Promotion of Women, Children, and the Family.[1]/nS\u00e8ne was born in July 1952 in Bamako.

It was in this forward-looking spirit that he participated in improving river navigation and building canals. He collaborated in the project to build a canal in Burgundy between the rivers Yonne and Sa\u00f4ne (completed much later, in 1832) and he puis se consacre au canal de Franche-Comt\u00e9 de Saint-Jean-de-Losne/Saint-Symphorien-sur-Sa\u00f4ne \u00e0 Dole (also known as the French: Liaison Sa\u00f4ne-Doubs): this part of the project to connect the Rhine with the Rh\u00f4ne, built between 1783 and 1803, is also known as the French: canal de Monsieur because it was opened by Louis V Joseph de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9, lately Prince and Governor of Burgundy.[2]/nBut his master work, \"The greatest public work of the 18th Century\",[3] was the Canal du Centre (or \"Canal du Charolais\"), (built 1783\u20131793) between Digoin and Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Over 112\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) with 62 locks, it connected the Loire to the Sa\u00f4ne, thus creating the primary route for boats from the English Channel to the Mediterranean Sea (the Loire having been connected to the Seine by the Canal de Briare)./nGauthey remained interested in development in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, his home town, where he rebuilt the quayside and built a theatre. These constructions are among many examples of neoclassical style in the area, including the dome of the pharmacy in the town, the churches at Givry and Louhans, the town hall at Tournus and the Ch\u00e2teau de Clermont-Montoison at Chagny./nChanges after the French Revolution brought \u00c9miland Gauthey honours and high office: he was named the first Inspecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es in 1791. At the age of 60 he moved to Paris, married his cousin and adopted his nephew Claude-Louis Navier, one of the most brilliant mathematicians and engineers of the early 19th century. in 1801 he became a member of the Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des ponts et chauss\u00e9es en 1801 and in 1805 its vice-president.

Around the time of the Capitulation of Wittenberg, Frederick conceived of the founding of the University of Jena, which was established in 1558 and became the university where Limnaeus was to spend all of his academic years.[2]/nUpon completion of his military service, Antonius moved to Jena, where Georg Wirn was born and lived, and where, in 1571, he enrolled at the university. In accordance with its tradition, upon enrollment he assumed the name Georgius Lymneus. At Jena, Limnaeus studied under Jacob Flach (1537\u20131611), who was a graduate of the University of Wittenberg and had exposure to Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131569) and frequented the lectures of Erasmus Reinhold (1511\u20131553.)[3]/nIn 1581, Limnaeus received the \u201cMagisters der Philosophie\u201c degree at the University of Jena./nLimnaeus issued a prognostication in 1585 in Erfurt and, in 1588, became the professor of mathematics at Jena, a position which he held until his death; concurrently, he also assumed the position of head librarian. He lectured on the Celestial sphere, astronomical and scientific calculations, the theory of planets and the use of astronomical tables, and in the areas of geography, geodesy and cosmography. Although he was not known to have produced any memorable manuscripts, he is known to have engaged in professional correspondence with peers, from time to time, including Tycho Brahe, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler, and to have maintained a respectable reputation as an academic prognosticator. In 1596, he founded the first observatory in Jena.[4]/nIn 1597, Limnaeus (along with Galileo, Brahe and Ursus) received a draft copy from Kepler of his first major work, Mysterium Cosmographicum. On April 24, 1598, Limnaeus wrote to Kepler, expressing his firm belief that heliocentric considerations should not be dismissed from the studies of astronomy by declaring, \u201cMost illustrious Sir, never was I estranged from the most ancient philosophy of the Platonists \u2013 nor have I thought, as have several petty philosophers in our time, that it ought to be shunted outside the borders of the territory of the republic of letters.\u201c These words have been used to illustrate that it was not uncommon for traditionalist academicians, such as Limnaeus, to covertly honor heliocentric views of the ancients, while at the same time skillfully avoiding any explicit reference to the more controversial views of Copernicus. Limnaeus added, however, the statement that for any serious student of astronomy, Kepler\u2019s work represents \u201da new path to knowledge of the stars.\u201d In light of the disconcerting imprisonment of Giordano Bruno in 1593 (who was executed in 1600), this open expression of both support to young Kepler, and delight in his mathematical astronomical approaches, provided him with some of the earliest, forceful words of encouragement, which he must have welcomed in contrast to the many strong criticisms his work quickly evoked.[5]/nIn addition, Limnaeus provided information to Kepler on Tycho Brahe which may have promoted his final decision to go to Prague and study under him, thereby ensuring access to Brahe\u2019s data and the furtherance of his own work. However, beyond serving as an encourager to Kepler, and a facilitator to his decision to assist Brahe, there is no record that Limnaeus ever dove into specific details of Kepler\u2019s work or adopted it for his lessons.[6]/nKepler assisted Brahe from 1599 until Brahe\u2019s sudden death in 1601. By 1609, Kepler would develop and introduce his laws of planetary motion, which would subsequently play a major role in the development of Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, as has been noted by Newton./nLimnaeus and his wife fell victim to the 1611 plague in Jena.", "40245486": "Georg Bohlmann (23 April 1869 \u2013 25 April 1928) was a German mathematician who specialized in probability theory and actuarial mathematics./nGeorg Bohlmann went to school in Berlin and Leipzig and took his Abitur at the Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin in 1888. After that, he began studying mathematics at the University of Berlin under Leopold Kronecker, Lazarus Fuchs, and Wilhelm Dilthey. As he advanced in his studies, Lie groups became the focus of his interest. Since this area was poorly represented at Berlin, he moved to the University of Halle, where he obtained his doctorate in 1892 under Albert Wangerin with a dissertation on the topic Ueber eine gewisse Klasse continuierlicher Gruppen und ihren Zusammenhang mit den Additionstheoremen (\"On a certain class of continuous groups and their relation to addition theorems\").[1] After that, he worked at the Meteorological Institute of Berlin, where presumably his interest in applied mathematics developed.  At the invitation of Felix Klein, he moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he habilitated in 1894. In 1895, he was involved in starting a seminar on actuarial science at G\u00f6ttingen.  However, since he held no permanent position there, he went to Berlin in 1903 to work as the Chief Actuary for the German subsidiary of the New York Mutual Life Insurance Company./nIn 1901, he wrote the entry on life insurance mathematics in the Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften (\"Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences\") in which he gave axioms for probability theory long before Andrey Kolmogorov did so in 1933. In particular, he was the first to give the modern definition of statistical independence. Compared to the current structure of probability theory, his work only lacked the technical condition of sigma additivity. However, in contrast to Kolmogorov, Bohlmann failed to prove significant theorems within his axiomatic framework. As a result, his fundamental contributions to probability theory gained very little attention. In particular, though Kolmogorov had visited G\u00f6ttingen several times in the late 1920s, he had no knowledge of Bohlmann's work./nBohlmann was an invited speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1908 at Rome.[2][3]", "34674927": "Jean Jacques Moreau (31 July 1923 \u2013 9 January 2014)[1] was a French mathematician and mechanician. He normally published under the name J. J. Moreau./nMoreau was born in Blaye. He received his doctorate in mathematics from the University of Paris, then became a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.  He was appointed Professor of Mathematical Models in Physics at Poitiers University and later Professor of General Mechanics at University of Montpellier II.  He was emeritus professor in the Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et G\u00e9nie Civil, a joint research unit of the university and the CNRS./nMoreau's principal works have been in non-smooth mechanics and convex analysis. He is considered one of the founders of convex analysis, where several fundamental and now classical results have his name (Moreau's lemma of the two cones, Moreau's envelopes, Moreau-Yosida's approximations, Fenchel-Moreau's theorem, etc.). He founded the Convex Analysis Group in the 1970s at Montpellier University (France)./nHe may also be considered as the father of non-smooth mechanics, a field of Solid Mechanics dealing with mechanical systems subjected to unilateral and bilateral constraints, impacts and set-valued friction laws (like Coulomb's friction law and its variations). He was the first to introduce complementarity conditions in Lagrangian systems, and to prove that the Gauss' principle of Mechanics extends to the case of non-smooth mechanics (one C.R.A.S. Paris paper in 1963 and a SIAM Control J. article in 1966). He invented in 1971/1972  the so-called sweeping process, which is a specific differential inclusion whose right-hand side is the normal cone to a time or state-dependent set (that may be convex or not). Sweeping processes represent a nice and powerful mathematical framework for many non-smooth mechanical systems, including Lagrangian systems, with applications in plasticity, fluid mechanics, electrical circuits with non-smooth components, etc. The mathematical literature on various kinds of sweeping processes has become abundant, with extensions towards non-convex sets (especially prox-regular sets), state-dependent sets, higher-order processes with distributional solutions, relationships with complementarity dynamical systems, etc./nAfter retiring in the 1980s, he started an intense research activity in Granular Matter, and contributed to settle the so-called Moreau-Jean event-capturing (or time-stepping) numerical scheme. The Moreau-Jean scheme may be seen as an extension of the implicit Euler method, originating from the (second order) sweeping process formalism of the Lagrange dynamics with unilateral constraints and impacts, which is a specific Measure Differential Inclusion (i.e., a differential inclusion whose solutions are measures). The Moreau-Jean scheme has inspired several groups of researchers in Europe and the USA for the simulation of non-smooth mechanical systems, and is available in open-source software packages like the INRIA SICONOS platform or the LMGC90 platform./nHe discovered the helicity invariant in the fluid dynamics of ideal fluids in 1962./nMoreau received many prizes, including the Grand Prix Joannid\u00e8s of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences./nSome of J.J.

Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), and Lemuel Shattuck Research Professor of Statistical Science (the first recipient).[1]  During the 1980s, Zelen chaired HSPH's Department of Biostatistics. Among colleagues in the field of statistics, he was widely known as a leader who shaped the discipline of biostatistics.[2]  He \"transformed clinical trial research into a statistically sophisticated branch of medical research.\"[3]/nZelen was noted for his developing some of the statistical methods and study designs still used in clinical cancer trials, in which experimental drugs are tested for toxicity, effectiveness, and proper dosage.  He introduced measures to ensure that data gathered from human trials would be as free as possible of errors and biases\u2014measures that are now standard practice.  Zelen helped transform clinical trial research into a well-managed and statistically sophisticated branch of medical science.  His work in this area led to significant medical advances, such as improved treatments for several different forms of cancer. His research also focused on improved early detection of cancer; on modeling the progression of cancer and its response to treatment; and on using statistical models to help determine optimal screening strategies for various common cancers, especially breast cancer. Ironically, he died after a prolonged battle with cancer./nOne of those experimental design models for randomized clinical trials is known as Zelen's design or Zelen's randomized consent design,[4] in which patients are randomized to either the treatment or to the control group before they give their informed consent. Because the group to which any given patient is assigned is known at the time of consenting, the study patient's consent can be sought conditionally./nIn 1962 Zelen was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[5]/nVisiting faculty member:/nMarvin Zelen was born and reared in New York City, where he attended and in 1944 received a diploma from Evander Childs High School.  Then, as a mathematics major at City College of New York, he discovered and developed his lifelong interest in statistics and probability.  In 1949, he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics there.  After earning a master's degree in mathematical statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1951, he worked for 10 years at the mathematics lab of the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C.  He was the only math lab employee without a doctorate, which he later earned in 1957 at American University./nIn the early 1960s, Zelen spent two years (1961-1963) as a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Mathematics Research Center, where he first worked with cancer researchers, helping them address problems with study design. After that, for four years beginning in 1963, he led the National Cancer Institute\u2019s applied mathematics and statistics section, where he delved further into cancer and clinical research. He spent a year in London as a Fulbright Scholar, and then he joined the biostatistics department at the State University of New York in Buffalo, now University at Buffalo./nDuring his 10 years in Buffalo, Zelen helped the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \u2014 one of several regional organizations established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to test experimental cancer treatments \u2014 with its studies. In an American University alumni magazine article in 2008, Zelen said those early studies were \u201cterrible.\u201d He said the studies were \u201cpoorly thought out; the data was wrong; they had poor quality control, not enough patients \u2014 everything you can think of that was antiscientific.\u201d  He urged biomedical researchers in charge of the studies to begin from scratch because they had learned relatively little because of study design flaws. They agreed with Zelen, and along with his longtime collaborator Paul Carbone, he established research standards and practice now used in clinical trials for many infectious diseases.  During that period, Zelen formed the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Buffalo, which focused on overseeing and improving statistical aspects of large, complex drug trials.  ECOG would later become one of the world's largest programs for testing and evaluating various cancer treatments./nZelen was also prominent in President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cwar on cancer\u201d during the early 1970s.  He was chair of a committee responsible for designing and organizing the new program. Lee-Jen Wei, HSPH biostatistics professor, called Zelen's involvement in the early war on cancer \u201ctremendous and lasting.\u201d/nIn the mid-1970s, Zelen's pioneering work in Buffalo brought him to the attention of HSPH's then-biostatistics chair, Frederick Mosteller.  Zelen insisted that he would only come to Harvard if he could bring the biostatistics team which he had built in Buffalo, since he wanted to build the world's greatest biostatistics department wherever he went.  Thus, in 1977, 27 faculty, researchers, and other staff members moved from Buffalo to Boston, along with their DEC-20 computer and their research projects, the ECOG trials \u2014 150 cancer trials involving several thousand patients.  Zelen's lab was established at the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, where, simultaneously with his tenure at HSPH, he built the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute\u2019s Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology./nZelen\u2019s colleague and successor (as Department Chair), biostatistics professor Nan Laird, recalled that \u201cthose first few years of integrating twelve new faculty members from Buffalo with half as many from Harvard were part of Marvin\u2019s grand plan to make Harvard the nation's leading biostatistics department \u2014 which it is and has been for quite some time. It was an enormously exciting time when we were united in working towards a common goal. Marvin\u2019s genius was that he got all of us involved, then stepped back and gave us all the credit.\u201d/nZelen served for a decade in the 1980s (1981-1990) as chair of the Harvard School of Public Health's Department of Biostatistics, where he has been credited with transforming HSPH's biostatistics department into the best biostatistics department in the United States.  He was also a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, in the FAS Department of Statistics in Harvard Square, and voted to remain an Emeritus Professor there, also, until his death in late 2014./nIn 2007, Zelen became the first holder of the newly named (by Harvard President Derek Bok) Lemuel Shattuck Research Professor of Statistical Science at HSPH.[7]/nZelen was known for developing the statistical methods and study designs that are used in clinical cancer trials, in which experimental drugs are tested for toxicity, effectiveness, and proper dosage.

His research also focused on improved early detection of cancer; on modeling the progression of cancer and its response to treatment; and on using statistical models to help determine optimal screening strategies for various common cancers, especially breast cancer./nMitchell H. Gail, MD, PhD,[8] senior investigator in the biostatistics branch of NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and president of the American Statistical Association (1995), commented:/nMarvin had a lot of guts and a vision for what was important.  He finagled NCI into supporting the use of DEC-10 (PDP-10) computers in clinical trials, long before the study section supported it. He inspired the clinical trials community of statisticians./nOn a more personal level, Zelen's colleague and successor Laird said that/n[Prof. Zelen was] a tremendous force in my personal and professional life. He was always in and out of my office, asking how things were going. Even as he was trying to convince me to do something I absolutely did not want to do, I always felt his intentions for me were the best. Marvin was always honest and unpretentious./nIn 1981, Zelen succeeded Frederick Mosteller as Biostatistics Chair.  He continued working on the ECOG trials, helped lay the groundwork for the department's pre-eminence in AIDS clinical trials, and improved the biostatistics curriculum.  As its chair, he helped propel the department to its position as a leading center for biostatistical research./nZelen also achieved another level of fame in the early 1980s when he and his late colleague (died 2009) in the biostatistics department, Stephen Lagakos,[9] launched a study of a possible connection between a cluster of childhood leukemia cases in Woburn and the town's water supply.  Known as the Harvard Health Study, the investigation showed, for the first time, a connection between Woburn's contaminated water and a variety of adverse health effects, including leukemia. The matter made headlines, wound up in court, and was chronicled in the book A Civil Action, which was later made into a movie. As the book notes, when Prof. Zelen announced the study's results in the basement of a Woburn church in February 1984, someone in the audience called out, \u201cThank God for Marvin Zelen,\u201d and the crowd burst into applause./nAnother of Zelen's achievements was his establishment, in 1975, of the Frontier Science and Technology Research Foundation in Boston, a nonprofit devoted to advancing the use of statistical science and practice and data management techniques in science, health care, and education. Prof. Zelen served as president, and his wife Thelma was chief administrative officer.  Several of his other close friends and Harvard colleagues were also directly involved.  Richard D. Gelber, professor of biostatistics of HSPH and at DFCI,[10] and winner of the 2008 Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction, noted:/nThis is another excellent example of how Marvin established an environment within which others could flourish. Thelma\u2019s contributions to Marvin\u2019s success cannot be overlooked. Their partnership is a role model of working together, and she has been a major force in the formation and administrative leadership of Frontier Science as its chief operating officer for almost 40 years./nand, adding his voice of praise for Prof. Zelen's mentorship and generosity/nDuring the past 39 years, Marvin taught me much about the importance of collaborative research, and how progress is fueled by statistical and clinical scientists working together as partners./nFellow biostatisticians from around the country\u2014people like Jack Kalbfleisch from the University of Michigan, Ross Prentice from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and Norman Breslow from the University of Washington - have all spoken of Zelen's huge influence. Said Kalbfleisch, \u201cMarvin was a tremendous force in the profession and a great mentor to so many of his colleagues and students.\u201d Prentice said Prof. Zelen \u201cdid much to define the biostatistical profession.\u201d Breslow said he was \u201cgreatly influenced by Marvin and his work.\u201d/nAgain, Mitchell H. Gail of National Cancer Institute recalled:/nSo many people were helped by Marvin, whether they needed assistance with starting a company, with a personal matter, or with ideas and guidance in academic statistics. That is truly a legacy to be proud of./nZelen was survived by his wife, Thelma Geier Zelen, and their two daughters, Deborah and Sandy Zelen, and by two grandsons, Matthew and Toby Mues.[11]/nSymposia/nCurrent HSPH biostatistics chair Victor de Gruttola said/nScientists from around the world have benefited from Dr. Zelen\u2019s innovative ideas and transformative effect on biomedical research, but those of us associated with the Harvard Department of Biostatistics are particularly grateful for Dr. Zelen\u2019s commitment to educating students and advancing the careers of junior scientists./nZelen has had work published in more than 150 publications.

For over 35 years she has taught Mathematics at America's oldest historically black college for women. Located just west of downtown, Spelman's campus sits adjacent Morehouse College.[7] While there, she worked under Shirley Mathis McBay, Etta Zuber Falconer, and Gladys Glass, mathematicians who were pushing to improve Spelman's science and Mathematics programs.

His well-known Arte de navegar (\"The Art of Navigation\", 1545) was the first work published in Spain dealing exclusively with navigational techniques (Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Enciso's Suma de Geographia, 1519, which gave ample geographical information already contained solar declination tables with explanations and the corrections for finding the latitude by measuring the height of Polaris)./nMedina is believed to have been born in Seville, although based on his name and the protection afforded to him by the Dukes of Medina Sidonia he may instead have been born in Medina-Sidonia.[1] In 1520 he became tutor to Juan Claros P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n y Arag\u00f3n, the Count of Niebla and heir to Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 6th Duke of Medina Sidonia.[2]/nAfter having amicably parted from the House of Medina Sidonia, he sought recognition as a cosmographer and brought out a text titled Libro de Cosmograf\u00eda (\"Book of Cosmography\", 1538). He received official permission to compile navigation maps, to write books about pilotage, and to manufacture navigational devices necessary for voyages to the Indies. In February 1539, he was appointed in Seville as examiner of the navigators and ship's captains who would take part in the conquest of the Indies. His work was closely associated with the \"House of Trade\" (Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n), the Spanish government agency overseeing the exploration and colonization of the New World, although he never succeeded in gaining employment in that agency.[2] He soon became aware of defects in the training of navigators and in the instruments, books and maps they relied upon, and wrote a \"Representation\" to King Charles I on the subject. This was the culmination of his rivalry with the cartographer Diego Guti\u00e9rrez and his family, who had the support of John Cabot. Medina's letter quickly led to a royal command of 22 February 1545, banning Guti\u00e9rrez from continuing to issue maps and instruments that Medina had described as very harmful to the students.[3][4]/nIn 1545 Medina published his most important work, Arte de navegar (\"The Art of Navigation\") in eight volumes. It was dedicated to the future Philip II, in support of his quest to be appointed royal cosmographer.[2] This work was an overview of existing knowledge on this subject, and was probably a revision and expansion of his \"Book of Cosmography\", which had already been examined by the Council of the Indies. Arte was the first treatise on navigation to be published in Spain (although a book by Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Albacar, published in C\u00e1diz in 1551, was also important). The senior cosmographer Alonso de Chaves demonstrated that Medina's Arte was a compilation, made with the assistance of other writers. Diego Guti\u00e9rrez and other authors claimed that they had helped with parts of the book, and Medina himself acknowledged the assistance of Francisco Faleiro and Alonso de Santa Cruz on other occasions, but not with the writing of Arte. The book was internationally disseminated and quickly translated into several European languages: it was translated into French fifteen times between 1554 and 1663, five times into Dutch (1580-1598), three times into Italian (1554-1609) and twice into English. This work contributed considerably to the development of navigation on the high seas./nIn 1549 Medina achieved appointment as honorary royal cosmographer. An abridged edition of Arte in Spanish was published in 1552 under the title Regimiento de navegaci\u00f3n (\"The control of navigation\"), omitting most of the theory of spherical geometry and including only what was essential for navigators. A later edition of Regimiento (1563) updated this popular handbook and added twenty \"warnings\" for the practical navigator. His unpublished Suma de Cosmographia (\"Compendium of cosmography\") of 1561 is an abridged version of Arte de navegar, containing information on astrology and navigation and written for a nonspecialist audience.[2]/nMedina's work adhered to the cosmological system of Ptolemy rather than that of Copernicus.[2] Despite his knowledge and achievements Medina continued to deny the phenomenon of magnetic declination, of which he lacked personal experience, in opposition to the opinion of most other cosmographers of the time.[5][6]/nMedina acted as royal adviser during the two assemblies convened by the Council of the Indies in 1554 and 1556 to determine the precise position of the Philippines and the Moluccas, and to define the demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese control in that part of the world. Mount Medina in Antarctica is named in his honour./nMedina also wrote historical and philosophical books. In 1548 he published a work titled Libro de las grandezas y cosas memorables de Espa\u00f1a (\"Book of the great deeds and memorable things of Spain\"). This dealt with historical acts and important towns in Spain, with engravings and transcriptions of key documents. It was later (1595) revised and expanded by Diego P\u00e9rez de Mesa, professor of mathematics at the University of Alcal\u00e1.

He was also a director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute./nWilliam Thurston was born in Washington, D.C., to Margaret Thurston (n\u00e9e\u00a0Martt), a seamstress, and Paul Thurston, an aeronautical engineer.[1] William Thurston suffered from congenital strabismus as a child, causing issues with depth perception.[1] His mother worked with him as a toddler to reconstruct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional ones.[1]/nHe received his bachelor's degree from New College in 1967 as part of its inaugural class.[1][2] For his undergraduate thesis, he developed an intuitionist foundation for topology.[3] Following this, he received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley under Morris Hirsch, with his thesis Foliations of Three-Manifolds which are Circle Bundles in 1972.[1][4]/nAfter completing his Ph.D., Thurston spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study,[1][5] then another year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor.[1]/nIn 1974, Thurston was appointed a full professor at Princeton University.[1][6] He returned to Berkeley in 1991 to be a professor (1991-1996) and was also director of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) from 1992 to 1997.[1][7] He was on the faculty at UC Davis from 1996 until 2003, when he moved to Cornell University.[1]/nThurston was an early adopter of computing in pure mathematics research.[1] He inspired Jeffrey Weeks to develop the SnapPea computing program.[1]/nDuring Thurston's directorship at MSRI, the institute introduced several innovative educational programs that have since become standard for research institutes.[1]/nHis Ph.D. students include Danny Calegari, Richard Canary, David Gabai, William Goldman, Benson Farb, Richard Kenyon, Steven Kerckhoff, Yair Minsky, Igor Rivin, Oded Schramm, Richard Schwartz, William Floyd, and Jeffrey Weeks.[8]/nHis early work, in the early 1970s, was mainly in foliation theory. His more significant results include:/nIn fact, Thurston resolved so many outstanding problems in foliation theory in such a short period of time that it led to an exodus from the field, where advisors counselled students against going into foliation theory,[9] because Thurston was \"cleaning out the subject\" (see \"On Proof and Progress in Mathematics\", especially section 6[10])./nHis later work, starting around the mid-1970s, revealed that hyperbolic geometry played a far more important role in the general theory of 3-manifolds than was previously realised.  Prior to Thurston, there were only a handful of known examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume, such as the Seifert\u2013Weber space.  The independent and distinct approaches of Robert Riley and Troels J\u00f8rgensen in the mid-to-late 1970s showed that such examples were less atypical than previously believed; in particular their work showed that the figure-eight knot complement was hyperbolic.  This was the first example of a hyperbolic knot./nInspired by their work, Thurston took a different, more explicit means of exhibiting the hyperbolic structure of the figure-eight knot complement.  He showed that the figure-eight knot complement could be decomposed as the union of two regular ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra whose hyperbolic structures matched up correctly and gave the hyperbolic structure on the figure-eight knot complement.  By utilizing Haken's normal surface techniques, he classified the incompressible surfaces in the knot complement.  Together with his analysis of deformations of hyperbolic structures, he concluded that all but 10 Dehn surgeries on the figure-eight knot resulted in irreducible, non-Haken non-Seifert-fibered 3-manifolds.  These were the first such examples; previously it had been believed that except for certain Seifert fiber spaces, all irreducible 3-manifolds were Haken.  These examples were actually hyperbolic and motivated his next theorem./nThurston proved that in fact most Dehn fillings on a cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold resulted  in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  This is his celebrated hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem./nTo complete the picture, Thurston proved a hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds.  A particularly important corollary is that many knots and links are in fact hyperbolic.  Together with his hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, this showed that closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds existed in great abundance./nThe hyperbolization theorem for Haken manifolds has been called Thurston's Monster Theorem, due to the length and difficulty of the proof.  Complete proofs were not written up until almost 20 years later.  The proof involves a number of deep and original insights which have linked many apparently disparate fields to 3-manifolds./nThurston was next led to formulate his geometrization conjecture.  This gave a conjectural picture of 3-manifolds which indicated that all 3-manifolds admitted a certain kind of geometric decomposition involving eight geometries, now called Thurston model geometries.  Hyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent geometry in this picture and also the most complicated. The conjecture was proved by Grigori Perelman in 2002\u20132003.[11][12]/nThurston and Dennis Sullivan generalized Lipman Bers' density conjecture from singly degenerate Kleinian surface groups to all finitely generated Kleinian groups in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[13][14] The conjecture states that every finitely generated Kleinian group is an algebraic limit of geometrically finite Kleinian groups, and was independently proven by Ohshika and Namazi\u2013Souto in 2011 and 2012 respectively.[13][14]/nIn his work on hyperbolic Dehn surgery, Thurston realized that orbifold structures naturally arose.  Such structures had been studied prior to Thurston, but his work, particularly the next theorem, would bring them to prominence.  In 1981, he announced the orbifold theorem, an extension of his geometrization theorem to the setting of 3-orbifolds.  Two teams of mathematicians around 2000 finally finished their efforts to write down a complete proof, based mostly on Thurston's lectures given in the early 1980s in Princeton. His original proof relied partly on Richard S. Hamilton's work on the Ricci flow./nIn 1976, Thurston and James Harris Simons shared the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry.[1]/nThurston received the Fields Medal in 1982 for \"revolutioniz[ing] [the] study of topology in 2 and 3 dimensions, showing interplay between analysis, topology, and geometry\" and \"contribut[ing] [the] idea that a very large class of closed 3-manifolds carry a hyperbolic structure.\"[15][16]/nIn 2005, Thurston won the first American Mathematical Society Book Prize, for Three-dimensional Geometry and Topology.\nThe prize \"recognizes an outstanding research book that makes a seminal contribution to the research literature\".[17] He was awarded the 2012 Leroy P.

It describes a number of neural network models which use supervised and unsupervised learning methods, and address problems such as pattern recognition and prediction.[8]/nThe primary intuition behind the ART model is that object identification and recognition generally occur as a result of the interaction of 'top-down' observer expectations with 'bottom-up' sensory information. The model postulates that 'top-down' expectations take the form of a memory template or prototype that is then compared with the actual features of an object as detected by the senses. This comparison gives rise to a measure of category belongingness. As long as this difference between sensation and expectation does not exceed a set threshold called the 'vigilance parameter', the sensed object will be considered a member of the expected class.

It deals with a global study of iteration of analytic functions. He was the first to introduce and study the set which is called now the Julia set.[citation needed] (The complement of this set is sometimes called the Fatou set). Some of the basic results of holomorphic dynamics were also independently obtained\nby Gaston Julia and Samuel Lattes in 1918.[7] Holomorphic dynamics has experienced a strong revival since 1982 because of the new discoveries of Dennis Sullivan, Adrien Douady, John Hubbard and others.

He is known as one of the country's foremost creators of mathematical puzzles.[1]/nDudeney was born in the village of Mayfield, East Sussex, England, one of six children of Gilbert and Lucy Dudeney. His grandfather, John Dudeney, was well known as a self-taught mathematician and shepherd; his initiative was much admired by his grandson. Dudeney learned to play chess at an early age, and continued to play frequently throughout his life. This led to a marked interest in mathematics and the composition of puzzles. Chess problems in particular fascinated him during his early years./nAlthough Dudeney spent his career in the Civil Service, he continued to devise various problems and puzzles. Dudeney's first puzzle contributions were submissions to newspapers and magazines, often under the pseudonym of \"Sphinx.\" Much of this earlier work was a collaboration with American puzzlist Sam Loyd; in 1890, they published a series of articles in the English penny weekly Tit-Bits./nDudeney later contributed puzzles under his real name to publications such as The Weekly Dispatch, The Queen, Blighty, and Cassell's Magazine. For twenty years, he had a successful column, \"Perplexities\", in The Strand Magazine, edited by the former editor of Tit-Bits, George Newnes. Dudeney continued to exchange puzzles with fellow recreational mathematician Sam Loyd for a while, but broke off the correspondence and accused Loyd of stealing his puzzles and publishing them under his own name./nSome of Dudeney's most famous innovations were his 1903 success at solving the Haberdasher's Puzzle (Cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that can be rearranged to make a square) and publishing the first known crossnumber puzzle, in 1926. He has also been credited with discovering new applications of digital roots. Dudeney was a leading exponent of verbal arithmetic puzzles; his were always alphametic, where the letters constitute meaningful phrases or associated words./nPreviously, it had been claimed (though not by Dudeney himself) that he was the inventor of verbal arithmetic. This was later refuted by the counter example of a verbal arithmetic puzzle published in the US in 1864.[2]/nOmission of detailed puzzle rules in the cited farm journal suggests they were already popular in America by 1864, when Dudeney was 7 years old. The popularity of these puzzles guarantees they'd be well known by then to Sam Loyd, an American puzzler and early Dudeney puzzle collaborator./nBoth Dudeney and Loyd were featured by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American\u2014Loyd in August 1957 and Dudeney in June 1958.[3]/nIn 1884 Dudeney married Alice Whiffin (1864\u20131945).[4] She later became a very well known writer who published many novels as well as a number of short stories in Harper's Magazine under the name \"Mrs. Henry Dudeney\". In her day, she was compared to Thomas Hardy for her portrayals of regional life. The income generated by her books was important to the Dudeney household, and her fame gained them entry to both literary and court circles./nAfter losing their first child at the age of four months in 1887, the Dudeneys had one daughter, Margery Janet (1890\u20131977).

He created the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu, a 1602 map of the world written in Chinese characters. In 2022, the Apostolic See declared its recognition of Ricci's heroic virtues, thereby bestowing upon him the honorific of Venerable.[1]/nRicci arrived at the Portuguese settlement of Macau in 1582 where he began his missionary work in China. He became the first European to enter the Forbidden City of Beijing in 1601 when invited by the Wanli Emperor, who sought his services in matters such as court astronomy and calendrical science. He converted several prominent Chinese officials to Catholicism. He also worked with several Chinese elites, such as Xu Guangqi, in translating Euclid's Elements into Chinese as well as the Confucian classics into Latin for the first time in history./nRicci was born on 6 October 1552 in Macerata, part of the Papal States and today a city in the Italian region of Marche. He studied the classics in his native hometown and studied law at Rome for two years. He entered the Society of Jesus in April 1571 at the Roman College. While there, in addition to philosophy and theology, he also studied mathematics, cosmology, and astronomy under the direction of Christopher Clavius. In 1577, he applied for a missionary expedition to the Far East. He sailed from Lisbon, Portugal, in March 1578 and arrived in Goa, a Portuguese colony, the following September. Ricci remained employed in teaching and the ministry there until the end of Lent 1582 when he was summoned to Macau to prepare to enter China. Ricci arrived in Macau in the early part of August.[2]/nIn August 1582, Ricci arrived at Macau, a Portuguese trading post on the South China Sea.[3]:\u200a79\u200a At the time, Christian missionary activity in China was almost completely limited to Macau, where some of the local Chinese people had converted to Christianity. Three years before, Michele Ruggieri was invited from Portuguese India expressly to study Chinese, by Alessandro Valignano, founder of St. Paul Jesuit College (Macau), and to prepare for the Jesuits' mission from Macau into Mainland China.[4]/nOnce in Macau, Ricci studied the Chinese language and customs. It was the beginning of a long project that made him one of the first Western scholars to master Chinese script and Classical Chinese. With Ruggieri, he travelled to Guangdong's major cities, Canton and Zhaoqing (then the residence of the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi), seeking to establish a permanent Jesuit mission outside Macau.[2]/nIn 1583, Ricci and Ruggieri settled in Zhaoqing, at the invitation of the governor of Zhaoqing, Wang Pan, who had heard of Ricci's skill as a mathematician and cartographer. Ricci stayed in Zhaoqing from 1583 to 1589, when he was expelled by a new viceroy. It was in Zhaoqing, in 1584, that Ricci composed the first European-style world map in Chinese, called \"Da Ying Quan Tu\" (Chinese: \u5927\u701b\u5168\u5716; lit. 'Complete Map of the Great World').[5] No prints of the 1584 map are known to exist, but, of the much improved and expanded Kunyu Wanguo Quantu of 1602,[6] six recopied, rice-paper versions survive.[7]/nIt is thought that, during their time in Zhaoqing, Ricci and Ruggieri compiled a Portuguese-Chinese dictionary, the first in any European language, for which they developed a system for transcribing Chinese words in the Latin alphabet. The manuscript was misplaced in the Jesuit Archives in Rome, rediscovered only in 1934, and published only in 2001.[8][9]/nThere is now a memorial plaque in Zhaoqing to commemorate Ricci's six-year stay there, as well as a \"Ricci Memorial Centre\"[10] in a building dating from the 1860s./nExpelled from Zhaoqing in 1588, Ricci obtained permission to relocate to Shaoguan (Shaozhou, in Ricci's account) in the north of the province, and reestablish his mission there.[11]/nFurther travels saw Ricci reach Nanjing (Ming's southern capital) and Nanchang in 1595. In August 1597, Alessandro Valignano (1539\u20131606), his superior, appointed him Major Superior of the mission in China, with the rank and powers of a Provincial, a charge that he fulfilled until his death.[12] He moved to Tongzhou (a port of Beijing) in 1598, and first reached the capital Beijing itself on 7 September 1598. However, because of a Chinese intervention against the Japanese invasion of Korea at the time, Ricci could not reach the Imperial Palace. After waiting for two months, he left Beijing; first for Nanjing and then Suzhou in Southern Zhili Province./nDuring the winter of 1598, Ricci, with the help of his Jesuit colleague Lazzaro Cattaneo, compiled another Chinese-Portuguese dictionary, in which tones in Chinese syllables were indicated in Roman text with diacritical marks. Unlike Ricci's and Ruggieri's earlier Portuguese-Chinese dictionary, this work has not been found.[8]/nIn 1601, Ricci was invited to become an adviser to the imperial court of the Wanli Emperor, the first Westerner to be invited into the Forbidden City. This honor was in recognition of Ricci's scientific abilities, chiefly his predictions of solar eclipses, which were significant events in the Chinese world.[13] He established the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Beijing, the oldest Catholic church in the city.[14] Ricci was given free access to the Forbidden City but never met the reclusive Wanli Emperor, who, however, granted him patronage, with a generous stipend and supported Ricci's completion of the Zhifang Waiji, China's first global atlas.[15]/nOnce established in Beijing, Ricci was able to meet important officials and leading members of the Beijing cultural scene and convert a number of them to Christianity,[16][17] the most prominent being leading agronomist Xu Guangqi.[18]/nRicci was also the first European to learn about the Kaifeng Jews,[19] being contacted by a member of that community who was visiting Beijing in 1605. Ricci never visited Kaifeng, Henan Province, but he sent a junior missionary there in 1608, the first of many such missions. In fact, the elderly Chief Rabbi of the Jews was ready to cede his power to Ricci, as long as he gave up eating pork, but Ricci never accepted the position.[19]/nRicci died on 11 May 1610, in Beijing, aged 57.[2] By the code of the Ming Dynasty, foreigners who died in China had to be buried in Macau. Diego de Pantoja made a special plea to the court, requesting a burial plot in Beijing, in the light of Ricci's contributions to China. The Wanli Emperor granted this request and designated a Buddhist temple for the purpose. In October 1610, Ricci's remains were transferred there.[20] The graves of Ferdinand Verbiest, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and other missionaries are also there, and it became known as the Zhalan Cemetery, which is today located within the campus of the Beijing Administrative College, in Xicheng District, Beijing.[21]/nRicci was succeeded as Provincial Superior of the China mission by Nicol\u00f2 Longobardo in 1610. Longobardo entrusted another Jesuit, Nicolas Trigault, with expanding and editing, as well as translating into Latin, those of Ricci's papers that were found in his office after his death. This work was first published in 1615 in Augsburg as De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas and soon was translated into a number of other European languages.[22]/nRicci could speak Chinese as well as read and write classical Chinese, the literary language of scholars and officials. He was known for his appreciation of Chinese culture in general but condemned the prostitution which was widespread in Beijing at the time.[23] He also called the Chinese \"barbarians\" in letters back home to his friends, and opposed what he considered to be anti-Black prejudice among the populace. He noted this, however, in the context of his function as a slave catcher for the Portuguese. (Ricci himself also owned African slaves.)[24]/nDuring his research, he discovered that in contrast to the cultures of South Asia, Chinese culture was strongly intertwined with Confucian values and therefore decided to use existing Chinese concepts to explain Christianity.[25] With his superior Valignano's formal approval, he aligned himself with the Confucian intellectually elite literati,[26] and even adopted their mode of dress. He did not explain the Catholic faith as entirely foreign or new; instead, he said that the Chinese culture and people always believed in God and that Christianity is the completion of their faith,[27]:\u200a323\u200a and explained the tenets of the Catholic faith through existing Chinese precepts and practices.[3]:\u200a79\u200a He borrowed an unusual Chinese term, Ti\u0101nzh\u01d4 (\u5929\u4e3b, \"Lord of Heaven\") to describe the God of Abraham, despite the term's origin in traditional Chinese worship of Heaven. (He also cited many synonyms from the Confucian Classics.)/nRicci took an accommodating approach on various Chinese practices, including rituals such as ancestor worship.[3]:\u200a81\u200aDominican and Franciscan missionaries considered this an unacceptable accommodation and later appealed to the Vatican on the issue.[27]:\u200a324\u200a This Chinese rites controversy continued for centuries. In 1721, fallout from the controversy led the Kangxi emperor to expel the Jesuits.[3]:\u200a81\u200a The Vatican's most recent statement on the Chinese rites controversy came in 1939. Some contemporary authors have praised Ricci as an exemplar of beneficial inculturation,[28][29] avoiding at the same time distorting the Gospel message or neglecting the indigenous cultural media.[30]/nLike developments in India, the identification of European culture with Christianity led almost to the end of Catholic missions in China, but Christianity continued to grow in Sichuan and some other locations.[27]:\u200a324/nXu Guangqi and Ricci become the first two to translate some of the Confucian classics into a Western language, Latin./nRicci also met a Korean emissary to China, teaching the basic tenets of Catholicism and donating several books.[31] Along with Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues's gifts to the ambassador Jeong Duwon in 1631, Ricci's gifts influenced the creation of Korea's Silhak movement.[32]/nThe cause of his beatification, originally begun in 1984, was reopened on 24 January 2010, at the cathedral of the Italian diocese of Macerata-Tolentino-Recanati-Cingoli-Treia.[33][34] Bishop Claudio Giuliodori, the apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Macerata, formally closed the diocesan phase of the sainthood process on 10 May 2013. The cause moved to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Vatican in 2014. Pope Francis issued a decree on 17 December 2022 that Fr.

Subsequently, the Marche Regional Government purchased the work, while the original model is now permanently exhibited at the main entrance of the Italian Consulate in Shanghai./nIn the run-up to the 400th anniversary of Ricci's death, the Vatican Museums hosted a major exhibit dedicated to his life. Additionally, Italian film director Gjon Kolndrekaj produced a 60-minute documentary about Ricci, released in 2009, titled Matteo Ricci: A Jesuit in the Dragon's Kingdom, filmed in Italy and China.[47][48]/nIn Taipei, the Taipei Ricci Institute and the National Central Library of Taiwan opened jointly the Matteo Ricci Pacific Studies Reading Room[49] and the Taipei-based\nonline magazine eRenlai, directed by Jesuit Beno\u00eet Vermander, dedicated its June 2010 issue to the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Ricci's death.[50]/nThe True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven (\u5929\u4e3b\u5be6\u7fa9) is a book written by Ricci, which argues that Confucianism and Christianity are not opposed and in fact are remarkably similar in key respects. It was written in the form of a dialogue, originally in Chinese. Ricci used the treatise in his missionary effort to convert Chinese literati, men who were educated in Confucianism and the Chinese classics. In the Chinese Rites controversy, some Roman-Catholic missionaries raised the question of whether Ricci and other Jesuits had gone too far and changed Christian beliefs to win converts.[51]/nPeter Phan argues that True Meaning was used by a Jesuit missionary to Vietnam, Alexandre de Rhodes, in writing a catechism for Vietnamese Christians.[52] In 1631, Girolamo Maiorica and Bernardino Reggio, both Jesuit missionaries to Vietnam, started a short-lived press in Th\u0103ng Long (present-day Hanoi) to print copies of True Meaning and other texts.[53] The book was also influential on later Protestant missionaries to China, James Legge and Timothy Richard, and through them John Nevius, John Ross, and William Edward Soothill, all influential in establishing Protestantism in China and Korea./nRicci translated various European scientific works into Chinese.[3]:\u200a79\u200a Other works by Ricci include:", "38017451": "Leone Minna Burton (n\u00e9e Gold; 14 September 1936 \u2013 1 December 2007) was a professor of education in mathematics and science, working in London teacher education colleges in the 1970s, the Open University in the 1980s and, from 1992, the University of Birmingham.   At the South Bank Polytechnic (now London South Bank University);she helped establish the first MSc in Mathematics Education in the UK. After retiring in 2001 she became Honorary Professor at King's College London, and Visiting Fellow in the Cambridge University Faculty of Education.[1] She was noted for her influence as a researcher and doctoral supervisor, setting up national and international research networks in the developing area of mathematics education.[2]/nBurton was born in Australia and moved to England in her early twenties. She attended the University of London studying mathematics.[3]  She began teaching at the secondary level but disliked the educational structure and methods of the day and moved to teaching at the primary level to have a greater opportunity to change teaching structure.  She received a postgraduate certificate in education in 1966 and an academic diploma in education in 1968, both from the University of London.  In 1967 she obtained a post as a mathematical education specialist at Battersea College of Education, which was dedicated to teacher preparation.  She received her PhD from the Institute of Education in 1980 with a thesis entitled \"The impact of education on political development\".[4]/nLeone Burton's contribution to mathematics education focused on researching the practices of working mathematicians and arguing their relevance for school teaching and learning.  This research is included in what is now termed the field of ethnomathematics which examines how mathematics is related to the culture in which it is developed. At the Open University, Burton collaborated in creating innovative courses in teacher education,  Developing Mathematical Thinking, that emphasized the role of problem solving in mathematics and argued that teachers should be aware of mathematical reasoning as well as mathematical content.[5]   A subsequent publication,  Thinking Mathematically, written in 1982 with Mason and Stacey, brought these ideas to an international teacher audience focusing on teachers' own knowledge of using and applying mathematics.[6]/nFrom 1984 to 1988 Burton was international convenor for the International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education[7] and visiting professor at institutions in Asia. She played a major role in shifting teachers\u2019 perceptions in relation to girls and mathematics in the UK and other places around the world.[8] Burton founded the monograph series International Perspective on Mathematics Education with the Greenwood Publishing group in 2001 which published three monographs between 2002 and 2006. This monograph series was subsequently renamed International Perspectives on Mathematics Education: Cognition, Equity and Society in honor of her pioneering work on equity and gender issues in mathematics education, edited by Bharath Sriraman, and published by Information Age Publishing./nHer final book, Mathematicians as Enquirers,[9] used interviews to characterize the ways professional mathematicians learn, including enquiry, visualization and collaboration. This research showed that the ways mathematicians learn are consistent with principles recognized in mathematics education research as suitable for school learning.[10]/nShe married John W.

In 1881 he matriculated at the Normal School of Sciences of Ghent University. In 1884 he graduated there and passed the agr\u00e9gation for teaching upper secondary classes. He then became a teacher in Ypres and in the following year he taught at the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e royal de Bruxelles but after a short time he was appointed a docent for teaching mathematical courses at the School of Civil Engineering of Ghent University.[1]\nIn 1886 he received his Ph.D. at Ghent University.[2] He became in 1887 a docent, in 1890 a professor extraordinarius, and in 1894 a professor ordinarius at the Faculty of Sciences of Ghent University. In 1932 he retired there as a professor emeritus.[1]/nOn 15 December 1919 he was elected to the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium.[3] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924 in Toronto.", "793017": "Ernest William Brown FRS (29 November 1866 \u2013 22 July 1938) was an English mathematician and astronomer, who spent the majority of his career working in the United States and became a naturalised American citizen in 1923.[1][2]/nHis life's work was the study of the Moon's motion (lunar theory) and the compilation of extremely accurate lunar tables.  He also studied the motion of the planets and calculated the orbits of Trojan asteroids./nBrown was born in Hull, England, the second of four children of William and Emma Brown (n\u00e9e Martin). His father was originally a farmer and later became a timber merchant. His mother and younger brother died of scarlet fever in 1870, when Brown was not quite 4 years old. He and his two sisters were then looked after by a maiden aunt, until his father remarried five years later.[1][3]/nBrown was educated at Totteridge Park School, Hertfordshire (now part of Dorset House School) and Hull and East Riding College. After leaving school, he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours as sixth Wrangler in mathematics in 1887.[4][5] He continued with post-graduate studies at Cambridge and worked under the direction of George Howard Darwin. In the summer of 1888, Darwin suggested that he study the papers of George William Hill on the lunar theory. As it turned out, this idea for a line of research was to have a major impact on the remainder of Brown's life./nBrown was made a fellow of Christ's College in 1889 and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in the same year. He received his master's degree in 1891 and then left Cambridge to take up a place as a mathematics instructor at Haverford College, Pennsylvania. There, he rose rapidly to the position of Professor of Mathematics in 1893. However, he continued most years to return to Cambridge during the summer, often staying with his old tutor, Darwin.[6]/nAt Haverford, Brown continued with his studies of the lunar theory, and made a thorough review of the work of earlier researchers, such as Hill, de Pont\u00e9coulant, Delaunay and Hansen. His mastery of the field was shown by the publication of his first great work, An Introductory Treatise on the Lunar Theory,[7] in 1896, when Brown was still less than 30 years of age. The following year, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society.[6]/nAs Brown's work progressed, he gradually evolved a plan to create a completely new lunar theory. This was eventually published as a series of papers in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society between 1897 and 1908. In 1907, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Yale University, with which he secured an agreement for funding the massive task of calculating detailed tables of the Moon's motion, based on his lunar theory. After a period of 12 years and a cost of over $34,000, Brown's magnum opus, Tables of the Motion of the Moon, was published in 1919./nBrown's objective had been to produce an accurate ephemeris of the Moon, based purely on gravitational theory. For the 'main problem' of the Earth-Moon-Sun system, he calculated terms in longitude and latitude down to an uncertainty of 0.001 arcseconds. He also included perturbations due to the other planets (principally Jupiter and Venus) and also accounted for the more difficult problem of the non-spherical nature of the Earth and Moon./nObservations showed that Brown's tables were indeed superior to those of Hansen, which had been in use since 1857, but there was still a large unexplained fluctuation in the Moon's mean longitude of the order of 10 arcseconds. A 'great empirical term', of magnitude 10.71 arcseconds and period 257 years, was introduced to eliminate this as far as possible. Given the precision of Brown's calculations, it must have come as a great disappointment to have to introduce this arbitrary adjustment./nIt had been discovered by Edmond Halley over two centuries previously that the Moon's motion appeared to be gradually speeding up. This 'secular acceleration' could not be explained by gravitational theory alone, and it had been suggested by Simon Newcomb that it was in fact due to a gradual deceleration of the Earth's rate of rotation, due to friction generated by the tides. The implication of this was that it was not the Moon that was speeding up \u2013 it was time (as measured in terms of Earth's increasingly long day) that appeared to be slowing down./nBrown devoted much study to this problem and proposed it should be attacked observationally, using lunar occultations to map the Moon's path more precisely. He also reasoned that, if the discrepancies were caused by variations in the Earth's rotation, it implied that observations of other objects would be similarly affected. This was partially verified by observations of transits of Mercury, but Brown was initially not convinced. However, he eventually concluded that Newcomb was right, and not only was the Earth's rate of rotation slowing, but also there were random, unpredictable fluctuations, and he published these findings in a paper in 1926.[4][6][8] Later work has shown this to be true, and astronomers now make a distinction between Universal Time, which is based on the Earth's rotation, and Terrestrial Time (formerly Ephemeris time), which is a uniform measure of the passage of time (see also \u0394T)./nBrown was an active member of the American Mathematical Society and served as its president from 1915 to 1916.[9]/nHe retained his professorship at Yale until he retired in 1932. As well as continuing his work on the Moon, he also worked on the motion of the planets around the Sun. In 1933, he published the book, Planetary Theory, co-authored with Clarence Shook, which contained a detailed exposition of resonance in planetary orbits and examined the special case of the Trojan asteroids. In 1937, he was awarded the Watson Medal by the US National Academy of Sciences./nOne of Brown's post-graduate pupils was Wallace John Eckert, who became an instructor at Columbia University while finishing his doctorate. Eckert would improve the pace of astronomical calculations by automating them with digital computers.[10]/nBrown never married, and for most of his adult life lived with his unmarried younger sister, Mildred, who kept house for him. She made it her job to shield him from \"cares and disturbances\" and succeeded in \"utterly spoiling him.\"[1] In his youth, he was a keen rower and mountaineer. He was a capable pianist and continued to play until a few years before his death. He remained fond of music and was for a time the head of the New Haven Oratorio Society. Brown also played chess to a high standard and loved detective stories./nHe enjoyed travelling and frequently crossed the Atlantic between the United States and Great Britain. With several professional colleagues, he was also an enthusiastic participant in the British Association's extended visit to South Africa and other parts of southern and eastern Africa between July and October 1905.[11][12]/nHis daily routine was unusual, and was described as follows:[1]/nHe was in the habit of going to bed early and as a consequence woke up between three and five o'clock in the morning. After having fortified himself with strong coffee from a thermos bottle he set to work without leaving his bed, smoking numerous cigarettes. His serious scientific work was thus done before he got up for breakfast at nine o'clock./nA heavy smoker, Brown suffered from bronchial trouble for much of his life. He was afflicted by ill-health during most of the six years of his retirement, and died in New Haven, Connecticut in 1938. His sister, Mildred, had died a few years before him and his only surviving close family was his widowed older sister, Ella Yorke, who had emigrated with her husband to New Zealand in the 1890s.[1]/nBrown's Tables were adopted by nearly all of the national ephemerides in 1923 for their calculations of the Moon's position, and continued to be used with some modification until 1983.  With the advent of digital computers, Brown's original trigonometrical expressions, given in the introduction to his 1919 tables (and from which the tables had been compiled), began to be used for direct computation instead of the tables themselves.  This also gained some improvement in precision, since the tables had embodied some minor approximations, in a trade-off between accuracy and the amount of labour needed for computations in those days of manual calculation.[13]/nBy the middle of the 20th century, the difference between Universal and Ephemeris Time had been recognised and evaluated, and the troublesome empirical terms were removed.[13] Further adjustments to Brown's theory were then made, arising from improved observational values of the fundamental astronomical constants used in the theory, and from re-working Brown's original analytical expansions to gain more precise versions of the coefficients used in the theory.[14]/nEventually, in 1984, Brown's work was replaced by results gained from more modern observational data (including data from lunar laser ranging) and altogether new computational methods for calculating the Moon's ephemeris.[15]", "64035259": "Whitley Stokes (1763\u20131845) was an eminent Irish physician and polymath. A one-time United Irishman, in 1798 he was sanctioned by Trinity College Dublin for his alleged republicanism. In 1821, he published a rebuttal of Robert Malthus's thesis that, as spurs to population growth, in Ireland attempts to improve the general welfare are self-defeating. The country's problem, Stokes argued, was not her \"numbers\" but her indifferent government./nStokes was born in Waterford, son of Gabriel Stokes (1732\u20131806), DD, chancellor of the cathedral, and master of Waterford endowed school, where the young Stokes had his primary education.[1] At age 16 he was admitted to Trinity College Dublin (TCD) (Scholar 1781, BA 1783, MA 1789, MB & MD 1793) and completing studies medicine at the University of Edinburgh.[2]/nHis first venture as a medical practitioner was in public health. He studied not only his patients' ailments but also their environments, noting that in the slums of Dublin certain families rented a small room for a few guineas a year, sub-letting to others who paid them sixpence-halfpenny per week to lay down a bed of straw in a corner.[1]/nHaving been admitted as a licentiate of the College of Physicians in 1795 without examination, in 1798 he was appointed Regius Professor of Medicine at TCD (a position he held until 1811), and was elected a Fellow of the College in 1800. At the same time \"with the assurance of a polymath\", he was Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics from 1807 and offered a course in natural history.  He left TCD to hold the chair of medicine at Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) 1819-1828.  Returning to TCD he became Regius Professor of Physic (1830-1840). In 1814 he funded an English-Irish dictionary.[1]/nHis principal medical works of Whitley Stokes are \"On an eruptive disease of children\", published in the Dublin Medical and Physical Essays (1808), and Observations on Contagion (1818). From 1818 to 1826 he was on the staff of the Meath Hospital where his services were available to the sick poor, and he worked through two typhus epidemics.[1]/nIn November 1791, Stokes was elected to the Society of the United Irishmen of Dublin, one of eighteen persons nominated in their absence. With Thomas Russell and Wolfe Tone, he was critical of William Drennan's membership Test. Its call for \"a brotherhood of affection [...] and a union of power among Irishmen of every religious persuasion\" to secure \u201can impartial and adequate representation of the Irish nation in parliament\",[3] was too rhetorical.[4]/nIn July 1792 he accompanied Tone on a visit to Belfast where Tone introduced him to his fellow physician-polymath Dr James MacDonnell.[1]/nA month in advance of the first of the United Irish risings in May 1798, at TCD Stokes was brought before the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Lord Clare. He admitted to having collected and given evidence to the liberal Lord Moira on the atrocities and tortures visited upon country people by Crown forces as they sought to break up and disarm the United Irish organisation; but denied himself having had any part in the movement as it prepared for insurrection.[5] Clare found him \"a most improper person to be entrusted in any degree with the government or direction of the college\". He was suspended as a tutor, and barred from election to senior fellowship, for three years.[6]/nStokes allowed his membership of the United Irishmen to lapse, but when in January 1793 the Society appointed a committee to draw up a scheme of parliamentary reform, he had submitted a plan. It broadened the franchise, but fell short of the principle of universal male suffrage that the Society ultimately approved.[7]/nLike his counterpart in Belfast, James MacDonnell, Stokes befriended, and maintained a correspondence, with Thomas Russell without embracing the United Irishman\u2018s radical democratic and insurrectionary politics. Stokes treated Russell when he became seriously ill during his imprisonment in Newgate in 1797.[1]/nIn an independent Ireland, Wolfe Tone had imagined Stokes as \"the head of a system of national education\".[5]/nAcknowledging the assistance of, among others, James MacDonnell and John Templeton of Belfast, in 1821 Stokes published Observations on the population and resources of Ireland. Stokes was returning to the theme of an earlier work, Projects for re-establishing the internal peace and tranquillity of Ireland (1799) in which he had argued that if in Ireland the \"value\" [i.e. the productivity] of labour could be increased, the country might sustain many times its present population.[8] In the new work, he questioned the \"trap\" or \"spectre\" of population growth proposed by  Robert Malthus: the argument that as common people use \"abundance\" to enlarge families rather than to increase their comforts, \"all attempts ... to ameliorate the condition of the poor are fruitless and mistaken\".[9][10]/nAlready, as a medical man, he had deplored what he depicted as the Malthusian view of hospitals, work houses and quarantines as vain attempts to \"delay the thinning of the people, which is necessary to the happiness of mankind\". He urged the government to ignore the new fixation with numbers and make health a priority.[11]/nInsisting upon the advantages mankind derives from \"improved industry, improved conveyance, improvements in morals, government and religion\", in Observations Stokes faulted Malthus's calculations. He denied that there was a  \"law of nature\" that procreation must outrun the means of subsistence.[12] Ireland was not, as English opinion so widely held, overpopulated thanks to the prolific potato. Rather than fret about our numbers\", Stokes argued for the division of large holdings, the encouragement and assistance of manufacture, and investment in inland navigation and roads. Once the Irish begin to feel \"whole clothes\" on their backs, \"effort for profit will be made.\"[13]/nIn An Inquiry Concerning the Population of Nations containing a Refutation of Mr. Malthus's Essay on Population (1818), George Ensor had developed a similar broadside against Malthusian political economy, arguing that poverty was sustained not by a reckless propensity to propagate, but rather by the state's indulgence of the heedless concentration of private wealth.[14] It is not clear whether Stokes was familiar with the work./nIn 1796 Stokes married Mary Ann Picknall.  They had five sons and five daughters. He was the father the physician William Stokes (1804\u201378) who succeeded him as Regius Professor of Physic at TCD, and through William the grandfather of Whitley Stokes \nthe Celtic Scholar (1830\u20131909)[15] and the Irish antiquarian Margaret Stokes (1832\u20131900).[5]/nWhitley Stokes died 13 April 1845 at 16 Harcourt St., Dublin, aged 82.[5]", "27662786": "Gaston Bodart  (1867\u20131940) was a military historian, statistician, and government official.

As an assistant commissioner of the Imperial and Royal Commission, he also helped to organize Austria's presentations at various world fairs and exhibitions./nTrained as a lawyer, Bodart entered government service. By 1894, he was an assistant commissioner in the Imperial and Royal Central Commission.  He published, in that year, Erziehung (en: Upbringing), with Ottilie Bondy, Henry Kautsch, and Goerg Adam Scheid.[1]/nIn his capacity at the Imperial Central Commission, Bodart helped to expand the collection of the Vienna Bibliotheque.[2]  Bodart also traveled extensively.  He visited the United States as part of the organizing committee for the Austrian exhibit at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.[3] Two years later, he was part of an Austrian delegation to examine the United States Commission on Fisheries exhibits.[4] In 1907, he traveled from Genoa to New York City, and from there via train to Milwaukee and Chicago, to visit the World's Pure Food Exposition (1907).[5]/nIn 1908, Bodart published his Milit\u00e4r-historisches Kriegs-Lexikon (1618\u20131905), in which he examined several thousand battles of the early modern era. Drawing on this, Bodart's most famous work, Losses of life in modern wars, Austria-Hungary; France, (1916), identified the casualties of war in all of Austria and Austria-Hungary's wars the Thirty Years War, in the early 17th century, through the Russo-Japanese War, in the early 20th century. In this volume he compiled participants and casualties from more than 1500 battles, and he posited that wartime casualties led to stagnation and loss of creative force. His interest in the statistical implications of casualties in wartime linked with those of Vernon Lyman Kellogg; the volume was published in English in the series Military Selection and Race Deterioration, funded by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Division of Economics and History.[6]/nIn his assessment of Austria's wars with France, 1805\u20131815, which he prepared in 1913, Bodart wrote of Napoleon Bonaparte, \"No other man has sacrificed so many human victims to the god of war as did Napoleon I; no other man has sowed death broadcast on such a scale; no other commander ever cared less for his soldiers than he.\"[7] His manuscript of Die Menschen-Verluste Osterreich-Ungarns im Weltkriege 1914\u20131918[8] remained unpublished.[9]/nBodart was born in 1867 in Vienna to a family of Belgian descent.[5]  Bodart married Hedwig Neuhold, and they lived in Hart bei Gloggnitz.

His doctoral thesis advisor was Robert E. Hopkins. Frieden is now an emeritus professor of optical sciences at the University of Arizona./nFrieden is best known for his extensive work on Fisher information as a grounding principle for deriving and elaborating physical theory. (Examples are the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation of quantum mechanics and the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution of statistical mechanics.) Such theories take the form of differential equations or probability distribution functions./nCentral to Frieden's derivations is the mathematical variational principle of extreme physical information (EPI). This principle builds on the well-known idea that the observation of a \"source\" phenomenon is never completely accurate. That is, information is inevitably lost in transit from source to observation. Furthermore, the random errors that creep in are presumed to define the distribution function of the source phenomenon. As Frieden puts it, \"the physics lies in the fluctuations.\" Finally, the information loss may be shown to be an extreme value. Thus if the observed level of Fisher information in the data has value I, and the level of Fisher information that existed at the source has value J, the EPI principle states that I \u2212 J = extremum. In most situations, the extremum is a minimum, meaning that there is a tendency for any observation to faithfully match up with its source./nFrieden has used Fisher information and the EPI principle to derive most existing fundamental laws of physics, and some new and existing laws of biology, cancer growth, chemistry, and economics. Frieden argues that Fisher information, especially its loss I \u2212 J during observation, and EPI make up a general method for deriving scientific laws./nThere is a view that puts into doubt the physical and mathematical correctness of Frieden's ideas, this coming from Raymond F. Streater's Lost Causes in Theoretical Physics: Physics from Fisher Information, and Cosma Shalizi's review of Physics from Fisher Information.

His name is most often associated with the Poynting\u2013Robertson effect, the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum, which he also described in terms of general relativity./nDuring World War II, Robertson served with the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He served as technical consultant to the Secretary of War, the OSRD Liaison Officer in London, and the Chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force./nAfter the war Robertson was director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, chairman of the Robertson Panel on UFOs in 1953 and scientific advisor to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in 1954 and 1955.

His father died when he was 15 years old, but although money was short, all five siblings attended university. He entered the University of Washington in Seattle in 1918, initially with the intention of studying engineering, but he later switched to mathematics.[1] He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1922 and a Master of Science in mathematics and physics in 1923.[2]/nIn 1923 Robertson married Angela Turinsky, a philosophy and psychology student at the University of Washington.[2] They had two children: George Duncan, who became a surgeon, and Marietta, who later married California Institute of Technology (Caltech) historian Peter W. Fay. At the University of Washington he also met Eric Temple Bell, who encouraged him to pursue mathematics at Caltech.[2] Robertson completed his PhD dissertation in mathematics and physics there in 1925 under the supervision of Harry Bateman, writing \"On Dynamical Space-Times Which Contain a Conformal Euclidean 3-Space\".[3][4]/nUpon receipt of his doctorate, Robertson received a National Research Council Fellowship to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, where he met David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Martin Schwarzschild, John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner.[5] He found Max Born unsympathetic to his concept of an expanding universe, which Born considered \"rubbish\".[6] He also spent six months at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he was a post-doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld.[7]/nRobertson returned to the United States in 1927, and became an assistant professor of mathematics at Caltech. In 1928,[8] he accepted a position as an assistant professor of mathematical physics at Princeton University, where he became an associate professor in 1931, and a professor in 1938.[9] He spent 1936 on sabbatical at Caltech.[10] His interest in general relativity and differential geometry led to a series of papers in the 1920s that developed the subject.[11][12][13]/nRobertson wrote three important papers on the mathematics of quantum mechanics.[11] In the first, written in German, he looked at the coordinate system required for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be solvable.[14] The second examined the relationship between the commutative property and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.[15] The third extended the second to the case of m observables.[16] In 1931 he published a translation of Weyl's The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics.[11]/nIt was Robertson's anonymous 1936 critical peer review of a paper submitted by Albert Einstein to Physical Review which caused Einstein to withdraw the paper from consideration.[17][18]/nYet perhaps Robertson's most notable achievements were in applying relativity to cosmology.[19] He independently developed the concept of an expanding universe,[20] which would imply distant galaxies as seen from Earth would be redshifted \u2013 a phenomenon previously confirmed by Vesto Slipher[21][22]\n. Robertson went on to apply the theory of continuous groups in Riemann spaces to find all the solutions that describe the cosmological spaces.   [23] This was extended by Arthur Geoffrey Walker in 1936, and is today widely known in the United States as the Robertson\u2013Walker metric.[19]/nOne of Robertson's landmark papers, a brief note in The Annals of Mathematics, entitled a \"Note on the preceding paper: The two body problem in general relativity\", solved that problem within a degree of approximation not improved on for several decades.  Earlier work, such as the Schwarzschild metric, were for a central body that did not move, while Robertson's solution considered two bodies orbiting each other. Nevertheless, his solution failed to include gravitational radiation, so the bodies orbit forever, rather than approaching each other.[24]/nYet Robertson's name is most often associated with the Poynting\u2013Robertson effect,[19] the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain's motion. John Henry Poynting described it in 1903 based on the \"luminiferous aether\" theory, which was superseded by Einstein's theories of relativity. In 1937, Robertson described the effect in terms of general relativity.[25]/nRobertson developed the theory of invariants of tensors to derive the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u2013Howarth equation in 1940, which was later used by George Batchelor and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in the theory of axisymmetric turbulence to derive Batchelor\u2013Chandrasekhar equation.[26]/nAside from his work in physics, Robertson played a central role in American scientific intelligence during and after World War II. He was approached by Richard Tolman shortly after World War II began in 1939, and began working for the Committee for Passive Protection Against Bombing. This was absorbed with other groups into Division 2 of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), with Robertson engaged in the study of terminal ballistics.[27]/nIn 1943, Robertson became the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) chief scientific liaison officer in London.[27] He became close friends with Reginald Victor Jones,[28] and Solly Zuckerman praised the work Robertson and Jones did on scrambling radar beams and beacons.[29] In 1944 Robertson also became a technical consultant to the Secretary of War, and the chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force.[27] His fluency in German helped him to interrogate German scientists, including rocket scientists involved in the V-2 rocket program.[30] He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his contributions to the war effort.[10]/nAfter the war, Robertson accepted a professorship at Caltech in 1947. He would remain there for the rest of his career, except for long  periods of government service.[31][27] He was a Central Intelligence Agency classified employee and director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense,[32] the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, and scientific advisor in 1954 and 1955 to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Alfred M.

Also during this period of time, all along with another friend, Lax fatally wounded another student by hitting his head.[3] He later moved to Paris, and there he taught in 1507\u20131508 at the Coll\u00e8ge de Calvi and then at the Coll\u00e8ge de Montaigu, where he was a student of John Mair (or Major) and simultaneously was a teacher himself. In Paris he was known as the \"Prince of Sophists,\" and his works and lessons were very praised. He taught in Paris until 1516, and then returned to Spain. Some researchers think there was an attempt by some of king Charles V's servants to appoint him University of Saragossa's High Master, just as they had tried to appoint Erasmus as High Chancellor of the same university during the same months.[4] In the end this was not possible, and he was appointed as a teacher in the University of Huesca, that same year. There he taught until 1520, when he became University of Saragosa's High Master (similar to a dean), vice-chancellor and rector, and also was simultaneously one of the four Masters of Arts, a position  very similar to Arts faculty's professor in other universities. There he had his brilliant nephew Michael Servetus as a student in the same university, who also became in 1525 one of the four Masters of Arts. During this period of time Lax, who had Erasmian friends, permitted that Erasmus's works be read and taught in the university. In 1527 apparently Lax attacked his nephew and colleague Michael Servetus in a violent brawl of which no other details are known, but that got Servetus expelled. The most probable causes of this clash is  that Servetus would have started talking of his \"heretic\" theological ideas, or that Lax had silenced Servetus's probable collaboration in his work Quaestiones phyisicales,  which just 11 days before had  started to get in print.[5] Lax remained University of Saragossa's High master, teaching Arts, until his death at Saragossa in 1560, blind and with gout in his hands.[6]", "105043": "Leopold Vietoris (/vi\u02d0\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0r\u026as/; German: [vi\u02d0\u02c8to\u02d0\u0280\u026as]; 4 June 1891 \u2013 9 April 2002) was an Austrian mathematician, World War I veteran and supercentenarian.

He is known for his contributions to infinitesimal calculus and educating Leonhard Euler in the pupil's youth./nJohann was born in Basel, the son of Nicolaus Bernoulli, an apothecary, and his wife, Margarethe Schongauer, and began studying medicine at University of Basel.  His father desired that he study business so that he might take over the family spice trade, but Johann Bernoulli did not like business and convinced his father to allow him to study medicine instead. Johann Bernoulli began studying mathematics on the side with his older brother Jacob Bernoulli.[5] Throughout Johann Bernoulli's education at Basel University the Bernoulli brothers worked together spending much of their time studying the newly discovered infinitesimal calculus. They were among the first mathematicians to not only study and understand calculus but to apply it to various problems.[6] In 1690,[7] he completed a degree dissertation in medicine,[8] reviewed by Leibniz,[7] whose title was De Motu musculorum et de effervescent et fermentation.[9]/nAfter graduating from Basel University, Johann Bernoulli moved to teach differential equations. Later, in 1694, he married Dorothea Falkner, the daughter of an alderman of Basel, and soon after accepted a position as the professor of mathematics at the University of Groningen. At the request of his father-in-law, Bernoulli began the voyage back to his home town of Basel in 1705. Just after setting out on the journey he learned of his brother's death to tuberculosis. Bernoulli had planned on becoming the professor of Greek at Basel University upon returning but instead was able to take over as professor of mathematics, his older brother's former position. As a student of Leibniz's calculus, Bernoulli sided with him in 1713 in the Leibniz\u2013Newton debate over who deserved credit for the discovery of calculus. Bernoulli defended Leibniz by showing that he had solved certain problems with his methods that Newton had failed to solve. Bernoulli also promoted Descartes' vortex theory over Newton's theory of gravitation. This ultimately delayed acceptance of Newton's theory in continental Europe.[10]/nIn 1724, Johann Bernoulli entered a competition sponsored by the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, which posed the question:/nIn defending a view previously espoused by Leibniz, he found himself postulating an infinite external force required to make the body elastic by overcoming the infinite internal force making the body hard. In consequence, he was disqualified for the prize, which was won by Maclaurin. However, Bernoulli's paper was subsequently accepted in 1726 when the Acad\u00e9mie considered papers regarding elastic bodies, for which the prize was awarded to Pierre Mazi\u00e8re. Bernoulli received an honourable mention in both competitions./nAlthough Johann and his brother Jacob Bernoulli worked together before Johann graduated from Basel University, shortly after this, the two developed a jealous and competitive relationship.  Johann was jealous of Jacob's position and the two often attempted to outdo each other.  After Jacob's death, Johann's jealousy shifted toward his own talented son, Daniel. In 1738 the father\u2013son duo nearly simultaneously published separate works on hydrodynamics.  Johann attempted to take precedence over his son by purposely and falsely predating his work two years prior to his son's.[11][12]/nThe Bernoulli brothers often worked on the same problems, but not without friction. Their most bitter dispute concerned the brachistochrone curve problem, or the equation for the path followed by a particle from one point to another in the shortest amount of time, if the particle is acted upon by gravity alone. Johann presented the problem in 1696, offering a reward for its solution. Entering the challenge, Johann proposed the cycloid, the path of a point on a moving wheel, also pointing out the relation this curve bears to the path taken by a ray of light passing through layers of varied density. Jacob proposed the same solution, but Johann's derivation of the solution was incorrect, and he presented his brother Jacob's derivation as his own.[13]/nBernoulli was hired by Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital for tutoring in mathematics. Bernoulli and l'H\u00f4pital signed a contract which gave l'H\u00f4pital the right to use Bernoulli's discoveries as he pleased. L'H\u00f4pital authored the first textbook on infinitesimal calculus, Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes in 1696, which mainly consisted of the work of Bernoulli, including what is now known as l'H\u00f4pital's rule.[14][15][16] Subsequently, in letters to Leibniz, Varignon and others, Bernoulli complained that he had not received enough credit for his contributions, in spite of the preface of his book:/nI recognize I owe much to the insights of the Messrs. Bernoulli, especially to those of the younger (John), currently a professor in Groningen. I did unceremoniously use their discoveries, as well as those of Mr. Leibniz. For this reason I consent that they claim as much credit as they please, and will content myself with what they will agree to leave me.", "62495321": "Chang-Shou Lin (Chinese: \u6797\u9577\u58fd; born 17 April 1951) is a Taiwanese mathematician./nLin completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at National Taiwan University.[1] He then completed doctoral study at New York University in the United States in 1983,[1] and was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study between 1984 and 1985.[2] He taught at NTU from 1987 to 1990, when he joined the faculty of National Chung Cheng University.[1][3] Lin was director of the National Center for Theoretical Sciences between 1993 and 2003.[1] In 2006, Lin returned to NTU as director of the  Institute for Mathematical Sciences.[1]/nIn his research, Lin has explored mean field theory and Eisenstein series.[4][5] Lin was elected a member of Academia Sinica in 1998,  received the Morningside Medal that same year, and was awarded Taiwan's Presidential Science Prize\u00a0[zh] in 2001.[1] He is an editor of the Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics, published by Academia Sinica.[6] In 2014, Lin was invited to speak at the International Congress of Mathematicians conference in Seoul, South Korea./nLin was critical of the Democratic Progressive Party response to the Sunflower Student Movement,[7] and has signed petitions backing required mathematics education for Taiwanese senior high school students,[8] and against the nuclear energy question posed by the 2018 Taiwanese referendum.[9]/nThis article about a Taiwanese scientist is a stub.

The relationship does not last and Jane later becomes engaged to Des, while Mike dates Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend). Jones later stated that Mike was the love of Jane's life. Mike pursues a teaching career and returns to his high school for a student placement, where he almost gets himself fired for kissing a student./nMike temporarily leaves Erinsborough to tour in a band in late 1988. The storyline was a cover for Pearce, who took a break to shoot a feature film. On his return, Mike reveals that he was in a motorbike accident with Jenny Owens (Danielle Carter). Mike feels immense guilt that she has been paralyzed after he tried to show her a trick. Pearce decided not to renew his contract upon its expiration in October 1989, as he wanted to pursue more challenging roles. Mike's exit storyline saw him leave Erinsborough to be with his sick mother on 6 December 1989. Pearce reprised the role for the show's finale on 28 July 2022, as Mike returns to Erinsborough with his daughter, and returned again on 18 September 2023./nGuy Pearce was in his final year at Geelong College and appearing in amateur theatre when he \"bombarded\" the Grundy Organisation with tapes of his performances.[1][2] He then attended a general audition at Grundys,[2] where he auditioned for Neighbours casting director Jan Russ.[3] He was cast as teenager Mike Young, who became one of several characters introduced in 1986 to give the show \"a more youthful look\".[4] Two days after finishing his HSC exams, Pearce relocated from Geelong to Melbourne. He started work at Neighbours on 2 December 1985.[5][6] Mike was his first professional acting role. Pearce was critical of his early performances, saying \"I was really awful because I didn't know what I was doing.\"[5] He admitted that for the first two and a half years, he \"was running behind the eight-ball\" as he filmed two and a half hours worth of episodes a week, but he eventually settled into his acting and the character began to come naturally to him.[5] Pearce later stated that being cast as Mike was \"a fantastic break for an 18-year-old\". He said \"I'd been doing amateur theatre in Geelong and suddenly I was in a national television show.\"[7] Pearce made his debut as Mike on 20 January 1986, which was the first episode broadcast on Network Ten following the show's move from Seven Network.[8]/nMike is introduced as a school friend of Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan).[9] His official character's biography states that he is \"a thoroughly nice young man. Scott Robinson recommends him for the job at the coffee shop which he does outside school hours. He is ambitious and hardworking, and often studies in the coffee shop.\"[1] He is also characterised as \"a nice well adjusted young guy with a bright future.\"[10] Unbeknown to his friends, Mike and his mother Barbara (Rona McLeod; Diana Greentree) are physically abused by his father David Young (Stewart Faichney). This motivates Mike to take the job at the coffee shop, as he wants to earn enough money to get himself and his mother away from David.[1] His boss Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) finds out about his situation and tries to help persuade Barbara to leave her husband, so she and Mike can start afresh, but Barbara is so afraid of David that she cannot make the break. Daphne later suggests that Mike comes to live with her and her partner Des Clarke (Paul Keane), who become his guardians.[10] The storyline led to Pearce receiving hundreds of letters from children, who confided in him, as Mike, about their own experiences with abusive parents.[11] He told Lou Anson of Aberdeen Press and Journal that some of them asked him to become their pen-pal, but he was only able to write back advising them to seek help. He also told Anson that until he joined Neighbours, he had no idea \"such terrible things happened.\"[11]/nNeil Wallis and Dave Hogan of The Neighbours Factfile noted that the child abuse \"still haunts\" Mike, who is later abandoned by his mother when she moves overseas following the death of his father.[9] As he settles into Ramsay Street, Mike dates Nikki Dennison (Charlene Fenn).[12] The Guardian's Patrick Barkham described him at this time as \"the slightly square boy next door\" and a \"nice-but-lonely orphan\".[13] Mike and Scott are the victims of \"a cruel practical joke\" by Sue Parker (Kate Gorman), who learns that they have written a pop song and sent it to a producer.[14] Sue poses as Molly Meldrum's secretary and invites them to come and sing the song in front of Molly. Scott and Mike re-record the song and tell all their friends at school. When they turn up at Molly's house, they soon learn the appointment is a hoax and Sue publicly gloats about what happened.[14] In March 1988, Pearce spoke to Eithne Power of the Radio Times about upcoming storylines for his character and stated \"Mike will have developed a bit more by then. He certainly needs to. Though he's a good, responsible guy he goes really fuddy-duddy when it comes to girls. He can handle his work and his study and his friendships, but with girls he's a real twit. I'm all for that, it makes him more believable, rounds him out. Who needs someone who's got nothing left to learn?\"[2]/nOne of the character's most notable storylines was his relationship with Jane Harris (Annie Jones).[10] Jane was introduced a few months after Mike and they formed a friendship group with Scott and Charlene Mitchell (Kylie Minogue), which became popular with viewers and the media.[15] Author Josephine Monroe said that until Jane's arrival, Mike often felt like \"a bit of a gooseberry\" when he was with Scott and Charlene. Jane took \"an instant shine\" to Mike, but believed that he had not noticed her as she wore big glasses and was \"a geeky brainbox\".[10] However, Mike soon began paying her attention, despite receiving jibes from his school friends. One of the serial's most memorable plots occurred when Mike asked Jane to the school dance and she received a makeover from Daphne and Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), which left him proud to escort his girlfriend to the dance.[10] The relationship initially faces opposition from Jane's grandmother Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray), and is tested by the return of Nikki, who tries to come between the couple, and Mike's jealously when he realises Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) likes Jane, after they become lost in the bush together.[16] Monroe noted that Mike and Jane were good for each other, but they never seemed \"madly in love\" like Scott and Charlene, whose wedding they attended as best man and bridesmaid respectively.[10] Mike's interest in photography led to a modelling opportunity for Jane, after he took a photo of her that was selected to be the poster for the first Lassiters Girl.[10]/nThe relationship ends when Mike goes off to university and later meets Megan Downey (Michelle O'Grady), who tries to get him to move in with her.[17] Mike has \"a change of heart\" and then begins trying to win Jane back. Pearce told Patrice Fidgeon from TV Week: \"He's been wooing her, sending her flowers and finally she gives in. I think she feels sorry for him and eventually realises she really does like him.\"[17] The former couple were not on good terms prior to working together taking test shots for a modelling campaign with Scott's help. After Scott decides to swim back to the shore after they become stranded at sea, Mike and Jane have a chance to resolve their past issues and Jane re-evaluates her feelings for Mike.[17] Fidgeon observed that it is clear both Mike and Jane care deeply for one another. Pearce told him that up to that point, their relationship had been \"a fairly platonic one\".[17] Jane is also dating pilot Glen Matheson (Richard Moss), who is much older than her, but she realises their relationship is not going to work and ends it. Mrs Mangel, who was not initially in favour of Mike dating her granddaughter, changes her mind about him following Jane's involvement with Glen.[17] Fidgeon speculated that Mike and Jane might follow in Scott and Charlene's footsteps and marry. Pearce refused to say how the relationship worked out, but was pleased with the direction his character was taking.[17]/nJane and Mike's relationship does not last, and she is later paired with Des. While preparing for Mike's birthday, Des helps Mike set up his own photography dark room. Jane also offers to help out, but she receives a big electric shock and Des saves her.[18] A romance soon develops between them, and Jones commented that \"it builds towards a full on affair.\"[18] This results in end of her relationship with Mike, with Jones adding \"Mike gets the flick, basically.\"[18] Producers then paired Mike with Bronwyn Davies (Rachel Friend) for a brief romance storyline.[19] Friend admitted to being scared in her \"first encounter\" with Pearce, but after kissing him she realised that while she was self-conscious, nobody took any notice.[19] Bronwyn soon chooses Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan) over Mike.[20] Mike later believes he and Jane have a chance of reconciling, but learns she is in love with Des.[20] When Jane is almost hit by a car, this makes Des realise how much he loves Jane and asks her to marry him.[20] While everyone is pleased for the couple, Mike is upset when he hears the news, as he realises that both of the women in his life have chosen other men over him.[20] While reflecting on her character's relationships in June 2022, Jones believed Mike was the love of Jane's life. She said Jane was heartbroken when he broke up with her, adding \"There will always be a hole in her heart for Mike.\"[21]/nMike pursues a career as a school teacher at university and he returns to Erinsborough High on a student placement.[10] While there, Mike privately tutors 16 year old Jessie Ross (Michelle Kearley) and learns that she is being abused by her mother Adele Ross (Marian Sinclair). McCready and Furlong of Neighbours The Official Annual 1991 pointed out the story was ironic as Mike had also been the victim of paternal abuse.[22] Mike is angered when Jessie's father Ted Ross (Doug Bennett) learns what is happening and appears to be more concerned about his business reputation, rather than his daughter. McCready and Furlong stated \"Even though he is only young, Mike has had enough experience to be able to deal with such dramatic incidents in a sensible way.\"[22] Mike later shares a kiss with Jessie in an empty classroom, but they are caught by principal Kenneth Muir (Roger Boyce) and he decides to take some time away.[10]/nPearce took a two month break from Neighbours in late 1988 to film a role in Heaven Tonight.[5] He confirmed that he was not leaving the show and had in fact signed for another year. He was grateful to Grundys for letting him go and writing him out of the scripts.[23] On-screen, Mike temporarily departs Erinsborough to tour with a jazz band.[24] Portraying Mike as a jazz musician came easy to Pearce, as he is a musician himself and enjoys playing and writing rock songs.[25] Upon his return, he is moody and becomes hostile towards Henry, who has moved into his home and is staying in Bronwyn's room. Mike later punches Henry.[26] The cause of Mike's bad mood is later revealed. Off-screen, he had met Jenny Owens (Danielle Carter), who seemed to share his sense of adventure.[24] Mike initially keeps their relationship a secret from his friends and their story is told through a dream sequence.[24] Pearce told Darren Devlyn of TV Week: \"They zip around from town to town on Mike's motorbike... it's a bit thrill for them.\"[24] However, Mike \"flirts with danger\" and forgets his sense of responsibility when he goes to show Jenny a trick. Jenny loses her grip when Mike accelerates and she falls from the bike. Her spine takes the brunt of the fall and she becomes a paraplegic, who has to use a wheelchair.[24] Carter joined the cast for six weeks, as Mike spends time with Jenny at a convalescence home.[24] His feelings of guilt lead him to try and make her life more comfortable, and they eventually grow closer.[27]/nIn June 1989, David Brown and Patrice Fidgeon of TV Week reported that Pearce was set to quit Neighbours, along with Jones.[28] They reported that the pressure was on Pearce and Jones to stay following the departures of Minogue and Donovan, but Pearce wanted to prioritise his film and music careers. Brown and Fidgeon also reported that Network Ten wanted to keep the departures \"under wraps\" to minimise negative publicity in the lead up to the show's 1000th episode.[28] Pearce decided not to renew his contract when it ran out in October that year.[29] Pearce said Neighbours had opened a lot of doors for him, but he wanted more of a challenge. He explained \"I've been doing Neighbours now for some three and a half years and when I stepped away for two months to do Heaven Tonight it was like I had to remember how to act again. You've always had to act in Neighbours, but you fall into a routine. I didn't have to think about what Mike does anymore, I just naturally do it.\"[29] Pearce had thought about leaving the show for around a year, and after starring in Heaven Tonight he realised that he wanted to continue making feature films.[30] He also felt that playing Mike had become stale and he had achieved everything he could from the role, stating \"I've been incredibly lucky. It's been a really good launching pad and the best thing for me was that it was the first professional job I'd ever done on television, so I learned a great deal about working with cameras and direction.\"[30] On-screen, Des informs Mike that his mother has been injured in a plane crash and urges him to visit her. Marion MacDonald of The Sydney Morning Herald observed that Mike showed \"an unfilial reluctance\" to fly out to Barbara, as she had been a bad parent.[31] However, Mike eventually decides to leave Erinsborough to reconcile with her.[32] His exit aired in December 1989.[31]/nWhen Neighbours was cancelled, Pearce discussed a hypothetical return with Donovan. In March 2022, producers approached Pearce with the invitation to reprise the role for few episodes in June that year. Pearce informed Donovan, who himself would soon reprise his famous role.[33]/nOn 3 June 2022, Duncan Lindsay of the Metro confirmed Pearce would be reprising his role for the Neighbours finale, following its cancellation earlier in the year.[34] He appears in the final three episodes, which air back-to-back on 28 July 2022.[35] Of his return, Pearce stated \"It is very exciting and surreal at the same time being back on set again, however it feels like coming home. It's where it all started for me professionally. I've been asked to come back on occasions over the years and wondered if it was the right thing to do, but once I knew the show was finishing, I knew I had to do it.\"[34]/nExecutive producer Jason Herbison said Pearce was returning for \"a very special story arc\" and that he had been involved in the development of the storyline, which will answer the question \"who is Mike Young today?\"[34] Pearce later told Angela Bishop of Studio 10 that Mike's return sees him and his daughter relocate from Perth to Erinsborough.[36]/nPearce also revealed that his friend and fellow actor Kate Winslet was a fan of the show and his character, so he and the producers considered naming the mother of Mike's daughter after her. However, Pearce felt that was \"a little personal\" to him, as his former wife is called Kate, so they named her Rose, after Winslet's character in Titanic.[36]/nIn May 2023, following the series' return to production, Pearce indicated that he was in discussions to make a further appearance in order to provide closure to Mike's relationship with Jane.[37] His return was confirmed on Neighbours' social media accounts shortly after.[38][39] Pearce's scenes were filmed in the UK ahead of the regular series production recommencing.[40] In January 2024, executive producer Jason Herbison stated that Pearce would continue to make occasional appearances.[41]/nMike and his mother, Barbara, live in fear of being beaten by Mike's father, David. Mike befriends Scott Robinson at Erinsborough High School. Through Scott, Mike secures a job at Daphne Lawrence's coffee shop. He begins staying overnight to avoid going home and Daphne's friend Zoe Davis (Ally Fowler) finds his sleeping bag. She also notices bruises on Mike's face and asks whether his father beats him. He later confides in her about how his father was having problems at work and started hitting him around a year ago. He also says that he is saving money so he and his mother can move away. Zoe soon tells Daphne about Mike's father. Mike eventually goes home, but his father soon turns violent and Mike stands up to him. He later turns up at the coffee shop and tells Daphne that he thinks he has killed his father, as he hit his head when Mike pushed him. Daphne calls Barbara and learns David is okay. She tells them that Mike will be staying with her, and has Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine) look at Mike's facial injuries. Mike refuses to go back home with his parents and Barbara brings him his belongings./nMike later moves in with Daphne and her partner Des Clarke, who offer to become his legal guardians. He briefly dates Scott's cousin Nikki Dennison, but he later falls for Jane Harris when she moves in with her grandmother, Nell Mangel. Jane falls for Mike straight away, but it takes a while before Mike realises his feelings due to Jane's plain image. Helen Daniels and Daphne give her a makeover for a school dance, which consists of replacing her glasses with contacts, a new haircut and makeup. Mike likes her new image and they begin dating. Mrs Mangel is not happy that her granddaughter is dating Mike and when she receives letters about Mike's reputation with other girls, Mrs Mangel stops Jane from seeing him. Daphne eventually catches school bully, Sue Parker, posting the letters and Sue explains that she is jealous of Mike and Jane's relationship. Mrs Mangel then lets Jane and Mike continue dating. When Nikki returns to Ramsay Street, Mike helps comfort her when she discovers her mother is ill, leading Jane to become jealous of their friendship. Mike becomes jealous when Shane Ramsay shows an attraction to Jane, but she tells Mike that he is the only one for her./nFollowing their final exams, Jane focuses on her modelling career and Mike decides to become a teacher. As they are leading separate lives, Jane and Mike split up amicably and remain friends. Not long after, Daphne is killed in a car crash and Mike is left feeling guilty as he had not been around for a few weeks. Mike is angry and upset and he finds the two men who had crashed into Daphne's car. He attacks them and is later arrested. When Mike finishes university, he gets a job teaching maths at Erinsborough High. Mike becomes close to one of his students, Jessie Ross, who admits that she has an abusive father too. Mike confronts her father, but soon learns that her mother is the one abusing her. Mike becomes close to Jessie and they share a kiss, which is witnessed by principal Kenneth Muir. Mr Muir suspends Mike, who decides to leave Erinsborough for a while./nOn his return, Mike finds Des and Jane have forged a strong friendship. Mike becomes moody as he settles back in. When Jenny Owens comes to see him, it is revealed that Mike and Jenny took a ride on his motorbike and she fell off. Jenny is paralysed and uses a wheelchair. Mike blames himself for Jenny's condition and cannot bring himself to accept that the event was an accident. Jenny eventually convinces him that it was not his fault. At the same time, Des and Jane begin dating and Mike is disgusted with the both of them. He refuses to accept the relationship and leaves Erinsborough again. He returns in the middle of Des and Jane's engagement party and he interrupts it. Mike eventually accepts that Des and Jane love each other and gives them his blessing. Mike begins to feel like there is not much left for him in Erinsborough and when he hears that his mother had been in a plane crash, and with his father long dead, Mike decides to leave Ramsay Street and join her to help her recovery. Years later, when Jane returns to Erinsborough, she reveals that Mike is teaching underprivileged children in the Philippines./nThirty-three years later, Mike drives his motorbike through Ramsay Street and sees Jane in her driveway and unawarely interrupts Clive trying to win her back. Mike leaves and goes to Lassiters, where Shane recognises him. Mike goes to see his daughter, Sam Young (Henrietta Graham), who works at the hotel and sees Paul again. Mike bumps into Jane, who drops all her belongings on the floor, and the two are stunned to see each other once again. Mike has drinks with his old friends and waves goodbye to Jane when she leaves. Clive approaches Mike and asks if he is interested in another relationship with Jane, as Clive is trying to restart his with her. Mike says he is not and Jane gives her a tour of all the houses on Ramsay Street. A drunken Clive sees them together and speaks aggressively towards Mike. The two have a fight, but once the alcohol has worn off Clive, he accepts that his and Jane's relationship is over. Mike takes Jane on a ride on his motorbike. He later tells Jane that he still loves her and they hug, rekindling their relationship. Mike and Jane are reunited with Scott and Charlene when they return and the four of them watch over Ramsay Street as its residents party./nTwo years after moving back to Ramsay Street, Mike and Jane plan a trip to London, with Mike heading there before Jane as they are unable to get airfares together. The two reunite in Surrey. Mike reveals to Sam that he plans to propose to Jane, but these plans are derailed by news of the possible closure of Erinsborough High, where Jane works. Mike throws the ring into the lake, but realises that he made a rushed decision to put off the proposal. He retrieves the ring and proposes to Jane, with her accepting. Jane returns to Australia for work and later gets a call from Mike, who tells her that he has been offered a job in the UK as a motorcycle tour guide. Jane tells him to accept it and he announces that he will be working on a four-month contract./nCritics often remarked on the character's good looks and nice personality. Mike was named \"Ramsay Street's favourite boy next door\" by Rob Scully of the Aberdeen Evening Express.[30] He also called Mike \"wholesome\",[30] while the Daily Mirror's Hilary Bonner called him \"nice\" and a \"fresh-face heart throb\".[42] David Astle of The Sydney Morning Herald dubbed the character \"a mullet-mopped kid\" and a \"hunky young teacher.\"[43] A writer for Sunday Life observed that Mike was introduced to the show as \"a troubled teenager beaten up by his father.\"[44]/nA writer for the BBC's Neighbours website stated that Mike's most notable moment was when he saw Jane's \"transformation at the school dance.\"[45] In 2010, to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company, included Mike in their 25 most memorable characters in the show's history.[46] Describing him they state: \"The Erinsborough economy is studied the world over for being the only one in the world that can sustained on just four professions: you can work in 'business', or be a journalist, a doctor, or a teacher. Mike chose the latter, probably because he was the nice, fairly quiet boy out of the legendary original set of teens on the show. His romance with plain Jane Harris unfortunately ended up with her engaged to his father figure of a friend, Des, one of many reasons why he left the show to care for his sick mother.\"[46] Robin Wilks from The Daily Telegraph included Pearce at number three in his feature on the \"Top five ex-Neighbours stars\", following his successful acting career. While discussing his time on the show, Wilks thought there was a lot of \"unresolved sexual tension\" between Mike and Lucy Robinson.[47]/nLorna Cooper of MSN TV has listed Mike as one of soap opera's forgotten characters and claimed he was a favourite out of the golden era of the serial.[48] Orange UK describe Mike as one of the serial's \"hottest spunks\".[49] LoveFilm describe Mike's storylines as serious and give him the nickname \"motorbike Mike\".[50] A writer from Heat magazine called Mike \"cheesy, but gorgeous\".[51] In 2022, Kate Randall (also from Heat) included Mike and Jane in the magazine's top ten Neighbours characters of all time feature. Randall stated that Mike assumed the role of the \"quiet teen\".[52] Mike was placed at number twenty-nine on the Huffpost's \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him as a \"quiet teenager\" who transformed into \"a Speedo-clad pin up at the height of 80s Neighbours mania.\"[53] He added that Mike was part of the show's dream team quartet\" which consisted of Mike, Jane, Scott and Charlene.[53]", "1481340": "Scott Kim is an American puzzle and video game designer, artist, and author of Korean descent.

His early schooling was in Wellington and he was dux of Hutt Valley High School in 1957.  He earned his Bachelor of Science (a double major in Applied and Pure Mathematics and a further double major in Physics and Mathematical Physics) and in 1962 he earned a Masters of Science with first class honours in Mathematics, all from Victoria University of Wellington. The bachelor's degree was from the University of New Zealand, as the constituent colleges of UNZ, of which Victoria University College was one of four, had proliferated into four autonomous Universities by the time Pearce completed his master's degree.[3]/nPearce always remained proud of his New Zealand origins. Being descended from Maori people, he claimed his New Zealand ancestry was longer than almost all his peers from New Zealand.[3]/nPearce is descended from Alexander Gray, one of just five Scots who settled in New Zealand as part of the original and largely strong interest in Maoritanga and claimed ancestral connection to three waka (canoes) in the heke (migration): Aotea, Kurahaupo and Takatimu. His principal tribal connection was with the Ngati Ruanui, based in the southern Taranaki.[3]/nIn 1963 Pearce left New Zealand for doctoral study at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, under the supervision of Pat Moran. Thereafter followed short stints (1 to 3 years) as lecturer at: ANU; University of Queensland (visiting Professor); Universit\u00e9 de Rennes 1, France; and University of Sheffield (1966\u201368).[3] He was appointed to the University of Adelaide in 1968 and remained there for the ensuing years, having been promoted to senior lecturer in 1971, Reader in 1982 and professor in 2003.[4] He was a leading figure in the Department of Applied Mathematics there, being appointed in 2005 to the Elder Chair of Mathematics./nWhile at ANU, he met and married Frances (n\u00e9e O'Connor), and they brought up their two daughters, Emma and Ann, in Adelaide.[3] Charles died in a motor vehicle accident near Fox Glacier on the NZ South Island on 8 June 2012.[5]/nHe is known for probabilistic and statistical modelling. Pearce published prolifically in the area of probabilistic and statistical modelling and analysis, with strong contributions being made in both theory and practice. His book with Dragomir addresses the fine points of the Hermite\u2013Hadamard inequality and is published by Kluwer Academic Press. His applied interests included queuing theory, road traffic, telecommunications, and urban planning. With former student Bill Henderson, who followed him from Sheffield to Adelaide, he helped establish the successful Teletraffic Centre in the University of Adelaide.  Publications are numerous and include three books, 23 book chapters, and over 300 research articles./nWith the formation of the Division of Applied Mathematics of the Australian Mathematical society, Pearce soon emerged as a key figure. The most enduring significant role was as Chief Editor of their Applied Mathematics Journal, now called The ANZIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics. The formation of ANZIAM in 1993 was close to Pearce's heart, as it encapsulated the union he espoused of joint activity in Applied Mathematics involving both Australia and New Zealand. He was a strong worker for ANZIAM and it was fitting that this, along with his outstanding research work, was recognised by the award of the ANZIAM Medal in 2001.[6]/nPearce was elected as a Fellow of the New Zealand Mathematical Society in 2003 and was awarded the ASOR Ren Potts Award in 2007.[1]", "35723914": "Samuel Mountifort Longfield (1802 \u2013 21 November 1884) was an Irish lawyer, judge, mathematician, and academic. He was the first Professor of Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin.[1]/nHe was son of Mountifort Longfield, vicar of Desert Serges (Desert Magee), County Cork, and his wife Grace, daughter of William Lysaght of Fort William and Mount North, County Cork. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, graduated as moderator and gold medallist in science in 1823, became a fellow in 1825, and proceeded to the degrees of M.A. in 1829 and LL.D. in 1831.[2]/nIn 1828 Longfield was called to the Irish bar, but did not practise. When the professorship of political economy in Trinity College was founded in 1832, he was appointed the first professor; and in 1834 he resigned his fellowship and became Regius Professor of Feudal and English Law there, a post he held for the rest of his life, from 1871 having as deputy N.

He became a judge of the court, and continued to sit until 1867.[2]/nA liberal in politics, Longfield helped draft the Irish measures of the first and second Gladstone administrations. In 1867 he was sworn a member of the Irish Privy Council. He was appointed a commissioner of Irish national education in 1853, and on several occasions was an assessor to the general synod of the Church of Ireland; with Joseph Galbraith he was one of the architects of the church's finances.[2]/nLongfield was an active member of the Social Science Congress and the Dublin Statistical Society. He died at 47 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, on 21 November 1884.[2]/nHis most important work in economics was \"Lectures on Political Economy\", which was published in 1834. He argued against the labor theory of value and developed a marginal revenue productivity theory of labour and capital. It was unusual for its time and was only rediscovered after 1900; some of his ideas on capital and interest foreshadowed the work of the Austrian School.[3]/nHis main approaches revolved around the labor theory of value, an analysis of capital and distribution theory (based on a concept of marginal productivity). He applies insofar as the representative of the marginal utility theory avant la lettre.[citation needed]/nIn 1845 Longfield married Elizabeth Penelope, daughter of Andrew Armstrong.[2]/nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Lee, Sidney, ed.

During this time, Nicolson became a proficient numerical analyst and an expert user of Hartree's differential analyser.[4] Nicolson, along with other members of the research group worked on defence-related problems for the Air Defence Research and Development Establishment (later the Radar Research and Development Establishment), both part of the Ministry of Supply.  Nicolson's two significant bodies of wartime research, \"Transient behaviour in the single anode magnetron\" and \"heat conduction\", formed the basis of parts II and III of her 1946 PhD thesis Three Problems in Theoretical Physics.[3]/nNicolson's research on heat conduction related to solutions of the heat equation, and with her colleague John Crank she investigated the numerical stability of several solution techniques. The algorithm now known as the Crank\u2013Nicolson method emerged from this work and was published in 1947.[5]/nNicolson was a research student in Cambridge from 1945 and completed her Ph.D. thesis completed at the Victoria University of Manchester (now Manchester University) in 1946.[3]  She was a Tucker-Price Research Fellow of Girton College, Cambridge from 1946 to 1949, working at the Cavendish Laboratory.[2][6]  Nicolson moved to Leeds around January 1950 with her husband Malcolm Nicolson, also a physicist, as he had been appointed to a lectureship in Physics at Leeds University.[7][6]  Phyllis Nicolson had married Malcolm in 1942 and they had two sons, Donald Macleod Nicolson (born 20 September 1947 in Cambridge) and Roderick Ian Nicolson (born 5 February 1950 in Leeds).[6]/nMalcolm Nicolson, aged 33, died in a train accident in December 1951, and Phyllis was appointed to take over his lectureship.[8][7] In 1955, Nicolson married physicist Malcolm McCaig, who had a son Ian McCaig (born February 1946) from a previous marriage.[7][6] In May 1957, Nicolson and McCaig had a son together, Andrew Malcolm McCaig.[6]  All three of Nicolson's sons ended up getting PhDs \u2013 in mathematics,[6] psychology,[9] and geology.[10]/nNicolson died from breast cancer in 1968 in Sheffield.[7]", "50109073": "Ilya Nikolaevich Bronshtein (Russian: \u0418\u043b\u044c\u044f \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0448\u0442\u0435\u0439\u043d, German: Ilja Nikolajewitsch Bronstein, also written as Bronschtein; born 1903, died 1976) was a Russian applied mathematician and historian of mathematics./nBronshtein taught at the Moscow State Technical University (MAMI), then the State College of Mechanical Engineering, on the Chair of Advanced Mathematics established in 1939.

Hot lead typesetting for the work had already started when the Siege of Leningrad prohibited further development and the print matrices were relocated.[2] After the war, they were first considered lost, but could be found again years later, so that the first edition of \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0442\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432 could finally be published in 1945.[2][3] This was a major success and went through eleven editions in Russia and was translated into various languages, including German and English, until the publisher Nauka planned to replace it with a translation of the American Mathematical Handbook for Scientists and Engineers by Granino and Theresa M. Korn in 1968.[2][3]\nHowever, in a parallel development starting in 1970, the so called \"Bronshtein and Semendyayev\" (BS), which had been translated into German in 1958, underwent a major overhaul by a team of East-German authors around G\u00fcnter Grosche, Viktor & Dorothea Ziegler (of University of Leipzig), to which Bronshtein himself could no longer contribute due to reasons of age.[2] This was published in 1979 and spawned translations into many other languages as well, including a retranslation into Russian and an English edition. In 1986, the 13th Russian edition was published. The German 'Wende' and the later reunification led to considerable changes in the publishing environment in Germany between 1989 and 1991, which eventually resulted in two independent German publishing branches by Eberhard Zeidler (published 1995\u20132013) and by Gerhard Musiol\u00a0[de] & Heiner M\u00fchlig (published 1992\u20132020) to expand and maintain the work up to the present, again with translations into many other languages including English.", "53222035": "Prof Bertram Martin Wilson FRSE (14 November 1896, London \u2013 18 March 1935, Dundee, Scotland) was an English mathematician, remembered primarily as a co-editor, along with G. H. Hardy and P. V. Seshu Aiyar, of Srinivasa Ramanujan's Collected Papers.[1][2][3] (It seems probable that Wilson did not know about Ramanujan's lost notebook, which was probably passed by G. H. Hardy to G. N. Watson some years after Wilson's death.[4])/nHe was born in London on 14 November 1896 the son of Rev Alfred Henry Wilson and his wife, Ellen Elizabeth Vincent.[5]/nWilson was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and then studied Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating MA. In 1920 he was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, and was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1926.[6] He remained there for slightly more than thirteen years, working under three professors, Frank Stanton Carey (1860\u20131928), J. C. Burkhill, and E. C. Titchmarsh. In 1933 Wilson was appointed Professor of Pure and Applied Mathematics at University College, Dundee[2] as successor to John Edward Aloysius Steggall, who retired.[7]/nHis early interests in mathematical analysis are shown in some dozen original papers, published between 1919 and 1924, mainly on the theory of numbers and on integral equations and orthogonal functions, but these were only a small part of his total contribution to mathematics. Subsequently, most of his attention was directed to the study of the remarkable Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan: he was one of the editors of the Collected Papers, published in 1927, and at the time of his death was still occupied, again as joint editor, in the much greater task of annotating Ramanujan's note-books. He was also on the editorial board of the new Compositio Mathematica and contributed many reviews to the Fortschritte.[2]/nSometime in the late 1920s, G. N. Watson and B. M. Wilson began the task of editing Ramanujan's notebooks. The second notebook, being a revised, enlarged edition of the first, was their primary focus. Wilson was assigned Chapters 2\u201314, and Watson was to examine Chapters 15\u201321. Wilson devoted his efforts to this task until 1935, when he died from an infection at the early age of 38. Watson wrote over 30 papers inspired by the notebooks before his interest evidently waned in the late 1930s. Thus, the project was never completed.[8]/nWilson was elected on 5 March 1934 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, James Hartley Ashworth, Nicholas Lightfoot and Edward Thomas Copson.[9]/nIn 1934 he gave a talk Ramanujan's Note-Books and their Place in Modern Mathematics at the third Colloquium of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society at the University of St Andrews.[10]/nWilson died on 18 March 1935 following a brief illness.[2]/nIn 1930 he married Margaret Fancourt Mitchell.[11]/nG. N. Watson and B. M. Wilson never completed their project of editing Ramanujan's notebooks (not including the \"lost\" notebook), but Bruce C. Berndt completed their project in a 5-volume publication Ramanujan's Notebooks, Parts I\u2014V. The following quote refers to the three notebooks involved in Watson and Wilson's project:/n.... Ramanujan left three notebooks. The first notebook, totaling 351 pages, contains 16 chapters of loosely organized material with the remainder unorganized. In the organized part, which ends on page 263 ..., Ramanujan wrote on only one side of the paper. Shortly thereafter, Ramanujan began to write on both sides of the page and then returned to the unused reverse sides to record additional material, so that only about 20 of 351 pages are actually blank./nThe second notebook is a revised enlargement of the first and was probably composed during the nine months that Ramanujan held a scholarship at the University of Madras prior to his departure from England. This notebook contains 21 chapters, comprising 256 pages, followed by 100 pages of miscellaneous material./nThe third short notebook contains 33 pages of miscellaneous material.[12]/nBerndt benefited substantially from Wilson's considerable efforts in editing Ramanujan's second notebook. Because some journals require the permission of each author when an article is to be published, for some of Berndt's work he was not permitted to put Wilson or Watson as a coauthor. However, Berndt published several articles with Wilson as a coauthor.[13][14][15][16][17]", "2005652": "Tommaso Ceva (December 20, 1648 \u2013 February 3, 1737) was an Italian Jesuit mathematician from Milan.  He was the brother of Giovanni Ceva. His work aided in spreading a knowledge of Newton's discovery of the law of gravitation./nTommaso Ceva was born into a wealthy Milanese family in 1648. After studying at the Collegio di Brera, a Jesuit college in Milan, on 24 March 1663 he entered the Society of Jesus. He taught mathematics and rhetoric at the Jesuit College of Brera in Milan for thirty-eight years.[1] His most famous student was Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri. Under the tutelage of Ceva, Saccheri wrote his first work, titled Quaesita geometrica (Geometric Investigations, 1693). Ceva was one the main representatives of Celia Grillo Borromeo's Academia Vigilantium.[2] Joseph I named him Caesarian Theologian early in the 18th century.[2]/nHis first scientific work, De natura gravium (The Nature of Gravity, 1699), dealt with physical subjects - such as gravity and free fall - in a philosophical way. His only mathematical work, published in 1699 was the Opuscula Mathematica (Mathematical Essays), which dealt with geometry, gravity and arithmetic. Ceva designed an instrument to divide a right angle into a specified number of equal parts.[3] His device, described in the Acta Eruditorum in 1695, won him the attention of Leibniz.[4] This same instrument was described in 1704 by the French mathematician Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital.[5]/nIn his Philosophia novo-antiqua (New-Ancient Philosophy, 1704) Ceva defended scholasticism against the systems Descartes and Gassendi and tried to reconcile the best of ancient and modern natural philosophy.[6] The work comprises six dissertations, dealing with topics ranging from mathematics to cosmology and mechanics, and engages with live issues for the science of the time (Copernican theory; Descartes's physics and denial of animal souls; Gassendi's atomism). Ceva accepted Galileo's theory of motion but not his cosmology. As far as Cartesian physics is concerned, he especially criticized the identification of the essence of matter with extension.[7] Ceva's Philosophia novo-antiqua was reissued in Wien in 1719, in Florence in 1723 and in Venice in 1732./nCeva was also a noted poet and dedicated a significant amount of his time to this task. In the literary field Ceva shared the Arcadian reaction against marinism, and summed it up in his oft-quoted definition of poetry as \u2018un sogno che si fa in presenza della ragione\u2019 (\u201ca dream made in the presence of reason\u201d).[6] His Latin poem Jesus Puer, dedicated to the Holy Roman emperor Joseph I, was translated into many languages including German and Italian. Two other collections of Latin verses, Sylvae (1699; \u201cWoods\u201d) and Carmina (1704; \u201cPoems\u201d), range over philosophic, scientific, religious, and literary subjects. Ceva was made a fellow of the Arcadia in 1718 and was in correspondence with Vincenzo Viviani and Luigi Guido Grandi.[2] He was a close friend of the mathematician Pietro Paolo Caravaggio and his son Pietro Paolo Caravaggio junior.[8]/nHis Opuscula mathematica brought him international fame and his Carmina were favourably reviewed in Acta Eruditorum.[9] His work was highly praised by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart.[10]/nIn his latter years Ceva suffered from paralysis. He died in Milan on 3 February 1737.[2]/nPrompted by the familiar \"insertion\" method of Archimedes, Ceva devised in 1699 a curve for trisection which was called the \"Cycloidum anomalarum\".[11] The principle involved is that of doubling angles.

Brigo has been the most cited author for the technical section of Risk Magazine in the twenty years periods 1998\u20132017,[5] and his research on credit-default-swaps (CDS)-calibration has been referenced in legal proceedings.[9] More in detail, in 2011 the court of law in Novara, Italy, retried a case of financial intermediation after the bankruptcy of Lehman. The judgement explanation refers to Brigo's research article on credit calibration, which was an early online preprint version of Brigo, Morini and Tarenghi (2011), using their first passage firm-value models AT1P and SBTV to calibrate Lehman's CDS data, following an earlier application to Parmalat data. The court sentence states that \"... in a recent study two different mathematical models (AT1P and SBTV) have been applied to the CDS trend of Lehman, and this shows that, despite a worsening of the estimate, even from a mathematical point of view, based on the CDS patterns, the survival probability of Lehman, even near the default event, was still high.\"[9]/nBrigo started his research work with the development and study of the projection filters, during his Ph.D. with Bernard Hanzon and Francois Le Gland, published mainly in Brigo, Hanzon and Le Gland (1998, 1999). This initial version of projection filters was investigated by the Swedish Defense Research Agency.[16] The projection filters are nonlinear filters based on the differential geometric approach to statistics, also related to information geometry. This work was part of Brigo's PhD studies, appearing in his PhD dissertation \"Filtering by projection on the manifold of exponential densities\".[12]/nProjection filters approximate the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) of the optimal nonlinear filter, evolving in an infinite dimensional space, with a finite dimensional stochastic differential equation obtained via projection of the SPDE on a chosen finite dimensional manifold of probability densities. Brigo and co-authors considered different types of optimality criteria and metrics, leading to a variety of projection filters (besides the initial references, see in particular Armstrong and Brigo (2016), and Armstrong, Brigo and Rossi Ferrucci (2021)).\nProjection filters have been applied to several areas, including navigation, ocean dynamics, quantum optics and quantum systems, estimation of fiber diameters, estimation of chaotic time series, change point detection and other areas, with the relevant references listed in the related projection filters page applications./nMathematical finance is the research area where Brigo has been most active and is most known, both in academia and industry, authoring three monographs and about one hundred academic and industry publications.[1]/nBrigo and co-authors published several research papers on interest rate modeling, culminating in the monograph Brigo and Mercurio (2006) where the theory and practice of interest rate modelling are developed, including inflation modeling, credit risk modeling, early treatment of credit valuation adjustments and calibration of models to market data. The monograph collects a good part of the earlier published research by the two authors and further co-authors./nIn volatility smile modelling, Brigo and co-authors have introduced stochastic differential equations that are consistent with dynamical mixture models, both in a univariate setting in Brigo and Mercurio (2002) and Brigo, Mercurio and Sartorelli (2003), among others, and in a multivariate setting, allowing for reconciling single assets and index volatility smiles or triangulation of FX rates smiles, in Brigo, Rapisarda and Sridi (2018) and Brigo, Pisani and Rapisarda (2021).[17][18] These mixture dynamics models have been successfully applied to different asset classes, see the specific entry for further references./nFrom 2002, Brigo contributed also to credit derivatives modeling and counterparty credit risk valuation. Brigo and co-authors worked extensively on credit default swap and credit default options in particular, both for single name default options in Brigo (2005), Brigo and Alfonsi (2005), Brigo and El-Bachir (2010),[19][20] and for credit default index options in Brigo and Morini (2011),[21] showing how one could properly include a systemic default event in the valuation and clarifying the role of information in the valuation. Brigo was also among the first to publish a method for valuation of constant maturity credit default swaps, a form of credit default swaps where the premium leg does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread from a reference vanilla CDS over a constant time to maturity, see Brigo (2006)[22] and the related entry.\nBrigo focused also on multiname credit derivatives, showing in Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti (2007),[20] through a dynamic loss model, how data implied a non-negligible probability that several names defaulted together, showing some large default clusters and a concrete risk of high losses in collateralized debt obligations prior to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. This research has been updated in 2010, leading to the monograph Credit Models and the Crisis: A journey into CDOs, Copulas, Correlations and Dynamic Models by Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti (2010),[23] where, besides the dynamic loss models, the authors show research published before the crisis in 2006, highlighting the problems of the implied and base correlation paradigms that were dominating the valuation of credit index tranches at the time, based on the Gaussian copula, including the impossibility to match specific tranche spread patterns and the issue of allowing for negative expected tranched losses that pointed at possible arbitrage, see for example Torresetti, Brigo and Pallavicini (2006).[24]/nBrigo worked extensively on the theory and practice of valuation adjustments with several co-authors, being among the first in introducing early counterparty risk pricing calculations (later called credit valuation adjustment - CVA) in Brigo and Masetti (2006),[25] and then focusing early on wrong way risk for CVA, see for example Brigo and Pallavicini (2007),[26] and later on Brigo, Capponi and Pallavicini (2014) for the case of wrong way risk with credit default swaps, where the underlying itself is default risky and default correlation plays a key role,[19] highlighting the issue that even daily collateralization may not protect enough from losses, especially under default contagion,[27] thus anticipating the discussion on initial margins. Brigo and co-authors were also among the first to introduce rigorously the debit valuation adjustment (DVA),[25]   while a volume on the updated nonlinear theory of valuation, including credit effects,[6] collateral modeling and funding costs, has appeared in Brigo, Morini and Pallavicini (2013), a volume that also collects investigation of wrong way risk across asset classes[28] and collects earlier research of the authors on collateral modeling and funding costs. Still on wrong way risk, Brigo and Vrins (2018) resort to a change of probability measure as a possible explanatory and computational technique.[29] \nThe research in this area expanded with several articles that contributed to give full mathematical rigor to the theory of credit and funding valuation adjustments, and to show their limits, highlighting the need for a full nonlinear valuation framework. These works include Brigo and Pallavicini (2014), who highlight the necessity of initial margin and the inherent nonlinear nature of the valuation problem under credit, collateral and funding effects, sketching the derivation of a valuation equation using advanced mathematical tools that will be made fully rigorous in subsequent papers.[30]\nThis research continued with Brigo, Buescu, and Rutkowski (2017), reconciling credit and funding effects with a basic option pricing theory,[29] Brigo, Francischello and Pallavicini (2019) for a fully rigorous analysis of valuation as a fully nonlinear problem expressed mathematically through backward stochastic differential equations and semi-linear partial differential equations,[25] and Brigo, Buescu, Francischello, Pallavicini and Rutkowski (2022) to reconcile the mathematically rigorous results on nonlinear valuation and valuation adjustments based on cash flows adjustments with an approach based on hedging./nBrigo and co-authors further approached mathematical finance in general from a pathwise point of view, trying to establish results independently of the probabilistic setting. Armstrong, Bellani, Brigo and Cass (2021) show how to obtain option prices without probability theory, using rough paths techniques.[31] This approach originated from an early result of Brigo and Mercurio (2000), where it is established that given an arbitrarily fine pre-assigned trading time grid, two statistically indistinguishable models in the grid can generate arbitrarily different options prices.[32]\nFor pathwise finance in optimal trade execution, Bellani and Brigo (2022)\nshow how one can do optimal execution in a model agnostic way, introducing the notion of good execution. Still in the context of optimal execution but with probability theory fully back in the framework, Brigo, Graceffa and Neumann (2022)[33] show how to combine the theories of price impact, related to optimal execution,  with the theory of the term structure of interest rates./nIn the research area of risk management and risk measures in particular,  Armstrong and Brigo (2019, 2022) show that, under the S-shaped utility of Kahneman and Tversky, which can be used to model excessively tail risk seeking traders, or limited liability traders, static risk constraints based on value at risk or expected shortfall as risk measures are ineffective in curbing the potentially rogue trader utility maximization.[34] The broad regulatory implications of this research were discussed in The Banker, Bracken Column, May 1, 2018./nIn the area of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to mathematical finance, and retail credit risk in particular, non-performing loans are examined in Bellotti, Brigo, Gambetti and Vrins (2021) who approach prediction of recovery rates with machine learning.[35]\nIn insurance, Lamberton, Brigo and Hoy (2017) show how robotic process automation and artificial intelligence may be deployed to enhance performances in the insurance industry.[36]/nBrigo has been researching several areas of probability theory and statistics. His main work concerns the interaction of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with the geometry of manifolds. Initially, this research has been applied to filtering, although later on, with the help of several co-authors, it has been studied in its own right and has been applied to finance too. One of the main results is the interpretation of Ito SDEs as 2-jets. This interpretation is related to Schwartz morphism and was developed in Armstrong and Brigo (2018) via the structure of jet bundles, with applications to filtering for both ordinary and quantum systems.[37] Indeed, this work has inspired the optimal approximation of SDEs on submanifolds in Armstrong, Brigo and Rossi Ferrucci (2021) with applications leading to the   latest family of projection filters based on the Ito-vector and Ito-jet projections.[37] \nIn a similar vein, and with rough differential equations in mind, the study of non-geometric rough paths on manifolds has been approached in Armstrong, Brigo, Cass and Rossi Ferrucci (2022)./nStill in the context of the theory of SDEs but without geometry, Brigo and co-authors worked on the theory of specific stochastic processes known as Peacocks in Brigo, Jeanblanc and Vrins (2020), linking them with Stochastic Differential Equations whose solutions are uniformly distributed. These SDEs have to be analyzed with particular care as they have time-dependent non-Lipschitz and degenerate coefficients.[38]/nIn probability and statistics, and in the theory of statistical distributions in particular, Alfonsi and Brigo (2005) have introduced new families of multivariate distributions through the concept of periodic copula function.[39] Brigo, Mai and Scherer (2016) propose a new characterization of the Marshall-Olkin distribution. This is based on survival indicators of a related Markov chain[40] and is applied to credit risk.", "46340778": "Thomas Ransford (born 1958) is a British-born Canadian mathematician, known for his research in spectral theory and complex analysis.

Moving to the US, he obtained a Ph.D. in geometry with Frank Morley and became a professor of mathematics at California Institute of Technology. There he taught fluid dynamics to students going into aerodynamics with Theodore von Karman. Bateman made a broad survey of applied differential equations in his Gibbs Lecture in 1943 titled, \"The control of an elastic fluid\"./nBateman was born in Manchester, England, on 29 May 1882. He first gained an interest in mathematics during his time at Manchester Grammar School. In his final year, he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. Bateman studied with coach Robert Alfred Herman to prepare for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. He distinguished himself in 1903 as Senior Wrangler (tied with P.E. Marrack) and by winning the Smith's Prize (1905).[4]/nHis first paper, \"The determination of curves satisfying given conditions\", was published when he was still an undergraduate student.[5] He studied in G\u00f6ttingen and Paris, and taught at the University of Liverpool and University of Manchester. After moving to the US in 1910, he taught at Bryn Mawr College and then Johns Hopkins University. There, working with Frank Morley in geometry, he achieved his Ph.D., prior to which he had already published more than 60 papers, including some of his celebrated papers. In 1917, he took up his permanent position at the California Institute of Technology, which was then known as the \"Throop Polytechnic Institute\"./nEric Temple Bell says, \"Like his contemporaries and immediate predecessors among Cambridge mathematicians of the first decade of this century [1901\u20131910]... Bateman was thoroughly trained in both pure analysis and mathematical physics, and retained an equal interest in both throughout his scientific career.\"[6]/nTheodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was called in as an advisor for a projected aeronautics laboratory at Caltech and later gave this appraisal of Bateman:[7]/nIn 1926 Cal Tech [sic] had only a minor interest in aeronautics. The professorship that came nearest to aeronautics was occupied by a shy, meticulous Englishman, Dr. Harry Bateman. He was an applied mathematician from Cambridge who worked in the field of fluid mechanics. He seemed to know everything but did nothing important. I liked him./nHarry Bateman married Ethel Horner in 1912 and had a son named Harry Graham, who died as a child. Later, the couple adopted a daughter named Joan Margaret. He died on his way to New York in 1946 of coronary thrombosis./nIn 1907, Harry Bateman was lecturing at the University of Liverpool together with another senior wrangler, Ebenezer Cunningham. In 1908, together they came up with the idea of a conformal group of spacetime (now usually denoted as C(1,3))[8] which involved an extension of the method of images.[9]/nIn nuclear physics, the Bateman equation is a mathematical model describing abundances and activities in a decay chain as a function of time, based on the decay rates and initial abundances. The model was formulated by Ernest Rutherford in 1905 and the analytical solution was provided by Harry Bateman in 1910.[10]/nFor his part, in 1910 Bateman published The Transformation of the Electrodynamical Equations.[11] He showed that the Jacobian matrix of a spacetime diffeomorphism which preserves the Maxwell equations is proportional to an orthogonal matrix, hence conformal. The transformation group of such transformations has 15 parameters and extends both the Poincar\u00e9 group and the Lorentz group. Bateman called the elements of this group spherical wave transformations.[12]/nIn evaluating this paper, one of his students, Clifford Truesdell, wrote:/nThe importance of Bateman's paper lies not in its specific details but in its general approach. Bateman, perhaps influenced by Hilbert's point of view in mathematical physics as a whole, was the first to see that the basic ideas of electromagnetism were equivalent to statements regarding integrals of differential forms, statements for which Grassmann's calculus of extension on differentiable manifolds, Poincar\u00e9's theories of Stokesian transformations and integral invariants, and Lie's theory of continuous groups could be fruitfully applied.[13]/nBateman was the first to apply Laplace transform to the integral equation in 1906. He submitted a detailed report on integral equations in 1911 to the British association for the advancement of science.[14] Horace Lamb in his 1910 paper[15] solved an integral equation/nas a double integral, but in his footnote he says, \"Mr. H. Bateman, to whom I submitted the question, has obtained a simpler solution in the form\"/nIn 1914, Bateman published The Mathematical Analysis of Electrical and Optical Wave-motion. As Murnaghan says, this book \"is unique and characteristic of the man. Into less than 160 small pages is crowded a wealth of information which would take an expert year to digest.\"[3]\nThe following year he published a textbook Differential Equations, and sometime later Partial differential equations of mathematical physics. Bateman is also author of Hydrodynamics and Numerical integration of differential equations. Bateman studied the Burgers' equation[16] long before Jan Burgers started to study./nHarry Bateman wrote two significant articles on the history of applied mathematics: \"The influence of tidal theory upon the development of mathematics\",[17] and \"Hamilton's work in dynamics and its influence on modern thought\".[18]/nIn his Mathematical Analysis of Electrical and Optical Wave-motion (p.\u00a0131), he describes the charged-corpuscle trajectory as follows:/na corpuscle has a kind of tube or thread attached to it. When the motion of the corpuscle changes a wave or kink runs along the thread; the energy radiated from the corpuscle spreads out in all directions but is concentrated round the thread so that the thread acts as a guiding wire./nThis figure of speech is not to be confused with a string in physics, for the universes in string theory have dimensions inflated beyond four, something not found in Bateman's work. Bateman went on to study the luminiferous aether with an article \"The structure of the Aether\".[19] His starting point is the bivector form of an electromagnetic field, \n\n\n\n\nE\n\n+\ni\n\nB\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {E} +i\\mathbf {B} }\n\n. He recalled Alfred-Marie Li\u00e9nard's electromagnetic fields, and then distinguished another type he calls \"aethereal fields\":/nWhen a large number of \"aethereal fields\" are superposed their singular curves indicate the structure of an \"aether\" which is capable of supporting a certain type of electromagnetic field./nBateman received many honours for his contributions, including election to the American Philosophical Society in 1924, election to the Royal Society of London in 1928, and election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1930.[20] He was elected as vice-president of the American Mathematical Society in 1935 and was the Society's Gibbs Lecturer for 1943.[3][21] He was on his way to New York to receive an award from the Institute of Aeronautical Science when he died of coronary thrombosis. The Harry Bateman Research Instructorships at the California Institute of Technology is named in his honour.[22]/nAfter his death, his notes on higher transcendental functions were edited by Arthur Erd\u00e9lyi, Wilhelm Magnus, Fritz Oberhettinger\u00a0[de], and Francesco G. Tricomi, and published in 1953.[23]/nIn a review of Bateman's book Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics, Richard Courant says that \"there is no other work which presents the analytical tools and the results achieved by means of them equally completely and with as many original contributions\" and also \"advanced students and research workers alike will read it with great benefit\".", "36444845": "Hjalmar Magnus Eklund (12 January 1880 in Turku \u2013 10 June 1937 in Pargas) was the first Finnish expert in mathematical logic and philosophy and also a pioneer in the Ido language./nEklund was born in Turku in 1880, the son of a sea captain.[1] He was very talented in many areas. He studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Helsinki, and graduated MA in 1903.[1] He focused on set theory, and became the first Finnish expert in logic, which was then a new area. In 1906, he worked at the linguistic department of the university where he became interested in languages./nFrom 1906 to 1918, Eklund worked as a teacher in different high schools in Turku and Pori. Around the same time he continued his studies and graduated with a master's degree in philosophy in 1911.

He joined the Society of Jesus in 1575 and for the Society he designed several buildings including the Cathedral in Baeza and San Hermenegildo Church in Seville.[1] He studied geometry and architecture with Juan de Herrera, the architect of Philip II of Spain. After ordination, he specialised in the exegesis of the Old Testament./nIn 1596, he published the first volume of Ezechielem Explanationes, or Commentary on Ezekiel[2] a work begun by Jer\u00f3nimo del Prado, who died the year prior. Villalpando was accused of heresy, but a review of his beliefs and writings by the Spanish Inquisition found him innocent. That same year he travelled to Rome where he published additional volumes in 1604. He died there on 22 May 1608.[3]/nVillalpando's major work as a scholar was a commentary on the prophet Ezekiel, published with the support of King Philip II. This text included imaginative reconstructions of Solomon's Temple and depictions of Jerusalem, which were renowned and influential. He based them on the vision of the prophet Ezekiel and published them in his Ezechielem Explanationes. They inspired many European illustrators and were circulated among the master builders of the 17th century./nHis drawings were based on the assumption that the buildings of Jerusalem were designed using the laws of geometry, and they were drawn in parallel or orthographic projection, which is a form of image Villalpando likened to God's vision.[4] Contradicting the theory developed by Vitruvius in De architectura, which sought to establish that the origins of the orders lay in the Architecture of ancient Greece, Villalpando argued that there was an original link between the classical orders and Solomon's Temple and that the classical orders had their origin in specifications detailed by God.[5]/nThe Inquisition's interest in Villalpando centered on his illustrations as possible misinterpretations of scripture. In the opinion of some art historians, Villalpando's illustrations of Solomon's temple influenced numerous monastery constructions of the baroque era, as well as on the grids schemes of urban planners.[6] Villalpando's imagery was used in the design of Protestant churches and synagogues in the 17th century.[7]/nVillalpando was a disciple of Juan de Herrera, architect of El Escorial, whose designs for that complex included quadratic inner courtyards and risalits.[8]/nCriticisms of Villalpando reconstruction of the Temple include: that the sub-structure of the Temple in his designs is exaggerated,[9][a] that his work lacks any archaeological basis or grounding in realism,[4] that he failed  to use Jewish sources apart from the Hebrew Bible such as the writings of Josephus, the Talmud, and the writings of Maimonides.[9]/nVillalpando also wrote theoretical tracts on gravity, geometry and architecture, occupying himself above all with conveying the geometrical principles of constructions.

A pioneer in experimental psychology and founder of psychophysics (techniques for measuring the mind), he inspired many 20th-century scientists and philosophers. He is also credited with demonstrating the non-linear relationship between psychological sensation and the physical intensity of a stimulus via the formula: \n\n\n\nS\n=\nK\nln\n\u2061\nI\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S=K\\ln I}\n\n, which became known as the Weber\u2013Fechner law.[2][3]/nFechner was born at Gro\u00df S\u00e4rchen, near Muskau, in Lower Lusatia, where his father, a maternal uncle, and his paternal grandfather were pastors. His mother, Johanna Dorothea Fechner (b. 1774), n\u00e9e Fischer, also came from a religious family. Despite these religious influences, Fechner became an atheist in later life.[4]/nFechner's father, Samuel Traugott Fischer Fechner (1765-1806) was free-thinking in many ways, for example by having his children be vaccinated, teaching them Latin, and being a passionate grower of fruit.[4] He died unexpectedly in 1806, leaving the family destitute.[5] Fechner had an elder brother, Eduard Clemens Fechner (1799-1861) and three younger sisters: Emilie, Clementine, and Mathilde. Fechner and his brother were then raised for a few years by his maternal uncle\u2014the pastor, before being reunited with his mother and sistes in Dresden.[4]/nFechner was educated first at Sorau (now \u017bary in Western Poland)./nIn 1817 Fechner studied medicine for six months at the Medizinische Akademie Carl Gustav Carus\u00a0[de] in Dresden and from 1818 at the University of Leipzig, the city in which he spent the rest of his life.[6] He earned his PhD from Leipzig in 1823.[7]/nIn 1834 he was appointed professor of physics at Leipzig. But in 1839, he injured his eyes in the research on afterimages by gazing at the Sun through colored glasses,[8] while studying the phenomena of color and vision, and, after much suffering, resigned. Subsequently, recovering, he turned to the study of the mind and its relations with the body, giving public lectures on the subjects dealt with in his books.[9] Whilst lying in bed, Fechner had an insight into the relationship between mental sensations and material sensations. This insight proved to be significant in the development of psychology as there was now a quantitative relationship between the mental and physical worlds.[10]/nFechner published chemical and physical papers, and translated chemical works by Jean-Baptiste Biot and Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard from French. He also wrote several poems and humorous pieces, such as the Vergleichende Anatomie der Engel (1825), written under the pseudonym of \"Dr. Mises.\"[9]/nFechner's epoch-making work was his Elemente der Psychophysik (1860). He started from the monistic thought that bodily facts and conscious facts, though not reducible one to the other, are different sides of one reality. His originality lies in trying to discover an exact mathematical relation between them. The most famous outcome of his inquiries is the law known as Fechner's Law, which may be expressed as follows:[9]/nThe law has been found to be immensely useful, but to fail for very faint and for very strong sensations. Within its useful range, Fechner's law is that sensation is a logarithmic function of physical intensity. S. S. Stevens pointed out that such a law does not account for the fact that perceived relationships among stimuli (e.g., papers coloured black, dark grey, grey, light grey, and white) are unchanged with changes in overall intensity (i.e., in the level of illumination of the papers). He proposed, in his famous 1961 paper entitled \"To Honor Fechner and Repeal His Law\", that intensity of stimulation is related to perception via a power-law./nFechner's general formula for getting at the number of units in any sensation is S =\u00a0c\u00a0log\u00a0R, where S stands for the sensation, R for the stimulus numerically estimated, and c for a constant that must be separately determined by experiment in each particular order of sensibility. Fechner's reasoning has been criticized on the grounds that although stimuli are composite, sensations are not. \"Every sensation,\" says William James, \"presents itself as an indivisible unit; and it is quite impossible to read any clear meaning into the notion that they are masses of units combined.\"[9]/nIn 1838, he also studied the still-mysterious perceptual illusion of what is still called the Fechner color effect, whereby colors are seen in a moving pattern of black and white. The English journalist and amateur scientist Charles Benham, in 1894, enabled English-speakers to learn of the effect through the invention of the spinning top that bears his name, Benham's top. Whether Fechner and Benham ever actually met face to face is not known./nIn his Vorschule der Aesthetik(1876) he used the method of extreme ranks for subjective judgements. Two years later he published a paper which developed the notion of the median and is generally credited with introducing the median into the formal analysis of data.[11] He later explored experimental aesthetics and attempted to determine the shapes and dimensions of aesthetically pleasing objects, using as a database the sizes of paintings.[12]/nIn 1871, Fechner reported the first empirical survey of coloured letter photisms among 73 synesthetes.[13][14] His work was followed in the 1880s by that of Francis Galton.[15][16][17]/nOne of Fechner's speculations about consciousness dealt with brain. During his time, it was known that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical and that there is a deep division between the two halves that are linked by a connecting band of fibers called the corpus callosum. Fechner speculated that if the corpus callosum were split, two separate streams of consciousness would result - the mind would become two. Yet, Fechner believed that his theory would never be tested; he was incorrect. During the mid-twentieth century, Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga worked on epileptic patients with sectioned corpus callosum and observed that Fechner's idea was correct.[18]/nFechner constructed ten rectangles with different ratios of width to length and asked numerous observers to choose the \"best\" and \"worst\" rectangle shape. He was concerned with the visual appeal of rectangles with different proportions. Participants were explicitly instructed to disregard any associations that they have with the rectangles, e.g. with objects of similar ratios. The rectangles chosen as \"best\" by the largest number of participants and as \"worst\" by the fewest participants had a ratio of 0.62 (21:34).[19] This ratio is known as the \"golden section\" (or golden ratio) and referred to the ratio of a rectangle's width to length that is most appealing to the eye. Carl Stumpf was a participant in this study./nHowever, there has been some ongoing dispute on the experiment itself, as the fact that Fechner deliberately discarded results of the study ill-fitting to his needs became known, with many mathematicians, including Mario Livio, refuting the result of the experiment.[20]/nIn his posthumously published Kollektivmasslehre (1897), Fechner introduced the Zweiseitige Gauss'sche Gesetz or two-piece normal distribution, to accommodate the asymmetries he had observed in empirical frequency distributions in many fields. The distribution has been independently rediscovered by several authors working in different fields.[21]/nIn 1861, Fechner reported that if he looked at a light with a darkened piece of glass over one eye then closed that eye, the light appeared to become brighter, even though less light was coming into his eyes.[22] This phenomenon has come to be called Fechner's paradox.[23] It has been the subject of numerous research papers, including in the 2000s.[24] It occurs because the perceived brightness of the light with both eyes open is similar to the average brightness of each light viewed with one eye.[22]/nFechner, along with Wilhelm Wundt and Hermann von Helmholtz, is recognized as one of the founders of modern experimental psychology. His clearest contribution was the demonstration that because the mind was susceptible to measurement and mathematical treatment, psychology had the potential to become a quantified science. Theorists such as Immanuel Kant had long stated that this was impossible, and that therefore, a science of psychology was also impossible./nThough he had a vast influence on psychophysics, the actual disciples of his general philosophy were few. Ernst Mach was inspired by his work on psychophysics.[25] William James also admired his work: in 1904, he wrote an admiring introduction to the English translation of Fechner's B\u00fcchlein vom Leben nach dem Tode (Little Book of Life After Death)./nFurthermore, he influenced Sigmund Freud, who refers to Fechner when introducing the concept of psychic locality in his The Interpretation of Dreams that he illustrates with the microscope-metaphor.[26][27][28]/nFechner's world concept was highly animistic. He felt the thrill of life everywhere, in plants, earth, stars, the total universe. Fechner was a panpsychist; he viewed the entire universe as being inwardly alive and consciously animated, instead of being dead \u201cstuff\u201d as accepted by most of his contemporary colleagues, who had become devotees to what was becoming known as material science. Yet he based his panpsychism on a well thought out description of consciousness as waves. He believed that human beings stand midway between the souls of plants and the souls of stars, who are angels.[29] God, the soul of the universe, must be conceived as having an existence analogous to human beings. Natural laws are just the modes of the unfolding of God's perfection. In his last work Fechner, aged but full of hope, contrasts this joyous \"daylight view\" of the world with the dead, dreary \"night view\" of materialism. Fechner's work in aesthetics is also important. He conducted experiments to show that certain abstract forms and proportions are naturally pleasing to our senses, and gave some new illustrations of the working of aesthetic association.[9] Charles Hartshorne saw him as a predecessor on his and Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy and regretted that Fechner's philosophical work had been neglected for so long.[30]/nFechner's position in reference to predecessors and contemporaries is not very sharply defined. He was remotely a disciple of Schelling,[9] learned much from Baruch Spinoza, G. W. Leibniz, Johann Friedrich Herbart, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Christian Hermann Weisse, and decidedly rejected G. W. F. Hegel and the monadism of Rudolf Hermann Lotze./nFechner's work continues to have an influence on modern science, inspiring continued exploration of human perceptual abilities by researchers such as Jan Koenderink, Farley Norman, David Heeger, and others./nIn 1970, the International Astronomical Union named the Fechner crater on the far side of the Moon after Fechner.[31]/nIn 1985 the International Society for Psychophysics called its annual conference Fechner Day. The conference is now scheduled to include 22 October to allow psychophysicists to celebrate the anniversary of Fechner's waking up on that day in 1850 with a new approach into how to study the mind.[32] Fechner Day runs annually with the 2021 Fechner Day being the 37th.[33] It is organized annually, by a different academic host each year.[34][35][36]  During the pandemic resulting from COVID-19, Fechner Day was held online in 2020 and 2021./nLittle is known of Fechner's later years, nor of the circumstances, cause, and manner of his death./nFechner was the brother of painter Eduard Clemens Fechner and of Clementine Wieck Fechner, who was the stepmother of Clara Wieck when Clementine became her father Friedrich Wieck's second wife.[citation needed]", "39394032": "Frederik van der Blij (13 May 1923, Leiden \u2013 27 January 2018,[1] Heino, Netherlands) was a Dutch mathematician.

She was an activist for women's right to vote, and for other women's causes. She was the second woman to plead a case before the House of Lords, and was one of the founders of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom./nIn the first year of World War I, Macmillan spoke for the peace-seeking women of the United Kingdom at the International Congress of Women, a women's congress convened at The Hague.  The Congress elected five delegates to take their message to political leaders in Europe and the United States. She travelled to the neutral states of Northern Europe and Russia before meeting up with other delegates in the U.S.  She met with world leaders such as President Woodrow Wilson, whose countries were still neutral, to present the proposals formulated at The Hague. Wilson subsequently used these proposals as some of his Fourteen Points, his justification for making war to forge a lasting peace. At war's end, Macmillan helped to organise the second women's congress in Zurich and was one of the delegates elected to take the resolutions passed at the congress to the political leaders meeting in Paris to formulate the Versailles Peace Treaty. She supported the founding of the League of Nations. Macmillan tried but did not succeed in getting the League to establish nationality for women independent of the nationality of their husbands./nJessie Chrystal Macmillan was born on 13 June 1872 to Jessie Chrystal (n\u00e9e) Finlayson and John Macmillan,[1] a tea merchant working for Melrose & Co in Leith. The family lived at 8 Duke Street (Dublin Street as of 1922) in Edinburgh's New Town.[2]/nMacmillan was the only daughter among her parents' eight sons. After an early education in Edinburgh she boarded at St Leonards School in St Andrews on the east coast of Scotland.[3] In October 1892 Macmillan was among the first female students to enrol at the university, she was however not the first to graduate as others were either more advanced in their studies or taking higher degrees. Macmillan studied science subjects including Honours Mathematics with George Chrystal, Astronomy with Ralph Copeland, and Natural Philosophy with Peter Guthrie Tait and Cargill Gilston Knott. In April 1896 she graduated with a BSc with first-class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, the first woman at the university to do so.[4]/nIn the summer of 1896 she went to Berlin for further university study, then returned to Edinburgh and passed an examination in Greek language to enter the Faculty of Arts in October 1896. She studied a number of social subjects including politics, and graduated in April 1900. Macmillan was the first woman to earn First-class honours from Edinburgh in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, also earning Second-class honours in Moral Philosophy and Logic. During this time she was a member of the Edinburgh Ladies' Debating Society, a forum which helped her gain confidence arguing in the face of opposition. She also joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in May 1897, the second woman member after Flora Philip in 1896.[4]/nMacmillan was active in the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage (ENSWS). In 1897, two women's groups in Great Britain united to become the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), of whom Macmillan, along with Louisa Stevenson, served as executive committee members from Edinburgh.[5] She was known as Chrystal Macmillan\u2014she did not use the name Jessie, her mother's first name and her own birth name.[4]/nAs graduates, Macmillan and four other women were full members of the General Council of Edinburgh University, but they were denied the opportunity to vote in February 1906 to determine the Member of Parliament who would represent the university seat. Macmillan argued that the wording of the General Council's voting statutes used the word persons throughout, and that she and the other female graduates were indeed persons.[6] In March, Macmillan wrote to Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy to ask for aid, as Elmy was the author of the pamphlet The Enfranchisement of Women. Macmillan told Elmy \"I formed my beliefs on your pamphlet.\"[6] Elmy recommended she contact Charlotte Carmichael Stopes for additional useful arguments. Macmillan brought the case before the University Courts in 1907 but lost, and lost a subsequent appeal. Scottish suffragists banded together to raise the \u00a31000 required to present a case to the House of Lords. They hoped to raise awareness in Great Britain of the absurdity and injustice of denying the vote to educated women such as themselves.[6]/nIn November 1908, Macmillan appeared in London to argue, as a university graduate, for her right to vote for Scottish University seats. During her speech, the buildings of Parliament were made to suspend the temporary arrangements put in place to prevent women from entering\u2014such arrangements had been instituted after the first militant suffrage agitations.[7] Macmillan was the first woman to argue a case before the bar of the House of Lords.[8] She was backed by her contemporary, Frances Simson, one of the first eight female graduates of Edinburgh. Given audience late in the day, Macmillan spoke for three-quarters of an hour. Press reports of the appearance described her as a \"modern Portia,\" Shakespeare's fictional heiress and legal dilettante. In Scotland, Glasgow's The Herald reported that she began nervously but warmed to her subject and \"argued law in an admirable speaking voice\".[4] Two days later she continued to plead her case, this time in \"complete self-possession\", wearing a dark red outfit and hat trimmed with ermine furs.[4] Like other suffragists in Britain and the United States, she based her case on the words person and persons in the voting statutes, arguing that such unspecific words were no basis for the exclusion of one entire sex from voting.[8] The court upheld both lower courts' decisions that the word persons did not include women when referring to privileges granted by the state. She lost the case, but The New York Times reported that she responded to the decision against her with the words \"We'll live to fight another day\".[9] In Wellington, New Zealand, the Evening Post wrote a less strident account, noting that Macmillan was cheerful in defeat. After the court adjourned, she said to a reporter from the London Daily Chronicle, \"I don't suppose that there is anything more to be done just now, but we shall live to fight another day.\"[10] No matter her exact words, her time at the House of Lords attracted worldwide publicity which proved valuable to the women's cause.[8]/nMacmillan spoke at many suffrage meetings during this period; for example, in 1909, she was a speaker at an NUWSS meeting along with Dr Elsie Inglis and Alice Low in Edinburgh's Caf\u00e9 Oak Hall. A guest speaker was J A Scott from New Zealand, where women already had the right to vote.[11][12]/nIn 1911, Macmillan attended the sixth congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in Stockholm. There, she embarked upon a long-term project, in cooperation with Marie Stritt, president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, and Maria V\u00e9rone, president of the French League for Women's Rights, to document women's voting conditions around the world. In May 1913, after two years of correspondence with widely separated women's rights activists to gather global information, the women completed Woman Suffrage in Practice, 1913, a book to which Carrie Chapman Catt added a foreword. Published in conjunction with the NUWSS and the National American Woman Suffrage Association, the book described current women's voting practices in 35 countries and empires, with the authors dividing the work by country. Macmillan was responsible for writing about the UK, the US, New Zealand, Australia, India, China, South Africa and five smaller countries. Macmillan noticed that in few countries and empires were women excluded specifically by statute\u2014they were instead kept from voting by custom alone. She wrote from both personal experience and outside observation of women's activists: \"as soon as they become alive to this fact, they have tested the legality of their exclusion in the law courts.\"[13] In 1913, Macmillan attended the seventh IWSA congress in Budapest, and began to serve the IWSA as vice president, a position she would hold for ten years.[8] In 1914, she authored a 30-page booklet entitled Facts versus fancies on woman suffrage published by the NUWSS./nWhen World War I began, Macmillan looked for peace activism on the part of NUWSS. Instead, she found a majority of British women were in favour of helping the men win the war.[14] Her pacifism was not at all passive\u2014soon after hostilities broke out, she travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy. By late October 1914 she was providing food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp. Macmillan signed the Open Christmas Letter, a peace-seeking exchange between women of warring nations, in late 1914.[15]/nElsewhere in the world, pacifist women were forced to adjust to the realities of war. After \"the guns of August\", Rosika Schwimmer, a native of Austria-Hungary working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations.[16] In September 1914, Stritt wrote to Catt in America with \"deep personal regret\" for the \"terrible war\".[15] The pacifist women of Germany were forced by war to withdraw their invitation to host the annual IWSA congress which was to have been held nine months later in Berlin.[15] In December 1914, Canadian Julia Grace Wales, a professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, published her views about working toward a mediated peace in a pamphlet entitled \"Continuous Mediation Without Armistice\", popularly known as the Wisconsin Plan.[17] Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, rather than holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in The Hague for four days beginning 28 April 1915.[16]/nWhen this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Millicent Fawcett who were devoted to war work and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded.[14] They rejected a resolution favored by internationalists Helen Bright Clark and Margaret Bondfield[18] which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague.[19] Because of this, women such as Margaret Ashton,[20] Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague, some 180 women in total.[21] Macmillan was the only internationalist executive of NUWSS who did not resign; she was away performing relief work.[22] Volunteering near The Hague, Macmillan prepared to join the ex-NUWSS members after the group crossed the English Channel./nAt The Hague 28 April to 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals.[23] The event was called the International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. The 180-strong contingent of British women was greatly reduced by Winston Churchill's purposeful cancellation of British ferry service across the Channel, stranding most of the British activists.[21] Already in Antwerp, Macmillan easily attended the women's conference to speak for the UK\u2014she was one of only three British women present.[4] Macmillan was selected as a member of the international committee who were to travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world,[17] and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with it. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.[23]/nAfter the war, Macmillan went to Z\u00fcrich in May 1919 as a delegate to the International Congress of Women. The Congress strongly condemned the harsh surrender terms that were being planned for Germany in the Treaty of Versailles to be signed the next month. Macmillan carried this written condemnation to the ongoing Paris Peace Conference, but no changes were made to the treaty.[4]/nBy early 1918, British women who had attained the age of 30 were given the right to vote and hold office. Following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, which enabled women to become members of the legal profession, Macmillan applied to Middle Temple as a pupil barrister.[4] She was called to the bar on 28 January 1924 and in 1926 joined the Western Circuit, becoming only the second women to be elected to its Bar Mess. Between then and 1929 she acted as counsel for defence in the six cases in which she appeared on the Circuit, and she took 65 cases in the North London Session courts between 1927 and 1936. From 1929, she appeared at the Central Criminal Court in five cases for the prosecution, and one for defence [court books]. There are no records available for her civil cases.[citation needed] As she was studying for the bar, she co-founded the Open Door Council for the repeal of legal restraints on women. Macmillan worked to lift restrictions and so give women of all stations an equal opportunity in the workplace.[8] NUWSS was re-organised in 1918 as the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, but Macmillan disagreed with the group's stance on protective legislation for women workers. In 1929, she co-founded a global group, the Open Door International for the Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker\u2014she served as president of this group until her death.[8]/nAt the 1935 general election, Macmillan unsuccessfully stood for election as the Liberal candidate in Edinburgh North. She came third, with less than 6% of the votes./nIn the same period, she worked to stem the traffic in females used as sexual slaves. To that end, she worked with Alison Roberta Noble Neilans' Association for Moral and Social Hygiene.[8] Feminist writer Cicely Hamilton wrote of Macmillan that \"she was the right kind of lawyer, one who held that Law should be synonymous with Justice\u00a0... Her chief aim in life\u2014one might call it her passion\u2014was to give every woman of every class and nation the essential protection of justice. She was, herself, a great and very just human being\u00a0... She could not budge an inch on matters of principle but she never lost her temper and never bore a grudge in defeat.\"[4]/nIn 1917, Macmillan spoke out against the practice of assigning a woman's national citizenship depending on whom she married. From 1905, this had been the vocal position of Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, known as Lady Aberdeen, but Macmillan saw the issue in a new light during the war. Women who were married to foreigners were, upon declaration of war, faced suddenly with status as enemy nationals within the land of their birth. From the same legal basis, a number of British women were enjoying full citizenship in enemy territories.[25] Macmillan was in favour of women having the right to independent nationality with the same right to retain or change as men.  To that end, she wrote a piece entitled \"The Nationality of Married Women\" that was published twice in Jus Suffragii, once in July 1917 and again with updated statistics in June 1918. However, no new laws were passed about it, and a woman's citizenship remained tied to that of her husband./nThe subject came up again in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong contingent of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six of the most influential international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality.[25] The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, and on the other side were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands, and children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.[25]/nIn 1937, Macmillan's health was failing and in June of that year she had a leg amputated. On 21 September she died of heart disease, at home in bed at 8 Chalmers Crescent, Edinburgh. On 23 September her body was cremated.[26] Her remains were buried with her parents in Corstorphine churchyard in the west of the city. The grave is marked by a substantial granite cross just north of the church./nIn her will, she specified bequests to the Open Door International for the Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker, and to the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene.[4]/nA memorial stained glass window was added in Old Corstorphine Church soon after her death. It is on the south side of the church towards the south-east corner./nThe Chrystal Macmillan Prize is a \u00a3100 award given \"at the discretion of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee\" of the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple in London, a professional group of attorneys.[27] The prize was founded as an annual grant to benefit female law students scoring the highest in the bar's final examination, and to support societies with which Macmillan was associated.[4]/nHer alma mater, the University of Edinburgh, has honoured Macmillan in several ways. The university's Chrystal Macmillan Building at the north-west corner of George Square is named in her honour, one of only two University buildings named after women.[28] Since 2008, it houses the majority of the School of Social and Political Science.[29]/nA Millennial Plaque honouring Macmillan is placed at the King's Buildings, a science campus at the university. The plaque notes that she was a \"suffragist, founder of Women's International League for Peace and Freedom\", as well as the being the \"first woman science graduate of the University\" in acknowledgment of her achievement in 1896.[4]/nIn 2021, the university's School of Social and Political Science instituted the Chrystal Macmillan PhD Studentship, to be awarded to PhD students studying fields relevant to Chrystal Macmillan, including social justice, gender and equality, human rights, and conflict resolution.[30]/nIn 1957, the United Nations established independent nationality for each married person, a ruling Macmillan had worked toward without success in her lifetime.[25]/nHer name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.[31][32][33]", "3775233": "Paul Scriptoris (c. 1460 \u2013 21 October 1505) was a German Franciscan mathematician, Scotist, and professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.

For the Icelandic Literary Society, he surveyed the country from 1831 to 1843. The results of his work were published in a topographic map of Iceland at a scale of 1:480,000 on four sheets.[2] It was the first complete map of Iceland and, although generally dated to 1844, was not completed until 1848. It was published under the direction of Olaf Nikolas Olsen in Copenhagen. In 1849, a smaller edition on one sheet at a scale of 1:960,000 appeared. For his survey work, Bj\u00f6rn received the Order of the Dannebrog in 1846 and the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1859.[3]/nBj\u00f6rn was born at Tannsta\u00f0ir, a remote farm on the Hr\u00fatafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in H\u00fanavatnss\u00fdsla in north-western Iceland. Although the family was poor, they sent him to school to the local priests, who recognized his intellectual abilities. In 1808, Bj\u00f6rn passed an exam in Reykjav\u00edk, obtaining a recommendation from the bishop for studying at the University of Copenhagen. But these plans were delayed by the Gunboat War between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom. Only after the end of the Napoleonic Wars could Bj\u00f6rn travel to Denmark and enrolled in 1817 at the University of Copenhagen, where he studied theology and mathematics.[1] During his studies, he won the university's gold medal for mathematics twice.[4]/nIn 1822, a new post for a school teacher in Danish, mathematics, and history opened at the school of Bessasta\u00f0ir[c] in Iceland and was offered to Bj\u00f6rn. He abandoned his theologic studies and accepted the post, returning to Iceland and taking up his duties as a school teacher on 14 May 1822.[5] When the school was moved to Reykjav\u00edk in 1846, Bj\u00f6rn followed. Five years later he was appointed chief assistant (Yfirkennari) to the rector. He retired in 1862.[1]/nBj\u00f6rn Gunnlaugsson was married twice; first to Ragnhei\u00f0ur Bjarnad\u00f3ttir (died 1834), after her death he married in 1836[6] Gu\u00f0laug Arad\u00f3ttir (died 1873).[1][4]/nBj\u00f6rn was an exceptional figure in early 19th-century Iceland. The abstract thoughts of this gentle learned man were beyond the grasp of most of his compatriots, who regarded him as an eccentric with few of the practical skills they so highly valued.[7] Yet the simple folk also felt a certain kind of respectful awe towards this scholar.[8]/nBj\u00f6rn knew the inclination towards the practical of his fellow countrymen well. When he returned to Iceland as a school teacher for mathematics, the curriculum at the grammar school at Bessasta\u00f0ir covered barely more than the four basic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.[9] In his inauguration speech at the school, he emphasized the practical applications of mathematics.[10] He tried to take mathematics education to a higher level,[11] but failed ultimately as his treatment of the subject was often too abstract for his pupils and he was, according to Benedikz, \"not capable of handling a class of mathematical ignoramuses\".[12]/nThe only studied mathematician in Iceland in the 19th century, Bj\u00f6rn was isolated from the academic community in Europe, and the intellectual environment made him turn to didactics and the applications of mathematics, and also to philosophy.[10]/nIn August 1829, Bj\u00f6rn, who had done in the early 1820s cartographic work under the direction of Heinrich Christian Schumacher at Altona,[4] proposed to the Danish government to undertake a land survey of Iceland, and asked for the instruments used by the Danish Navy in their earlier coastal surveys to be sent to Iceland. His request was ignored at first. In 1831, the Literary Society of Iceland decided to sponsor him and helped him obtain the necessary instruments. From 1831 to 1843, Bj\u00f6rn spent the summers surveying the country together with one assistant, and in the winters he would draw the maps. He did not lay a new baseline but started from the earlier coastal surveys the Danish Navy had undertaken in the period of 1774 to 1818,[14] extending the triangulation inland. The Literary Society supported him with a yearly grant, and so did the Danish government from 1836 to 1846.[15]/nBj\u00f6rn's hand-drawn maps were sent to Copenhagen for preparing the publication. Olaf Nikolas Olsen had been appointed as the director of publication; he proposed to publish the map on four sheets, and he probably also defined the scale of 1:480,000 and the conical projection used. The map was published under Olsen's name, with the Literary Society of Iceland as the publisher, and paid by the Danish treasury. The title page was in Danish and French. Although dated 1844, it was probably not completed until 1848. In 1849, a smaller version of the map on one sheet at a scale of 1:960,000 was published.[15]/nBj\u00f6rn's survey formed the basis of many subsequent maps of Iceland for the next hundred years; new maps based on new surveys appeared only after World War II.[15] It was an immense work, and Bj\u00f6rn realized soon enough that one man alone would not be able to triangulate the whole island in his lifetime, and focused his attention on the inhabited areas. Yet he managed to survey a good part of the wilderness, too, even if he had to rely on the accounts of the local population in some remote areas. Bj\u00f6rn was well aware of the inaccuracies in some regions; already in 1834, he wrote that one \"should neither have too high or too low expectations of the map, nor trust too greatly nor too little in its usefulness or accuracy\".[16] The central highlands were sketchy on his map; they were mapped properly for the first time by \u00deorvaldur Thoroddsen, whose map was printed in 1901. Still, Bj\u00f6rn's survey is considered a great advancement, especially given the limited resources he had at his disposition.[15] In recognition of his outstanding survey work Bj\u00f6rn Gunnlaugsson was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1846 and also received the Knight's cross of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur.[17] The map was also exhibited at the World's fair at Paris in 1878, where it was awarded a prize.[18]/nNj\u00f3la is a long didactic theological-philosophical poem Bj\u00f6rn wrote mostly during his survey travels when the weather did not permit him to work or in the evenings. It was published originally in the annual report of 1842 of the Bessasta\u00f0ir school, and then in 1853 with some minor revisions and again in 1884 in Reykjav\u00edk.[14] The poem begins by describing a night view of the skies, and then introduces the reader to astronomic distances, explaining how long a cannonball shot from the sun would take to reach each of the planets\u2014and then the next star.[19] In later stanzas, he describes the birth of the universe, covers Newton's laws and explains gravity.[20] He interweaves such physics and mathematics framed as poetry with theological and philosophical musings about the purpose of the universe, the nature of good and evil, and God's intent.[21]/nTowards the end of his teaching career, Bj\u00f6rn wrote down the mathematics he would have liked to teach in the T\u00f6lv\u00edsi, a mathematical textbook unprecedented in Iceland, both in its breadth and depth, but also in the rigour of its proofs.[22] Moreover, it was written in Icelandic; in an attempt to make mathematics more accessible to his fellow countrymen, Bj\u00f6rn even tried to find Icelandic names for mathematical concepts that hitherto had only been named using Danish or Latin words. But the work was largely ignored, and Bj\u00f6rn's Icelandic terms never caught on.[23] Begun in 1856,[24] volume 1 was published in Reykjav\u00edk in 1865 by E. \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson,[25] but its second part was still unpublished in 2003 and existed only as an unpublished manuscript at the National and University Library of Iceland.[26] Gunnlaugsson's first biographers, Melste\u00f0 and Jensson, wrote that it was \"a book praised by all but read by extremely few\".[27]", "858914": "Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn J\u0101bir ibn Sin\u0101n al-Raqq\u012b al-\u1e24arr\u0101n\u012b a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101bi\u02be al-Batt\u0101n\u012b[n 1] (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a), usually called al-Batt\u0101n\u012b, a name that was in the past Latinized as Albategnius,[n 2] (before 858\u00a0\u2013 929) was an astronomer, astrologer and mathematician, who lived and worked for most of his life at Raqqa, now in Syria. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous of the astronomers of the medieval Islamic world./nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's writings became instrumental in the development of science and astronomy in the west. His Kit\u0101b az-Z\u012bj a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101bi\u2019 (c.\u2009900), is the earliest extant z\u012bj (astronomical table) made in the Ptolemaic tradition that is hardly influenced by Hindu or Sasanian astronomy. Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b refined and corrected Ptolemy's Almagest, but also included new ideas and astronomical tables of his own. A handwritten Latin version by the Italian astronomer Plato Tiburtinus was produced between 1134 and 1138, through which medieval astronomers became familiar with al-Batt\u0101n\u012b. In 1537, a Latin translation of the z\u012bj was printed in Nuremberg. An annotated version, also in Latin, published in three separate volumes between 1899 and 1907 by the Italian Orientalist Carlo Alfonso Nallino, provided the foundation of the modern study of medieval Islamic astronomy./nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observations of the Sun led him to understand the nature of annular solar eclipses. He accurately calculated the Earth's obliquity (the angle between the planes of the equator and the ecliptic), the solar year, and the equinoxes (obtaining a value for the precession of the equinoxes of one degree in 66 years). The accuracy of his data encouraged Nicolaus Copernicus to pursue ideas about the heliocentric nature of the cosmos. Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's tables were used by the German mathematician Christopher Clavius in reforming the Julian calendar, and the astronomers Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei and Edmund Halley all used Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observations./nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b introduced the use of sines and tangents in geometrical calculations, replacing the geometrical methods of the Greeks. Using trigonometry, he created an equation for finding the qibla (the direction which Muslims need to face during their prayers). His equation was widely used until superseded by more accurate methods, introduced a century later by the polymath al-Biruni./nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b, whose full name was Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn J\u0101bir ibn Sin\u0101n al-Raqq\u012b al-\u1e24arr\u0101n\u012b al-\u1e62\u0101bi\u02be al-Batt\u0101n\u012b, and whose Latinized name was Albategnius, was born before 858 in Harran in Bil\u0101d ash-Sh\u0101m (Islamic Syria), 44 kilometres (27\u00a0mi) southeast of the modern Turkish city of Urfa. He was the son of Jabir ibn Sinan al-Harrani, a maker of astronomical instruments.[3] The epithet al-\u1e62abi\u2019 suggests that his family belonged to the pagan Sabian sect of Harran,[4][5] whose religion featured star worship, and who had inherited the Mesopotamian legacy of an interest in mathematics and astronomy.[2][n 3] His contemporary, the polymath Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra, was also an adherent of Sabianism, which died out during the 11th century.[7]/nAlthough his ancestors were likely Sabians, al-Batt\u0101n\u012b was a Muslim, as shown by his first name.[5] Between 877 and 918/19 he lived in Raqqa, now in north central Syria, which was an ancient Roman settlement beside the Euphrates, near Harran. During this period he also lived in Antioch,[3] where he observed a solar and a lunar eclipse in 901. According to the Arab biographer Ibn al-Nad\u012bm, the financial problems encountered by al-Batt\u0101n\u012b in old age forced him to move from Raqqa to Baghdad.[8]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b died in 929 at Qasr al-Jiss,[2] near Samarra, after returning from Baghdad where he had resolved an unfair taxation grievance on behalf of a clan from Raqqa.[9]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b is considered to be the greatest[10][11][12] and most famous of the known astronomers of the medieval Islamic world. He made more accurate observations of the night sky than any of his contemporaries,[3] and was the first of a generation of new Islamic astronomers that followed the founding of the House of Wisdom in the 8th century.[13] His meticulously described methods allowed others to assess his results, but some of his explanations about the movements of the planets were poorly written, and have mistakes.[14]/nSometimes referred to as the \"Ptolemy of the Arabs\",[15] al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's works reveal him to have been a devout believer in Ptolemy's geocentric model of the cosmos. He refined the observations found in Ptolemy's Almagest,[3] and compiled new tables of the Sun and the Moon, previously long accepted as authoritative.[5] Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b established his own observatory at Raqqa. He recommended that the astronomical instruments there were greater than one metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in size.[8] Such instruments, being larger\u2014and so having scales capable of measuring smaller values\u2014were capable of greater precision than had previously been achieved.[16] Some of his measurements were more accurate than those taken by the Polish astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus during the Renaissance. One reason for this is thought to be that al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's location for his observations at Raqqa was closer to the Earth's equator, so that the ecliptic and the Sun, being higher in the sky, were less susceptible to atmospheric refraction.[5] The careful construction and alignment of his astronomical instruments enabled him to achieve an accuracy of observations of equinoxes and solstices that had previously been unknown.[8]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b was one of the first astronomers to observe that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies during the year, which led him to understand the reason why annular solar eclipses occur.[3][17][18] He saw that the position in the sky at which the angular diameter of the Sun appeared smallest was no longer located where Ptolemy had stated it should be,[3] and that since Ptolemy's time, the longitudinal position of the apogee had increased by 16\u00b047'.[12]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b was an excellent observer.[19] He improved Ptolemy's measurement of the obliquity of the ecliptic (the angle between the planes of the equator and the ecliptic),[9] producing a value of 23\u00b0 35';[5][n 4] the accepted value is around 23\u00b0.44.[20] Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b obtained the criterion for observation of the lunar crescent\u2014i.e., if the longitude difference between the Moon and the Sun is greater than 13\u00b0 66\u02dd and the Moon's delay after sunset is more than 43.2 minutes, the crescent will be visible.[2] His value for the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and 24 seconds, is 2 minutes and 22 seconds from the accepted value.[5]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b observed changes in the direction of the Sun's apogee, as recorded by Ptolemy,[21] and that as a result, the equation of time was subject to a slow cyclical variation.[22] His careful measurements of when the March and September equinoxes took place allowed him to obtain a value for the precession of the equinoxes of 54.5\" per year, or 1 degree in 66 years,[5][9] a phenomenon that he realised was altering the Sun's annual apparent motion through the zodiac constellations.[23]/nIt was impossible for al-Batt\u0101n\u012b, who adhered to the ideas of a stationary Earth and geocentricism, to understand the underlying scientific reasons for his observations or the importance of his discoveries.[23]/nOne of al-Battani's greatest contributions was his introduction of the use of sines and tangents in geometrical calculations, especially spherical trigonometric functions, to replace Ptolemy's geometrical methods. Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's methods involved some of the most complex mathematics developed up to that time.[23] He was aware of the superiority of trigonometry over geometrical chords, and demonstrated awareness of a relation between the sides and angles of a spherical triangle, now given by the expression:[12]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b produced a number of trigonometrical relationships:[24]/nHe also solved the equation/ndiscovering the formula/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b used the Iranian astronomer Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi's idea of tangents to develop equations for calculating and compiling tables of both tangents and cotangents. He discovered their reciprocal functions, the secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, which he referred to as a \"table of shadows\", in reference to the shadow produced on a sundial.[24]/nUsing these trigonometrical relationships, al-Batt\u0101n\u012b created an equation for finding the qibla, which Muslims face in each of the five prayers they practice every day.[26] The equation he created did not give accurate directions, as it did not take into account the fact that Earth is a sphere. The relationship he used was precise enough only for a person located in (or close to) Mecca, but was still a widely used method at the time. Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's equation for \n\n\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q}\n\n, the angle of the direction of a place towards Mecca is given by:[25]/ntan\n\u2061\nq\n=\n\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\u0394\n\u03bb\n\n\nsin\n\u2061\n\u0394\n\u03d5\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\tan q={\\frac {\\sin \\Delta \\lambda }{\\sin \\Delta \\phi }}}/nwhere \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03bb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\lambda }\n\n is the difference between the longitude of the place and Mecca, and \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\phi }\n\n is the difference between the latitude of the place and Mecca./nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's equation was superseded a century after it was first used, when the polymath al-Biruni summarized several other methods to produce results that were more accurate than those that could be obtained using al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's equation.[27]/nA small work on trigonometry, Tajr\u012bd u\u1e63\u016bl tark\u012bb al\u2010juy\u016bb (\"Summary of the principles for establishing sines\") is known.

The manuscript is extant in Istanbul as MS Carullah 1499/3.

Incomplete copies exist in other western European libraries.[8] Much of the book consists of instructions for using the attached tables. Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b used an Arabic translation of the\u00a0Almagest\u00a0made from Syriac, and used few foreign terms. He copied some data directly from Ptolemy's Handy Tables, but also produced his own. His star table of 880 used around half the stars found in the then 743-year-old\u00a0Almagest. It was made by increasing Ptolemy's stellar longitudes, to allow for the different positions of the stars, now known to be caused by precession.[8]/nOther z\u012bjes based on\u00a0Kit\u0101b az-Z\u012bj a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101bi\u2019 include\u00a0those written by Kushyar Gilani, Al\u012b ibn Ahmad al-Nasaw\u012b, Ab\u016b Rash\u012bd D\u0101nesh\u012b, and Ibn al-Kammad.[2]/nThe first version in Latin from the Arabic was made by the English astronomer Robert of Ketton; this version is now lost.[2][22] A Latin edition was also produced by the Italian astronomer Plato Tiburtinus between 1134 and 1138.[29] Medieval astronomers became quite familiar with al-Batt\u0101n\u012b through this translation, renamed De motu stellarum (\"On stellar motion\").[9] It was also translated from Arabic into Spanish during the 13th century, under the orders of Alphonso X of Castile; a part of the manuscript is extant.[22]/nThe\u00a0z\u012bj\u00a0appears to have been widely used until the early 12th century. One 11th-century z\u012bj, now lost, was compiled by al-Nasaw\u012b. That it was based on al-Batt\u0101n\u012b can be inferred from the matching values for the longitudes of the solar and planetary apogees. Al-Nasaw\u012b had as a young man written astronomical tables using data obtained from al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's\u00a0z\u012bj, but then discovered the data he used had been superseded by more accurately made calculations.[30]/nThe invention of movable type in 1436 made it possible for astronomical works to be circulated more widely, and a Latin translation of the Kit\u0101b az-Z\u012bj a\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101bi\u2019 was printed in Nuremberg in 1537 by the astronomer Regiomontanus, which enabled Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observations to become accessible at the start of the scientific revolution in astronomy.[9][29] The z\u012bj was reprinted in Bologna in 1645;[29] the original document is preserved at the Vatican Library in Rome.[31]/nThe Latin translations, including the printed edition of 1537, made the z\u012bj influential in the development of European astronomy.[19] A chapter of the \u1e62\u0101bi\u02be Z\u012bj also appeared as a separate work, Kit\u0101b Ta\u1e25q\u012bq aqd\u0101r al\u2010itti\u1e63\u0101l\u0101t [bi\u2010\u1e25asab \u02bfur\u016b\u1e0d al\u2010kaw\u0101kib] (\"On the accurate determination of the quantities of conjunctions [according to the latitudes of the planets]\").[8]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's work was published in three volumes, in 1899, 1903, and 1907, by the Italian Orientalist Carlo Alfonso Nallino,[2] who gave it the title Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b sive Albatenii opus astronomicum: ad fidem codicis Escurialensis Arabice editum.

He compared to his own value for the sidereal year with those obtained by al-Batt\u0101n\u012b, Ptolemy and a value he attributed to the 9th-century scholar Thabit ibn Qurra.[6] The accuracy of al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observations encouraged Copernicus to pursue his ideas about the heliocentric nature of the cosmos,[3] and in the book that initiated the Copernican Revolution, the De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, al-Batt\u0101n\u012b is mentioned 23 times.[37]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's tables were used by the German mathematician Christopher Clavius in reforming the Julian calendar, leading to it being replaced by the Gregorian calendar in 1582.[9] The astronomers Tycho Brahe, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei cited Al-Batt\u0101n\u012b or his observations.[5] His almost exactly correct value obtained for the Sun's eccentricity is better than the values determined by both Copernicus and Brahe.[8]/nThe lunar crater Albategnius was named in his honour during the 17th century. Like many of the craters on the Moon's near side, it was given its name by Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.[38]/nIn the 1690s, the English physicist and astronomer Edmund Halley, using Plato Tiburtius's translation of al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's z\u012bj, discovered that the Moon's speed was possibly increasing.[39] Halley researched the location of Raqqa, where al-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observatory had been built, using the astronomer's calculations for the solar obliquity, the interval between successive autumnal equinoxes and several solar and lunar eclipses seen from Raqqa and Antioch. From this information, Halley derived the mean motion and position of the Moon for the years 881, 882, 883, 891, and 901. To interpret his results, Halley was dependent upon on knowing the location of Raqqa, which he was able to do once he had corrected the accepted value for the latitude of Aleppo.[40]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's observations of eclipses were used by\u00a0the English astronomer Richard Dunthorne\u00a0to determine a value for the increasing speed of the Moon in its orbit, he calculated that the lunar longitude was changing at a rate of 10 arcseconds per century.[8][41]/nAl-Batt\u0101n\u012b's data is still used by geophysicists.[42]", "40377121": "Muhammad Sharif (cosmologist) (Urdu: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641) (15 June 1962), TI, FPAS, is a Pakistani professor, specialised in mathematical physics and cosmology.

He has been noted for the linkages that he has found between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.[5]/nHuh was born in Stanford, California while his parents were completing graduate school at Stanford University. He was raised in South Korea, where his family returned when he was approximately two years old. His father was a professor of statistics at Korea University, while his mother was a professor of Russian language at Seoul National University.[1][6] Poor scores on elementary school tests convinced him that he lacked the innate aptitude to excel in mathematics. He dropped out of high school to focus on writing poetry after becoming bored and exhausted by the routine of constantly studying during his youth.[6] Due to the academic setbacks he endured throughout his childhood and adolescent years that eventually culminated into a subsequent career breakthrough into mathematics which also resulted him in netting the coveted Fields Medal. Huh has been described as a late bloomer, both in terms of his career phenomena and with respect to his academic and professional development.[7] Huh matriculated at Seoul National University in 2002, but found himself initially unsettled.

Huh credited the course with sparking his interest in research-level math.[6] Huh then proceeded to complete a master's degree at Seoul National University, while frequently travelling to Japan with Hironaka and acting as his personal assistant.[6] Due to his poor academic record as a undergraduate, Huh was rejected from all but one of the American universities that he applied to.

Technically the tool was that of deriving \"amplitude\" equations from the full Navier\u2013Stokes equations, simplified equations describing the evolution of a slowly changing wave amplitude of the roiling liquid; this amplitude equation was later described as the Newell\u2013Whitehead\u2013Segel equation./nWith Evelyn Keller he developed a model for slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum) chemotaxis[6] that was perhaps the first example of what was later called an \"emergent system\"; e.g. in Steven Johnson's 2001 book Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software.[7] Dictyostelium is 'the main character'.[8] Its amoebas join into a single multicellular aggregate (akin to a multicellular organism) if food runs out; the multicellular aggregate has a better chance to find optimal conditions for spore dispersal. Keller and Segel showed that simple assumptions about an attractive chemical (cyclic AMP), which is both secreted by cells and steers them, could explain such behavior without the need for any master cell that manages the process.[6]/nThey also developed a model for chemotaxis.[9] Hillen and Painter say of it: \"its success ... a consequence of its intuitive simplicity, analytical tractability and capacity to replicate key behaviour of chemotactic populations. One such property, the ability to display 'auto-aggregation,' has led to its prominence as a mechanism for self-organisation of biological systems. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to finite-time blow-up under certain formulations of the model, and a large body of work has been devoted to determining when blow-up occurs or whether globally existing solutions exist\".[10]/nA paper with Jackson[11] was the first to apply Turing's reaction\u2013diffusion scheme to population dynamics. Lee Segel also found a way to explain the mechanism from a more intuitive perspective than had previously been used./nIn 1975 Segel was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics in the Weizmann Institute. A central project was renewing the computer science aspect of the department by bringing simultaneously 4 young leading researchers whom he dubbed the 'Gang of Four' - David Harel (Israel Prize '04), Amir Pnueli (Turing Prize '96, Israel Prize '00), Adi Shamir (Turing Prize '02) and Shimon Ullman (Israel Prize '15)./nSegel was the editor of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology between 1986 and 2002./nLee Segel was the author of:/nAnd Editor of:/nSegel was the Ulam Visiting Scholar of the Santa Fe Institute for 1992\u201393.\nThe Sixth Israeli Mini-Workshop in Applied Mathematics was dedicated to his memory.

Without interaction between different components, the kinetic curves converge into a simple norm, even for open systems./nThe detailed mechanism of many real physico-chemical complex systems includes both reversible\nand irreversible reactions. Such mechanisms are typical in homogeneous combustion,\nheterogeneous catalytic oxidation, and complex enzyme reactions. The classical\nthermodynamics of perfect systems is defined for reversible kinetics and has no limit for\nirreversible reactions.[8] On the contrary, the mass action law gives the possibility to write the chemical kinetic equations for any\ncombination of reversible and irreversible reactions. Without additional restrictions,\nthis class of equations is extremely wide and can approximate any dynamical system\nwith preservation of positivity of concentrations and the linear conservation laws. (This\ngeneral approximation theorem was proved in 1986.[15]) The model\nof real systems should satisfy some restrictions. Under the standard microscopic reversibility requirement, these restrictions should be formulated as follows: A\nsystem with some irreversible reactions should be at the limit of the systems with all reversible reactions and the detailed balance conditions.[7] Such systems have been completely described in 2011.[7] The extended principle of detailed balance is the\ncharacteristic property of all systems that obey the generalized mass action law and is\nthe limit of systems with detailed balance when some of the reaction rate constants\ntend to zero (the Gorban-Yablonsky theorem)./nThe extended principle of detailed balance consists of two parts:/nThe stoichiometric vector of the reaction \n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n\n\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\nA\n\ni\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2211\n\nj\n\n\n\n\u03b2\n\nj\n\n\n\nA\n\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{i}\\alpha _{i}A_{i}\\to \\sum _{j}\\beta _{j}A_{j}}\n\n is the gain minus loss vector with coordinates\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n\ni\n\n\n=\n\n\u03b2\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma _{i}=\\beta _{i}-\\alpha _{i}}\n\n./n(It may be useful to recall the formal convention: the linear span of an empty set is 0;\nthe convex hull of an empty set is empty.)/nThe extended principle of detailed balance gives an ultimate and complete answer to the following problem: how to throw away some reverse reactions without violating thermodynamics and microscopic reversibility?

On his first visit to Dunsink Observatory, he showed two of them to Brinkley, who requested that the papers be developed further. Hamilton complied, and early in 1823, Brinkley approved the amended version.[11] In July of 1823, Hamilton earned a place at Trinity College Dublin by examination, at age 17. His tutor there was Charles Boyton, a family friend,[3] who brought to his attention the contemporary mathematics published by the group at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris.[12] John Brinkley remarked of the precocious Hamilton, \"This young man, I do not say will be, but is, the first mathematician of his age.\"[13]/nThe college awarded Hamilton two optimes, or off-the-chart grades, in Greek and in physics. He was first in every subject and at every examination. He was expected to win further student honours, but his undergraduate career was curtailed.[8][by what?] He earned degrees in both classics and mathematics (BA in 1827, MA in 1837)./nHamilton aimed to win a Trinity College fellowship by competitive examination,[3] but his ambition was overtaken by events[further explanation needed], after Brinkley in 1826 was made Bishop of Cloyne.[14] Hamilton was still an undergraduate, when he was appointed in 1827 to the vacant posts left by Brinkley's departure, Andrews Professor of Astronomy and Royal Astronomer of Ireland.[5]:\u200a209/nIn 1824, Hamilton was introduced at Edgeworthstown to the novelist Maria Edgeworth, by the Rev. Richard Butler, the vicar of Trim, County Meath to whom his uncle James Hamilton was curate.[15][16]:\u200a5,\u200a34\u200a During the same period, his uncle introduced him to the Disney family at Summerhill House, County Meath. The Disney sons attended Trinity College, and Hamilton had friends among them. At Summerhill, he met Catherine Disney, their sister.[16]:\u200a37\u200a[17]/nHamilton was attracted to Catherine Disney, but her family did not approve and Catherine was required to marry the Rev. William Barlow, a brother of her elder sister's husband. The wedding took place in 1825.[16]:\u200a109,\u200a113\u200a Hamilton wrote in 1826 about his feelings for her in an extended poem, \"The Enthusiast\". Over twenty years later, in 1847, he confided in John Herschel that during this period he might have become a poet.[17]/nIn 1825, Hamilton met Arabella Lawrence, younger sister of Sarah Lawrence, a significant correspondent and frank critic of his poetry. It was a contact he made through Maria Edgeworth's circle.[16]:\u200a26\u200a[18]/nHamilton, now Royal Astronomer of Ireland, took up residence at Dunsink Observatory where he spent the rest of his life.[9] He was there from 1827 until his death in 1865.[19] In his early years at Dunsink, Hamilton observed the heavens quite regularly;[20] He left routine observation to his assistant Charles Thompson.[21][22] Hamilton's sisters also supported the observatory's work.[3]/nThe introductory lectures by Hamilton in astronomy were celebrated; in addition to his students, they attracted scholars, poets, and women.[23] Felicia Hemans wrote her poem The Prayer of the Lonely Student after hearing one of his lectures.[24]/nHamilton invited his four sisters to come and live at the observatory in 1827, and they ran the household until his marriage in 1833. They included Eliza Mary Hamilton (1807\u20131851), the poet.[3] In 1827, Hamilton wrote to his sister Grace about \"some of\" the Lawrence sisters having met his sister Eliza in Dublin.[25][26]/nNewly appointed to the Observatory, Hamilton set off on a tour in Ireland and England with Alexander Nimmo, who was coaching him on latitude and longitude.[27] One call was to Sarah Lawrence's school at Gateacre, near Liverpool, where Hamilton had a chance to assess the calculator Master Noakes.[28] They visited William Wordsworth at Rydal Mount in September of that year, where Caesar Otway was also present.[29][30]:\u200a410\u200a After the visit, Hamilton sent numerous poems to Wordsworth, becoming a \"poetic disciple\".[31]/nWhen Wordsworth visited Dublin in the summer of 1829, in a party with John Marshall and his family, he stayed at Dunsink with Hamilton.[30]:\u200a411\u200a On a second tour in England with Nimmo in 1831, Hamilton parted from him at Birmingham, to visit the Lawrence sisters and family on his mother's side in the Liverpool area. They met up again in the Lake District, where they climbed Helvellyn and had tea with Wordsworth. Hamilton returned to Dublin, via Edinburgh and Glasgow.[16][32]/nHamilton visited Samuel Taylor Coleridge at Highgate, in 1832, helped by an unexpected letter of introduction given to him by Sarah Lawrence on a visit to Liverpool in March of that year. He also paid a call, with Arabella, on the family of William Roscoe, who had died in 1831.[33][34]/nWhile attending Trinity College, Hamilton proposed to his friend's sister, whose refusal drove the young Hamilton to depression and illness, even to the verge of suicide.[35] He proposed again in 1831 to Ellen de Vere, a sister of the poet Aubrey De Vere (1814\u20131902), who declined as well.[35] Hamilton eventually married Helen Marie Bayly in 1833,[35] a country preacher's daughter, and had three children with her: William Edwin Hamilton (born 1834), Archibald Henry (born 1835), and Helen Elizabeth (born 1840).[36] Hamilton's married life turned out to be difficult and unhappy as Bayly proved to be pious, shy, timid, and chronically ill.[35]/nHamilton retained his faculties unimpaired to the last, and continued the task of finishing the Elements of Quaternions which had occupied the last six years of his life. He died on 2 September 1865, following a severe attack of gout.[8][37] He is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin./nHamilton made outstanding  contributions to classical mechanics and optics./nHis first discovery was in an early paper that he communicated in 1823 to John Brinkley, who presented it under the title of Caustics in 1824 to the Royal Irish Academy. It was referred as usual to a committee, which recommended further development and simplification before publication. Between 1825 and 1828 the paper was expanded, and became a clearer exposition of a novel method.[6] Over this period, Hamilton gained an appreciation for the nature and importance of optics.[38]/nIn 1827, Hamilton presented a theory of a single function, now known as Hamilton's principal function, that brings together mechanics and optical theory. It helped to establish the foundations of the wave theory of light in mathematical physics. He proposed it when he first predicted its existence in the third supplement to his Systems of Rays, read in 1832./nThe Royal Irish Academy paper was finally entitled Theory of Systems of Rays (23 April 1827), and the first part was printed in 1828 in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. The more important contents of the second and third parts appeared in the three voluminous supplements (to the first part) which were published in the same Transactions, and in the two papers On a General Method in Dynamics, which appeared in the Philosophical Transactions in 1834 and 1835. In these papers, Hamilton developed his central principle of \"Varying Action\"./nA result of this work is a prediction for transparent biaxial crystals (i.e. monoclinic, orthorhombic or triclinic crystals).[39] A ray of light entering such a crystal at a certain angle would emerge as a hollow cone of rays. This discovery was known as conical refraction.[6] Hamilton found it from the geometry of the wave surface introduced by Augustin-Jean Fresnel, which has singular point.[40] There is a basic mathematical explanation of the phenomenon, namely that the wave surface is not the boundary of a convex body. A fuller understanding awaited the microlocal analysis of the middle of the 20th century,[41]/nThe step from optics to dynamics in the application of the method of \"Varying Action\" was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose Philosophical Transactions for 1834 and 1835 there are two papers on the subject./nHamiltonian mechanics was a powerful new technique for working with equations of motion. Hamilton's advances enlarged the class of mechanical problems that could be solved. His principle of \"Varying Action\" was based on the calculus of variations, in the general class of problems included under the principle of least action which had been studied earlier by Pierre Louis Maupertuis, Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange and others. Hamilton's analysis uncovered a deeper mathematical structure than had been previously understood, in particular a symmetry between momentum and position. The credit for discovering what are now called the Lagrangian and Lagrange's equations belongs also to Hamilton./nBoth the Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian approaches have proven important in the study of continuous classical systems in physics, and quantum mechanical systems: the techniques find use in electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, relativity theory and quantum field theory. In the Dictionary of Irish Biography David Spearman writes:[42]/nThe formulation that he devised for classical mechanics proved to be equally suited to quantum theory, whose development it facilitated. The Hamiltonian formalism shows no signs of obsolescence; new ideas continue to find this the most natural medium for their description and development, and the function that is now universally known as the Hamiltonian, is the starting-point for calculation in almost any area of physics./nMany scientists, including Liouville, Jacobi, Darboux, Poincar\u00e9, Kolmogorov, Prigogine[43] and Arnold, have extended Hamilton's work, in mechanics, differential equations and symplectic geometry.[44]/nHamilton's mathematical studies seem to have been undertaken and carried to their full development without collaboration, and his writings do not belong to any particular school. He was intended by the university authorities who elected him to the Professorship of Astronomy to spend his time as he best could for the advancement of science, without restrictions.[6]/nHamilton made his discovery of the algebra of quaternions in 1843.[5]:\u200a210\u200a Among much prior related work, in 1840 Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues had reached a result that amounted to their discovery in all but name.[45]/nHamilton was looking for ways of extending complex numbers (which can be viewed as points on a 2-dimensional Argand diagram) to higher spatial dimensions. In working with four dimensions, rather than three, he created quaternion algebra. According to Hamilton, on 16 October he was out walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin with his wife when the solution in the form of the equation/noccurred to him; Hamilton then carved this equation using his penknife into the side of the nearby Broom Bridge (which Hamilton called Brougham Bridge).[5]:\u200a210/nThe quaternions involved abandoning the commutative law, a radical step for the time. In the context of this prototype geometric algebra, Hamilton also introduced the cross and dot products of vector algebra, the quaternion product being the cross product minus the dot product as scalar. Hamilton also described a quaternion as an ordered four-element multiple of real numbers, and described the first element as the \"scalar\" part, and the remaining three as the \"vector\" part. He coined the neologisms \"tensor\" and \"scalar\", and was the first to use the word \"vector\" in the modern sense.[46]/nHamilton looked into the solution of the quintic in the theory of equations, examining the results arrived at by Niels Henrik Abel, George Jerrard and others in their researches. There is Hamilton's paper on fluctuating functions in Fourier analysis, and the invention of the hodograph. Of his investigations into the solutions, especially by numerical approximation, of certain classes of physically-important differential equations, only parts were published, at intervals, in the Philosophical Magazine.[6]/nHamilton also introduced the icosian game or Hamilton's puzzle. It is based on the concept of a Hamiltonian path in graph theory.[3]/nHamilton introduced, as a method of analysis, both quaternions and biquaternions, the extension to eight dimensions by the introduction of complex number coefficients. When his work was assembled in 1853, the book Lectures on Quaternions had \"formed the subject of successive courses of lectures, delivered in 1848 and subsequent years, in the Halls of Trinity College, Dublin\". Hamilton confidently declared that quaternions would be found to have a powerful influence as an instrument of research./nWhen he died, Hamilton was working on a definitive statement of quaternion science. His son William Edwin Hamilton brought the Elements of Quaternions, a hefty volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866. As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by Charles Jasper Joly, when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing in 1899 and the second in 1901. The subject index and footnotes in this second edition improved the Elements accessibility./nHamilton was twice awarded the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy.[47] The first award, in 1834, was for his work on conical refraction, for which he also received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society the following year.[48] He was to win it again in 1848./nIn 1835, being secretary to the meeting of the British Association which was held that year in Dublin, Hamilton was knighted by the lord-lieutenant. Other honours rapidly succeeded, among which his election in 1837 to the president's chair in the Royal Irish Academy, and the rare distinction of being made a corresponding member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Later, in 1864, the newly established United States National Academy of Sciences elected its first Foreign Associates, and decided to put Hamilton's name on top of their list.[49]/nA plaque under the Broom Bridge, associated with the discovery of quaternions, was unveiled by \u00c9amon de Valera on 13 November 1958.[50][51] Since 1989, the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, has organised a pilgrimage called the Hamilton Walk, in which mathematicians take a walk from Dunsink Observatory to the bridge, where no trace of the carving remains, though a stone plaque does commemorate the discovery.[52]/nThe Hamilton Institute is an applied mathematics research institute at Maynooth University and the Royal Irish Academy holds an annual public Hamilton lecture at which Murray Gell-Mann, Frank Wilczek, Andrew Wiles and Timothy Gowers have all spoken. The year 2005 was the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth and the Irish government designated that the Hamilton Year, celebrating Irish science. Trinity College Dublin marked the year by launching the Hamilton Mathematics Institute.[53]/nTwo commemorative stamps were issued by Ireland in 1943 to mark the centenary of the announcement of quaternions.[54] A 10-euro commemorative silver proof coin was issued by the Central Bank of Ireland in 2005 to commemorate 200 years since his birth./nIt is believed by some modern mathematicians that Hamilton's work on quaternions was satirized by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson in Alice in Wonderland. In particular, the Mad Hatter's tea party was meant to represent the folly of quaternions and the need to revert to Euclidean geometry.[56] In September 2022 evidence was presented to counter this suggestion, which appears to have been based on an incorrect understanding of both quaternions and their history.[57]/nHamilton married Helen Bayly, daughter of Rev Henry Bayly, Rector of Nenagh, County Tipperary, in 1833; she was a sister of neighbours to the observatory.[58][16]:\u200a108\u200a They had three children: William Edwin Hamilton (born 1834), Archibald Henry (born 1835) and Helen Eliza Amelia (born 1840).[59] Helen stayed with her widowed mother at Bayly Farm, Nenagh for extended periods, until her mother's death in 1837. She also was away from Dunsink, staying with sisters, for much of the time from 1840 to 1842.[60] Hamilton's married life was reportedly difficult.[5]:\u200a209\u200a In the troubled period of the early 1840s, his sister Sydney ran his household; when Helen returned, he was happier after some depression.[16]:\u200a125,\u200a126", "72586": "Simon Stevin (Dutch: [\u02c8sim\u0254n \u02c8ste\u02d0v\u026an]; 1548\u20131620), sometimes called Stevinus, was a Flemish mathematician, scientist and music theorist.[1] He made various contributions in many areas of science and engineering, both theoretical and practical. He also translated various mathematical terms into Dutch, making it one of the few European languages in which the word for mathematics, wiskunde (wis and kunde, i.e., \"the knowledge of what is certain\"), was not a loanword from Greek but a calque via Latin. He also replaced the word chemie, the Dutch for chemistry, by scheikunde (\"the art of separating\"), made in analogy with wiskunde./nVery little is known with certainty about Simon Stevin's life, and what we know is mostly inferred from other recorded facts.[2] The exact birth date and the date and place of his death are uncertain.  It is assumed he was born in Bruges, since he enrolled at Leiden University under the name Simon Stevinus Brugensis (meaning \"Simon Stevin from Bruges\").  His name is usually written as Stevin, but some documents regarding his father use the spelling Stevijn (pronunciation [\u02c8ste:v\u03b5\u026an]); this was a common spelling shift in 16th-century Dutch.[3] \nSimon Stevin's mother, Cathelijne (or Catelyne), was the daughter of a wealthy family from Ypres; her father Hubert was a poorter of Bruges.  Cathelijne would later marry Joost Sayon, who was involved in the carpet and silk trade and was a member of the schuttersgilde Sint-Sebastiaan. Through her marriage, Cathelijne became a member of a family of Calvinists; it is thought that Simon Stevin was likely brought up in the Calvinist faith.[4]/nIt is believed that Stevin grew up in a relatively affluent environment and enjoyed a good education.  He was likely educated at a Latin school in his hometown.[5]/nStevin left Bruges in 1571 apparently without a particular destination.  Stevin was most likely a Calvinist since a Catholic would likely not have risen to the position of trust he later occupied with Maurice, Prince of Orange.  It is assumed that he left Bruges to escape the religious persecution of Protestants by the Spanish rulers. Based on references in his work \"Wisconstighe Ghedaechtenissen\" (Mathematical Memoirs), it has been inferred that he must have moved first to Antwerp where he began his career as a merchant's clerk.[6] Some biographers mention that he travelled to Prussia, Poland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden and other parts of Northern Europe, between 1571 and 1577.  It is possible that he completed these travels over a longer period of time.  In 1577 Simon Stevin returned to Bruges and was appointed city clerk by the aldermen of Bruges, a function he occupied from 1577 to 1581.  He worked in the office of Jan de Brune of the Brugse Vrije, the castellany of Bruges./nWhy he had returned to Bruges in 1577 is not clear.  It may have been related to the political events of that period. Bruges was the scene of intense religious conflict. Catholics and Calvinists alternately controlled the government of the city.  They usually opposed each other but would occasionally collaborate in order to counteract the dictates of King Philip II of Spain.  In 1576 a certain level of official religious tolerance was decreed. This could explain why Stevin returned to Bruges in 1577.  Later the Calvinists seized power in many Flemish cities and incarcerated Catholic clerics and secular governors supportive of the Spanish rulers.  Between 1578 and 1584 Bruges was ruled by Calvinists./nIn 1581 Stevin again left his native Bruges and moved to Leiden where he attended the Latin school.[5] On 16 February 1583 he enrolled, under the name Simon Stevinus Brugensis (meaning \"Simon Stevin from Bruges\"), at Leiden University, which had been founded by William the Silent in 1575.  Here he befriended William the Silent's second son and heir Prince Maurice, the Count of Nassau.[4] Stevin is listed in the university's registers until 1590 and apparently never graduated./nFollowing William the Silent's assassination and Prince Maurice's assumption of his father's office, Stevin became the principal advisor and tutor of Prince Maurice.  Prince Maurice asked his advice on many occasions, and made him a public officer \u2013 at first director of the so-called \"waterstaet\"[7] (the government authority for public works, especially water management) from 1592, and later quartermaster-general of the army of the States-General.[8] Prince Maurice also asked Stevin to found an engineering school within the University of Leiden./nStevin moved to The Hague where he bought a house in 1612.  He married in 1610 or 1614 and had four children.  It is known that he left a widow with two children at his death in Leiden or The Hague in 1620.[4]/nStevin is responsible for many discoveries and inventions. Stevin wrote numerous bestselling books, and he was a pioneer of the development and the practical application of (engineering related) science such as mathematics, physics and applied science like hydraulic engineering and surveying. He was thought to have invented the decimal fractions until the middle of the 20th century, when researchers discovered that decimal fractions had been previously introduced by the medieval Islamic scholar al-Uqlidisi in a book written in 952. Moreover, a systematic development of decimal fractions was given well before Stevin in the book Miftah al-Hisab written in 1427 by Al-Kashi./nHis contemporaries were most struck by his invention of a so-called land yacht, a carriage with sails, of which a model was preserved in Scheveningen until 1802. The carriage itself had been lost long before. Around the year 1600 Stevin, with Prince Maurice of Orange and twenty-six others, used the carriage on the beach between Scheveningen and Petten. The carriage was propelled solely by the force of wind and acquired a speed which exceeded that of horses.[7]/nStevin's work in the waterstaet involved improvements to the sluices and spillways to control flooding, exercises in hydraulic engineering. Windmills were already in use to pump the water out but in Van de Molens (On mills), he suggested improvements including ideas that the wheels should move slowly with a better system for meshing of the gear teeth. These improved threefold the efficiency of the windmills used in pumping water out of the polders.[9] He received a patent on his innovation in 1586.[8]/nStevin's aim was to bring about a second age of wisdom, in which mankind would have recovered all of its earlier knowledge. He deduced that the language spoken in this age would have to be Dutch, because, as he showed empirically, in that language, more concepts could be indicated with monosyllabic words than in any of the (European) languages he had compared it with.[7] This was one of the reasons why he wrote all of his works in Dutch and left the translation of them for others to do. The other reason was that he wanted his works to be practically useful to people who had not mastered the common scientific language of the time, Latin. Thanks to Simon Stevin the Dutch language got its proper scientific vocabulary such as \"wiskunde\" (\"kunst van het gewisse of zekere\" the art of what is known or what is certain) for mathematics, \"natuurkunde\" (the \"art of nature\") for physics, \"scheikunde\" (the \"art of separation\") for chemistry, \"sterrenkunde\" (the \"art of stars\") for astronomy, \"meetkunde\" (the \"art of measuring\") for geometry./nStevin was the first to show how to model regular and semiregular polyhedra by delineating their frames in a plane. He also distinguished stable from unstable equilibria.[7]/nStevin contributed to trigonometry with his book, De Driehouckhandel./nIn The First Book of the Elements of the Art of Weighing, The second part: Of the propositions [The Properties of Oblique Weights], Page 41, Theorem XI, Proposition XIX,[10] he derived the condition for the balance of forces on inclined planes using a diagram with a \"wreath\" containing evenly spaced round masses resting on the planes of a triangular prism (see the illustration on the side). He concluded that the weights required were proportional to the lengths of the sides on which they rested assuming the third side was horizontal and that the effect of a weight was reduced in a similar manner. It is implicit that the reduction factor is the height of the triangle divided by the side (the sine of the angle of the side with respect to the horizontal). The proof diagram of this concept is known as the \"Epitaph of Stevinus\". As noted by E. J. Dijksterhuis, Stevin's proof of the equilibrium on an inclined plane can be faulted for using perpetual motion to imply a reductio ad absurdum. Dijksterhuis says Stevin \"intuitively made use of the principle of conservation of energy ... long before it was formulated explicitly\".[2]:\u200a54/nHe demonstrated the resolution of forces before Pierre Varignon, which had not been remarked previously, even though it is a simple consequence of the law of their composition.[7]/nStevin discovered the hydrostatic paradox, which states that the pressure in a liquid is independent of the shape of the vessel and the area of the base, but depends solely on its height.[7]/nHe also gave the measure for the pressure on any given portion of the side of a vessel.[7]/nHe was the first to explain the tides using the attraction of the moon.[7]/nIn 1586, he demonstrated that two objects of different weight fall with the same acceleration.[11][12]/nThe first mention of equal temperament related to the twelfth root of two in the West appeared in Simon Stevin's unfinished manuscript Van de Spiegheling der singconst (ca 1605) published posthumously three hundred years later in 1884;[13] however, due to insufficient accuracy of his calculation, many of the numbers (for string length) he obtained were off by one or two units from the correct values.[14] He appears to have been inspired by the writings of the Italian lutenist and musical theorist Vincenzo Galilei (father of Galileo Galilei), a onetime pupil of Gioseffo Zarlino./nBookkeeping by double entry may have been known to Stevin, as he was a clerk in Antwerp in his younger years, either practically or through the medium of the works of Italian authors such as Luca Pacioli and Gerolamo Cardano. However, Stevin was the first to recommend the use of impersonal accounts in the national household. He brought it into practice for Prince Maurice, and recommended it to the French statesman Sully.[15][7]/nStevin wrote a 35-page booklet called De Thiende (\"the art of tenths\"), first published in Dutch in 1585 and translated into French as La Disme. The full title of the English translation was Decimal arithmetic: Teaching how to perform all computations whatsoever by whole numbers without fractions, by the four principles of common arithmetic: namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The concepts referred to in the booklet included unit fractions and Egyptian fractions. Muslim mathematicians were the first to utilize decimals instead of fractions on a large scale. Al-Kashi's book, Key to Arithmetic, was written at the beginning of the 15th century and was the stimulus for the systematic application of decimals to whole numbers and fractions thereof.[16][17] But nobody established their daily use before Stevin. He felt that this innovation was so significant, that he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures and weights to be merely a question of time.[18][7]/nHis notation is rather unwieldy. The point separating the integers from the decimal fractions seems to be the invention of Bartholomaeus Pitiscus, in whose trigonometrical tables (1612) it occurs, and it was accepted by John Napier in his logarithmic papers (1614 and 1619).[7]/nStevin printed little circles around the exponents of the different powers of one-tenth. That Stevin intended these encircled numerals to denote mere exponents is clear from the fact that he employed the same symbol for powers of algebraic quantities. He did not avoid fractional exponents; only negative exponents do not appear in his work.[7]/nStevin wrote on other scientific subjects \u2013 for instance optics, geography, astronomy \u2013 and a number of his writings were translated into Latin by W. Snellius (Willebrord Snell). There are two complete editions in French of his works, both printed in Leiden, one in 1608, the other in 1634.[7]/nStevin wrote his Arithmetic in 1594. The work brought to the western world for the first time a general solution of the quadratic equation, originally documented nearly a millennium previously by Brahmagupta in India./nAccording to Van der Waerden, Stevin eliminated \"the classical restriction of 'numbers' to integers (Euclid) or to rational fractions (Diophantos)...the real numbers formed a continuum. His general notion of a real number was accepted, tacitly or explicitly, by all later scientists\".[19] A recent study attributes a greater role to Stevin in developing the real numbers than has been acknowledged by Weierstrass's followers.[20] Stevin proved the intermediate value theorem for polynomials, anticipating Cauchy's proof thereof. Stevin uses a divide and conquer procedure, subdividing the interval into ten equal parts.[21] Stevin's decimals were the inspiration for Isaac Newton's work on infinite series.[22]/nStevin thought the Dutch language to be excellent for scientific writing, and he translated many of the mathematical terms to Dutch. As a result, Dutch is one of the few Western European languages that have many mathematical terms that do not stem from Greek or Latin. This includes the very name wiskunde (mathematics)./nHis eye for the importance of having the scientific language be the same as the language of the craftsman may show from the dedication of his book De Thiende ('The Disme' or 'The Tenth'): 'Simon Stevin wishes the stargazers, surveyors, carpet measurers, body measurers in general, coin measurers and tradespeople good luck.' Further on in the same pamphlet, he writes: \"[this text] teaches us all calculations that are needed by the people without using fractions. One can reduce all operations to adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing with integers.\"/nSome of the words he invented evolved: 'aftrekken' (subtract) and 'delen' (divide) stayed the same, but over time 'menigvuldigen' became 'vermenigvuldigen' (multiply, the added 'ver' emphasizes the fact it is an action). 'Vergaderen' (gathering) became 'optellen' (add lit. count up)./nAnother example is the Dutch word for diameter: 'middellijn', lit.: line through the middle./nThe word 'zomenigmaal' (quotient lit. 'that many times') has been replaced by 'quoti\u00ebnt' in modern-day Dutch./nOther terms did not make it into modern day mathematical Dutch, like 'teerling' (die, although still being used in the meaning as die), instead of cube./nAmongst others, he published:", "2268051": "Eliot Roy Weintraub (/\u02c8wa\u026antr\u0251\u02d0b/; born March 22, 1943) is an American mathematician, economist, and, since 1976, professor of economics at Duke University.[1] He was born in 1943 in New York City.[2][3]/nWeintraub has published numerous articles in professional journals and other edited volumes. His teaching and research have traced the connection between mathematics and economics at technical, methodological or historical, and micro and macro levels.[4] A broad theme of later work has been the transformation of economics from a historical to a mathematical discipline, as in General Equilibrium Analysis (1985),[5] Stabilizing Dynamics:  Constructing Economic Knowledge (1991),[6] How Economics Became a Mathematical Science (2002).,[7] and \"Finding Equilibrium: Arrow, Debreu, McKenzie and the Problem of Scientific Credit\" co-authored with Till D\u00fcppe (2014).[8]  The latter was awarded the 2016 Joseph J.

Along with Federico Cesi, Anastasio de Filiis and Johannes van Heeck, he founded the Accademia dei Lincei in August 1603./nFrancesco was the son of Bernardino Stelluti and his wife Lucrezia Corradini. He went to Rome at a young age to study law. Once he had completed his studies he began to work in the law, which he practised all his life, while also dedicating himself to literary and scientific studies.[1]/nIn the Accademia, he was first appointed Grand Counsellor, with the task of teaching mathematics, geometry and astronomy to the other members. Later he was appointed proponitor (lecturer) in machines and mathematical instruments, and provisor (supervisor) and calculator of the motions of the stars. His pseudonym in the Accademia was Tardigrado (slow stepper), reflecting his character as a quiet, studious man, careful and versatile. His protecting star was Saturn, from which he was said to draw his capacity for reflection and speculation, as well as his motto, Quo serius eo citius (\u201cthe slower, the swifter\u201d). In 1604 he authored the Logicae Physicae et Metaphysicae Brevissimum Compendium.[1]/nLike his companions he faced hostility from the family of Prince Cesi because of the creation of the Accademia dei Lincei and was compelled to leave Rome for several years, going first to Fabriano and then to the Farnese court in Parma.[2] He returned to Rome in 1609, and took an active role in the development of the Accademia. In 1610 he went to Naples with Cesi to establish a branch of the Accademia there, to be run by Giambattista della Porta[2] and he also began his life\u2019s work of editing the \u201cTesoro Messicano\u201d, which contained the records gathered in Mexico by naturalist Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Toledo in the 1570s.[1] In 1612 he was elected  procuratore generale of the Accademia./nIn 1625 he and Federico Cesi printed in broadsheet (or broadside) form[3] the work Apiarium in 1625, marking the first published microscopic revelations of biological structures.[4][5] The broadsheet contained an illustration of three bees - a design of three bees was the family crest of the new pope, Urban VIII.[6]/nStelluti\u2019s Persio tradotto in verso sciolto e dichiarato (\"[Works of Aulus] Persius [Flaccus] translated into light verse and annotated [lit. 'declared' in the sense of 'remarked/commented upon']\"), published in Rome in 1630, is the first book published in codex form to contain images of organisms viewed through the microscope.[3]/nSubsequently, in 1637 he published a work on fossilised wood, apparently also with the aid of magnifying instruments[7] and he finally published the \u201cTesoro Messicano\u201d in 1651.[8] The Tesoro Messicano (\u201cMexican Treasure\u201d) or more precisely the Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus, was the final work of the Accademia. It represented nearly half a century of collaborative work among Accademia members. After the death of Prince Cesi, Stelluti carried forward the work of the Accademia, and, in particular, ensured that the long and sometimes poorly organised project to create this book was brought to fruition. The work was not only very long, but full of an extraordinary number of illustrations - 800 in the first 899 pages.[9]/nAfter Prince Cesi's death, Stelluti was steadfast in preventing the heritage of the Accademia from being lost and he remained close to his friend's widow.

After graduating from Tartu Secondary Science School (Tartu Reaalg\u00fcmnaasium) in 1931 he was admitted to the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Tartu University to study mathematics. After graduating the university in 1935 and finishing the compulsory service in Estonian Defence Forces he was appointed as junior assistant in the Laboratory of Mathematics and Mechanics in Tallinn Technical Institute (currently Tallinn University of Technology). He defended his Master's thesis in 1938 under the supervision of professor Hermann Jaakson\u00a0[et] in Tartu University. In 1940 he got a scholarship for doctoral studies from Tartu University./nIn July 1941, Kangro was drafted to the Red Army. He served until February 1942, when he was sent to Chelyabinsk Agricultural Mechanisation Institute. At the end of 1943, he was transferred to Moscow University, where he continued his research towards a Doctor's degree./nKangro returned to Estonia in autumn 1944, and from November onwards he started teaching at Tartu University. In 1947\u201348 he was the dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. He defended his Doctoral thesis in July 1947 and became a professor in 1951. In 1952\u20131959 he was the head of the Chair of Geometry, from 1959 until his death in 1975 he was the head of the Chair of Mathematical Analysis./nIn his Doctoral thesis he created a new theory of convergence, which generalized Borel theory of summation, and applied this to study problems connected to convergence of complex power series. He defined new summation methods and used them to characterize properties of the sum of power series and its analytic continuation. The star-shaped summability domains of power series obtained by these new summation methods enabled him to get results extending the applications of Borel summation methods in function theory./nIn the 1950s, he laid the basis on systematic treatment of summability factors together with German mathematicians Alexander Peyerimhoff and Wolfgang Jurkat. He combined ideas of modern functional analysis with classical analysis. Together with his student Simson Baron he started to describe the summability factors for double series./nConsidering applications to orthogonal series and Tauberian theorems, Kangro  created a theory of summability with speed based on functional analysis, which helped him to solve several problems in function and summability theory. In addition to laying the basis for the new theory he also pointed out main directions for applications. This work was interrupted by his unexpected death in 1975./nAfter the war Kangro had a great influence on modernizing the teaching of mathematics in Tartu State University.\nHis courses on algebra and mathematical analysis reflected the changes taking place in these areas in the first half of the 20th century: function theory of polynomials was replaced by abstract algebra, mathematical analysis was based on axiomatic methods and set theory. His course on functional analysis became a starting point for a new research direction in numerical methods in Tartu./nKangro's main contribution was raising a new generation of mathematicians. He has supervised 23 Candidate's theses in mathematics. In addition to mathematical analysis he has also contributed to development of algebra, numerical methods and geometry in Estonia.

The family eventually settled in the Peloponnese region of Greece around the time of the Greek War of Independence. From a young age, Nikolaidis exhibited a high level of intelligence. He attended Greece's elite military school known as Evelpidon, graduating with honors. The Greek government sent him to Paris on a scholarship to study with the most brilliant minds of the time. He studied at the \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es and the \u00c9cole polytechnique.[5]  His professor at the \u00c9cole polytechnique was Joseph Bertrand. His classmates at the time were Henri Brocard and \u00c9mile Lemoine. His professor at the \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es was mechanician and mathematician Adh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant. Nikolaidis taught civil engineering and mathematics in France. He was also affiliated with Charles Hermite, Jacques Antoine Charles Bresse, and L\u00e9on Foucault. He had an academic disagreement with Bresse and Foucault, publishing his responses in the French magazine Cosmos. He abandoned his teaching position at the \u00c9cole nationale des ponts et chauss\u00e9es because of his disagreement with Bresse. In 1863, Nikolaidis published Th\u00e9orie du Mouvement d'une Figure Plane dans son Plan Application aux Organes des Machines and in  1864 he published his dissertation, M\u00e9moire Sur la Th\u00e9orie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Surfaces. By 1865, he had two Phds. That same year he returned to Greece and became an instructor at Evelpidon. Around the same period at 40 years of age, he fought on the side of Crete during the Cretan revolt in 1866, and subsequently fought on the side of France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, commanding the 174th Battalion of Verville. When he returned to Greece he became a professor at the University of Athens in 1871. Three years later he published an accumulation of his complex mathematical work in French entitled Analectes, ou M\u00e9moires et Notes sur les Diverses Parties des Math\u00e9matiques. Around this period he taught Cyparissos Stephanos, inspiring the young mathematician. By 1881, he retired from teaching at the University of Athens due to an illness.

He worked as muwaqqit (\u0645\u0648\u0642\u062a, religious timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and constructed a sundial for its minaret in 1371/72./nIbn al-Shatir was born in Damascus, Syria around the year 1304. His father died when he was six years old. His grandfather took him in which resulted in Ibn al-Shatir learning the craft of inlaying ivory.[2] Ibn al-Shatir traveled to Cairo and Alexandria to study astronomy, where he fell in, inspired him.[2]  After completing his studies with Abu \u2018Ali  al-Marrakushi, Ibn al-Shatir returned  to his home in Damascus where he was then appointed muwaqqit (timekeeper) of the Umayyad Mosque.[2] Part of his duties as muqaqqit involved keeping track of the times of the five daily prayers and when the month of Ramadan would begin and end.[3] To accomplish this, he created a variety of astronomical instruments. He made several astronomical observations and calculations both for the purposes of the mosque, and to fuel his later research. These observations and calculations were organized in a series of astronomical tables.[4] His first set of tables, which have been lost over time, allegedly combined his observations with those of Ptolemy, and contained entries on the Sun, Moon and Earth.[3]/nIbn al-Shatir most important astronomical treatise was kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul (\"The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles\"). In it he drastically reformed the Ptolemaic models of the Sun, Moon and planets. His model incorporated the Urdi lemma, and eliminated the need for an equant (a point on the opposite side of the center of the larger circle from the Earth) by introducing an extra epicycle (the Tusi-couple), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical (but conceptually very different) to what Nicolaus Copernicus did in the 16th century. This new planetary model was published in his work the al-Zij al-jadid (The New Planetary Handbook.)[3] Before the kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul was made, there was a treatise that Ibn al-Shatir made which described the observations and procedures that lead to him creating his new planetary models.[3]/nUnlike previous astronomers before him, Ibn al-Shatir was not concerned with adhering to the theoretical principles of natural philosophy or Aristotelian cosmology, but rather to produce a model that was more consistent with empirical observations and contemporary theory. For example, it was Ibn al-Shatir's concern for observational accuracy which led him to eliminate the epicycle in the Ptolemaic solar model and all the eccentrics, epicycles and equant in the Ptolemaic lunar model. Shatir's new planetary model consisted of new secondary epicycles instead of equant, which improved on the Ptolemaic model. His model was thus in better agreement with empirical observations than any previous model,[5][failed verification] and was also the first that permitted empirical testing.[6][failed verification] His work thus marked a turning point in astronomy, which may be considered a \"Scientific Revolution before the Renaissance\".[5][failed verification]/nDrawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy's lunar model, Ibn al-Shatir produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy's crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.[7] This was the first accurate lunar model which matched physical observations.[8]/nIbn al-Shatir's Solar Model exemplifies his commitment towards accurate observational data, and its creation serves as a general improvement towards the Ptolemaic model. When observing the Ptolemaic solar model, it is clear that most of the observations are not accounted for, and cannot accommodate the observed variations of the apparent size of the solar diameter.[9] Because the Ptolemaic system contains some faulty numerical values for its observations, the actual geocentric distance of the Sun had been greatly underestimated in its solar model. And with the problems that had arisen from the Ptolemaic models, there was an influx of need to create solutions that would resolve them. Ibn al-Shatir's model aimed to do just that, creating a new eccentricity for the solar model. And with his numerous observations, Ibn al-Shatir was able to generate a new maximum solar equation (2;2,6\u00b0), which he found to have occurred at the mean longitude \u03bb 97\u00b0 or 263\u00b0 from the apogee.[10] As the method was deciphered through geometric ways, it was easy to identify that 7;7 and 2;7 were the radii of the epicycles.[11] In addition, his final results for apparent size of the solar diameter were concluded to be at apogee (0;29,5), at perigee (0;36,55), and at mean distance (0;32.32).[10] This was partially done by reducing Ptolemy\u2019s circular geometric models to numerical tables in order to perform independent calculations to find the longitude of the planets.[1] The longitude of the planets was defined as a function of the mean longitude and the anomaly. Rather than calculating every possible value, which would be difficult and labor-intensive, four functions of a single value were calculated for each planet and combined to calculate quite accurately the true longitude of each planet.[12]/nTo calculate the true longitude of the moon, Ibn al-Shatir assigned two variables, \u03b7, which represented the Moon's mean elongation from the Sun, and \u03b3, which represented its mean anomaly. To any pair of these values was a corresponding e, or equation which was added to the mean longitude to calculate the true longitude. Ibn al-Shatir used the same mathematical scheme when finding the true longitudes of the planets, except for the planets the variables became \u03b1, the mean longitude measured from apogee (or the mean center) and \u03b3 which was the mean anomaly as for the moon. A correcting function c3' was tabulated and added to the mean anomaly \u03b3 to determine the true anomaly \u03b3'.[12] As shown in Shatir's model, it was later discovered that Shatir's lunar model had a very similar concept as Copernicus.[2] Ibn al-Shatir never gave motivation towards his two epicycles to be adopted, so it was hard to tell the difference between his model and the Ptolemaic model./nAlthough Ibn al-Shatir's system was firmly geocentric (he had eliminated the Ptolemaic eccentrics), the mathematical details of his system were identical to those in Copernicus's De revolutionibus.[13] Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus paralleled the work of Ibn al-Shatir one century earlier.[14] Ibn al-Shatir's lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus.[15] Copernicus's Mercury model was flawed in the fact that he was not able to properly understand the model first created by Ibn al-Shatir. Copernicus also translated Ptolemy's geometric models to longitudinal tables in the same way Ibn al Shatir did when constructing his solar model.[1] This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of Ibn al-Shatir.[16]  It is unknown whether Copernicus read Ibn al-Shatir and the argument is still debated. The differences between the two can be seen in their works. Copernicus followed a heliocentric model (planets orbit the Sun) while Ibn al-Shatir followed the geocentric model (as mentioned earlier). Also Copernicus followed the inductive reasoning while Ibn al-Shatir followed the Zij traditions.[15] A Byzantine manuscript containing a solar model diagram with a second epicycle, was discovered to have been in Italy at the time of Copernicus. The presence of this eastern manuscript containing the ideas of Islamic scholars in Italy provides potential evidence of transmission of astronomical theories from the East to Western Europe.[17]/nThe idea of using hours of equal time length throughout the year was the innovation of Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by al-Batt\u0101n\u012b. Before the Islamicate scholar created the improved sundial, he had to understand the sundial created by his predecessors. The Greek had sundials too, but they had nodus-based with straight hour lines which meant that the hours in the day would be unequal (temporary hours) depending on the season. Each day was split into twelve equal segments which meant that the hours would have been shorter in the winter and longer in the summer due to the activity of the sun.[18] Ibn al-Shatir was aware that \"using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year.\" His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept later appeared in Western sundials from at least 1446.[18][19]/nIbn al-Shatir also invented a timekeeping device called \"Sand\u016bq al\u2010Yaw\u0101q\u012bt li ma\u02bfrifat al-Maw\u0101q\u012bt\" (jewel box), which incorporates both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of prayers.[20] The \"Sand\u016bq al\u2010Yaw\u0101q\u012bt li ma\u02bfrifat al-Maw\u0101q\u012bt\" had a moveable hole in it which allowed the user to find the hour angle of the sun. If this angle was suitable with the horizon, then the user could use it as a polar sundial.[21] This device is preserved in the museum of Aleppo (largest museum in the city of Aleppo, Syria).[21]  He also created a sundial which was placed on top of the Madhanat al-Arus (The Minaret of the Bride) in the Umayyad Mosque.[13] The sundial was created on a slab of marble which was approximately 2 meters by 1 meter. The sundial being engraved on the marble was so that Ibn al-Shatir could read the time of the day in equinoctial (equal times) hours for the prayer times.[13] This sundial was later removed in the eighteenth century and a replica was put in its place. The original sundial was placed in the Damascus archeology museum.[21] He also created another sundial but in smaller dimensions (12\u00a0cm x 12\u00a0cm \u00d7 3\u00a0cm) to find out the prayer times of midday and the afternoon. This sundial was able to tell the local meridian and the direction of the mecca (located in Saudi Arabia).[21] Other notable instruments invented by him include a reversed astrolabe and an astrolabic clock.[22] The astrolabe that he created was called the al\u2010\u0101la al\u2010j\u0101mi\u02bfa (the universal instrument). This astrolabe was created by Ibn al-Shatir when he wrote on the ordinary planispheric astrolabe and when he wrote on the two most common quadrants (the astrolabic and the trigonometric varieties).[22] These two common quadrants were modified versions of the sine quadrant. He also created a set of tables that had values of spherical astronomical functions for prayer times. The tables displayed the times for the morning, afternoon, and evening prayers. The latitude that was used to create the table was 34\u00b0 (which was correspondent to a location north of Damascus).[4]", "36477942": "Yuval Peres (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1; born 5 October 1963) is a mathematician known for his research in probability theory, ergodic theory, mathematical analysis, theoretical computer science, and in particular for topics such as fractals and Hausdorff measure, random walks, Brownian motion, percolation and Markov chain mixing times.

Rodgers' personal physical puzzle collection was legendary.[4][5]/nThrough his monthly Mathematical Games column and his extensive correspondence, Gardner had created a large network of fans and had achieved an almost cult-like status.[1][6]  Rodgers knew many of the other people in the ever expanding Gardner circle and a decade after Gardner stopped writing his column, Rodgers decided that a conference in his honor was merited.  He managed to convince the usually shy Gardner to attend and then used Gardner's own voluminous and meticulous files to assemble a list of invitees.  They called it The Gathering 4 Gardner, which was subsequently shortened to G4G. Gardner attended the first G4G in 1993 and the second, dubbed G4G2, in 1996.[6]  Since then, there has been a gathering every two years up to G4G13 in 2018, and then G4G14 in 2022, delayed because of the Covid pandemic.  For the first two decades G4G was sustained mostly by Rodgers with \"seemingly unfettered access to his personal time and resources.\"[3]/nBy the time of G4G7 in 2006, the conference was attracting a wide assortment of people, including Mathematician Daina Taimina, gaming hobbyist Lou Zocchi, puzzle designer Wei-Hwa Huang, magic square expert Lee Sallows, puzzle historian David Singmaster, computer scientist and origamist Ron Resch, and spidron inventor D\u00e1niel Erd\u00e9ly\u2014in addition to establishment mathematicians John H.

After graduating from Boys High School in Brooklyn, he studied mathematics at New York University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1930, a master's degree in 1932, and a doctorate (Ph.D.) in 1936. He continued at NYU as an instructor until 1942.[1]/nDuring World War II, Kline was posted to the Signal Corps (United States Army) stationed at Belmar, New Jersey. Designated a physicist, he worked in the engineering lab where radar was developed. After the war he continued investigating electromagnetism, and from 1946 to 1966 was director of the division for electromagnetic research at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences./nKline resumed his mathematical teaching at NYU, becoming a full professor in 1952.\nHe taught at New York University until 1975, and wrote many papers and more than a dozen books on various aspects of mathematics and particularly teaching of mathematics. He repeatedly stressed the need to teach the applications and usefulness of mathematics rather than expecting students to enjoy it for its own sake. Similarly, he urged that mathematical research concentrate on solving problems posed in other fields rather than building structures of interest only to other mathematicians.\nOne can get a sense of Kline's views on teaching from the following:/nI would urge every teacher to become an actor. His classroom technique must be enlivened by every device used in theatre. He can be and should be dramatic where appropriate. He must not only have facts but fire. He can utilize even eccentricities of behavior to stir up human interest. He should not be afraid of humor and should use it freely. Even an irrelevant joke or story perks up the class enormously.[2]/nMorris Kline was a protagonist in the curriculum reform in mathematics education that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, a period including the programs of the new math. An article by Kline in 1956 in The Mathematics Teacher was titled \"Mathematical texts and teachers: a tirade\".  Calling out teachers that blame students for their failures, he wrote \"There is a student problem, but there are also three other factors which are responsible for the present state of mathematical learning, namely, the curricula, the texts, and the teachers.\" The tirade touched a nerve, and changes started to happen. But then Kline switched to being a critic of some of the changes. In 1958, he wrote \"Ancients versus moderns: a new battle of the books\". The article was accompanied with a rebuttal by Albert E. Meder Jr. of Rutgers University.[3] He says, \"I find objectionable: first, vague generalizations, entirely undocumented, concerning views held by 'modernists', and second, the inferences drawn from what has not been said by the 'modernists'.\" \nBy 1966, Kline proposed an eight-page high school plan.[4] The rebuttal for this article was by James H. Zant; it asserted that Kline had \"a general lack of knowledge of what was going on in schools with reference to textbooks, teaching, and curriculum.\" Zant criticized Kline\u2019s writing for \"vagueness, distortion of facts, undocumented statements and overgeneralization.\"/nIn 1966[5] and 1970,[6] Kline issued two further criticisms. In 1973, St. Martin\u2019s Press contributed to the dialogue by publishing Kline\u2019s critique, Why Johnny Can\u2019t Add: the Failure of the New Math. Its opening chapter is a parody of instruction as students\u2019 intuitions are challenged by the new jargon. The book recapitulates the debates from Mathematics Teacher, with Kline conceding some progress: He cites Howard Fehr of Columbia University who sought to unify the subject through its general concepts: sets, operations, mappings, relations, and structures in the Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study./nIn 1977, Kline turned to undergraduate university education; he took on the academic mathematics establishment with his Why the Professor Can't Teach: The Dilemma of University Education. Kline argues that the onus on professors in the United States to conduct research misdirects the scholarly method that characterizes good teaching. He lauds scholarship as expressed by expository writing or reviews of original work of others. For scholarship, he expects critical attitudes to topics, materials and methods. Among the rebuttals are those by D.T. Finkbeiner, Harry Pollard, and Peter Hilton.[7] Pollard conceded, \"The society in which learning is admired and pursued for its own sake has disappeared.\" The Hilton review was more direct: Kline has \"placed in the hand of enemies\u2026[a] weapon\". Having started in 1956 as an agitator for change in mathematics education, he became a critic of some trends. Skilled expositor that he was, editors frequently felt his expressions were best tempered with rebuttal./nIn considering what motivated Morris Kline to protest, consider Professor Meder\u2019s opinion:[8]/nI am wondering whether in point of fact, Professor Kline really likes mathematics [...] I think that he is at heart a physicist, or perhaps a \u2018natural philosopher\u2019, not a mathematician, and that the reason he does not like the proposals for orienting the secondary school college preparatory mathematics curriculum to the diverse needs of the twentieth century by making use of some concepts developed in mathematics in the last hundred years or so is not that this is bad mathematics, but that it minimizes the importance of physics./nIt might appear so, as Kline recalls E. H. Moore\u2019s recommendation to combine science and mathematics at the high school level.[9] But closer reading shows Kline calling mathematics a \"part of man\u2019s efforts to understand and master his world\", and he sees that role in a broad spectrum of sciences./nIn Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty (ch. XIII: \"The Isolation of Mathematics\"), Kline deplored the way mathematics research was being conducted, complaining that often mathematicians, not willing to become acquainted with the (sometimes deep) context needed to solve applied problems in sciences, prefer to invent pure mathematics problems that are not necessarily of any consequence. Kline also blamed the publish or perish academic culture for this state of affairs.[citation needed]", "46996476": "Shambhu Dayal Sinvhal (20 November 1923 - 27 May 2015) was an Indian mathematician, astronomist and a former vice chancellor of Kumaon University.[1] Born on 20 November 1923 at Indore in the largest Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to B.

M. Turing Award for their contribution to computer science./nNygaard was born in Oslo and received his master's degree in mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1956. His thesis on abstract probability theory was entitled \"Theoretical Aspects of Monte Carlo methods\"./nNygaard worked full-time at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment from 1948 to 1960, in computing and programming (1948\u20131954) and operational research (1952\u20131960)./nFrom 1957 to 1960, he was head of the first operations research groups in the Norwegian defense establishment. He was cofounder and first chairman of the Norwegian Operational Research Society (1959\u20131964). In 1960, he was hired by the Norwegian Computing Center (NCC), responsible for building up the NCC as a research institute in the 1960s, becoming its Director of Research in 1962./nWith Ole-Johan Dahl, he developed the initial ideas for object-oriented programming (OOP) in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral (NR)) as part of the Simula I (1961\u20131965) and Simula 67 (1965\u20131968) simulation programming languages, which began as an extended variant and superset of ALGOL 60.[2] The languages introduced the core concepts of object-oriented programming: objects, classes, inheritance, virtual quantities, and multi-threaded (quasi-parallel) program execution. In 2004, the Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets (AITO) established an annual prize in the name of Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard to honor their pioneering work on object-orientation.

In the mid and late 1960s, he was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Norwegian Liberal Party, and chair of that party's Strategy Committee.[4] He was a minor ballot candidate in the 1949 parliamentary election.[5] During the intense political fight before the 1972 referendum on whether Norway should become a member of the European Common Market (later the European Union), he worked as coordinator for the many youth organisations that worked against membership./nFrom 1971 to 2001, Nygaard was a member of the Labour Party, and a member of their committees on research policies./nIn November 1988, he became chair of the Information Committee on Norway and the EEC, in August 1990 reorganized as Nei til EF an organization disseminating information about Norway's relation to the Common Market, and coordinating the efforts to keep Norway outside. (No to European Union membership for Norway, literally \"No to the EU\"). In 1993, when the EEC ratified the Maastricht Treaty and became the European Union the organization changed its name to reflect this. Nei til EF became the largest political organization in Norway (145,000 members in 1994, from a population of 4 million). Nygaard worked with Anne Enger Lahnstein, leader of the anti-EU Centre Party, in this campaign. In the referendum on 28 November 1994, \"Nei til EU\" succeeded: 52.2% of the electorate voted \"No\", and the voter participation was the highest ever in Norway's history: 88.8%. The strategy of the campaign, insisted by Nygaard, was that it had to be for something as well as against, i.e., the Scandinavian welfare state Nygaard considered threatened by the Maastricht Agreement./nHe resigned as chair in 1995, and was later the chair of the organization's strategy committee and a member of its council./nIn 1996 and 1997, Nygaard was the coordinator of the efforts to establish The European Anti-Maastricht Movement (TEAM), a cooperative network between national organizations opposing the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union (EMU) and the Maastricht Treaty in European countries within and outside the EU.

From 1935 to 1939, he didn't publish any research papers. According to Iyanaga, it was because of the pressure of teaching and other business to which he was not accustomed. He managed to solve a question of Artin on generalizing the principal ideal theorem  and this was published in 1939./nIyanaga did publish many papers which arose through several courses such as algebraic topology, functional analysis, and geometry, which he taught. He became professor at the University of Tokyo in 1942, during World War II. Towards the end of the war, many Japanese cities were bombarded and he had to find refuge in the countryside. He was busy in editing textbooks from primary and secondary schools and he continued to give courses and organise seminars./nAfter the end of the war, he joined the Science Council of Japan in 1947.

He was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of the numerous and brilliant compositions which, in an individual and original manner, have revived the great traditions of the Spanish drama\"./nHe was born in Madrid on 19 April 1832.[2] His father, a doctor and institute professor of Greek,[3] was from Aragon and his mother was from Navarra. He spent his childhood in Murcia, where he finished his elementary school education. It was there, at the Murcia Institute, where he first gained his love for mathematics. While still a child he read Goethe, Homer, and Balzac, readings that alternated with those of mathematicians like Gauss, Legendre, and Lagrange./nIn order to earn enough money to attend the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenier\u00eda de Caminos, Canales y Puertos (Engineering School of Roads, Channels and Ports), he moved at the age of fourteen to Madrid.[4] At the age of twenty, he left the Madrid School with a Civil Engineering degree, which he had obtained as first in his class, and he had to move to Almeria and Granada to begin working at his first job.[5]/nIn 1854 he began teaching a class at the Engineering School, working as a secretary there also. He taught mathematics, stereotomy, hydraulics, descriptive geometry, and differential and physical calculus from that year until 1868. From 1858 to 1860 he was also a professor at the Assistants' School of Public Works./nHis Problemas de geometr\u00eda anal\u00edtica (1865) and Teor\u00edas modernas de la f\u00edsica. Unidad de las fuerzas materiales (1867) were held in some regard. He became a member of the Society of Political Economy, helped to found the magazine La Revista, and took a prominent part in propagating free trade doctrines in the press and on the platform.[5]/nHe was clearly marked out for office, and when the revolution of 1868 overthrew the monarchy, he resigned his post for a place in the revolutionary cabinet.[5]/nEchegaray also entered politics later in his life. As a founding member of the republican Radical Democratic Party,[6] he enjoyed a career in the government sector, being appointed Minister of Education, of Public Works and Finance Minister successively between 1867 and 1874.[3] He retired from politics after the Bourbon restoration in 1874.[5]/nTheater had always been the love of Jos\u00e9 Echegaray's life. Although he had written earlier plays (La Hija natural and La \u00daltima Noche, both in 1867), he truly became a dramatist in 1874.[5] His plays reflected his sense of duty, which had made him famous during his time in the governmental offices. Dilemmas centered on duty and morality are the motif of his plays. He replicated the achievements of his predecessors of the Spanish Golden Age, remaining a prolific playwright./nHis most famous play is El gran Galeoto, a drama written in the grand nineteenth century manner of melodrama. It is about the poisonous effect that unfounded gossip has on a middle-aged man's happiness. Echegaray filled it with elaborate stage instructions that illuminate what we would now consider a hammy style of acting popular in the 19th century. Paramount Pictures filmed it as a silent with the title changed to The World and His Wife, and it was the basis for a later film The Great Galeoto. His most remarkable plays[citation needed] are O locura o santidad (Saint or Madman?, 1877); Mariana (1892); El estigma (1895); La duda, 1898; and El loco Dios (God, the fool, 1900)./nAmong his other famous plays are La esposa del vengador (1874) (The Avenger's Wife); En el pu\u00f1o de la espada (1875) (In the Sword's Handle); En el pilar y en la cruz (1878) (On the Stake and on the Cross); and Conflicto entre dos deberes (1882) (Conflict of Two Duties).[3]/nAlong with the Proven\u00e7al poet Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904, after having been nominated that year by a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, making him the first Spaniard to win the prize.[7]/nJos\u00e9 Echegaray maintained constant activity until his death on 14 September 1916 in Madrid.[2] His extensive work did not stop growing in his old age: in the final stage of his life he wrote 25 or 30 mathematical physics volumes. At the age of 83 he commented:/nI cannot die, because if I am going to write my mathematical physics encyclopedia, I need at least 25 more years./nSeveral streets in Spain are named after Jos\u00e9 Echegaray.

He provided the only testimony against Lt.\u00a0Gen.\u00a0John Cope at the court martial following the Battle of Prestonpans during the 1745 Jacobite uprising, but Having exaggerated his own accomplishments and lacking corroboration, Jack had his testimony discounted by the judges, who found Cope blameless. Jack was later involved in the development of achromatic lenses and his work on conic sections was a source for the mathematical sections of the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica./nRichard Jack was born in Scotland, in the Great Britain, probably between 1710 and 1715.[1] He married Elizabeth Brown on 14 March 1737,[2] around the time that he was teaching mathematics in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1737.[1] The couple later had a son, also named Richard.[3] Jack lectured on mathematics in Edinburgh, probably from 1739 to 1743 when he ran advertisements in the Caledonian Mercury.[1] He enjoyed the patronage of Hugh Hume-Campbell, the 3rd earl of Marchmont,[4] whom he was helping to observe sunspots.[5]/nDuring Charles Edward Stuart's Jacobite uprising in 1745, Jack remained loyal to George\u00a0II. Volunteering, he was entrusted with arranging some of the placement of the cannon at Edinburgh[6] as a fortifications engineer[4] under the guidance of Prof.\u00a0Colin MacLaurin.[7] He fled with most of the other Hanoverian forces ahead of Charles's unopposed entrance into Edinburgh on 17 September.[4] He then performed reconnaissance on the Stuart forces, counting and evaluating the men in the main force encamped on Arthur's Seat on 19 September.[6] He claimed that on the next day he had assisted with the planning of the artillery placement[8] and then personally fired two cannons, dislodging Stuart men from the church at Tranent. Other witnesses later averred Jack had claimed knowledge of the theory of gunnery but had not been involved in any of the army's strategy;[9] he had scouted some areas and helped direct artillery fire against the men in Tranent after almost being killed by them, but he had proven so completely inept at the cannons' operation that he never fired them himself.[9] The following day was the 21 September Battle of Prestonpans, during which Jack said he and four sailors worked the same two cannon while Lt.\u00a0Col.\u00a0Alan Whiteford and five sailors worked the other four; Lt.\u00a0Col.\u00a0Whiteford and other witnesses, however, said the nine sailors had fled before the battle, Jack had been sent away as useless and wasn't seen in the fighting, and Whiteford had been forced to operate all six guns on his own.[10] A year later, on 24 September 1746,[6] Jack was the only eyewitness to testify under oath at the court martial of the Whig commander Lt.\u00a0Gen.\u00a0John Cope.[1] He testified that he had seen three officers\u2014probably but not certainly including Cope\u2014flee the battlefield ahead of the general defeat after a Highland charge.[11] Given his inflated claims in other matters and lack of corroboration, however, the court discounted his testimony and exonerated Cope,[4][12] although the general never again held high position.[13]/nOn 25 May 1750, Jack received patent #656 for a \"quadrant for taking the altitude of the sun or moon by refraction\" and also \"a refracting telescope with four spherical lenses\"[14] jointly with the successful London instrument maker George Adams.[5][15] They claimed that their design offered 30 levels of magnification[16] and eliminated color aberrations. Although those claims were vigorously disputed by rival instrument makers,[17] Jack and Adams seem to have been vindicated by some practical and authoritative test in early 1752 and made a sizeable profit on the design.[18] None of the devices are known to still exist[19] but, on the basis of surviving records, Millburn considers it likely that representatives of the Admiralty or Board of Ordnance praised the patent telescope's high level of magnification\u2014the most essential attribute for long-range fire\u2014despite the accuracy of other complaints about its faults.[20] Jack advertised his lectures on math in London in 1751 and 1754.[1] He also lectured on experimental philosophy, fortification, and gunnery.[21]/nJack died in 1759.[1] The advertisement for his probate auction stated that he had been \"assistant engineer in the late expedition against Guadaloupe\",[3] a French colony captured by British forces under Maj.\u00a0Gen.\u00a0Peregrine Hopson after a six-month siege during the Seven Years' War. His effects included an air pump, microscope, telescopes, and other scientific instruments.[19]/nJack wrote three major works:[1]/nJack also composed most of a fourth book, The Doctrine of Proportion Geometrically Demonstrated, prior to 1745 but lost its manuscript when Stuart forces ransacked his home during their occupation of Edinburgh.[22]/nJack's work on conic sections was a major reference for the 1771 first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.[1] His work on a geometrical proof of the existence of God, however, was generally held in low repute and considered by MacFarlane to be \"one of the most absurd\" attempts to apply mathematical reasoning to theological questions.[23] Gillespie described it as \"a specimen of impure Mathematics, gone deplorably out of their road\".[24] Writing under the pen name Antitheos, George Simpson offered that Jack's arguments \"may afford grounds for curious speculation respecting that bias toward absurdity which is too frequently found to beset the human mind\".[25]", "18193447": "Kirik the Novgorodian (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446, romanized:\u00a0Kirik Novgorodets; 1110 \u2013 after 1158) was a monk of the Antoniev Monastery and later a hieromonk in the entourage of Archbishop Niphont of Novgorod (r. 1130\u20131156) famous for writing the first mathematical treatise in Eastern Slavdom, the Uchenie o chislakh (Russian: \u0423\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e \u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0445, \"Teaching on Numbers\"); he also wrote entries in the Novgorod First Chronicle in the 1140s and asked some of the 152 questions of Niphont in a theological work known as the Voproshanie Kirika (Russian: \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e, \"The Questions of Kirik\")[1]  He also translated the works of Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople as well as the Pentateuch./nKirik (a form of the name Kirill) wrote in the Uchenie o Chislakh (in full, Uchenie im zha vedati cheloveku chisla vsekh let), that \"my birthday was 26 years before now, that is 312 months, 1,300 weeks, and 9,500 without three days.\"  Since the Uchenie is dated to 1136, his birth year would have been 1110.

He integrated his research findings into a broader framework that explored the connections between diverse mathematical theories like recursion theory, type theory, category theory, and denotational semantics, and their practical implementation in functional languages.[9]/nHe then took an interdisciplinary approach to explore the role of physics in biology to comprehend extended criticality,[10]  anti-entropy,[11] and biological time.[12] Later, his research was directed toward the epistemology of theoretical biology, and  Interfaces of Physics, Biology, and Computing.[13]/nLongo used an interdisciplinary research approach to explore the relationship between several mathematical theories and computer science, particularly by investigating the mathematical semantics of programming languages.[14] His research contributed to constructing a mathematical framework regarding the theory of programming and generated results related to syntax and semantics. In related research he explored the structural properties of the set-theoretical models of lambda-calculus[15] and established new links to Recursion in Higher Types.[16][17] Collaborating with E. Moggi he characterized hereditary effective operations (HEO) and Kleene-Kreisel countable functionals.[18][19] In 1986, he further analyzed the computability in higher types and proved a completeness theorem for type checking using a model that was created based on the idea of recursion theory.[20]/nLongo's research in the field contributed towards the development of technical tools for polymorphism[21] and emphasized the connections between concepts utilized in computer science and mathematical structures derived from generalized recursion, demonstration theory, and category theory.[22] Between 1991 and 1993, he researched ad hoc polymorphism and demonstrated the characteristics of \"parametricity\" of second order systems[23][24] as well as developed extension of classical functional systems.[25][26] In addition, he proposed a novel analysis of the \"invariance levels\" of proofs through the concept of Prototype Proofs within Type Theory[27] which was later applied to investigate the concrete incompleteness theorem.[28]/nIn 1993, Longo made a thematic change in his research and elaborated the relatability of cognitive phenomena to the foundations of mathematical knowledge. He examined concepts such as mathematical continuity, infinity, computational representations[29][30] and also investigated the significance of action and movement in shaping the understanding of geometric space.[31] His work provided insights into the role of order and symmetries in the cognitive foundations of mathematics.[32] Furthermore, he explored the relationship between the invention of perspective in painting and its connection to the foundations of geometry and the concept of infinity in mathematics.[33]/nLongo's research in the field served as the initiating point for his project titled, Geometry and Cognition.[34] He has integrated the mathematical organization of space with the concept of causality in physics and natural science.[35][36] Together with Bailly, he developed a mathematical theory that focused on understanding the notions of complexity and information within geometric structures and evaluated the geometry associated with different levels of the organization.[37] In addition, he initiated a team at LIENS called Complexity and Morphological Information which has been responsible for projects like \"Physical singularities and effective computability\".[38]/nLongo has researched theoretical biology in collaboration with biologists and philosophers of biology.

In keeping with this curriculum and practices, Larson has written a book titled Mathematical Practices, with examples of how teachers can implement the curriculum and practices in Grades K-8.[27]/nBeginning in 2008, Larson Texts began a policy of having the content of its copyrights available free on the Internet.  Currently, this policy applies to all of its 7 middle school titles, its 3 high school titles, and its title Math & You./nIn 1992, Larson Texts formed a software division called Meridian Creative Group,  later renamed as Larson Learning.  The division developed and sold tutorial mathematics software for grades K through 8.[28]  In 2005,  Larson Learning was sold to Houghton Mifflin for $7 million.[29]/nIn 2013, Larson devised and designed an educational game called My Dear Aunt Sally.[30]  It was programmed by 3G Studios.  The game is intended for Grades 2-8 and teaches operations involving whole numbers, integers, fractions, decimals, and rational numbers./nDuring his first few years as an assistant professor at Penn State Erie, Larson continued to do research in the area of his dissertation. His research resulted in the publication of several articles, mostly dealing with the lattice of topologies.[31] By the mid-1970s, however, he switched his writing efforts to textbooks./nLarson is an active member of the three American mathematics teaching organizations: the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges, and the Mathematical Association of America.  He is a frequent speaker at each of these organizations'   state and national conferences.[32]/nRon and Deanna Larson have been active in philanthropy at Penn State University.

In 2008, Larson was unable to find a publisher for a new series for middle school to follow the 2006 \"Focal Point\" recommendations of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.[34] He then started a new company to publish the books, Big Ideas Learning, LLC.[35][36]/nAccording to his acceptance speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college.  \"In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment to talk with the math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, you have to remember that I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.'  Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no idea\u2014and so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964.\"[37]", "37592148": "Yasutaka Ihara (\u4f0a\u539f \u5eb7\u9686, Ihara Yasutaka; born 1938, Tokyo Prefecture) is a Japanese mathematician and professor emeritus at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences.

His father, Bernard Pompeius Bolzano, was an Italian who had moved to Prague, where he married Maria Cecilia Maurer who came from Prague's German-speaking family Maurer. Only two of their twelve children lived to adulthood./nBolzano entered the University of Prague in 1796 and studied mathematics, philosophy and physics. Starting in 1800, he also began studying theology, becoming a Catholic priest in 1804. He was appointed to the new chair of philosophy of religion at Prague University in 1805.[12] He proved to be a popular lecturer not only in religion but also in philosophy, and he was elected Dean of the Philosophical Faculty in 1818./nBolzano alienated many faculty and church leaders with his teachings of the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social and economic systems that would direct the nation's interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations. His political convictions, which he was inclined to share with others with some frequency, eventually proved to be too liberal for the Austrian authorities. On December 24, 1819, he was removed from his professorship (upon his refusal to recant his beliefs) and was exiled to the countryside and then devoted his energies to his writings on social, religious, philosophical, and mathematical matters./nAlthough forbidden to publish in mainstream journals as a condition of his exile, Bolzano continued to develop his ideas and publish them either on his own or in obscure Eastern European journals. In 1842 he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1848./nBolzano made several original contributions to mathematics. His overall philosophical stance was that, contrary to much of the prevailing mathematics of the era, it was better not to introduce intuitive ideas such as time and motion into mathematics.[14] To this end, he was one of the earliest mathematicians to begin instilling rigor into mathematical analysis with his three chief mathematical works Beytr\u00e4ge zu einer begr\u00fcndeteren Darstellung der Mathematik (1810), Der binomische Lehrsatz (1816) and Rein analytischer Beweis (1817). These works presented \"...a sample of a new way of developing analysis\", whose ultimate goal would not be realized until some fifty years later when they came to the attention of Karl Weierstrass.[15]/nTo the foundations of mathematical analysis he contributed the introduction of a fully rigorous \u03b5\u2013\u03b4 definition of a mathematical limit.  Bolzano was the first to recognize the greatest lower bound property of the real numbers.[16] Like several others of his day, he was skeptical[dubious  \u2013 discuss] of the possibility of Gottfried Leibniz's infinitesimals, that had been the earliest putative foundation for differential calculus.  Bolzano's notion of a limit was similar to the modern one: that a limit, rather than being a relation among infinitesimals, must instead be cast in terms of how the dependent variable approaches a definite quantity as the independent variable approaches some other definite quantity./nBolzano also gave the first purely analytic proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, which had originally been proven by Gauss from geometrical considerations. He also gave the first purely analytic proof of the intermediate value theorem (also known as Bolzano's theorem). Today he is mostly remembered for the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem, which Karl Weierstrass developed independently and published years after Bolzano's first proof and which was initially called the Weierstrass theorem until Bolzano's earlier work was rediscovered.[17]/nBolzano's posthumously published work Paradoxien des Unendlichen (The Paradoxes of the Infinite) (1851) was greatly admired by many of the eminent logicians who came after him, including Charles Sanders Peirce, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind. Bolzano's main claim to fame, however, is his 1837 Wissenschaftslehre (Theory of Science), a work in four volumes that covered not only philosophy of science in the modern sense but also logic, epistemology and scientific pedagogy. The logical theory that Bolzano developed in this work has come to be acknowledged as ground-breaking. Other works are a four-volume Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft (Textbook of the Science of Religion) and the metaphysical work Athanasia, a defense of the immortality of the soul. Bolzano also did valuable work in mathematics, which remained virtually unknown until Otto Stolz rediscovered many of his lost journal articles and republished them in 1881./nIn his 1837 Wissenschaftslehre Bolzano attempted to provide logical foundations for all sciences, building on abstractions like part-relation, abstract objects, attributes, sentence-shapes, ideas and propositions in themselves, sums and sets, collections, substances, adherences, subjective ideas, judgments, and sentence-occurrences. These attempts were an extension of his earlier thoughts in the philosophy of mathematics, for example his 1810 Beitr\u00e4ge where he emphasized the distinction between the objective relationship between logical consequences and our subjective recognition of these connections. For Bolzano, it was not enough that we merely have confirmation of natural or mathematical truths, but rather it was the proper role of the sciences (both pure and applied) to seek out justification in terms of the fundamental truths that may or may not appear to be obvious to our intuitions./nBolzano begins his work by explaining what he means by theory of science, and the relation between our knowledge, truths and sciences. Human knowledge, he states, is made of all truths (or true propositions) that men know or have known. However, this is a very small fraction of all the truths that exist, although still too much for one human being to comprehend. Therefore, our knowledge is divided into more accessible parts. Such a collection of truths is what Bolzano calls a science (Wissenschaft). It is important to note that not all true propositions of a science have to be known to men; hence, this is how we can make discoveries in a science./nTo better understand and comprehend the truths of a science, men have created textbooks (Lehrbuch), which of course contain only the true propositions of the science known to men. But how to know where to divide our knowledge, that is, which truths belong together? Bolzano explains that we will ultimately know this through some reflection, but that the resulting rules of how to divide our knowledge into sciences will be a science in itself. This science, that tells us which truths belong together and should be explained in a textbook, is the Theory of Science (Wissenschaftslehre)./nIn the Wissenschaftslehre, Bolzano is mainly concerned with three realms:/n(1) The realm of language, consisting in words and sentences. \n(2) The realm of thought, consisting in subjective ideas and judgements. \n(3) The realm of logic, consisting in objective ideas (or ideas in themselves) and propositions in themselves./nBolzano devotes a great part of the Wissenschaftslehre to an explanation of these realms and their relations./nTwo distinctions play a prominent role in his system. First, the distinction between parts and wholes. For instance, words are parts of sentences, subjective ideas are parts of judgments, objective ideas are parts of propositions in themselves. Second, all objects divide into those that exist, which means that they are causally connected and located in time and/or space, and those that do not exist. Bolzano's original claim is that the logical realm is populated by objects of the latter kind./nSatz an Sich is a basic notion in Bolzano's Wissenschaftslehre. It is introduced at the very beginning, in section 19. Bolzano first introduces the notions of proposition (spoken or written or thought or in itself) and idea (spoken or written or thought or in itself). \"The grass is green\" is a proposition (Satz): in this connection of words, something is said or asserted. \"Grass\", however, is only an idea (Vorstellung). Something is represented by it, but it does not assert anything. Bolzano's notion of proposition is fairly broad: \"A rectangle is round\" is a proposition \u2014 even though it is false by virtue of self-contradiction \u2014 because it is composed in an intelligible manner out of intelligible parts./nBolzano does not give a complete definition of a Satz an Sich (i.e. proposition in itself) but he gives us just enough information to understand what he means by it. A proposition in itself (i) has no existence (that is: it has no position in time or place), (ii) is either true or false, independent of anyone knowing or thinking that it is true or false, and (iii) is what is 'grasped' by thinking beings. So a written sentence ('Socrates has wisdom') grasps a proposition in itself, namely the proposition [Socrates has wisdom]. The written sentence does have existence (it has a certain location at a certain time, say it is on your computer screen at this very moment) and expresses the proposition in itself which is in the realm of in itself (i.e. an sich). (Bolzano's use of the term an sich differs greatly from that of Kant; for Kant's use of the term see an sich.)[18]/nEvery proposition in itself is composed out of ideas in themselves (for simplicity, we will use proposition to mean \"proposition in itself\" and idea to refer to an objective idea or idea in itself). Ideas are negatively defined as those parts of a proposition that are themselves not propositions. A proposition consists of at least three ideas, namely: a subject idea, a predicate idea and the copula (i.e. 'has', or another form of to have). (Though there are propositions which contain propositions, we won't take them into consideration right now.)/nBolzano identifies certain types of ideas. There are simple ideas that have no parts (as an example Bolzano uses [something]), but there are also complex ideas that consist of other ideas (Bolzano uses the example of [nothing], which consists of the ideas [not] and [something]). Complex ideas can have the same content (i.e. the same parts) without being the same \u2014 because their components are differently connected. The idea [A black pen with blue ink] is different from the idea [A blue pen with black ink] though the parts of both ideas are the same.[19]/nIt is important to understand that an idea does not need to have an object. Bolzano uses object to denote something that is represented by an idea. An idea that has an object, represents that object. But an idea that does not have an object represents nothing. (Don't get confused here by terminology: an objectless idea is an idea without a representation.)/nConsider, for further explanation, an example used by Bolzano. The idea [a round square], does not have an object, because the object that ought to be represented is self-contrary. A different example is the idea [nothing] which certainly does not have an object. However, the proposition [the idea of a round square has complexity] has as its subject-idea [the idea of a round square]. This subject-idea does have an object, namely the idea [a round square]. But, that idea does not have an object./nBesides objectless ideas, there are ideas that have only one object, e.g. the idea [the first man on the moon] represents only one object. Bolzano calls these ideas 'singular ideas'. Obviously there are also ideas that have many objects (e.g. [the citizens of Amsterdam]) and even infinitely many objects (e.g. [a prime number]).[20]/nBolzano has a complex theory of how we are able to sense things. He explains sensation by means of the term intuition, in German called Anschauung. An intuition is a simple idea, it has only one object (Einzelvorstellung), but besides that, it is also unique (Bolzano needs this to explain sensation). Intuitions (Anschauungen) are objective ideas, they belong to the an sich realm, which means that they don't have existence. As said, Bolzano's argumentation for intuitions is by an explanation of sensation./nWhat happens when you sense a real existing object, for instance a rose, is this: the different aspects of the rose, like its scent and its color, cause in you a change. That change means that before and after sensing the rose, your mind is in a different state. So sensation is in fact a change in your mental state. How is this related to objects and ideas? Bolzano explains that this change, in your mind, is essentially a simple idea (Vorstellung), like, 'this smell' (of this particular rose). This idea represents; it has as its object the change. Besides being simple, this change must also be unique. This is because literally you can't have the same experience twice, nor can two people, who smell the same rose at the same time, have exactly the same experience of that smell (although they will be quite alike). So each single sensation causes a single (new) unique and simple idea with a particular change as its object. Now, this idea in your mind is a subjective idea, meaning that it is in you at a particular time. It has existence. But this subjective idea must correspond to, or has as a content, an objective idea. This is where Bolzano brings in intuitions (Anschauungen); they are the simple, unique and objective ideas that correspond to our subjective ideas of changes caused by sensation. So for each single possible sensation, there is a corresponding objective idea. Schematically the whole process is like this: whenever you smell a rose, its scent causes a change in you. This change is the object of your subjective idea of that particular smell. That subjective idea corresponds to the intuition or Anschauung.[21]/nAccording to Bolzano, all propositions are composed out of three (simple or complex) elements: a subject, a predicate and a copula. Instead of the more traditional copulative term 'is', Bolzano prefers 'has'. The reason for this is that 'has', unlike 'is', can connect a concrete term, such as 'Socrates', to an abstract term such as 'baldness'. \"Socrates has baldness\" is, according to Bolzano, preferable to \"Socrates is bald\" because the latter form is less basic: 'bald' is itself composed of the elements 'something', 'that', 'has' and 'baldness'. Bolzano also reduces existential propositions to this form: \"Socrates exists\" would simply become \"Socrates has existence (Dasein)\"./nA major role in Bolzano's logical theory is played by the notion of variations: various logical relations are defined in terms of the changes in truth value that propositions incur when their non-logical parts are replaced by others. Logically analytical propositions, for instance, are those in which all the non-logical parts can be replaced without change of truth value. Two propositions are 'compatible' (vertr\u00e4glich) with respect to one of their component parts x if there is at least one term that can be inserted that would make both true. A proposition Q is 'deducible' (ableitbar) from a proposition P, with respect to certain of their non-logical parts, if any replacement of those parts that makes P true also makes Q true. If a proposition is deducible from another with respect to all its non-logical parts, it is said to be 'logically deducible'.\nBesides the relation of deducibility, Bolzano also has a stricter relation of 'grounding' (Abfolge).[22] This is an asymmetric relation that obtains between true propositions, when one of the propositions is not only deducible from, but also explained by the other./nBolzano distinguishes five meanings the words true and truth have in common usage, all of which Bolzano takes to be unproblematic. The meanings are listed in order of properness:/nI.\tAbstract objective meaning: Truth signifies an attribute that may apply to a proposition, primarily to a proposition in itself, namely the attribute on the basis of which the proposition expresses something that in reality is as is expressed. Antonyms: falsity, falseness, falsehood./nII.\tConcrete objective meaning: (a) Truth signifies a proposition that has the attribute truth in the abstract objective meaning. Antonym: (a) falsehood./nIII.\tSubjective meaning: (a) Truth signifies a correct judgment. Antonym: (a) mistake./nIV.\tCollective meaning: Truth signifies a body or multiplicity true propositions or judgments (e.g. the biblical truth)./nV.\tImproper meaning: True signifies that some object is in reality what some denomination states it to be.  (e.g. the true God). Antonyms: false, unreal, illusory./nBolzano's primary concern is with the concrete objective meaning: with concrete objective truths or truths in themselves. All truths in themselves are a kind of propositions in themselves. They do not exist, i.e. they are not spatiotemporally located as thought and spoken propositions are. However, certain propositions have the attribute of being a truth in itself. Being a thought proposition is not a part of the concept of a truth in itself, notwithstanding the fact that, given God's omniscience, all truths in themselves are also thought truths. The concepts 'truth in itself' and 'thought truth' are interchangeable, as they apply to the same objects, but they are not identical./nBolzano offers as the correct definition of (abstract objective) truth: a proposition is true if it expresses something that applies to its object. The correct definition of a (concrete objective) truth must thus be: a truth is a proposition that expresses something that applies to its object. This definition applies to truths in themselves, rather than to thought or known truths, as none of the concepts figuring in this definition are subordinate to a concept of something mental or known./nBolzano proves in \u00a7\u00a731\u201332 of his Wissenschaftslehre three things:/nThere is at least one truth in itself (concrete objective meaning):/nB. There is more than one truth in itself:/nC. There are infinitely many truths in themselves:/nA known truth has as its parts (Bestandteile) a truth in itself and a judgment (Bolzano, Wissenschaftslehre \u00a726). A judgment is a thought which states a true proposition. In judging (at least when the matter of the judgment is a true proposition), the idea of an object is being connected in a certain way with the idea of a characteristic (\u00a7 23). In true judgments, the relation between the idea of the object and the idea of the characteristic is an actual/existent relation (\u00a728)./nEvery judgment has as its matter a proposition, which is either true or false. Every judgment exists, but not \"f\u00fcr sich\". Judgments, namely, in contrast with propositions in themselves, are dependent on subjective mental activity. Not every mental activity, though, has to be a judgment; recall that all judgments have as matter propositions, and hence all judgments need to be either true or false. Mere presentations or thoughts are examples of mental activities which do not necessarily need to be stated (behaupten), and so are not judgments (\u00a7 34)./nJudgments that have as its matter true propositions can be called cognitions (\u00a736). Cognitions are also dependent on the subject, and so, opposed to truths in themselves, cognitions do permit degrees; a proposition can be more or less known, but it cannot be more or less true. Every cognition implies necessarily a judgment, but not every judgment is necessarily cognition, because there are also judgments that are not true. Bolzano maintains that there are no such things as false cognitions, only false judgments (\u00a734)./nBolzano came to be surrounded by a circle of friends and pupils who spread his thoughts about (the so-called Bolzano Circle), but the effect of his thought on philosophy initially seemed destined to be slight.[3]/nAlois H\u00f6fler (1853\u20131922), a former student of Franz Brentano and Alexius Meinong, who subsequently become professor of pedagogy at the University of Vienna, created the \"missing link between the Vienna Circle and the Bolzano tradition in Austria.\"[23] Bolzano's work was rediscovered, however, by Edmund Husserl[4] and Kazimierz Twardowski,[6] both students of Brentano.

(There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father's side.[4])/nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor Schubert (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum./nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father's student days.[5] She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich./nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies.[6] Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of A. N. Strannoliubskii\u00a0[ru].[7] In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.[8]/nAlthough the word nihilist (\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438):/nAfter the famous writer Ivan Turgenev used the word nihilist to refer to Bazarov, the young hero of his 1862 novel Fathers and Children, a certain segment of the \"new people\" adopted that name as well, despite its negative connotations in most quarters.... For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.[9]:\u200a2\u20134/nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.[10]/nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the University of Heidelberg.  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.[2]:\u200a87\u201389\u200a  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology./nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot's Sunday salons.[10] There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing Middlemarch at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"[11]   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section)./nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university./nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.[2]:\u200a104\u2013106\u200a With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save Victor Jaclard.[2]:\u200a107\u2013108/nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn's rings, and on elliptic integrals\u2014to the University of G\u00f6ttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.[10]/nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions./nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her sex.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.[12][2]/nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time./nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.[10]/nThat year, with the help of the mathematician G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden.[10] Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.[13]/nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".[10][14] Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"Kovalevskaya top\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is \"completely integrable\" other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.[15]/nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.[2]:\u200a218\u200a After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia./nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, A Russian Childhood, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, Nihilist Girl (1890)./nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband,[16] but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.[3]:\u200a18/nKovalevskaya died of epidemic influenza complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.[2]:\u200a231\u200a She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen./nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,[2] a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina[17] (translated into English by M. Burov with the title Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R. Cooke.[10]/nSonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day is a grant-making program of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics. While the AWM currently does not have grant money to support this program, multiple universities continue the program with their own funding.[18]/nThe Kovalevsky Lecture is sponsored annually by the AWM and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics./nThe Kovalevskaia Fund, founded in 1985 with the purpose of supporting women in science in developing countries, was named in her honor./nThe lunar crater Kovalevskaya is named in her honor./nA gymnasium (high school) and progymnasium in Vilnius and gymnasium in Velikiye Luki are named after Sofya Kovalevskaya./nThe Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation of Germany bestows a bi-annual Sofia Kovalevskaya Award to promising young researchers./nSaint Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm have streets named in honor of Kovalevskaya./nOn 30 June 2021, a satellite named after her (\u00d1uSat 22 or \"Sofya\", COSPAR 2021-059AS) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 constellation./nKovalevskaya has been the subject of three film and TV biographies./nThis article incorporates material from Sofia Kovalevskaya on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.", "2563194": "George Szekeres AM FAA (Hungarian: [\u02c8s\u025bk\u025br\u025b\u0283]; 29 May 1911 \u2013 28 August 2005) was a Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician./nSzekeres was born in Budapest, Hungary, as Szekeres Gy\u00f6rgy and received his degree in chemistry at the Technical University of Budapest.

His doctoral advisor was Harley Flanders.[2] A Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at University of California, San Diego, Frankel was a longtime member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He is known for his work in global differential geometry, Morse theory, and relativity theory. He joined the UC San Diego mathematics department in 1965, after serving on the faculties at Stanford University and Brown University./nIn the 1930s, John Synge established what is now known as Synge's theorem, by applying the second variation formula for arclength to a minimal loop. Frankel adapted Synge's method to higher-dimensional objects. As a consequence, he was able to prove that, when given a positively curved Riemannian metric on a closed manifold, any two totally geodesic compact submanifolds must intersect if their dimensions are large enough. The idea is to apply Synge's method to a minimizing geodesic between the two submanifolds. By  the same approach, Frankel proved that complex submanifolds of positively curved K\u00e4hler manifolds must intersect if their dimensions are sufficiently large. These results were later extended by Samuel Goldberg and Shoshichi Kobayashi to allow positivity of the holomorphic bisectional curvature.[3]/nInspired by work of Ren\u00e9 Thom, Frankel and Aldo Andreotti gave a new proof of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem using Morse theory. The crux of the argument is the algebraic fact that the eigenvalues of the real part of a complex quadratic form must occur in pairs of the form \u00b1z. This becomes relevant in the context of Lefschetz's theorem, by considering a Morse function given by the distance to a fixed point. The second-order analysis at critical points is immediately aided by the above algebraic analysis, and the homology vanishing phenomena follows via the Morse inequalities.[4]/nGiven a Killing vector field for which the corresponding one-parameter group of isometries acts by holomorphic mappings, Frankel used the Cartan formula to show that the interior product of the vector field with the K\u00e4hler form is closed. Assuming that the first Betti number is zero, the de Rham theorem applies to construct a function whose critical points coincide with the zeros of the vector field. A second-order analysis at the critical  points shows that the set of zeros of the vector field is a nondegenerate critical manifold for the function. Following Raoul Bott's development of Morse theory for critical manifolds, Frankel was able to establish that the Betti numbers of the manifold are fully encoded by the Betti numbers of the critical manifolds, together with the index of his Morse function along these manifolds. These ideas of Frankel were later important for works of Michael Atiyah and Nigel Hitchin, among others.[5][6]/nArticles/nTextbooks", "43228330": "Alfred Aeppli was a Swiss mathematician.

Royal Engineers, Gosset attended Winchester College before matriculating as Winchester Scholar in natural sciences and mathematics at New College, Oxford. Upon graduating in 1899, he joined the brewery of Arthur Guinness & Son in Dublin, Ireland; he spent the rest of his 38-year career at Guinness.[1][2]/nGosset had three children with Marjory Gosset (n\u00e9e Phillpotts). Harry Gosset (1907\u20131965) was a consultant paediatrician; Bertha Marian Gosset (1909\u20132004) was a geographer and nurse; the youngest, Ruth Gosset (1911\u20131953) married the Oxford mathematician Douglas Roaf and had five children./nIn his job as Head Experimental Brewer at Guinness, the self-trained Gosset developed new statistical methods \u2013 both in the brewery and on the farm \u2013 now central to the design of experiments, to proper use of significance testing on repeated trials, and to analysis of economic significance (an early instance of decision theory interpretation of statistics) and more, such as his small-sample, stratified, and repeated balanced experiments on barley for proving the best yielding varieties.[3] Gosset acquired that knowledge by study, by trial and error, by cooperating with others, and by spending two terms in 1906\u20131907 in the Biometrics laboratory of Karl Pearson.[4] Gosset and Pearson had a good relationship.[4] Pearson helped Gosset with the mathematics of his papers, including the 1908 papers, but had little appreciation of their importance. The papers addressed the brewer's concern with small samples; biometricians like Pearson, on the other hand, typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.[2]/nGosset's first publication came in 1907, \"On the Error of Counting with a Haemacytometer,\" in which \u2013 unbeknownst to Gosset aka \"Student\" \u2013 he rediscovered the Poisson distribution.[3] Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery. The economic historian Stephen Ziliak discovered in the Guinness Archives that to prevent further disclosure of confidential information, the Guinness Board of Directors allowed its scientists to publish research on condition that they do not mention \"1) beer, 2) Guinness, or 3) their own surname\".[4] To Ziliak, Gosset seems to have gotten his pen name \"Student\" from his 1906\u20131907 notebook on counting yeast cells with a haemacytometer, \"The Student's Science Notebook\"[1][5] Thus his most noteworthy achievement is now called Student's, rather than Gosset's, t-distribution and test of statistical significance.[2]/nGosset published most of his 21 academic papers, including The probable error of a mean, in Pearson's journal Biometrika under the pseudonym Student.[6] It was, however, not Pearson but Ronald A. Fisher who appreciated the understudied importance of Gosset's small-sample work. Fisher wrote to Gosset in 1912 explaining that Student's z-distribution should be divided by degrees of freedom not total sample size. From 1912 to 1934 Gosset and Fisher would exchange more than 150 letters. In 1924, Gosset wrote in a letter to Fisher, \"I am sending you a copy of Student's Tables as you are the only man that's ever likely to use them!\" Fisher believed that Gosset had effected a \"logical revolution\".[3] In a special issue of Metron in 1925 Student published the corrected tables, now called Student's t \n\n\n\nz\n=\n\n\nt\n\nn\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle z={\\frac {t}{\\sqrt {n-1}}}}\n\n. In the same volume Fisher contributed applications of Student's t-distribution to regression analysis.[3]/nAlthough introduced by others, Studentized residuals are named in Student's honour because, like the problem that led to Student's t-distribution, the idea of adjusting for estimated standard deviations is central to that concept.[7]/nGosset's interest in the cultivation of barley led him to speculate that the design of experiments should aim not only at improving the average yield but also at breeding varieties whose yield was insensitive to variation in soil and climate (that is, \"robust\"). Gosset called his innovation \"balanced layout\", because treatments and controls are allocated in a balanced fashion to stratified growing conditions, such as differential soil fertility.[8] Gosset's balanced principle was challenged by Ronald Fisher, who preferred randomized designs. The Bayesian Harold Jeffreys, and Gosset's close associates Jerzy Neyman and Egon S. Pearson sided with Gosset's balanced designs of experiments; however, as Ziliak (2014) has shown, Gosset and Fisher would strongly disagree for the rest of their lives about the meaning and interpretation of balanced versus randomized experiments, as they had earlier clashed on the role of bright-line rules of statistical significance.[4]/nIn 1935, at the age of 59, Gosset left Dublin to take up the position of Head Brewer at a new (and second) Guinness brewery at Park Royal in northwestern London. In September 1937 Gosset was promoted to Head Brewer of all Guinness. He died one month later, aged 61, in Beaconsfield, England, of a heart attack.[1]/nGosset was a friend of both Pearson and Fisher, a noteworthy achievement, for each had a massive ego and a loathing for the other.

The non-execution was explained by many as a reward for Giordano's denunciation;[5] others state that it was due to intercession by his father or Fergola at the Bourbon court.[8] Giordano fled to France where he worked as cadastral surveyor in the French department of Aube; in 1824, he became a naturalized French citizen and changed his surname to Jourdan./nIn 1786, Giordano already presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences of Naples a memoir entitled Continuazione del medesimo argomento,[9] which opened the doors of the Academy to him. Shortly thereafter, in 1788, he became famous for solving the following problem: \"Given a circle and n points of its plane, inscribe in this circle a polygon whose sides, possibly prolonged, pass, according to a certain order, through the given points\";[10] this problem was a generalization of the \"problem of Pappus\", which had been already solved for the case of n=3 aligned points,[11] and the \"problem of  Castillon\", solved by the latter in 1776, proposed to him by Cramer, for n=3 points but still arranged in the plane.[12] Carnot thought that \"Ottajano\", the birthplace of Giordano, was a noble predicate rather than a town, and he called the young mathematician \"Ottajano\" in his publications;[13] after this, he began to be referred to as \"Ottajano\" in subsequent scientific publications.[7]", "46865643": "Peter Paul Nikolas Orlik (born 12 November 1938, in Budapest)[1] is an American mathematician, known for his research on topology, algebra, and combinatorics.[2]/nOrlik earned in 1961 his bachelor's degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim and in 1966 his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan under Frank Raymond with thesis Necessary conditions for the homeomorphism of Seifert manifolds.[3] He became in 1966 an assistant professor and in 1973 a full professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison./nOrlik was in the academic year 1971/72 a visiting professor in Oslo.

He works on Seifert manifolds, singularity theory, braid theory, reflection groups, invariant theory, and hypergeometric integrals.[2] He was, with Louis Solomon and Hiroaki Terao, a pioneer of the theory of arrangements of hyperplanes in complex space./nIn 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5]", "13606126": "Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action thriller film directed by John McTiernan (who directed the first installment). It was written by Jonathan Hensleigh, based on the screenplay Simon Says by Hensleigh and on the characters created by Roderick Thorp for his 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever. Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard film series, after Die Hard 2 (1990). It is followed by Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013)./nThe film stars Bruce Willis as NYPD Lieutenant John McClane and Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, who team up to stop an East German terrorist group headed by \"Simon\" (Jeremy Irons) who have planted bombs across New York City and plot to steal the gold bullion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was released on May 19, 1995 to mixed reviews and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The film later gained a cult following and is widely considered to be the best sequel in the franchise, as well as one of the best action films of the 1990s.[b]/nThe Bonwit Teller department store in New York City is blown up by a bomb during the morning commute. A man identifying himself as \"Simon\" telephones the New York City Police Department (NYPD), claiming responsibility and threatening to detonate another bomb unless policeman John McClane is sent to Harlem wearing a sandwich board with a racist slur on it. The NYPD comply and send McClane to Harlem, where he is confronted by an electrician and shop owner named Zeus Carver. McClane explains his situation before a group of gang members also confront McClane over his sign. Carver intervenes and saves McClane, and they escape in a taxi./nThey arrive at 1 Police Plaza, where Simon demands that the pair follow a timed challenge or he will set off more bombs. They agree and McClane eventually boards the 3 train heading towards the Wall Street station in order to defuse a bomb that Simon planted on it. Carver arrives at the station before McClane finds the bomb and throws it on the tracks just as it explodes. McClane and Carver regroup with the NYPD and meet some FBI and CIA agents, who initially inform the pair that Simon is \"Peter Krieg\", a mercenary and former colonel in the National People's Army. They then reveal that Krieg's real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber, who McClane killed years earlier in Los Angeles./nSimon then places another call to the NYPD, informing them that he has planted an explosive in one of the city's elementary schools which is set to explode once class ends and can be triggered by the same radio frequencies utilized by law enforcement. Simon offers to give the authorities the school's location if McClane and Carver follow another timed challenge, warning that he will detonate the explosive if any evacuation attempts are carried out. While the pair solve Simon's next challenge, the NYPD begin to search all elementary schools in the city. McClane realizes that Simon is attempting to distract the NYPD away from Wall Street, which has no schools, and travels to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Building. He discovers that Simon's men have stolen $140 billion of gold bullion from its vault using dump trucks. He follows the trucks into a water tunnel while Carver continues Simon's challenges./nSimon blows up a cofferdam and floods the tunnel, but McClane escapes and reunites with Carver. Surviving a car chase with Simon's men, the pair find that they were carrying enough money to pay for a bridge toll. The pair sneak aboard a tanker docked in the Long Island Sound, but Simon's associates capture them and tie them up next to a bomb. Simon explains that his school threat was fake and broadcasts a message claiming that he is planning on destroying the tanker to destabilize the Western world's economy. After he leaves, Carver and McClane free themselves and escape the tanker just before the bomb detonates. As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the NYPD, McClane informs them that none of the bullion Simon's men stole was on the tanker's cargo hold, having deduced that Simon had intended to keep all of it for himself using his knowledge of the Gruber family's modus operandi./nWhile attempting to place a call to his estranged wife Holly, McClane glances at a bottle of aspirin given to him by Simon onboard the tanker and notices that it was purchased at a truck stop in the Canadian province of Quebec on the Canada\u2013United States border. McClane informs the NYPD of his discovery, and joins them and Carver as they rush towards a warehouse near the truck stop where Simon and his men are redistributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are quickly apprehended by law enforcement personnel, though Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, attacking McClane. McClane shoots at an overhead power line, which falls onto the helicopter, causing it to crash into a pole before it falls to the ground and explodes. While they are celebrating their triumph, Carver persuades McClane to place another call to Holly./nLike most of the films in the series, the premise of this film was repurposed from a stand-alone project. Various scripts were written for Die Hard 3; a number of them were ultimately rejected by Bruce Willis on the grounds that they felt like retreads of the action movies that came in the wake of the first film.[9] One script, originally titled Troubleshooter, had McClane fighting terrorists on a Caribbean cruise line, but was rejected for being too similar to Under Siege.[10] Troubleshooter was later repurposed for Speed 2: Cruise Control.[9]/nThe script ultimately used was intended for a film entitled Simon Says, originally positioned as a Brandon Lee vehicle and the character of Zeus was written with an actress in mind. Warner Bros. bought the script and rewrote it as a Lethal Weapon sequel. Warner Bros. later put the script in turnaround, only to be purchased by 20th Century Fox and rewritten as a Die Hard film.[9]/nAndy Vajna replaced Joel Silver and Larry Gordon as the producer on the film due to a fall-out with Willis.[10] As a result, Vajna's company, Cinergi, acquired foreign rights to the film. In most regions, the film rights were acquired by Disney and Summit Entertainment, while Fox retained domestic and Japan rights.[1] In July 1997, Cinergi sold its 50% stake in the film to Fox for $11.25 million.[11]/nLaurence Fishburne was originally offered the co-starring role of Zeus Carver, a part also written for him, but wanted a higher fee. Producer Andy Vajna held out on the deal. Fishburne had earlier turned down the role of Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction, which was eventually played by Samuel L. Jackson. Fishburne was talked out of playing Jules by his representatives who wanted him to only accept leading parts, otherwise he would be stuck career-wise as a supporting actor. Subsequently, Pulp Fiction premiered at the Cannes Film Festival during the same time as Fishburne's pay negotiations. Vajna also attended the event to support Willis who was appearing in the Quentin Tarantino film. Tarantino recalled that Vajna was so impressed by Jackson's performance that he offered him the part of Carver instead. Fishburne later filed a lawsuit against Vajna's company Cinergi for reneging on a verbal agreement.[12][13] The lawsuit took two years and Fishburne received a settlement.[14]/nMichael Kamen returned to score the third film, again incorporating other material into his score (most notably \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\", not included on the soundtrack album). Excerpts from his scores for Die Hard and Die Hard 2 were also included in the new film. The soundtrack was released by RCA Victor.[citation needed] In 2012, La-La Land Records released an expanded version of the soundtrack, containing music that Kamen had composed but went unused in the final film.[15]/nUnlike its predecessors, Die Hard with a Vengeance did not take place during Christmas, instead being set during the late summer. It opened in theaters on May 19, 1995, five years after Die Hard 2. Despite concerns about the film portraying bomb threats and terrorism with the Oklahoma City bombing having occurred the previous month, the film was released as originally scheduled.[16]/nDie Hard with a Vengeance was released on VHS on December 19, 1995 along with a THX certified version.[17] It was then released on LaserDisc on January 17, 1996, and on DVD on March 9, 1999. A special edition was released on DVD on July 10, 2001 and then re-released in February 2005 and 2007.[18] The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 and 2013.[19]/nAn alternative ending to the one shown in the final movie was filmed with Jeremy Irons and Bruce Willis, set some time after the events in New York. It can be found on the Special Edition DVD. In this version, it is presumed that the robbery succeeds, and that McClane was used as the scapegoat for everything that went wrong. He is fired from the NYPD after more than 20 years on the force and the FBI has even taken away his pension; it is also mentioned that McClane and his wife Holly have divorced. Nevertheless, he still manages to track Simon using the batch number on the bottle of aspirins and they meet in a bar in Hungary. In this version, Simon has double-crossed most of his accomplices, gotten the loot to a safe hiding place somewhere in Hungary, and has the gold turned into statuettes of the Empire State Building in order to smuggle it out of the country. McClane is keen to take his problems out on Simon, who he invites to play a game called \"McClane Says\". This involves a form of Russian roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher that has had the sights removed, meaning it is impossible to determine which end is which. McClane then asks Simon some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Simon gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which fires the rocket through Simon, killing him.[20][21]/nIn the DVD audio commentary, screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh claims that this version was dropped because the studio thought it showed a more cruel and menacing side to McClane, a man who killed for revenge rather than in self-defense. The studio was also displeased with the lack of action in the scene, feeling that it did not fit as a \"climax\" and therefore chose to reshoot the finale as an action sequence at a significant monetary cost. Hensleigh's intention was to show that the events in New York and the subsequent repercussions had tilted McClane psychologically. This alternative ending, set some time after the film's main events, would have marked a serious break from the Die Hard formula, in which the plot unfolds over a period of roughly 12 hours.[21]/nAccording to the DVD audio commentary, a second alternative ending had McClane and Carver floating back to shore on a makeshift raft after the explosion at sea. Carver says it is a shame the bad guys are going to get away; McClane tells him not to be so sure. The scene then shifts to the plane where the terrorists find the briefcase bomb they left in the park and which Carver gave back to them (in this version it was not used to blow up the dam). The film would end on a darkly comic note as Simon asks if anyone has a four-gallon jug. This draft of the script was rejected early on \u2013 possibly due to the similarity of the ending to Die Hard 2, where all the villains board a plane that later explodes \u2013 so it was never actually filmed. The rocket-launcher sequence was the only alternative ending to be filmed.[21]/nDie Hard with a Vengeance opened in the United States on May 19, 1995 and earned $22,162,245 in its opening weekend.[22][23] The film ranked number one at the box office, beating out Crimson Tide.[22] In Japan, it set a record opening for 20th Century Fox with a five-day gross of $13.5 million, beating Return of the Jedi and ranking number one for five consecutive weeks, grossing over $81 million.[c] Its opening in France set a summer record with a gross of $8.8 million in its first 8 days.[25] The film went on to gross $100,012,499 in the United States and Canada, and $266,089,167 in other markets, giving it a total worldwide gross of $366,101,666 and making it the highest-grossing film of 1995.[4][27]/nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Die Hard with a Vengeance gets off to a fast start and benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas.\"[28] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[29] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[30]/nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the action sequences and the performances of Willis, Jackson, and Irons, concluding: \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.\"[31] Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman disliked the film, stating that while \"[John] McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don't add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole\".[32]/nJames Berardinelli thought that the explosions and fights were \"filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right\".[33] Samuel L. Jackson's performance in the film was also praised by critics. Desson Howe of The Washington Post thought that \"the best thing about the movie is the relationship between McClane and Zeus,\" saying that Jackson was \"almost as good as he was in Pulp Fiction.\"[34] For Variety, Brian Lowry wrote the film was the \"least accomplished\" of the Die Hard series, but \"even a subpar adventure won't kill this series, as the pic's built-in audience will make it a major summer attraction, if perhaps one lacking quite the stamina of the first two movies\".[35]/nEmpire magazine's Ian Nathan gave the film a three out of five stars review, stating that \"Die Hard with a Vengeance is better than Die Hard 2, but not as good as the peerless original. Though it's breathless fun, the film runs out of steam in the last act. And Jeremy Irons' villain isn't fit to tie Alan Rickman's shoelaces.\"[36]/nIn the Crime Time Filmbook, which archives various UK film reviews, the film was given a five out of five star review citing it as \"...simply the best Action film of the decade, leaving imitators like Bad Boys, Executive Decision, The Rock and Chain Reaction in varying depths of shadow.[37]/nEmpire considered it to be one of the 50 greatest film sequels in 2009.[38] Ben Sherlock of Screen Rant regarded it as the best sequel of the franchise.[39] Johnny Hoffman from Movieweb considered it a step up from the previous film and praised Willis and Jackson's chemistry and the action scenes.[8]", "35265777": "Michael Grain Crandall (born November 29, 1940, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana) is an American mathematician, specializing in differential equations./nIn 1962 Crandall earned a baccalaureate in engineering physics from University of California, Berkeley, changed to mathematics, earning a master's in 1964 and a PhD in 1965 under Heinz Cordes at Berkeley, with a thesis that solved a problem in celestial mechanics posed by  Carl Ludwig Siegel; the thesis title is Two families of plane solutions of the four body problem. In 1965 he was an instructor at Berkeley, in 1966 an assistant professor at Stanford University and from 1969 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a professor from 1973 to 1976. From 1974 to 1984 he was a professor at the Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, from 1984 to 1990 as Hille-Professor of Mathematics. From 1988 until his retirement he was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Crandall was several times a visiting professor at the University of Paris, where he received an honorary doctorate in 1999. His legacy of contributions contains all but not limited to: Banach solutions in Euclidean spaces, Fourier transforms of planar variables, PDE concepts and iterations for sequence analysis, semigroup transform solutions, differential harmonic study of divergent hyperbole, physical transformations of finite Jacobian entities, unique harmonic populations in convergent contexts, application of abstract existence principles on non-linear contexts, normalized vector sequencing in multi-dimensional parallax geometries, and the mathematical equivalence study of topographical dissimilar nodes using traditional non-linear surfacing theories to produce distinct solutions in the realm of differential multi-variable applications./nCrandall works primarily on partial differential equations, e.g., with bifurcation theory, evolution equations, generation of semigroups of transformations on Banach spaces[1] and the theory of Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equations. With Pierre-Louis Lions he did research on the viscosity solutions of partial differential equations.[2]/nIn 2000 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those written in the form Mn = 2n \u2212 1 for some integer n.  He also developed Mersenne's laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, Harmonie universelle, for which he is referred to as the \"father of acoustics\".[1][2] Mersenne, an ordained Catholic priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called \"the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s\"[3] and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, \"the post-box of Europe\".[4]  He was also a member of the ascetical Minim religious order and wrote and lectured on theology and philosophy./nMersenne was born of Jeanne Mouli\u00e8re, wife of Julien Mersenne, peasants who lived near Oiz\u00e9, County of Maine (present-day Sarthe, France).[5] He was educated at Le Mans and at the Jesuit College of La Fl\u00e8che. On 17 July 1611, he joined the Minim Friars and, after studying theology and Hebrew in Paris, was ordained a priest in 1613./nBetween 1614 and 1618, he taught theology and philosophy at Nevers, but he returned to Paris and settled at the convent of L'Annonciade in 1620. There he studied mathematics and music and met with other kindred spirits such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes, \u00c9tienne Pascal, Pierre Petit, Gilles de Roberval, Thomas Hobbes, and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc. He corresponded with Giovanni Doni, Jacques Alexandre Le Tenneur, Constantijn Huygens, Galileo Galilei, and other scholars in Italy, England and the Dutch Republic. He was a staunch defender of Galileo, assisting him in translations of some of his mechanical works./nFor four years, Mersenne devoted himself entirely to philosophic and theological writing, and published Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim (Celebrated Questions on the Book of Genesis) (1623); L'Impiet\u00e9 des d\u00e9istes (The Impiety of the Deists) (1624); La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences (Truth of the Sciences Against the Sceptics, 1624). It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he was a Jesuit. He was educated by Jesuits, but he never joined the Society of Jesus. He taught theology and philosophy at Nevers and Paris./nIn 1635 he set up the informal Acad\u00e9mie Parisienne (Academia Parisiensis), which had nearly 140 correspondents, including astronomers and philosophers as well as mathematicians, and was the precursor of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences established by Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1666.[a] He was not afraid to cause disputes among his learned friends in order to compare their views, notable among which were disputes between Descartes, Pierre de Fermat, and Jean de Beaugrand.[6] Peter L. Bernstein, in his book Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk, wrote, \"The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, which were founded about twenty years after Mersenne's death, were direct descendants of Mersenne's activities.\"[7]/nIn 1635 Mersenne met with Tommaso Campanella but concluded that he could \"teach nothing in the sciences ... but still he has a good memory and a fertile imagination.\" Mersenne asked if Descartes wanted Campanella to come to Holland to meet him, but Descartes declined. He visited Italy fifteen times, in 1640, 1641 and 1645. In 1643\u20131644 Mersenne also corresponded with the German Socinian Marcin Ruar concerning the Copernican ideas of Pierre Gassendi, finding Ruar already a supporter of Gassendi's position.[8] Among his correspondents were Descartes, Galileo, Roberval, Pascal, Beeckman and other scientists./nHe died on 1 September 1648 of complications arising from a lung abscess./nQuaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim was written as a commentary on the Book of Genesis and comprises uneven sections headed by verses from the first three chapters of that book. At first sight the book appears to be a collection of treatises on various miscellaneous topics. However Robert Lenoble has shown[9] that the principle of unity in the work is a polemic against magical and divinatory arts, cabalism, and animistic and pantheistic philosophies./nMersenne was concerned with the teachings of some Italian naturalists that all things happened naturally and determined astrologically; for example, the nomological determinism of Lucilio Vanini (\"God acts on sublunary beings (humans) using the sky as a tool\"), and Gerolamo Cardano's idea that martyrs and heretic were compelled to self-harm by the stars;[10] Historian of science William Ashworth[11] explains \"Miracles, for example, were endangered by the naturalists, because in a world filled with sympathies and occult forces\u2014with what Lenoble calls a \"spontan\u00e9it\u00e9 ind\u00e9finie\"\u2014anything could happen naturally\"[12]:\u200a138/nMersenne mentions Martin Del Rio's Investigations into Magic and criticises Marsilio Ficino for claiming power for images and characters. He condemns astral magic and astrology and the anima mundi, a concept popular amongst Renaissance neo-platonists. Whilst allowing for a mystical interpretation of the Cabala, he wholeheartedly condemned its magical application, particularly angelology. He also criticises Pico della Mirandola, Cornelius Agrippa, Francesco Giorgio and Robert Fludd, his main target./nHarmonie universelle is perhaps Mersenne's most influential work.  It is one of the earliest comprehensive works on music theory, touching on a wide range of musical concepts, and especially the mathematical relationships involved in music.  The work contains the earliest formulation of what has become known as Mersenne's laws, which describe the frequency of oscillation of a stretched string. This frequency is:/nThe formula for the lowest frequency is/nwhere f is the frequency [Hz], L is the length [m], F is the force [N] and \u03bc is the mass per unit length [kg/m]./nIn this book, Mersenne also introduced several innovative concepts that can be considered the basis of modern reflecting telescopes:/nBecause of criticism that he encountered, especially from Descartes, Mersenne made no attempt to build a telescope of his own./nMersenne is also remembered today thanks to his association with the Mersenne primes. The Mersenne Twister, named for Mersenne primes, is frequently used in computer engineering and in related fields such as cryptography./nHowever, Mersenne was not primarily a mathematician; he wrote about music theory and other subjects. He edited works of Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and other Greek mathematicians. But perhaps his most important contribution to the advance of learning was his extensive correspondence (in Latin) with mathematicians and other scientists in many countries. At a time when the scientific journal had not yet come into being, Mersenne was the centre of a network for exchange of information./nIt has been argued that Mersenne used his lack of mathematical specialty, his ties to the print world, his legal acumen, and his friendship with the French mathematician and philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) to manifest his international network of mathematicians.[15]/nMersenne's philosophical works are characterized by wide scholarship and the narrowest theological orthodoxy. His greatest service to philosophy was his enthusiastic defence of Descartes, whose agent he was in Paris and whom he visited in exile in the Netherlands. He submitted to various eminent Parisian thinkers a manuscript copy of the Meditations on First Philosophy, and defended its orthodoxy against numerous clerical critics./nIn later life, he gave up speculative thought and turned to scientific research, especially in mathematics, physics and astronomy. In this connection, his best known work is Harmonie universelle of 1636, dealing with the theory of music and musical instruments. It is regarded as a source of information on 17th-century music, especially French music and musicians, to rival even the works of Pietro Cerone./nOne of his many contributions to musical tuning theory was the suggestion of/nas the ratio for an equally-tempered semitone (\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt[{12}]{2}}}\n\n). It was more accurate (0.44 cents sharp) than Vincenzo Galilei's 18/17 (1.05 cents flat), and could be constructed using straightedge and compass. Mersenne's description in the 1636 Harmonie universelle of the first absolute determination of the frequency of an audible tone (at 84\u00a0Hz) implies that he had already demonstrated that the absolute-frequency ratio of two vibrating strings, radiating a musical tone and its octave, is 1\u00a0:\u00a02. The perceived harmony (consonance) of two such notes would be explained if the ratio of the air oscillation frequencies is also 1\u00a0:\u00a02, which in turn is consistent with the source-air-motion-frequency-equivalence hypothesis./nHe also performed extensive experiments to determine the acceleration of falling objects by comparing them with the swing of pendulums, reported in his Cogitata Physico-Mathematica in 1644. He was the first to measure the length of the seconds pendulum, that is a pendulum whose swing takes one second, and the first to observe that a pendulum's swings are not isochronous as Galileo thought, but that large swings take longer than small swings.[16]/nTwo German pamphlets that circulated around Europe in 1614-15, Fama fraternitatis and Confessio Fraternitatis, claimed to be manifestos of a highly select, secret society of alchemists and sages called the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians. The books were allegories, but were obviously written by a small group who were reasonably knowledgeable about the sciences of the day,[citation needed] and their main theme was to promote educational reform (they were anti-Aristotelian). These pamphlets also promoted an occult view of science[citation needed] containing elements of Paracelsian philosophy, neo-Platonism, Christian Cabala and Hermeticism. In effect, they sought to establish a new form of scientific religion with some pre-Christian elements.[citation needed]/nMersenne led the fight against acceptance of these ideas, particularly those of Rosicrucian promoter Robert Fludd, who had a lifelong battle of words with Johannes Kepler. Fludd responded with Sophia cum moria certamen (1626), wherein he discusses his involvement with the Rosicrucians. The anonymous Summum bonum (1629), another critique of Mersenne, is a Rosicrucian-themed text. The cabalist Jacques Gaffarel joined Fludd's side, while Pierre Gassendi defended Mersenne./nThe Rosicrucian ideas were defended by many prominent men of learning, and some members of the European scholarly community boosted their own prestige by claiming to be among the selected members of the Brotherhood.[citation needed] However, it is now generally agreed among historians that there is no evidence that an order of Rosicrucians existed at the time, with later Rosicrucian Orders drawing on the name, with no relation to the writers of the Rosicrucian Manifestoes.[17]/nDuring the mid-1630s Mersenne gave up the search for physical causes in the Aristotelian sense (rejecting the idea of essences, which were still favoured by the scholastic philosophers) and taught that true physics could be only a descriptive science of motions (M\u00e9canisme), which was the direction set by Galileo Galilei.  Mersenne had been a regular correspondent with Galileo and had extended the work on vibrating strings originally developed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei.[18]/nAn air attributed to Mersenne was used by Ottorino Respighi in his second suite of Ancient Airs and Dances", "52665588": "Ian Murray Wanless (born 7 December 1969 in Canberra, Australia) is a professor in the School of Mathematics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

He also invented the quadrature formulas known as Newton\u2013Cotes formulas, and made a geometric argument that can be interpreted as a logarithmic version of Euler's formula.[4] He was the first Plumian Professor at Cambridge University from 1707 until his death./nCotes was born in Burbage, Leicestershire. His parents were Robert, the rector of Burbage, and his wife, Grace, n\u00e9e Farmer. Roger had an elder brother, Anthony (born 1681), and a younger sister, Susanna (born 1683), both of whom died young. At first Roger attended Leicester School, where his mathematical talent was recognised. His aunt Hannah had married Rev. John Smith, and Smith took on the role of tutor to encourage Roger's talent. The Smiths' son, Robert Smith, became a close associate of Roger Cotes throughout his life. Cotes later studied at St Paul's School in London and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1699.[5] He graduated BA in 1702 and MA in 1706.[2]/nRoger Cotes's contributions to modern computational methods lie heavily in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. Cotes began his educational career with a focus on astronomy. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1707, and at age 26 he became the first Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. On his appointment to professor, he opened a subscription list in an effort to provide an observatory for Trinity. Unfortunately, the observatory was still unfinished when Cotes died, and was demolished in 1797.[2]/nIn correspondence with Isaac Newton, Cotes designed a heliostat telescope with a mirror revolving by clockwork.[6][7] He recomputed the solar and planetary tables of Giovanni Domenico Cassini and John Flamsteed, and he intended to create tables of the moon's motion, based on Newtonian principles.[citation needed] Finally, in 1707 he formed a school of physical sciences at Trinity in partnership with William Whiston.[2]/nFrom 1709 to 1713, Cotes became heavily involved with the second edition of Newton's Principia, a book that explained Newton's theory of universal gravitation. The first edition of Principia had only a few copies printed and was in need of revision to include Newton's works and principles of lunar and planetary theory.[2] Newton at first had a casual approach to the revision, since he had all but given up scientific work.[citation needed] However, through the vigorous passion displayed by Cotes, Newton's scientific hunger was once again reignited.[citation needed] The two spent nearly three and half years collaborating on the work, in which they fully deduce, from Newton's laws of motion, the theory of the moon, the equinoxes, and the orbits of comets. Only 750 copies of the second edition were printed[2] although pirated copies from Amsterdam were also distributed to meet the demand for the work.[citation needed] As a reward to Cotes, he was given a share of the profits and 12 copies of his own.[citation needed] Cotes's original contribution to the work was a preface which supported the scientific superiority of Newton's principles over the then popular vortex theory of gravity advocated by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Cotes concluded that the Newton's law of gravitation was confirmed by observation of celestial phenomena that were inconsistent with the vortex theory.[2]/nCotes's major original work was in mathematics, especially in the fields of integral calculus, logarithms, and numerical analysis. He published only one scientific paper in his lifetime, titled Logometria, in which he successfully constructs the logarithmic spiral.[8][9] After his death, many of Cotes's mathematical papers were edited by his cousin Robert Smith and published in a book, Harmonia mensurarum.[2][10] Cotes's additional works were later published in Thomas Simpson's The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions.[8] Although Cotes's style was somewhat obscure, his systematic approach to integration and mathematical theory was highly regarded by his peers.[citation needed] Cotes discovered an important theorem on the n-th roots of unity,[11] foresaw the method of least squares,[12] and discovered a method for integrating rational fractions with binomial denominators.[8][13] He was also praised for his efforts in numerical methods, especially in interpolation methods and his table construction techniques.[8] He was regarded as one of the few British mathematicians capable of following the powerful work of Sir Isaac Newton.[citation needed]/nCotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33.

Lakon studied in France with Joseph Bertrand.  He was exposed to the works of Joseph Liouville, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernard Lamy, and Jacques Charles Fran\u00e7ois Sturm.  He brought the new revolutionary ideas back to Modern Greece.  He shared modern concepts with his students.  When he returned to Greece he became part of the new National Observatory of Athens.  He assisted world-renowned astronomer Georgios Konstantinos Vouris.  Lakon also helped revolutionize the Greek school system. He became a high school teacher.  He was also lecturing at the University of Athens.  He was involved in high school and university education from 1854 until 1900.  He wrote numerous textbooks in the field of physics and mathematics for high school and college education.  He inspired countless students namely famous Greek mathematician John Hazzidakis.[11]/nLakon was a teacher at the Second High school of Athens (2nd Gymnasium of Athens) from 1854 to 1864.  He was an adjunct professor of experimental physics at the University of Athens from 1854 to 1862.  In 1862, he became an adjunct professor of pure and applied mathematics.  The next year he taught more classes in mathematics at the university.  He started to become popular within the Greek scientific community.  The government approved several of his textbooks for high school and college education.  He shared the modern European scientific advancements he learned with Greece.  Most of the early college and high school textbooks were translations of French and German scientific advancements.  Because Lakon was familiar with Joseph Bertrand, he translated and promoted his textbook in 1857.  The translation was called Elements of Arithmetic (\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2).

The translation was very popular in Greece during the first period of education.  In 1868, Lakon became a full professor at the university and by 1880 he was the rector of the institution for one year.  In his speech, he elaborated on the significant discoveries of non-Euclidean geometry.  He referenced Aristotle's theories, postulates, primary concepts, and the role of axioms.  By the 1880s, Lakon and his student Ioannis Chatzidakis demonstrated their independent development in their textbooks.  The only approved licensed textbooks for High school and college education were written by Lakon and Ioannis Chatzidakis.  Lakon wrote Elements of Geometry (\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) in 1882.  In his textbook, he outlined his interpretation of axiomatic geometry.  He was very active within the scientific community, constantly interacting with his contemporaries in Greece namely Dimitrios Stroumpos and Timoleon Argyropoulos.[12]/nLakon supported the idea that it was impossible to experimentally confirm the indefinite divisibility of matter. \nLakon distinguished between the mass of a body and its weight.  He computed the acceleration rate of gravity in various cities up to four decimal places.  His contemporary Antonios Damaskinos supported the existence of a vacuum between small particles and in space between celestial bodies.  Argyopoulos and Lakon supported the belief that the Aether did not allow for the existence of an absolute vacuum.  Lakon and Argyropoulous supported the famous Foucault pendulum.  Lakon also did extensive research in the field of electromagnetism.\nHe died in Athens in 1900.[6][13]/nIn his book Elements of Geometry published in 1882 he focused on axiomatic foundation, Lakon and his contemporaries expanded on Euclid\u2019s Elements of Mathematics.  Euclid used two postulates for straight lines, and no postulate for planes.  Lacon proposed an axiom and two postulates for straight lines. He also introduced a postulate for planes.  His work was heavily influenced by the acceptable ideas of the time namely the works of Robert Simson, Wolfgang Bolyai, Hermann von Helmholtz, and David Hilbert.  Lakon was critical towards Euclidean geometry.  He felt it was ambiguous and lacked definitions for certain notions such as equality, excess, and defect.  Lakon utilized the logical-deductive character of geometry.   He superimposed Aristotle's epistemological theory in his deductive analysis.  There was a growing debate among German mathematicians in the 19th century centered around the definition of the plane.   Some mathematicians felt it was ambiguously defined by Euclid.[14]/nEuclid vaguely defined the plane.  He stated that a plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself.  The definition is similar to that of a straight line: a straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.  Robert Simson translated Euclid's The Elements of Euclid (1756) and defined the plane as the surface in which any two points being taken, the straight line between them lies wholly in that superficies (surface).  The line is known as Simson line.  Lakon accepted Simson's definition of the plane.  Lakon proved the existence of a surface using Simson line He defined it as a plane.  Lakon presented geometry as a theory of solid bodies using the rotations of straight lines about one axis utilizing the placement and inversion of objects in space.  Lakon was influenced by the works of Hermann von Helmholtz in dealing with motion while Wolfgang Bolyai influenced Lakon's interpretation of the sphere. \nLakon's student John Hazzidakis incorporated some of his works into his own textbooks.[15]/nLakon's geometric analysis consisted of nine axioms and postulates.  He presented primitive notions as notions of area, boundary, solid,  surface and line.  He also elaborated on position, continuity, point, part, and whole.  He presented the idea of motion relative to geometry.  He examined it as the notion of motion. He discussed the rotation and placement of geometric figures on a plane and in space.  He used the concept to prove theorems and define geometric notions.  Lakon viewed the sphere as the simplest geometric figure.  Lakon organized his geometric perspective as a theory of solid bodies.[16]", "9084162": "Nikolai Vladimirovich Yefimov (Russian: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0439 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0301\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u0444\u0438\u0301\u043c\u043e\u0432; 31 May 1910 in Orenburg \u2013 14 August 1982 in Moscow) was a Soviet mathematician.

It enjoyed immediate success and was republished in 1727./nHoste claims to have described all major sea battles from the time when galleys were supersede by broadside ships of the line.  However, the list is not necessarily complete according to Jenkins,[2] who shows that although galleys were not strong enough to stand in the line of battle, they did form a part of battle fleets where they were used to tow damaged battleships out of the line.  They remained in use in the calmer Mediterranean until at least 1700./nIn the preface to the first edition, Hoste declared that without evolutions, fleets were like barbarians who waged war without knowledge, without order, everything depending on caprice and chance.[3]   Evolutions provide a framework without which tactical opportunities cannot be seized.  The book therefore claimed to show generals and other officers not only what was necessary, but also what was possible./nHoste's system of sailing and battle formation was based on five ordres de marche which gave instructions on how to form a line of battle:/nTo clarify terminology, 'before the wind' means the ship is sailing in the same direction as the wind; 'close hauled' means the ship is sailing into the wind at an angle./nHoste detailed the navigational methods required to allow each ship in the fleet to reach these formations effectively./nHe also summarised the advantages of fighting from either windward or leeward positions.   The Windward position allowed a fleet to control the battle, blew smoke from their guns onto the enemy fleet and allowed them to use fireships against the enemy.  However it has the disadvantage that in heavy seas it may not be able to open its lower gun ports without risking flooding.   The Leeward position allowed ships to easily drop out of the line when damaged and allowed ships full use of their gun decks.   See also Naval tactics in the Age of Sail./nHoste also analysed where and how to double the enemy line and demonstrated five methods to avoid being doubled.[4]  This section of the book focuses strongly on defense rather than attack which reflects the strategic position of the French Navy in the late 1690s./nNaval signalling was briefly considered and he suggested a simple system of thirty-six signal flags of three colours.  Particular types of signals were restricted to certain positions or groups of ships.  British signalling at the time was very confusing and lacked standardisation./nHoste's rigorous mathematical treatment of naval tactics dominated French naval strategy throughout the 18th century.

According to Blackwell, \"He (von Neumann) listened to me talk about this rather obscure subject and in ten minutes he knew more about it than I did.\"[14]/nWhile a postdoc at IAS, Blackwell was prevented from attending lectures or undertaking research at nearby Princeton University, which the IAS has historically collaborated with in research and scholarship activities,[15] because of his race.[12]/nSeeking a permanent position elsewhere, he wrote letters of application to 104 historically black colleges and universities in 1942, and received a total of only three offers. He felt at the time that a black professor would be limited to teaching at black colleges.[16] Having been highly recommended by his dissertation advisor Joseph L. Doob for a position at the University of California, Berkeley, he was interviewed by statistician Jerzy Neyman. Neyman supported his appointment, and Griffith C. Evans, the head of the mathematics department, at first agreed and even convinced university president Robert Sproul that it was the correct decision, only to subsequently balk, citing the concerns of his wife. It was customary for Evans and his wife to invite the members of the department over for dinner and \"she was not going to have any darkie in her house.\"[17][18]/nHe was offered a post at Southern University at Baton Rouge, which he held in from 1942 to 1943, followed by a year as an Instructor at Clark College in Atlanta./nBlackwell joined the Mathematics Department at Howard University in 1944. When he joined, he was one of four faculty members and within three years he was appointed full professor and head of the department.[12] He remained at Howard until 1954./nIn 1947 while at Howard, Blackwell published the paper \"Conditional Expectation and Unbiased Sequential Estimation\", which outlined a technique that later became known as the Rao-Blackwell theorem.[19] The theorem provides a method for improving statistical estimates by potentially reducing their mean squared error./nFrom 1948 to 1950, Blackwell spent his summers at RAND Corporation with Meyer Abraham Girshick and other mathematicians exploring the game theory of duels.

He became the Statistics department chair in 1957.[12][22][23]/nBlackwell bridged topology and game theory via a game-theoretic proof of Kuratowski's theorem in 1967.[24] Blackwell only briefly extended his research beyond zero-sum games to explore the sure-thing principle[25][26] as introduced by Jimmie Savage,[27] primarily due the real-world societal implications of the mathematical result,[clarification needed][28] particularly for nuclear disarmament[how?] at the inception of the Cold War.[29]/nBlackwell wrote one of the first Bayesian textbooks, his 1969 Basic Statistics. It inspired the 1995 textbook Statistics: A Bayesian Perspective by the biostatistician Donald Berry./nHe spent the rest of his career at UC Berkeley, retiring in 1988[12][23] at age 70, which at that time was the mandatory retirement age.

In those years, Yadrenko began his studies of homogeneous and isotropic random fields. These investigations were presented in his candidate-degree thesis./nAfter postgraduate courses, Yadrenko worked at the Department of Mathematical Analysis and Probability Theory at the Kiev University. He devoted much energy to the development of mathematical education at secondary schools, organization of mathematical competitions, and publication of contemporary textbooks on elementary mathematics and combinatorial analysis and books of problems of mathematical competitions./nIn 1966, Yadrenko became the head of the Department of Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, a position he held for more than 32 years. Under his guidance, the researchers of the department carried out research in the spectral theory of random fields (in particular, his doctoral-degree thesis, which is a Soviet doctorate, was devoted to this theory), asymptotic methods in probability theory, the theory of stochastic differential equations, and applied problems in probability theory and mathematical statistics.

Yves Pomeau is one of the most recognized French theorists at the interface of physics and mechanics, and his pioneering work has opened up many avenues of research and has been a continuous source of inspiration for several generations of young experimental physicists and theorists worldwide.\"[7][8]/nIn his thesis[9][10] he showed that in a dense fluid the interactions are different from what they are at equilibrium and propagate through hydrodynamic modes, which leads to the divergence of transport coefficients in 2 spatial dimensions./nThis aroused his interest in fluid mechanics, and in the transition to turbulence. Together with Paul Manneville they discovered a new mode of transition to turbulence,[11] the transition by temporal Intermittency, which was confirmed by numerous experimental observations and CFD simulations. This is the so-called Pomeau\u2013Manneville scenario, associated with the Pomeau-Manneville maps\n[12]/nIn papers published in 1973 and 1976, Jean Hardy, Pomeau and Olivier de Pazzis [13][14] introduced the first lattice Boltzmann model, which is called the HPP model after the authors. Generalizing ideas from his thesis, together with Uriel Frisch and Brosl Hasslacher, they found[15]   a very simplified microscopic fluid model (FHP model) which allows simulating very efficiently the complex movements of a real fluid.[16] He was a pioneer of lattice Boltzmann methods and played a historical role in the timeline of computational physics./nReflecting on the situation of the transition to turbulence in parallel flows, he showed[17] that turbulence is caused by a contagion mechanism, and not by local instability. Front can be static or mobile  depending on the conditions of the system, and the causes of the motion can be the variation of a free energy, where the most energetically favorable state invades the less favorable one. The consequence is that this transition belongs to the class of directed percolation phenomena in statistical physics, which has also been amply confirmed by experimental and numerical studies./nIn dynamical systems theory, the structure and length of the attractors of a network corresponds to the dynamic phase of the network. The stability of Boolean network depends on the connections of their nodes. A Boolean network can exhibit stable, critical or chaotic behavior. This phenomenon is governed by a critical value of the average number of connections of nodes (\n\n\n\n\nK\n\nc\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K_{c}}\n\n), and can be characterized by the Hamming distance as distance measure.

Together with Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan, he gave a scaling law for the uniform speed of such a droplet.[19] With Christiane Normand, and Manuel Garc\u00eda Velarde, he studied convective instability.[20] Apart from simple situations, capillarity remains an area where fundamental questions remain. He showed[21] that the discrepancies appearing in the hydrodynamics of the moving contact line on a solid surface could only be eliminated by taking into account the evaporation/condensation near this line. Capillary forces are almost always insignificant in solid mechanics. Nevertheless, with Serge Mora and collaborators[22] they have shown theoretically and experimentally that soft gel filaments are subject to Rayleigh-Plateau instability, an instability never observed before for a solid. In collaboration with his former PhD student Basile Audoly and Henri Berestycki, he studied the speed of the propagation of a reaction front in a fast steady flow with a given structure in space.[23] With Basile Audoly and Martine Ben Amar, Pomeau developed[24] a theory of large deformations of elastic plates which led them to introduce the concept of \"d-cone\", that is, a geometrical cone preserving the overall developability of the surface, an idea now taken up by the solid mechanics community./nThe theory of superconductivity is based on the idea of the formation of pairs of electrons that become more or less bosons undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation. This pair formation would explain the halving of the flux quantum in a superconducting loop. Together with Len Pismen and Sergio Rica [25] they have shown that, going back to Onsager's idea explaining the quantification of the circulation in fundamental quantum states, it is not necessary to use the notion of electron pairs to understand this halving of the circulation quantum. He also analyzed the onset of BEC  from the point of view of kinetic theory. Whereas the kinetic equation for a dilute Bose gas had been known for many years, the way it can describe what happens when the gas is cooled down to reach temperature below the temperature of transition. At this temperature the gas gets a macroscopic component in the quantum ground state, as had been predicted by Einstein long ago. Pomeau and collaborators showed [26] that the solution of the kinetic equation becomes singular at zero energies and we did also find how the density of the condensate grows with time after the transition. They also derived the kinetic equation for the Bogoliubov excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates,[27] where they found three collisional processes.[28] Before the surge of interest in super-solids started by Moses Chan experiments, they had shown in an early simulation [29] that a slightly modified NLS equation yields a fair representation of super-solids. With Alan C. Newell, he studied turbulent crystals in macroscopic systems.[30]/nFrom his more recent work we must distinguish those concerning a phenomenon typically out of equilibrium, that of the emission of photons by an atom maintained in an excited state by an intense field that creates Rabi oscillations. The theory of this phenomenon requires a precise consideration of the statistical concepts of quantum mechanics in a theory satisfying the fundamental constraints of such a theory.

B.O. Koopman at Columbia University suggested that statistician Harold Hotelling might have a grant that would permit Doob to work with him. Hotelling did, so the Depression led Doob to probability./nIn 1933 Kolmogorov provided the first axiomatic foundation for the theory of probability. Thus a subject that had originated from intuitive ideas suggested by real life experiences and studied informally, suddenly became mathematics. Probability theory became measure theory with its own problems and terminology.  Doob recognized that this would make it possible to give rigorous proofs for existing probability results, and he felt that the tools of measure theory would lead to new probability results./nDoob's approach to probability was evident in his first probability paper,[2] in which he proved theorems related to the law of large numbers, using a probabilistic interpretation of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem. Then he used these theorems to give rigorous proofs of theorems proven by Fisher and Hotelling related to Fisher's maximum likelihood estimator for estimating a parameter of a distribution./nAfter writing a series of papers on the foundations of probability and stochastic processes including martingales, Markov processes, and stationary processes, Doob realized that there was a real need for a book showing what is known about the various types of stochastic processes, so he wrote the book Stochastic Processes.[3] It was published in 1953 and soon became one of the most influential books in the development of modern probability theory./nBeyond this book, Doob is best known for his work on martingales and probabilistic potential theory.  After he retired, Doob wrote a book of over 800 pages: Classical Potential Theory and Its Probabilistic Counterpart.[4] The first half of this book deals with classical potential theory and the second half with probability theory, especially martingale theory. In writing this book, Doob shows that his two favorite subjects, martingales and potential theory, can be studied by the same mathematical tools./nThe American Mathematical Society's Joseph L. Doob Prize, endowed in 2005 and awarded every three years for an outstanding mathematical book, is named in Doob's honor.[5] The postdoctoral members of the department of mathematics of the University of Illinois are named J L Doob Research Assistant Professors.", "1252692": "Douglas Rayner Hartree FRS (27 March 1897\u00a0\u2013 12 February 1958) was an English mathematician and physicist most famous for the development of numerical analysis and its application to the Hartree\u2013Fock equations of atomic physics and the construction of a differential analyser using Meccano.[2][3]/nDouglas Hartree was born in Cambridge, England. His father, William, was a lecturer in engineering at the University of Cambridge and his mother, Eva Rayner, was president of the National Council of Women of Great Britain and first woman to be mayor of the city of Cambridge. One of his great-grandfathers was Samuel Smiles;[1] another was the marine engineer William Hartree, partner of John Penn.[4] Douglas Hartree was the oldest of three sons that survived infancy. A brother and sister died in infancy when he was still a child, but his two brothers would later also die. Hartree's 7-year-old brother John Edwin died when Hartree was 17, and Hartree's 22-year-old brother Colin William died from meningitis in February 1920 when Hartree was 23.[5] His maternal cousin was the geologist Dorothy Helen Rayner.[6]/nHartree attended St John's College, Cambridge but the first World War interrupted his studies. He (and his father and brother) joined a group working on anti-aircraft ballistics under A. V. Hill, where he gained considerable skill and an abiding interest in practical calculation and numerical methods for differential equations, executing most of his own work with pencil and paper.[7] According to Hill, writing in Hartree\u2019s obituary, \u2018Quietly one day he improvised a long-base height-finder out of some wires, posts, and a steel tape\u2019.  This became known as the Hartree height-finder and was used extensively by British Anti-Aircraft troops until better optical height-finders were introduced. Its advantage was said to be that the height can be calculated from the observed quantities \u2018very rapidly by the use of nothing but simple arithmetic\u2019. It was also cheap to manufacture and easy to use./nAfter the end of World War I, Hartree returned to Cambridge graduating in 1922 with a Second Class degree in natural sciences./nIn 1921, a visit by Niels Bohr to Cambridge inspired Hartree to apply his numerical skills to Bohr's theory of the atom, for which he obtained his PhD in 1926 \u2013 his advisor was Ernest Rutherford. With the publication of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in the same year, Hartree was able to apply his knowledge\nof differential equations and numerical analysis to the new quantum theory.\nHe derived the Hartree equations for the distribution of electrons in an atom and proposed the self-consistent field method for their solution. The wavefunctions from this theory did not satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle for which Slater showed that determinantal functions are required. V. Fock published the \"equations with exchange\" now known as Hartree\u2013Fock equations. These are considerably more demanding computationally even with the efficient methods Hartree proposed for the calculation of exchange contributions. Today, the Hartree-Fock equations are of great importance to the field of computational chemistry, and are applied and solved numerically within most of the density functional theory programs used for electronic structure calculations of molecules and condensed phase systems.[8][9]/nIn 1929, Hartree was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester. In 1933, he visited Vannevar Bush at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned first hand about his differential analyser. Immediately on his return to Manchester, he set about building his own analyser from Meccano. Seeing the potential for further exploiting his numerical methods using the machine, he persuaded Sir Robert McDougall to fund a more robust machine, which was built in collaboration with Metropolitan-Vickers./nThe first application of the machine, reflecting Hartree's enthusiasm for railways, was calculating timetables for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.[10] He spent the rest of the decade applying the differential analyser to find solutions of differential equations arising in physics, including control theory and laminar boundary layer theory in fluid dynamics, making significant contributions to each of the fields./nThe differential analyser was not suitable for the solution of equations with exchange. When Fock's publication pre-empted Hartree's work on equations with exchange, Hartree turned his research to radio-wave propagation that led to the Appleton\u2013Hartree equation. In 1935, his father, William Hartree, offered to do calculations for him. Results with exchange soon followed. Douglas recognised the importance of configuration interaction that he referred to as \"superposition of configurations\".\nThe first multiconfiguration Hartree\u2013Fock results were published by father, son, and Bertha Swirles (later Lady Jeffreys) in 1939./nAt Hartree's suggestion, Bertha Swirles proceeded to derive equations with exchange for atoms using the Dirac equation in 1935. With Hartree's advice, the first relativistic calculations (without exchange) were reported in 1940 by A. O. Williams, a student of R. B. Lindsay./nDuring the Second World War Hartree supervised two computing groups. The first group, for the Ministry of Supply, has been described by Jack Howlett[11] as a \"job shop\" for the solution of differential equations. At the outbreak of World War II, the differential analyser at the University\nof Manchester was the only full-size (eight integrator)\ndifferential analyser in the country. Arrangements were made to have the machine available\nfor work in support of the national war effort. In time, the group consisted of four members[12] (Jack Howlett, Nicholas R. Eyres, J. G. L. Michel, Douglas Hartree, and Phyllis Lockett Nicolson). Problems were submitted to the group without information about the source but included the automatic tracking of targets, radio propagation, underwater explosions, heat flow in steel, and the diffusion equation later found to be for isotope separation. The second group was the magnetron research group of\nPhyllis Lockett Nicolson, David Copely, and Oscar Buneman.\nThe work was done for the Committee for the Co-ordination of the Valve Development assisting the development of radar. A differential analyser could have been used if more integrators had been available, so Hartree set up his group as three \"CPUs\" to work on mechanical desk calculators in parallel. For a method of solution, he selected what is now a classical particle simulation.[13]\nHartree never published any of his magnetron research findings in journals though he wrote numerous highly technical secret reports during the war./nIn April 1944 a committee which included Hartree recommended that a mathematical section be set up within the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In October this recommendation was put into effect with its first two objectives being the investigation of the possible adaptation of automatic telephone equipment to scientific equipment and the development of electronic computing devices suitable for rapid computing. One suspects that some members already knew of the Colossus computer. John R. Womersley (Turing's b\u00eate noire) was the first Director. In February 1945 he went on a two-month tour of computing installations in the USA, including visiting ENIAC (still not complete). He became acquainted with drafts of von Neumann's famous June 1945 EDVAC report. About two months later Hartree also went over to see ENIAC, not then publicly known./nIn February 1946, Max Newman (who had been involved in the Colossus computer) submitted an application to the Royal Society for funds to start the task of building a general-purpose computer at the University of Manchester. The Royal Society referred the request to Hartree and C.G. Darwin, Director of the NPL, to advise them. Hartree recommended the grant but Darwin opposed it on the grounds that Turing's ACE at NPL would be sufficient to serve the needs of the country. But Hartree's view won the day and the Manchester developments in computing were started./nHartree did further work in control systems and was involved in the early application of digital computers, advising the US military on the use of ENIAC for calculating ballistics tables. In the summer of 1946 Hartree made his second trip to ENIAC as an evaluation of its applicability to a broad range of science, when he became the first civilian to program it. For this he selected a problem involving the flow of a compressible fluid over a surface, such as air over the surface of a wing travelling faster than the speed of sound.[14]/nAt the end of 1945 or very early in 1946 Hartree briefed Maurice Wilkes of the University of Cambridge on the comparative developments in computing in the USA which he had seen. Wilkes, then received an invitation from the Moore School of Electrical Engineering (the builders of ENIAC) to attend a course on electronic computers. Before leaving for this, Hartree was able to brief him more fully on ENIAC. It was on the boat home that Wilkes planned the original design of EDSAC, which was to become operational in May 1949. Hartree worked closely with Wilkes in developing use of the machine for a wide range of problems and, most importantly, showed users from a number of areas in the university how they could use it in their research work./nHartree returned to Cambridge to take up the post of Plummer professor of mathematical physics in 1946. In October he gave an inaugural lecture entitled \"Calculating Machines: Recent and Prospective Developments and their impact on Mathematical Physics\". This described ENIAC and the work that Hartree had done on it. Even in 1946, two years before stored programming electronic computing became a reality, Hartree saw the need for the use of sub-routines. His inaugural lecture ended with a look at what computers might do. He said: \"..there are, I understand many problems of economic, medical and sociological interest and importance awaiting study which at present cannot be undertaken because of the formidable load of computing involved.\"/nOn 7 November 1946 The Daily Telegraph, having interviewed Hartree, quoted him as saying: \"The implications of the machine are so vast that we cannot conceive how they will affect our civilisation. Here you have something which is making one field of human activity 1,000 times faster. In the field of transportation, the equivalent to ACE would be the ability to travel from London to Cambridge ... in five seconds as a regular thing. It is almost unimaginable.\"[15]/nHartree's fourth and final major contribution to British computing started in early 1947 when the catering firm of J. Lyons & Co. in London heard of the ENIAC and sent a small team in the summer of that year to study what was happening in the USA, because they felt that these new computers might be of assistance in the huge amount of administrative and accounting work which the firm had to do. The team met with Col. Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who wrote to Hartree telling him of their search. As soon as he received this letter, Hartree wrote and invited representatives of Lyons to come to Cambridge for a meeting with him and Wilkes. This led to the development of a commercial version of EDSAC developed by Lyons, called LEO, the first computer used for commercial business applications. After Hartree's death, the headquarters of LEO Computers was renamed Hartree House. This illustrates the extent to which Lyons felt that Hartree had contributed to their new venture./nHartree's last famous contribution to computing was an estimate in 1950 of the potential demand for computers, which was much lower than turned out to be the case: \"We have a computer here in Cambridge, one in Manchester and one at the [NPL]. I suppose there ought to be one in Scotland, but that's about all.\" Such underestimates of the number of computers that would be required were common at the time.[16]/nHartree's last PhD student at Cambridge, Charlotte Froese Fischer, became known for the development and implementation of the multi-configuration Hartree\u2013Fock (MCHF) approach to atomic structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative calcium ion./nOutside of his professional life, Douglas Hartree was passionate about music, having an extensive knowledge of orchestral and chamber music. He played piano and was conductor of an amateur orchestra. This passion for music was perhaps what brought him together with his wife, Elaine Charlton, who was an accomplished pianist. Their marriage resulted in two sons, Oliver and John Richard, and one daughter, Margaret.[17] He died of heart failure in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 12 February 1958.[18]", "2923861": "Antoine-Joseph Yvon Villarceau (15 January 1813 \u2013 23 December 1883) was a French astronomer, mathematician, and engineer./nHe constructed an equatorial meridian-instrument and an isochronometric regulator for the Paris Observatory./nHe wrote M\u00e9canique C\u00e9leste.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966[2] and spent more than three decades on the mathematics faculty of the University of California, Berkeley (1960\u20131961 and 1964\u20131995), where he currently is Professor Emeritus, with research interests in algorithms, numerical analysis and global analysis.[3]/nSmale was born in Flint, Michigan and entered the University of Michigan in 1948.[4][5] Initially, he was a good student, placing into an honors calculus sequence taught by Bob Thrall and earning himself A's.  However, his sophomore and junior years were marred with mediocre grades, mostly Bs, Cs and even an F in nuclear physics.  However, with some luck, Smale was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Michigan's mathematics department.  Yet again, Smale performed poorly in his first years, earning a C average as a graduate student.  When the department chair, Hildebrandt, threatened to kick Smale out, he began to take his studies more seriously.[6] Smale finally earned his PhD in 1957, under Raoul Bott, beginning his career as an instructor at the University of Chicago./nEarly in his career, Smale was involved in controversy over remarks he made regarding his work habits while proving the higher-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. He said that his best work had been done \"on the beaches of Rio.\"[7][8] He has been politically active in various movements in the past, such as the Free Speech movement. In 1966, having travelled to Moscow under an NSF grant to accept the Fields Medal, he held a press conference there to denounce the American position in Vietnam, Soviet intervention in Hungary and Soviet maltreatment of intellectuals. After his return to the US, he was unable to renew the grant.[9] At one time he was subpoenaed[10] by the House Un-American Activities Committee./nIn 1960, Smale received a Sloan Research Fellowship and was appointed to the Berkeley mathematics faculty, moving to a professorship at Columbia the following year. In 1964 he returned to a professorship at Berkeley, where he has spent the main part of his career. He became a professor emeritus at Berkeley in 1995 and took up a post as professor at the City University of Hong Kong. He also amassed over the years one of the finest private mineral collections in existence. Many of Smale's mineral specimens can be seen in the book\u2014The Smale Collection: Beauty in Natural Crystals.[11]/nFrom 2003 to 2012, Smale was a professor at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago;[12] starting August 1, 2009, he became a Distinguished University Professor at the City University of Hong Kong.[13]/nIn 1988, Smale was the recipient of the Chauvenet Prize[1] of the MAA. In 2007, Smale was awarded the Wolf Prize in mathematics.[14]/nSmale proved that the oriented diffeomorphism group of the two-dimensional sphere has the same homotopy type as the special orthogonal group of 3 \u00d7 3 matrices.[15] Smale's theorem has been reproved and extended a few times, notably to higher dimensions in the form of the Smale conjecture,[16] as well as to other topological types.[17]/nIn another early work, he studied the immersions of the two-dimensional sphere into Euclidean space.[18] By relating immersion theory to the algebraic topology of Stiefel manifolds, he was able to fully clarify when two immersions can be deformed into one another through a family of immersions. Directly from his results it followed that the standard immersion of the sphere into three-dimensional space can be deformed (through immersions) into its negation, which is now known as sphere eversion. He also extended his results to higher-dimensional spheres,[19] and his doctoral student Morris Hirsch extended his work to immersions of general smooth manifolds.[20] Along with John Nash's work on isometric immersions, the Hirsch\u2013Smale immersion theory was highly influential in Mikhael Gromov's early work on development of the h-principle, which abstracted and applied their ideas to contexts other than that of immersions.[21]/nIn the study of dynamical systems, Smale introduced what is now known as a Morse\u2013Smale system.[22] For these dynamical systems, Smale was able to prove Morse inequalities relating the cohomology of the underlying space to the dimensions of the (un)stable manifolds. Part of the significance of these results is from Smale's theorem asserting that the gradient flow of any Morse function can be arbitrarily well approximated by a Morse\u2013Smale system without closed orbits.[23] Using these tools, Smale was able to construct self-indexing Morse functions, where the value of the function equals its Morse index at any critical point.[24] Using these self-indexing Morse functions as a key tool, Smale resolved the generalized Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in every dimension greater than four.[25] Building on these works, he also established the more powerful h-cobordism theorem the following year, together with the full classification of simply-connected smooth five-dimensional manifolds.[26][24]/nSmale also identified the Smale horseshoe, inspiring much subsequent research. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others. Smale is also known for injecting Morse theory into mathematical economics, as well as recent explorations of various theories of computation./nIn 1998 he compiled a list of 18 problems in mathematics to be solved in the 21st century, known as Smale's problems.[27] This list was compiled in the spirit of Hilbert's famous list of problems produced in 1900. In fact, Smale's list contains some of the original Hilbert problems, including the Riemann hypothesis and the second half of Hilbert's sixteenth problem, both of which are still unsolved.  Other famous problems on his list include the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture (now a theorem, proved by Grigori Perelman), the P = NP problem, and the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, all of which have been designated Millennium Prize Problems by the Clay Mathematics Institute.", "25435495": "(Nels) David Nelson, an American mathematician and logician, was born on January 2, 1918, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

As a consequence, they demonstrated that certain classically true formulas are unverifiable in the intuitionistic predicate calculus with strong negation.[3]/nNelson taught at Amherst College from 1942 to 1946 as an assistant professor.

His only surviving work is the Latin treatise Musica practica.[2]/nBy his own testimony at the end of his Musica practica, Ramos de Pareja was born in Baeza, possibly around 1440. Most of the biographical details of his life must be culled from this treatise. He says that he was a student of Juan de Monte and that he obtained the chair of music at the University of Salamanca for his commentaries on the works of Boethius (cum Boetium in musica legeremus). At Salamanca he had many debates with Pedro de Osma concerning his musical theories. In 1482, when he published his Musica, he revolutionarily proposed a new, five-limit division of the monochord, breaking from the Pythagorean system that had dominated the medieval ars antiqua through Boethius and Guido of Arezzo. This system of musical tuning yielded consonant perfect fourths and fifths, but the thirds and sixths were rough.[3] Ramos de Pareja's new division was only slowly accepted. Afterwards he worked in Italy, primarily at Bologna, where his theories engendered serious controversy, even polemics, from conservatives such as Franchino Gaffurio. After a long stay there he moved to Rome, where he died shortly after 1521./nRamos de Pareja sought to heal the divide between music in theory and in practice. To this end he sought to render the dissonant thirds and sixths consonant. He proposed the intervals 5/4, 6/5, 5/3, and 8/5 for the division of the monochord, subsequently accepted universally. Less successful was his attempt to replace hexachordal notation with a system of eight syllables denoting the eight sounds of a diatonic scale: psal-li-tur-per-vo-ces-is-tas./nThe Musica practica also contains interesting commentary on mensural notation, chromatic alterations, examples of counterpoint, musical instruments, and the division of music and its effects. Ramos de Pareja was the first theorist to label the method now known as the Guidonian hand the manus Guidonis; prior to him it was called the manus musicalis. He chose the title Musica practica to emphasise the practical rather than the theoretical/mathematical component of music. Throughout Ramos de Pareja alludes to his own compositions, though few survive.", "24157547": "Tadao Tannaka (\u6de1\u4e2d \u5fe0\u90ce, Tannaka Tadao, December 27, 1908 \u2013 October 25, 1986) was a Japanese mathematician who worked in algebraic number theory./nTannaka was born in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture on December 27, 1908.[1][2][3] After receiving a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Tohoku Imperial University in 1932, he was appointed a lecturer in the university in 1934 and received a Doctor of Science degree from the university in 1941.[1][3] He was promoted to assistant professor in 1942 and full professor in 1945.[1][2][3] Tannaka was a member at the Institute for Advanced Study from September 1955 to April 1957.[1][3][4] Tannaka retired from Tohoku University in 1972, after which he served as a full professor at Tohoku Gakuin University until 1981.[1][3]/nTannaka was an editor of the Tohoku Mathematical Journal and a member of the board of directors of the Mathematical Society of Japan.[1] Tannaka was also in charge of the \"Mathematics Chat\" article series in the monthly Mathematics for Universities\u00a0[jp] magazine from 1960 onwards.[5]/nTannaka died in Tokyo on October 25, 1986.[1][2][3]/nTannaka is known for developing the theory of Tannaka\u2013Krein duality, which generalizes Pontryagin duality to noncommutative compact groups and led to the development of Tannakian formalism.[1][2][6][7]/nTannaka was a recipient of the Order of the Rising Sun (3rd Class) in 1980.[3]", "23534956": "K.

He spent a few years teaching mathematics in some privately managed colleges[2] before joining the newly started Department of Mathematics, University of Kerala, as a research scholar in mathematics in 1965. He was initially under the supervision of Prof. M. R. Parameswaran. A year later he came under the guidance of Prof. B. R. Srinivasan. About two years later, consequent on the departure of Prof. B. R. Srinivasan from University of Kerala, Nambooripad became a student of Prof. Y. Sitaraman. He was awarded the PhD degree in 1974./nNambooripad's basic contributions are in the structure theory of regular semigroups. A semigroup is a set S together with an associative binary operation in S. A semigroup S is said to be regular if for every a in S there is an element b in S such that aba = a. Nambooripad axiomatically characterised the structure of the set of idempotents in a regular semigroup. He called a set having this structure a biordered set. \"The axioms defining a biordered set are quite complicated. However, considering the general nature of semigroups, it is rather surprising that such a finite axiomatization is even possible.\"[3] A full treatment of the theory was published as a single paper number of the Memoirs of American mathematical Society in 1979.\n\"In the mid 70s A. H. Clifford became very much excited by the work of Nambooripad on the structure of regular semigroups in terms of idempotent ordering and sandwich matrices and wrote several expository papers on Nambooripad structure theorem for regular semigroups\".[4]/nHe later developed an alternative approach to describe the structure of regular semigroups.  This particular work utilizes the abstract theory of cross-connections to provide a useful framework for studying various classes of regular semigroups.[5][6]/nTeX was introduced into Kerala by Nambooripad. After a visit to the United States in early 1990s, he brought the TeX programme to Kerala in fourteen floppy disks. Nambooripad encouraged his students to learn and use TeX, especially for preparing their theses. One of his students was E. Krishnan, one of the authors of the LaTeX primer2 published as an electronic book by the Indian TeX User Group. Krishnan also played an important role in establishing the Free Software Foundation of India.

He began his education at a grammar school in Leeds in 1756, but this ended in 1760 with the death of his father. He was apprenticed as a weaver, reading the classics when time permitted, until his elder brother, Joseph Milner, provided him with an opportunity. Joseph was offered the mastership at Hull's grammar school and invited Isaac to become the institution's usher./nThrough the patronage of his brother, Milner was subsequently freed from his duties in Hull and entered Queens' College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1770. He graduated with a BA degree as senior wrangler in 1774, winning the first Smith's prize.[3]/nShortly after he took his bachelor's degree he was ordained as deacon; in 1776 Queens' offered him a fellowship; in the following year he became a priest and college tutor; and in 1778 he was presented with the rectory of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge. However, he was a northerner at heart and thus was sent to reform the management of the Deanery of Carlisle. Taking a scientific approach to the Church of England's most northerly parishes he achieved success for the chapter and diocese. But Milner remained ambitious and seeking promotion he desired a return to Cambridge./nDuring these years his career as a natural philosopher began to take off. In 1776 Nevil Maskelyne hired him as a computer for the board of longitude, and two of his mathematical papers were presented to the Royal Society, of which he was elected fellow in 1780. In these papers Milner displayed three things: proficiency in mathematics, suspicion of French philosophy, and adherence to English Newtonian mechanics.  In 1782 the Jacksonian professorship of natural philosophy was established and the syndicate selected Milner as the inaugural professor, a position he retained until 1792.[4]/nBesides lecturing, Milner also developed an important process to fabricate nitrous acid, a key ingredient in the production of gunpowder. His paper describing this process was published in the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions in 1789 alongside an article of Joseph Priestley's, and the two corresponded on the subject. In later years Milner transferred his elaborate collection of chemical apparatus into the president's lodge at Queens' and performed experiments with E. D. Clarke, William Whewell, and the Wollaston brothers; he also collaborated with Humphry Davy and Joseph Banks in an attempt to cure gout./nOver the span of his forty-five-year career, Milner's scientific sentiments came to reflect his religious sentiments strongly. Although he never parted from the Anglican fold, he came to embrace the central evangelical doctrines of the late eighteenth century. Milner, with Charles Simeon, was largely responsible for the evangelical revival at Cambridge in post as Master of Queens' College.  Indeed, throughout the years of his tenure he dramatically changed the entire complexion of the college.  He was also responsible for the conversion of William Wilberforce, which occurred during their long continental tour of 1784\u20135.

In particular, he is recognized for his discovery of an original method of finding the greatest and the smallest ordinates of curved lines, which is analogous to that of differential calculus, then unknown, and his research into number theory. He made notable contributions to analytic geometry, probability, and optics. He is best known for his Fermat's principle for light propagation and his Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, which he described in a note at the margin of a copy of Diophantus' Arithmetica.

He was from Gascony, where his father, Dominique Fermat, was a wealthy leather merchant and served three one-year terms as one of the four consuls of Beaumont-de-Lomagne. His mother was Claire de Long.[2] Pierre had one brother and two sisters and was almost certainly brought up in the town of his birth.[citation needed]/nHe attended the University of Orl\u00e9ans from 1623 and received a bachelor in civil law in 1626, before moving to Bordeaux. In Bordeaux, he began his first serious mathematical researches, and in 1629 he gave a copy of his restoration of Apollonius's De Locis Planis to one of the mathematicians there. Certainly, in Bordeaux he was in contact with Beaugrand and during this time he produced important work on maxima and minima which he gave to \u00c9tienne d'Espagnet who clearly shared mathematical interests with Fermat. There he became much influenced by the work of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te.[4]/nIn 1630, he bought the office of a councilor at the Parlement de Toulouse, one of the High Courts of Judicature in France, and was sworn in by the Grand Chambre in May 1631. He held this office for the rest of his life. Fermat thereby became entitled to change his name from Pierre Fermat to Pierre de Fermat. On 1 June 1631, Fermat married Louise de Long, a fourth cousin of his mother Claire de Fermat (n\u00e9e de Long). The Fermats had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood: Cl\u00e9ment-Samuel, Jean, Claire, Catherine, and Louise.[5][6][7]/nFluent in six languages (French, Latin, Occitan, classical Greek, Italian and Spanish), Fermat was praised for his written verse in several languages and his advice was eagerly sought regarding the emendation of Greek texts. He communicated most of his work in letters to friends, often with little or no proof of his theorems. In some of these letters to his friends, he explored many of the fundamental ideas of calculus before Newton or Leibniz. Fermat was a trained lawyer making mathematics more of a hobby than a profession. Nevertheless, he made important contributions to analytical geometry, probability, number theory and calculus.[8] Secrecy was common in European mathematical circles at the time. This naturally led to priority disputes with contemporaries such as Descartes and Wallis.[9]/nAnders Hald writes that, \"The basis of Fermat's mathematics was the classical Greek treatises combined with Vieta's new algebraic methods.\"[10]/nFermat's pioneering work in analytic geometry (Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam et de tangentibus linearum curvarum) was circulated in manuscript form in 1636 (based on results achieved in 1629),[11] predating the publication of Descartes' famous La g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1637), which exploited the work.[12] This manuscript was published posthumously in 1679 in Varia opera mathematica, as Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci).[13]/nIn Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam and in De tangentibus linearum curvarum, Fermat developed a method (adequality) for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was equivalent to differential calculus.[14][15] In these works, Fermat obtained a technique for finding the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures, which led to his further work in quadrature./nFermat was the first person known to have evaluated the integral of general power functions. With his method, he was able to reduce this evaluation to the sum of geometric series.[16] The resulting formula was helpful to Newton, and then Leibniz, when they independently developed the fundamental theorem of calculus.[citation needed]/nIn number theory, Fermat studied Pell's equation, perfect numbers, amicable numbers and what would later become Fermat numbers. It was while researching perfect numbers that he discovered Fermat's little theorem. He invented a factorization method\u2014Fermat's factorization method\u2014and popularized the proof by infinite descent, which he used to prove Fermat's right triangle theorem which includes as a corollary Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n = 4. Fermat developed the two-square theorem, and the polygonal number theorem, which states that each number is a sum of three triangular numbers, four square numbers, five pentagonal numbers, and so on./nAlthough Fermat claimed to have proven all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived. Many mathematicians, including Gauss, doubted several of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat. His famous Last Theorem was first discovered by his son in the margin in his father's copy of an edition of Diophantus, and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof. It seems that he had not written to Marin Mersenne about it. It was first proven in 1994, by Sir Andrew Wiles, using techniques unavailable to Fermat.[citation needed]/nThrough their correspondence in 1654, Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped lay the foundation for the theory of probability. From this brief but productive collaboration on the problem of points, they are now regarded as joint founders of probability theory.[17] Fermat is credited with carrying out the first-ever rigorous probability calculation. In it, he was asked by a professional gambler why if he bet on rolling at least one six in four throws of a die he won in the long term, whereas betting on throwing at least one double-six in 24 throws of two dice resulted in his losing. Fermat showed mathematically why this was the case.[18]/nThe first variational principle in physics was articulated by Euclid in his Catoptrica. It says that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Hero of Alexandria later showed that this path gave the shortest length and the least time.[19] Fermat refined and generalized this to \"light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time\" now known as the principle of least time.[20] For this, Fermat is recognized as a key figure in the historical development of the fundamental principle of least action in physics. The terms Fermat's principle and Fermat functional were named in recognition of this role.[21]/nPierre de Fermat died on January 12, 1665, at Castres, in the present-day department of Tarn.[22] The oldest and most prestigious high school in Toulouse is named after him: the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat. French sculptor Th\u00e9ophile Barrau made a marble statue named Hommage \u00e0 Pierre Fermat as a tribute to Fermat, now at the Capitole de Toulouse./nTogether with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Fermat was one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century. According to Peter L. Bernstein, in his 1996 book Against the Gods, Fermat \"was a mathematician of rare power. He was an independent inventor of analytic geometry, he contributed to the early development of calculus, he did research on the weight of the earth, and he worked on light refraction and optics.

While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic./nErn\u0151 Rubik was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 13 July 1944, during World War II, and has lived all of his life in Hungary.

His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ern\u0151 Rubik has stated that:[4]/nBeside him I learned a lot about work in the sense of a value-creating process which has a target, and a positive result too. Both figuratively and literally he was a person capable of 'moving a hill'. There was nothing that could prevent him from doing what he decided or bringing a project to a completion, if necessary even with his own hands. No work was unworthy or undeserving for him./nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialized in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the Budapest University of Technology where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was in the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.[4]/nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik stated, \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence, and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"[4]/nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of Applied Arts (Iparm\u0171v\u00e9szeti F\u0151iskola). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the Rubik's Cube in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with CNN, Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"[5]/nSpace always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time. I think the CUBE arose from this interest, from this search for expression and for this always more increased acuteness of these thoughts.../nStarting with blocks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set out to create a structure that would allow the individual pieces to move without the whole structure falling apart. Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together.[5]/nRubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that, because of the cube's simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik's father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of communist Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces.[4] The cube was originally known in Hungary as the Magic Cube.[6]/nRubik licensed the Magic Cube to Ideal Toys, a US company in 1979. Ideal rebranded The Magic Cube to the Rubik's Cube before its introduction to an international audience in 1980.[7][8] The process from early prototype to significant mass production of the Cube had taken over six years.[5] The Rubik's Cube would go on to become an instant success worldwide, winning several Toy of the Year awards, and becoming a staple of 1980s popular culture. To date, over 350 million Rubik's Cubes have been sold, making it one of the best selling toys of all time.

His work included foundational papers in both pure and applied mathematics, celestial mechanics (notably on the three-body problem), analytic mechanics (the Levi-Civita separability conditions in the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation)[2] and hydrodynamics.[3][4]/nBorn into an Italian Jewish family in Padua, Levi-Civita was the son of Giacomo Levi-Civita, a lawyer and former senator. He graduated in 1892 from the University of Padua Faculty of Mathematics. In 1894 he earned a teaching diploma after which he was appointed to the Faculty of Science teacher's college in Pavia. In 1898 he was appointed to the Padua Chair of Rational Mechanics (left uncovered by death of Ernesto Padova) where he met and, in 1914, married Libera Trevisani, one of his pupils.[5] He remained in his position at Padua until 1918, when he was appointed to the Chair of Higher Analysis at the University of Rome; in another two years he was appointed to the Chair of Mechanics there./nIn 1900 he and Ricci-Curbastro published the theory of tensors in M\u00e9thodes de calcul diff\u00e9rentiel absolu et leurs applications,[6] which Albert Einstein used as a resource to master the tensor calculus, a critical tool in the development of the theory of general relativity. In 1917 he introduced the notion of parallel transport[7][8] in Riemannian geometry, motivated by the will to simplify the computation of the curvature of a Riemannian manifold.[9] Levi-Civita's series of papers on the problem of a static gravitational field were also discussed in his 1915\u20131917 correspondence with Einstein. The correspondence was initiated by Levi-Civita, as he found mathematical errors in Einstein's use of tensor calculus to explain the theory of relativity. Levi-Civita methodically kept all of Einstein's replies to him; and even though Einstein had not kept Levi-Civita's, the entire correspondence could be re-constructed from Levi-Civita's archive. It is evident from this that, after numerous letters, the two men had grown to respect each other. In one of the letters, regarding Levi-Civita's new work, Einstein wrote \"I admire the elegance of your method of computation; it must be nice to ride through these fields upon the horse of true mathematics while the like of us have to make our way laboriously on foot\".[10] In 1933 Levi-Civita contributed to Paul Dirac's equations in quantum mechanics as well.[11]/nHis textbook on tensor calculus, The Absolute Differential Calculus (originally a set of lecture notes in Italian co-authored with Ricci-Curbastro), remains one of the standard texts almost a century after its first publication, with several translations available./nIn 1936, receiving an invitation from Einstein, Levi-Civita traveled to Princeton, United States and lived there with him for a year. But when the risk of war in Europe again rose, he returned to Italy. The 1938 race laws enacted by the Italian Fascist government deprived Levi-Civita of his professorship and of his membership of all scientific societies.  Isolated from the scientific world, he died in his apartment in Rome in 1941./nAmong his PhD students were Octav Onicescu, Attilio Palatini, Giovanni Lampariello and Gheorghe Vr\u00e2nceanu./nLater on, when asked what he liked best about Italy, Einstein said \"spaghetti and Levi-Civita\".[12]/nAnalytical dynamics was another aspect of Levi-Civita's studies: many of his articles examine the three-body problem. He wrote articles on hydrodynamics and on systems of differential equations. He is credited with improvements to the Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem, on which he wrote a book in 1931. In 1933, he contributed to work on the Dirac equation. He developed the Levi-Civita field, a system of numbers that includes infinitesimal quantities./nLevi-Civita was elected an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1917.[13] The Royal Society awarded him the Sylvester Medal in 1922 and elected him as a foreign member in 1930. He became an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, following his participation in their colloquium in 1930 at the University of St Andrews. He was also a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.[14]/nAll his mathematical works, except for the monographs, treatises and textbooks, were posthumously gathered in the six volumes of his \"Collected works\", in a revised typographical form amending both typographical errors and author's oversights.", "2629104": "Lucien Marie Le Cam (November 18, 1924 \u2013 April 25, 2000) was a mathematician and statistician./nLe Cam was born November 18, 1924, in Croze, France.

He was a mathematician noted for his work on the decidability of various algebraic groups. Malcev algebras (generalisations of Lie algebras), as well as Malcev Lie algebras are named after him./nAt school, Maltsev demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics, and when he left school in 1927, he went to Moscow State University to study Mathematics.

His father, Urban, a carpenter and crofter, died when Josip was only a year old. His mother Marija, n\u00e9e Mrak, found bringing up the family alone very hard, but she was able to send her son to school in Ljubljana, where Plemelj studied from 1886 to 1894. Due to a bench thrown into Tivoli Pond by him or his friends, he could not attend the school after he finished the fourth class and had to pass the final exam privately.[2] After leaving and obtaining the necessary examination results he went to the University of Vienna in 1894 where he had applied to Faculty of Arts to study mathematics, physics and astronomy. His professors in Vienna were von Escherich for mathematical analysis, Gegenbauer and Mertens for arithmetic and algebra, Weiss for astronomy, Stefan's student Boltzmann for physics./nIn May 1898, Plemelj presented his doctoral thesis under Escherich's tutelage entitled \u00dcber lineare homogene Differentialgleichungen mit eindeutigen periodischen Koeffizienten (Linear Homogeneous Differential Equations with Uniform Periodical Coefficients). He continued with his study in Berlin (1899/1900) under the German mathematicians Frobenius and Fuchs and in G\u00f6ttingen (1900/1901) under Klein and Hilbert./nIn April 1902 he became a private senior lecturer at the University of Vienna. In 1906, he was appointed assistant at the Technical University of Vienna. In 1907, he became associate professor and in 1908 full professor of mathematics at the University of Chernivtsi (Ukrainian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0446\u0456, Russian: \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0446\u044b), Ukraine. From 1912 to 1913 he was dean of this faculty. In 1917, his political views led him to be forcibly ejected by the government and resettled  in Moravia. After the First World War he became a member of the University Commission under the Slovene Provincial Government and helped establish the first Slovene university at Ljubljana, and was elected its first chancellor. In the same year he was appointed professor of mathematics at the Faculty of Arts. After the Second World War he joined the Faculty of Natural Science and Technology (FNT). He retired in 1957 after having lectured in mathematics for 40 years./nPlemelj had shown his great gift for mathematics early in elementary school. He mastered the whole of the high school syllabus by the beginning of the fourth year and began to tutor students for their graduation examinations. At that time he discovered alone series for sin x and cos x. Actually he found a series for cyclometric function arccos x and after that he just inverted this series and then guessed a principle for coefficients. Yet he did not have a proof for that./nPlemelj had great joy for a difficult constructional tasks from geometry. From his high school days originates an elementary problem \u2014  his later construction of regular sevenfold polygon inscribed in a circle otherwise exactly and not approximately with simple solution as an angle trisection which was yet not known in those days and which necessarily leads to the old Indian or Babylonian approximate construction. He started to occupy himself with mathematics in fourth and fifth class of high school. Beside in mathematics he was interested also in natural science and especially astronomy. He studied celestial mechanics already at high school. He liked observing the stars. His eyesight was so sharp he could see the planet Venus even in the daytime./nPlemelj's main research interests were the theory of linear differential equations, integral equations, potential theory, the theory of analytic functions, and functional analysis. Plemelj encountered integral equations while still a student at G\u00f6ttingen, when the Swedish professor Erik Holmgren gave a lecture on the work of his fellow countryman Fredholm on linear integral equations of the 1st and 2nd kind. Spurred on by Hilbert, G\u00f6ttingen mathematicians attacked this new area of research and Plemelj was one of the first to publish original results on the question, applying the theory of integral equations to the study of harmonic functions in potential theory./nHis most important work in potential theory is summarised in his 1911 book Potentialtheoretische Untersuchungen (Studies in Potential Theory),[3] which received the Jablonowski Society award in Leipzig (1500 marks), and the Richard Lieben award from the University of Vienna (2000 crowns) for the most outstanding work in the field of pure and applied mathematics written by any kind of 'Austrian' mathematician in the previous three years./nHis most original contribution is the elementary solution he provided for the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem f+ = g f\u2212 about the existence of a differential equation with given monodromy group. The solution, published in his 1908 article \"Riemannian classes of functions with given monodromy group\", rests on three formulas that now carry his name, which connect the values taken by a holomorphic function at the boundary of an arc \u0393:[4]/nThese formulas are variously called the Plemelj formulae, the Sokhotsky-Plemelj formulae, or sometimes (mainly in German literature) the Plemelj-Sokhotsky Formulae, after the Polish mathematician Julian Sochocki (1842\u20131927)./nBased on his methods of solving the Riemann problem he had developed the theory of singular integral equations (MSC (2000) 45-Exx) which was used above all by the Russian school at the head of Nikoloz Muskhelishvili (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u0445\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438) (1891\u20131976)./nPlemelj contributed significantly to the theory of analytic functions in solving the problem of uniformization of algebraic functions, contributions on formulation of the theorem of analytic extension of designs and treatises in algebra and in number theory./nIn 1912, Plemelj published a very simple proof of the special case of Fermat's Last Theorem where the exponent, n, is 5.[5] More difficult proofs of this case were first provided by Dirichlet in 1828 and Legendre in 1830.[5]/nHis arrival in Ljubljana in 1919 was seminal for the development of mathematics in Slovenia. As a good teacher he had raised several generations of mathematicians and engineers. His most famous student is Ivan Vidav.

In 1897 he submitted his results to James W. Glaisher, then editor of the journal Messenger of Mathematics. Glaisher was favourably impressed and passed the results on to William Burnside and Alfred Whitehead.

He is famous as a private tutor of aspiring undergraduate Cambridge mathematicians, earning him the sobriquet the \"senior-wrangler maker.\"/nHe also made important contributions in asserting a solid, rather than fluid, interior for the Earth and explaining many geological phenomena in terms of his model. However, though his conclusions proved to be correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning were subsequently seen as unsound./nHopkins was born at Kingston-on-Soar, in Nottinghamshire, the only son of William Hopkins, a gentleman farmer. In his youth he learned practical agriculture in Norfolk before his father rented him a small farm at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.[2] However, Hopkins was unsuccessful as a farmer and, when his first wife died sometime around 1821, he took the opportunity to mitigate his losses and enter St Peter's College (now Peterhouse) at the University of Cambridge, taking his degree of B.A. in 1827 as seventh wrangler and M.A. in 1830.[3]/nBefore graduation, Hopkins had married Caroline Frances Boys (1799\u20131881) and was, therefore, ineligible for a fellowship. He instead maintained himself as a private tutor, coaching the young mathematicians who sought the prestigious distinction of Senior Wrangler. He was enormously successful in the role, earning the sobriquet senior wrangler maker and grossing \u00a3700\u2013800 annually. By 1849, he had coached almost 200 wranglers, of whom 17 were senior wranglers including Arthur Cayley and G. G. Stokes. Among his more famous pupils were Lord Kelvin, James Clerk Maxwell and Isaac Todhunter. Francis Galton praised his teaching style:[3]/nHopkins to use a Cantab expression is a regular brick; tells funny stories connected with different problems and is no way Donnish; he rattles us on at a splendid pace and makes mathematics anything but a dry subject by entering thoroughly into its metaphysics. I never enjoyed anything so much before./nHe also coached Edward Routh who went on to be Senior Wrangler and himself a prodigious \"wrangler maker\".[4] In 1833, Hopkins published Elements of Trigonometry and became distinguished for his mathematical knowledge.[2]/nThere was a famous story that the theory of George Green (1793\u20131841) was almost forgotten. In 1845, Lord Kelvin (William Thomson, a young man in 1845) got some copies of Green's 1828 short book from William Hopkins. Subsequently, Lord Kelvin helped to make Green's 1828 work famous.[5]/nAbout 1833, through meeting Adam Sedgwick at Barmouth and joining him in several excursions, Hopkins became intensely interested in geology. From then on, in papers published by the Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Geological Society of London, he defined the discipline of physical geology, making mathematical investigations dealing with the effects that an elevatory force, acting from below, would produce on a portion of the Earth's crust, in fissures and faults. In this way he discussed the elevation and denudation of the Lake District, the Wealden area, and the Bas Boulonnais.[2]/nHopkins conceived of a largely solid but dynamic Earth threaded with cavities whereby hot vapours or fluids could create locally elevatory pressures. Such a model was at odds with the ideas of Charles Lyell whose theory was of a \"steady state\" with a largely liquid terrestrial interior, inside a solid crust no more than 100 miles thick. Hopkins presented a series of papers at the Royal Society between 1838 and 1842 analysing the Earth's rotation, including its precession and nutation, and using observations to support his theory, contending that they were inconsistent with a fluid interior. He also interpreted earthquakes and volcanoes through the same model in an 1847 British Association report.[3]/nAs part of his investigations, Hopkins sought to quantify the effects of enormous pressures on the melting point and thermal conductivity of various substances. With the support of a grant from the Royal Society, he invoked the assistance of Thomson, James Prescott Joule and William Fairbairn to make measurements which he interpreted as supporting his theory. He further asserted that the cooling of the Earth had had no real impact on climate.[3] He read a paper to the Geological Society On the Causes which may have produced changes in the Earth's superficial Temperature (1851). In his second address as president of the Geological Society of London (1853) he criticised Elie de Beaumont's theory of the elevation of mountain-chains and the imperfect evidence on which he saw it as resting.[2]/nUltimately, it was Thomson who tactfully pointed out that, though Hopkins's conclusions about the Earth's structure were correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning was unsound.[3]/nHopkins wrote also on the motion of glaciers and the transport of glacial erratics[2] but trespassed on the sensitivities of J. D. Forbes who saw the subject as his personal fiefdom and was contemptuous of Hopkins's lack of observational experience in the subject.[3]/nHopkins enjoyed music, poetry and landscape painting. He spent the end of his life in a lunatic asylum in Stoke Newington. He died there of chronic mania and exhaustion.[3]/nHe had, with his second wife, one son and three daughters, among them morality campaigner Ellice Hopkins.[3]/nHe played first-class cricket from 1825 to 1828.

She also found a newfound enjoyment in sexually charged performances and began going to cabarets in the Rembrandtplein area, where she bought a wig for performances.[14] Her newfound enjoyment led her to experiment with dressing up. She said that working as a sex worker in a brothel gave her a euphoric feeling because it was the first time in her life that she was accepted and approached as a woman on both a sexual and an emotional level. She felt a variety of emotions, some of which were not directly related to the sexual aspect of the experience.[15]/nShe wrote about sadomasochism, advocated for pornography, and worked to eliminate prejudices regarding transgender people, sex work, and sexual pleasure.

She is most noted for her formulation of ray tracing equations in a cold magneto-plasma, now widely known in the radio science community[1] as Haselgrove's Equations.[2][3]/nHaselgrove developed her equations at Cambridge University in the 1950s, as a student under Kenneth Budden, by re-applying the earlier work of William Rowan Hamilton  and Hamilton's principle in geometrical optics[4] to radio propagation in a plasma.[5] Indeed, the application of Haselgrove's equations is often termed Hamiltonian ray tracing. Ray tracing is intrinsically an approximation that is often called geometric. It formulates as the Eikonal equation and is only applicable under certain conditions including that the plasma is slowly varying; nevertheless it has enormous practical use in radio science.  Other radio propagation scientists have developed various techniques to explore radio propagation in such media,[3]  but Haselgrove's formulation has seen the most widespread application, most likely because the resulting set of differential equations readily lend themselves to numerical solution on a computer. Haselgrove herself used the Cambridge computer, EDSAC, to study ray propagation in the Earth's ionosphere in the late 1950s.[6] Historically the best-known code applying Haselgrove's equations is  the Jones-Stephenson code[7] which was developed in the 1970s and may be found at the US Department of Commerce website./nToday Haselgrove's equations are widely used in scientific investigations involving radio propagation in slowly varying plasmas, and therefore have found much applicability in exploration and utilization of the Earth's ionosphere. Here they have also been used to represent the radio propagation element of practical systems providing high frequency communication, direction finding and over-the-horizon radar. For a recent broad discussion on ray tracing in the ionosphere see Bennett et al.[8] Other publications applying Haselgrove's equations have recently appeared.[9]/nHaselgrove was married to British mathematician C. Brian Haselgrove and published several highly cited, technical articles with him (e.g.,[10]). They are also credited for first  solving the 6\u00d710 Pentomino. Brian Haselgrove died in 1964, and Jenifer remarried to another British mathematician, John Leech, and took his surname. She worked at the University of Glasgow until 1982. She resided in England until her death on 13 March 2015.", "55811631": "Paul Mansion (3 June 1844 \u2013 16 April 1919) was a Belgian mathematician, editor of the journal Mathesis./nMansion was the ninth of the ten brothers. His father died when he was only a baby and he was brought up by his mother and his older brothers. He studied at Huy school and high school.[1] In 1862 he entered in the \u00c9cole Normale des Sciences, attached to the University of Ghent, where he graduated in 1865. From this time till 1867 he taught mathematics in the artillery academy in Ghent, while he was working in his doctoral thesis. He was awarded PhD in 1867.[2]/nIn 1867, after the death of his professor Mathias Schaar, he was appointed to the chair of calculus at the university of Ghent.[3] He remained there until he was appointed to the chair of probability in 1892.[4] Also, from 1884, he taught the history of mathematics./nIn 1874, with Eugene Catalan, he founded the journal Nouvelle Correspondence Math\u00e9matique, and in 1880, with Joseph Neuberg, he founded the journal Mathesis.[5]/nThe works of Mansion, deal mainly with non-Euclidean geometry,[6] history of mathematics,[7] and differential equations. He published 349 works in very different journals.[8]", "2793007": "M\u0101dhava of Sangamagr\u0101ma (M\u0101dhavan)[5] (c.\u20091340\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091425) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who is considered as the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics in the Late Middle Ages. Madhava made pioneering contributions to the study of infinite series, calculus, trigonometry, geometry, and algebra. He was the first to use infinite series approximations for a range of trigonometric functions, which has been called the \"decisive step onward from the finite procedures of ancient mathematics to treat their limit-passage to infinity\".[1]/nLittle is known about M\u0101dhava's life with certainty. However, from scattered references to M\u0101dhava found in diverse manuscripts, historians of Kerala school have pieced together informations about the mathematician. In a manuscript preserved in the Oriental Institute, Baroda, Madhava has been referred to as M\u0101dhavan v\u0113\u1e47v\u0101r\u014dh\u0101d\u012bn\u0101m kartt\u0101 ...

This is corroborated by M\u0101dhava himself. In his short work on the moon's positions titled Ve\u1e47v\u0101roha, M\u0101dhava says that he was born in a house named baku\u1e37\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dhita . . . vih\u0101ra.[7] This is clearly Sanskrit for Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i. Ila\u00f1\u00f1i is the Malayalam name of the evergreen tree  Mimusops elengi and the Sanskrit name for the same is Baku\u1e37a. Palli is a term for village. The Sanskrit house name baku\u1e37\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dhita . . . vih\u0101ra has also been interpreted as a reference to the Malayalam house name Ira\u00f1\u00f1i ninna ppa\u1e37\u1e37i and some historians have tried to identify it with one of two currently existing houses with names Iri\u00f1\u00f1anava\u1e37\u1e37i and Iri\u00f1\u00f1\u0101rapa\u1e37\u1e37i both of which are located near Irinjalakuda town in central Kerala.[7] This identification is far fetched because both names have neither phonetic similarity nor semantic equivalence to the word \"Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i\".[6]/nMost of the writers of astronomical and mathematical works who lived after Madhava's period have referred to Madhava as \"Sangamagrama Madhava\" and as such it is important that the real import of the word \"Sangamagrama\" be made clear. The general view among many scholars is that Sangamagrama is the town of Irinjalakuda some 70 kilometers south of the Nila river and about 70 kilometers south of Cochin.[6] It seems that there is not much concrete ground for this belief except perhaps the fact that the presiding deity of an early medieval temple in the town, the Koodalmanikyam Temple, is worshiped as Sangameswara meaning the Lord of the Samgama and so Samgamagrama can be interpreted as the village of Samgameswara. But there are several places in Karnataka with samgama or its equivalent k\u016b\u1e0dala in their names and with a temple dedicated to Samgam\u1e17svara, the lord of the confluence. (Kudalasangama in Bagalkot district is one such place with a celebrated temple dedicated to the Lord of the Samgama.)[6]/nThere is a small town on the southern banks of the Nila river, around 10 kilometers upstream from Tirunavaya, called K\u016b\u1e0dall\u016br. The exact literal Sanskrit translation of this place name is Samgamagram: k\u016b\u1e6dal in Malayalam means a confluence (which in Sanskrit is samgama) and \u016br means a village (which in Sanskrit is grama). Also the place is at the confluence of the Nila river and its most important tributary, namely, the Kunti river. (There is no confluence of rivers near Irinjalakuada.) Incidentally there is still existing a Nambudiri (Malayali Brahmin) family by name K\u016btall\u016br Mana a few kilometers away from the Kudallur village. The family has its origins in Kudallur village itself. For many generations this family hosted a great Gurukulam specialising in Vedanga.[6] That the only available manuscript of Sphu\u1e6dacandr\u0101pti, a book authored by Madhava, was obtained from the manuscript collection of K\u016btall\u016br Mana might strengthen the conjecture that Madhava might have had some association with K\u016btall\u016br Mana.[8] Thus the most plausible possibility is that the forefathers of Madhava migrated from the Tulu land or thereabouts to settle in Kudallur village, which is situated on the southern banks of the Nila river not far from Tirunnavaya, a generation or two before his birth and lived in a house known as Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i whose present identity is unknown.[6]/nThere are also no definite evidences to pinpoint the period during which Madhava flourished. In his Venvaroha, Madhava gives a date in 1400 CE as the epoch. Madhava's pupil Parameshvara Nambudiri, the only known direct pupil of Madhava, is known to have completed his seminal work Drigganita in 1430 and the Paramesvara's date has been determined as c.\u20091360-1455. From such circumstantial evidences historians have assigned the date c.\u20091340\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091425 to Madhava./nAlthough there is some evidence of mathematical work in Kerala prior to Madhava (e.g., Sadratnamala[which?] c. 1300, a set of fragmentary results[9]), it is clear from citations that Madhava provided the creative impulse for the development of a rich mathematical tradition in medieval Kerala.  However, except for a couple, most of Madhava's original works have been lost. He is referred to in the work of subsequent Kerala mathematicians, particularly in Nilakantha Somayaji's Tantrasangraha (c. 1500), as the source for several infinite series expansions, including sin \u03b8 and arctan \u03b8.  The 16th-century text Mahajy\u0101nayana prak\u0101ra (Method of Computing Great Sines) cites Madhava as the source for several series derivations for \u03c0.  In Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva's Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (c. 1530),[10] written in Malayalam, these series are presented with proofs in terms of the Taylor series expansions for polynomials like 1/(1+x2), with x = tan\u00a0\u03b8, etc./nThus, what is explicitly Madhava's work is a source of some debate.  The Yukti-dipika (also called the Tantrasangraha-vyakhya), possibly composed by Sankara Variar, a student of Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva, presents several versions of the series expansions for sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8, and arctan \u03b8, as well as some products with radius and arclength, most versions of which appear in Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.  For those that do not, Rajagopal and Rangachari have argued, quoting extensively from the original Sanskrit,[1] that since some of these have been attributed by Nilakantha to Madhava, some of the other forms might also be the work of Madhava./nOthers have speculated that the early text Karanapaddhati (c. 1375\u20131475), or the Mahajy\u0101nayana prak\u0101ra was written by Madhava, but this is unlikely.[3]/nKaranapaddhati, along with the even earlier Keralite mathematics text Sadratnamala, as well as the Tantrasangraha and Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, were considered in an 1834 article by C. M. Whish, which was the first to draw attention to their priority over Newton in discovering the Fluxion (Newton's name for differentials).[9] In the mid-20th century, the Russian scholar Jushkevich revisited the legacy of Madhava,[11] and a comprehensive look at the Kerala school was provided by Sarma in 1972.[12]/nThere are several known astronomers who preceded Madhava, including K\u01d6\u1e6dalur Kizh\u0101r (2nd century),[13] Vararuci (4th century), and \u015aa\u1e45karan\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a (866 AD).  It is possible that other unknown figures preceded him.  However, we have a clearer record of the tradition after Madhava.  Parameshvara was a direct disciple.  According to a palm leaf manuscript of a Malayalam commentary on the Surya Siddhanta, Parameswara's son Damodara (c. 1400\u20131500) had Nilakantha Somayaji as one of his disciples. Jyeshtadeva was a disciple of Nilakantha. Achyutha Pisharadi of Trikkantiyur is mentioned as a disciple of Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva, and the grammarian Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri as his disciple.[10]/nIf we consider mathematics as a progression from finite processes of algebra to considerations of the infinite, then the first steps towards this transition typically come with infinite series expansions. It is this transition to the infinite series that is attributed to Madhava. In Europe, the first such series were developed by James Gregory in 1667. Madhava's work is notable for the series, but what is truly remarkable is his estimate of an error term (or correction term).[14] This implies that he understood very well the limit nature of the infinite series.  Thus, Madhava may have invented the ideas underlying infinite series expansions of functions, power series, trigonometric series, and rational approximations of infinite series.[15]/nHowever, as stated above, which results are precisely Madhava's and which are those of his successors is difficult to determine.  The following presents a summary of results that have been attributed to Madhava by various scholars./nAmong his many contributions, he discovered infinite series for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, arctangent, and many methods for calculating the circumference of a circle. One of Madhava's series is known from the text Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, which contains the derivation and proof of the power series for inverse tangent, discovered by Madhava.[16] In the text, Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva describes the series in the following manner:/nThe first term is the product of the given sine and radius of the desired arc divided by the cosine of the arc. The succeeding terms are obtained by a process of iteration when the first term is repeatedly multiplied by the square of the sine and divided by the square of the cosine. All the terms are then divided by the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, .... The arc is obtained by adding and subtracting respectively the terms of odd rank and those of even rank. It is laid down that the sine of the arc or that of its complement whichever is the smaller should be taken here as the given sine. Otherwise the terms obtained by this above iteration will not tend to the vanishing magnitude.[17]/nThis yields:/nor equivalently:/nThis series is Gregory's series (named after James Gregory, who rediscovered it three centuries after Madhava).  Even if we consider this particular series as the work of Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva, it would pre-date Gregory by a century, and certainly other infinite series of a similar nature had been worked out by Madhava.  Today, it is referred to as the Madhava-Gregory-Leibniz series.[17][18]/nMadhava composed an accurate table of sines. Madhava's values are accurate to the seventh decimal place. Marking a quarter circle at twenty-four equal intervals, he gave the lengths of the half-chord (sines) corresponding to each of them. It is believed that he may have computed these values based on the series expansions:[4]/nMadhava's work on the value of the mathematical constant Pi is cited in the Mahajy\u0101nayana prak\u0101ra (\"Methods for the great sines\").[citation needed]  While some scholars such as Sarma[10] feel that this book may have been composed by Madhava himself, it is more likely the work of a 16th-century successor.[4] This text attributes most of the expansions to Madhava, and gives the following infinite series expansion of \u03c0, now known as the Madhava-Leibniz series:[19][20]/nwhich he obtained from the power-series expansion of the arc-tangent function. However, what is most impressive is that he also gave a correction term Rn for the error after computing the sum up to n terms,[4] namely:/nwhere the third correction leads to highly accurate computations of \u03c0./nIt has long been speculated how Madhava found these correction terms.[21] They are the first three convergents of a finite continued fraction, which, when combined with the original Madhava's series evaluated to n terms, yields about 3n/2 correct digits:/nThe absolute value of the correction term in next higher order is/nHe also gave a more rapidly converging series by transforming the original infinite series of \u03c0, obtaining the infinite series/nBy using the first 21 terms to compute an approximation of \u03c0, he obtains a value correct to 11 decimal places (3.14159265359).[22]\nThe value of 3.1415926535898, correct to 13 decimals, is sometimes attributed to Madhava,[23] but may be due to one of his followers. These were the most accurate approximations of \u03c0 given since the 5th century (see History of numerical approximations of \u03c0)./nThe text Sadratnamala appears to give the astonishingly accurate value of \u03c0\u00a0=\u00a03.14159265358979324 (correct to 17 decimal places). Based on this, R. Gupta has suggested that this text was also composed by Madhava.[3][22]/nMadhava also carried out investigations into other series for arc lengths and the associated approximations to rational fractions of \u03c0.[3]/nMadhava  developed the power series expansion for some trigonometry functions which were further developed by his successors at the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.[24] (Certain ideas of calculus were known to earlier mathematicians.) Madhava also extended some results found in earlier works, including those of Bh\u0101skara II.[24] However, they did not combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, or turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today.[25]/nK.\u00a0V. Sarma has identified Madhava as the author of the following works:[26][27]/nThe Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics was founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, South India and included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. It flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries.They gave three important results,series expansion of three trigonometry functions of sine, cosine and arctant and the proof of their results where later given in Yuktibhasa text.[9][24][25]/nThe group also did much other work in astronomy; indeed many more pages are developed to astronomical computations than are for discussing analysis related results.[10]/nThe Kerala school also contributed much to linguistics (the relation between language and mathematics is an ancient Indian tradition, see K\u0101ty\u0101yana). The ayurvedic and poetic traditions of Kerala can also be traced back to this school.  The famous poem, Narayaniyam, was composed by Narayana Bhattathiri./nMadhava has been called \"the greatest mathematician-astronomer of medieval India\",[3]  some of his discoveries in this field show him to have possessed extraordinary intuition\".[29] O'Connor and Robertson state that a fair assessment of Madhava is that\nhe took the decisive step towards modern classical analysis.[4]/nThe Kerala school was well known in the 15th and 16th centuries, in the period of the first contact with European navigators in the Malabar Coast.  At the time, the port of Muziris, near Sangamagrama, was a major center for maritime trade, and a number of Jesuit missionaries and traders were active in this region.  Given the fame of the Kerala school, and the interest shown by some of the Jesuit groups during this period in local scholarship, some scholars, including G. Joseph of the U. Manchester have suggested[30] that the writings of the Kerala school may have also been transmitted to Europe around this time, which was still about a century before Newton.[31] However, there is no direct evidence by way of relevant manuscripts that such a transmission actually took place.[31] According to David Bressoud, \"there is no evidence that the Indian work of series was known beyond India, or even outside of Kerala, until the nineteenth century.\"[32]", "40506": "Julian Karol Sochocki (Polish: Julian Karol Sochocki; Russian: \u042e\u043b\u0438\u0430\u043d \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439; February 2, 1842, in Warsaw, Congress Poland, Russian Empire \u2013 December 14, 1927, in Leningrad, Soviet Union) was a Polish-Russian mathematician.[1]  His name is sometimes transliterated from Russian in several different ways (e.g. Sokhotski or Sochotski).[1]/nSochocki was born in Warsaw under the Russian domination to a Polish family, where he attended state gymnasium.

Vega was educated first in Morav\u010de and later attended high school for six years (1767\u20131773) in Ljubljana (the Jesuit College of Ljubljana, Jezuitski kolegij v Ljubljani\u00a0[sl]), studying Latin, Greek, religion, German, history, geography, science, and mathematics. At that time there were about 500 students there. He was a schoolfellow of Anton Toma\u017e Linhart, a Slovenian writer and historian. Vega finished high school when he was 19, in 1773. After completing his studies at the Lyceum of Ljubljana (Licej v Ljubljani) he became a navigational engineer in 1775. Tentamen philosophicum, a list of questions for his comprehensive examination, was preserved and is available in the Mathematical Library in Ljubljana. The problems cover logic, algebra, metaphysics, geometry, trigonometry, geodesy, stereometry, geometry of curves, ballistics, and general and special physics./nVega left Ljubljana five years after graduation and entered military service in 1780 as a professor of mathematics at the Artillery School in Vienna. At that time he started to sign his last name as Vega and no longer Veha. When Vega was 33 he married Josefa Svoboda (Jo\u017eefa Swoboda) (1771\u20131800), a Czech noble from \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice who was 16 at that time./nVega participated in several wars. In 1788 he served under Austrian Imperial Field-Marshal Ernst Gideon von Laudon (1717\u20131790) in a campaign against the Turks at Belgrade. His command of several mortar batteries contributed considerably to the fall of the Belgrade fortress. Between 1793 and 1797 he fought French Revolutionaries under the command of Austrian General Dagobert-Sigismond de Wurmser (1724\u20131797) with the European coalition on the Austrian side. He fought at Fort Louis, Mannheim, Mainz, Wiesbaden, Kehl, and Dietz. In 1795 he had two 30-pound (14\u00a0kilogram) mortars cast, with conically drilled bases and a greater charge, for a firing range up to 3000\u00a0metres (3300\u00a0yards). The old 60\u00a0lb (27\u00a0kg) mortars had a range of only 1800\u00a0m (2000\u00a0yd)./nIn September 1802 Vega was reported missing. After a few days' search his body was found. The police report concluded that his death was an accident. It is believed that he died on 26 September 1802 in Nu\u00dfdorf on the Danube, near the Austrian capital, Vienna./nVega published a series of books of logarithm tables. The first one appeared in 1783. Much later, in 1797 it was followed by a second volume that contained a collection of integrals and other useful formulae. His Handbook, which was originally published in 1793, was later translated into several languages and appeared in over 100 issues. His major work was Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus (Treasury of all Logarithms) that was first published 1794 in Leipzig (its 90th edition was published in 1924). This mathematical table was actually based on Adriaan Vlacq's tables, but corrected a number of errors and extended the logarithms of trigonometric functions for the small angles. An engineer, Franc Allmer, honourable senator of the Graz University of Technology, has found Vega's logarithmic tables with 10 decimal places in the Museum of Carl Friedrich Gauss in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss used this work frequently and he has written in it several calculations. Gauss has also found some of Vega's errors in the calculations in the range of numbers, of which there are more than a million. A copy of Vega's Thesaurus belonging to the private collection of the British mathematician and computing pioneer Charles Babbage (1791\u20131871) is preserved at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh./nOver the years Vega wrote a four-volume textbook Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Mathematik (Lectures about Mathematics).[3] Volume I appeared in 1782 when he was 28\u00a0years old, Volume II in 1784, Volume III in 1788 and Volume IV in 1800. His textbooks also contain interesting tables: for instance, in Volume II one can find closed form expressions for sines of multiples of 3 degrees, written in a form easy to work with./nVega wrote at least six scientific papers. On August 20, 1789 Vega achieved a world record when he calculated pi to 140 places, of which the first 126 were correct.[4] This calculation he proposed to the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in the booklet V. razprava (The fifth discussion), where he had found with his calculating method an error on the 113th place from the estimation of Thomas Fantet de Lagny (1660\u20131734) from 1719 of 127 places. Vega retained his record 52\u00a0years until 1841 and his method is mentioned still today. His article was not published by the Academy until six years later, in 1795. Vega had improved John Machin's formula from 1706:/nwith his formula, which is equal to Euler's formula from 1755:/nand which converges faster than Machin's formula. He had checked his result with the similar Hutton's formula:[5]/nHe had developed the second term in the series only once./nAlthough he worked in the subjects of ballistics, physics and astronomy, his major contributions are to the mathematics of the second half of the 18th century./nIn 1781 Vega tried to push further his idea in the Austrian Habsburg monarchy about the usage of the decimal metric system of units. His idea was not accepted, but it was introduced later under the emperor Franz Josef I in 1871./nVega was a member of the Academy of Practical Sciences in Mainz, the Physical and Mathematical Society of Erfurt, the Bohemian Scientific Society in Prague, and the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He was also an associate member of the British Scientific Society in G\u00f6ttingen. He was awarded the Order of Maria Theresa on May 11, 1796. In 1800 Vega obtained a title of hereditary baron including the right to his own coat of arms./nJurij Vega High School (Gimnazija Jurija Vege) in Idrija was founded in 1901 as the first Slovene Realschule. In 1935, Vega (crater) on the Moon was named after Vega. The National Bank of Slovenia put into circulation a 50 tolar banknote in his honour in March 1993,[6] and the Slovene Post Office issued a stamp honouring Vega in 1994. In 2004 Slovenia issued coins commemorating his 250th birthday.[7] The asteroid 14966 Jurijvega, discovered on July 30, 1997, is named after him. Slovenia's Vega Astronomical Society[8] is named after both Jurij Vega and the star Vega. The star, however, is not named after Jurij Vega and its name is much older. A free open-source physics library for 3D deformable object simulation, Vega FEM, has also been named after Vega./nVega is also notable as the tutor and academic advisor of Ignaz Lindner\u00a0[sl],[1] resulting in a notable scientific genealogy (see Academic genealogy of theoretical physicists: Jurij Vega)./nSandifer, Ed (2006). \"Why 140 Digits of Pi Matter\" (PDF).

In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to Sompting, West Sussex, and died there in 1977./nBeryl May was born on (1900-05-10)10 May 1900, at Penley Villa, Park Lane, Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Agnes Dent (1869\u20131967), n\u00e9e\u00a0Thornley, and Eustace Edward (1868\u20131954).[1] She was baptised at St\u00a0Paul's, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.[2]:\u200a1\u200a They had married at St Mary's Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27\u00a0July 1898.[3] Her mother was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art.[4] She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers.[5][6] In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.[7]/nOn 18\u00a0March 1889, Dent's father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board.[8][9] In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, his elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax.[10] In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics' Institute.[11][a] He enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College.[b] In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations.[13][14][c] His first teaching post was at Coopers' Company Grammar School, Bow, London,[15] before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School.[16]/nIn October 1901, Dent's father left Chippenham to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster.[17][18][d] The family moved to Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century.[21][22][e] In April 1907, they moved to 22\u00a0Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.[20]:\u200a264\u200a[23] He was elected chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922,[24][f] and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.[25][g]/nDent's father was also a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs and the Princess Ju\u2011Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward.[28][29][30] In Princess Ju\u2011Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the princess, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure.[31][32] In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night.[29][32][h] She also acted in a scene from Tennyson's Princess at the County School's prize giving day on 16\u00a0December 1913.[35][i]/nFrom 1909, Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher.[37] At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne\u2011Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook.[38][39][j] In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the school.[40][41] In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed.[41][42] She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916.[43][k] In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, one of the first two women's colleges in the University of Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.[44]/nIn 1918, Dent joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire.[37] The First World War opened new employment opportunities for women, and RAE was one of the first military establishments to recruit women into engineering, and mathematical and computational research.[45]:\u200a116\u200a[46]:\u200a10\u200a In the same period that Dent was at RAE, Lorna Swain, then mathematics tutor at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge, worked at the establishment on the problem of aircraft propeller vibration.[45]:\u200a84\u200a The Treasury reduced RAE's funding after the end of the war, and consequently, the number of resources and staff available to support research fell significantly.[47]:\u200a58\u200a In 1919, she left RAE after being accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol.[37][l] In June 1920, she passed her intermediate examination in French with supplementary courses in Latin, history, and mathematics.[49][50]:\u200a1/nIn the following academic year, Dent joined the honours course in mathematics and took an intermediate examination in physics.[51][50]:\u200a1\u200a After spending the summer of 1921 at her parents' home in Warminster,[52] she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course.[51] The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac's previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year.[51] They were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hass\u00e9, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge;[51] Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the Bristol University College, soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hass\u00e9 joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.[53]:\u200a111\u200a Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus.[54] Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was \"the best teacher he had ever had.\"[51]/nDent studied four courses in pure mathematics:[55]/nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course.[56][m] Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:[55]/nIn June 1923, Dent graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours.[57][51][n] On 7\u00a0July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge.[56][58][59] On her death in 1922, Lilias Sophia Ashworth Hallett left one thousand pounds each to the University of Bristol and Girton College, University of Cambridge, to found scholarships for women.[60]:\u200a259,\u200a261\u200a The University of Bristol scholarship was open to women graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth \u00a345 at the time (equivalent to \u00a32,700 in 2021).[61] She spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification.[59] Before 1948, the University of Cambridge denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as she left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.[62][o]/nDent spent the summer of 1924 at her parents' home in Warminster, playing mixed doubles tennis in a tournament organised by the local Women's Unionist Association.[64] In September of the same year, she was appointed an assistant teacher in mathematics at the High School for Girls, in Barnsley, Huddersfield Road, on an annual salary of \u00a3250 (equivalent to \u00a315,200 in 2021).[59][37] Annie Rose Nuttall, the school's head teacher,[65] was a former student at Newnham College.[66][p] In the early 1920s, women who had studied university level mathematics faced limited employment prospects, as mathematics and engineering professions, other than perhaps school teaching, were dominated by men.[69] Dent resigned her position on 31\u00a0August 1925 after being appointed a demonstrator (research assistant) in the Department of Physics at the University of Bristol,[59][37] with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).[70]:\u200a107\u200a[q]/nIn 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens.[72][r] From August 1925, John Lennard-Jones, of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, was elected reader in mathematical physics.[74][72] In March 1927, Lennard\u2011Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.[75][76]:\u200a24\u200a[77][s] Lennard\u2011Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.[72][51]/nLennard\u2011Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals.[51][78] Dent's thesis for her master's degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard\u2011Jones, \"Some theoretical determinations of crystal parameters. CXVI\", and with Lennard\u2011Jones and Sydney Chapman, \"Structure of carbonate crystals\" and \"Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals\".[t] On 28\u00a0June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work.[79] In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help.[u] Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.[76]:\u200a26\u200a[1][v]/nIn 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\", and with Sydney Chapman, \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage.[80][81] Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics.[w] Lennard\u2011Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[83] She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: \"The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal\" (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides.[84] In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park, Manchester.[iii]:\u200a14\u201315\u200a[85]/nIn December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the university council.[86] Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1\u00a0February 1930. Littleton was later Sir Neville Mott's co-author and research assistant in the physics department.[87][88]:\u200a517\u200a In 1930, Lennard\u2011Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.[83][72][x]/nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well-known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines, and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer.[90] In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new \"technical intelligence\" section.[85]:\u200a193\u200a[y] In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the University of Birmingham,[91] and past member of the first standing committee of ASLIB.[85]:\u200a228\u200a Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.[85]:\u200a193\u200a In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6\u00a0January 1930.[iii]:\u200a15\u200a[85] She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,[92]:\u200a314\u200a and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.[85]:\u200a193/nDent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.[93]:\u200a204\u2013205\u200a In 1932, the branch had twenty-six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.[94]:\u200a412\u200a Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.[92]:\u200a301\u200a By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan-Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications.[95] Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.[96]/nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\" (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell.[97][98] In 1937, David Myers, then at the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Oxford, asked Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter to calculate the space charge limitation of secondary current in a triode.[99]:\u200a91\u200a[100]:\u200a96\u200a The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a differential analyser. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.[99]:\u200a91\u200a[100]:\u200a97\u200a Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in \"The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines\" (1950).[101][z] She would later analyse the problem of stress distribution in a thick disk based on a method devised by Philip Pollock,[103] for Richard William Bailey, the former director of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical sections of the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.[104]:\u200a16\u200a[aa]/nDent was a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government's conference dinner on 22\u00a0September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford.[105][ab] In 1939, she was elected to the editing committee of the ASLIB book list.[106] In 1944, she was put in charge of the women working in the research department laboratory at Metropolitan-Vickers, and in 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the new computation section.[59] Her role would bring her into contact with Audrey Stuckes, a materials science researcher in the department, and a graduate of Newnham College, who would later head the physics department at the University of Salford.[107] In 1953, they collaborated on an investigation into the heating effects that occur when a current is passed through a semiconductor that has no barrier layer.[108] Dent suggested methods to solve the equations and computed the numerical integrations.[109] In the following year, she developed the Fourier analysis in \"Regenerative Deflection as a Parametrically Excited Resonance Phenomenon\" (1954), that calculated the optimal radial oscillations to maintain cyclotron resonance in a synchrocyclotron. The causes of axial spreading of the charged particle beam during extraction were also analysed.[110]/nDent joined the Women's Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design.[111][112] With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Ferranti Mark 1 (Mark 1) computer at the University of Manchester, that demonstrated that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer.[113] Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services.[114] In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor.[115] A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.[116]/nIn 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed Zeta circuit on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill's paper on constructing a high-power pulse transformer and circuit.[117] The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds (equivalent to \u00a350,000 in 2021), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time.[118] She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women's Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.[85]:\u200a232\u200a[119]:\u200a243/nIn the 1920s, Dent was living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton.[120] May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House, and Dent returned to Bristol on 22\u00a0December 1934 for Staveley's funeral.[121] Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association, and secretary and treasurer of the group of former Clifton Hill House students.[iii]:\u200a1, 9\u200a She would later write \"I was very sorry indeed to leave Bristol and have many happy memories of my time there. I shall miss living at the [Clifton Hill House] Hall very much.\"[iii]:\u200a15/nIn 1926, Dent was elected treasurer of the University of Bristol's Convocation, the university's alumni association.[122] In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the Convocation[123][124]:\u200a62\u200a She later represented the Manchester branch of the association.[121] Around 1926, Dent was appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association.[125] The association's aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University.[120] In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women's International League in October 1928.[126]/nIn July 1929, in Dent's last year at Bristol, she went on holiday to North Devon with friends that included Gertrude Roxbee, known as \"Rox\", who had graduated with Dent in 1923 with a BSc in botany.[iii]:\u200a12\u201313\u200a[124] After moving to Manchester in January 1930, Dent found shared lodgings at 10\u00a0Montrose Avenue, West Didsbury, in the same house as Roxbee who, at that time, was a teacher at Whalley Range High School.[iii]:\u200a15, 50\u200a At weekends, she would ramble to Hebden Bridge, and with Roxbee, learnt to figure skate at the Ice Palace, a former ice rink on Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.[iii]:\u200a54\u200a[127]/nIn September 1930, she returned to Bristol for the ninety-eighth conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (British Association), meeting her friends at an alumnae association lunch.[iii]:\u200a93\u200a In the afternoon of the 4\u00a0September 1930, she toured Avonmouth Docks as a conference member,[iii]:\u200a94\u200a[128] and in the evening, was invited to a reception held by Walter Bryant, the then lord mayor of Bristol, at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.[iii]:\u200a94\u200a[129]. On the following day, she visited an aircraft manufacturer at Whitchurch Airport and attended a garden party at Wills Hall.[iii]:\u200a94\u200a[128]/nOn the Monday of the conference, Dent was in the audience to see Paul Dirac present his paper on the proton and the structure of matter.[iii]:\u200a94\u200a[130] She would later comment:[iii]:\u200a94/nI heard a striking paper by Dirac, who was a student with me, who is now a very famous person, as I always knew he would be\u00a0... I now go about boasting that I was in the same class!/nDent's father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529\u00a0King's Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St\u00a0Matthew's Church, Stretford.[131] She had close links to St\u00a0Matthew's; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St\u00a0Matthew's Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.[59]/nIn 1962, Dent and her mother moved from Stretford to 1\u00a0Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing.[132][133] Her mother died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10\u00a0April 1967.[134] Dent's sister, Florence Mary, also lived in the house until her death on 13 September 1986(1986-09-13) (aged\u00a084).[135] After a brief period as a teacher at a prep school in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, Florence worked as a secretary for a marine insurance firm attached to Lloyd's of London at 12 Leadenhall Street, commuting into London from Harrow each day.[iii]:\u200a57\u201359/nBeryl May Dent died at Worthing Hospital on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged\u00a077) after a long period of disablement. The funeral service was held on 12\u00a0August 1977 at St Mary's Church, Sompting, followed by cremation.[136][137] Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the book of remembrance at the crematorium states:[138][139][ac]/nBeryl May Dent 1900\u00a0\u2013 A real Christian loved by all\u00a0\u2013 1977/nThere is also a memorial to her at the Church of St\u00a0Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting. The bishop's chair, situated close to the altar, bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:[140][ad]/nIn loving memory of BERYL DENT 1900\u00a0\u2013 1977/nHer Christian faith is perhaps not unexpected, given her father's work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life. However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career.[141][142]/nAn archive of Dent's papers, that relate to her life and work in the 1920s in the physics department at the University of Bristol, is held in the Special Collections of the University of Bristol Arts and Social Sciences Library, in Tyndall Avenue, Bristol.[1] Included in that archive is a series of letterbooks, written in the 1930s by members of the Clifton Hill House Old Students' Association, that include news and photographs of Dent, her family, and friends.[iii][iv]/nIn 1928, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\" and \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface.[80][81] They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).[143]:\u200a796\u2013797\u200a The expression for the potential in vacuum, \n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)}\n\n, at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e_{k}}\n\n, and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form:[143]:\u200a797/n\u03c6\n\n0\n\n\n\n(\nr\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n)\n\n\ns\n\n\nexp\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\u2212\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\na\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nm\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nz\n+\n\nz\n\ns\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n|\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2211\n\nk\n\n\n\ne\n\nk\n\n\ncos\n\u2061\n\n[\n\n\nk\n\nl\n,\nm\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\u2225\n\n\n\u2212\n\nr\n\nk\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi _{0}\\left(r\\right)={\\frac {2\\pi }{a^{2}}}\\sum _{l,m}\\sum _{s}{\\frac {\\left(-1\\right)^{s}\\exp \\left[-\\left({\\frac {2\\pi }{a}}\\right){\\sqrt {l^{2}+m^{2}}}\\left(z+z_{s}\\right)\\right]}{\\left|k_{l,m}\\right|}}\\times \\sum _{k}e_{k}\\cos \\left[k_{l,m}\\left(r_{\\parallel }-r_{k}\\right)\\right]}/n/n/n/n/n(1)/nThe expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower planes of the crystal lattice. Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.[143]:\u200a797\u200a Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,[144]:\u200a481\u200a had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.[145]/nMichael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in surface and colloid chemistry at Loughborough University of Technology and professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, concurred with Buckley, noting that \"an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal\u00a0... is obviously extremely improbable.\" However, they acknowledged that the Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally.[146] Nonetheless, Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.[147]:\u200a14\u200a Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and Paul Hansma, has shown that this result has direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.[148]:\u200a543/nThe theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.[149]:\u200a1\u200a If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by \ud835\udf06, then the reduced major axis method assumes that \ud835\udf06 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of x and y.[150] RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.[149]:\u200a2/nIn Dent's 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\", she admitted that when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown, \"we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions.\"[151] However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of Gaussian error functions, she contended that this expression may be regarded as \"a function of the unknown quantities\", or the likelihood function of the data distribution.[152]:\u200a106\u200a Furthermore, she argued that maximising this function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation,[153]:\u200a5\u200a subject to the condition that the points are collinear, will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the centroid and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.[152]:\u200a106/nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta }\n\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:[154]/n\u03b8\n\n2\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n+\n\n[\n\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n]\n\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta ^{2}x^{T}y+\\left[\\lambda x^{T}x-y^{T}y\\right]\\theta -\\lambda x^{T}y=0}/n/n/n/n/n(2)/nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for the positive root (or zero) of (2):[155]:\u200a183/n\u03b8\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n+\n\n\n(\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n+\n4\n\u03bb\n(\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{ML}\\equiv {\\frac {y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x+{\\sqrt {(y^{T}y-\\lambda x^{T}x)^{2}+4\\lambda (x^{T}y)^{2}}}}{2x^{T}y}}}/n/n/n/n/n(3)/nInspection of (3) shows that as \ud835\udf06 tends to plus infinity, the positive root tends to:[155]:\u200a183/n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n, equal to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {x^{T}y}{x^{T}x}}}/n/n/n/n/n(4)/nCorrespondingly, as \ud835\udf06 tends to zero, the root tends to:[155]:\u200a183/n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n, equal to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {y^{T}y}{x^{T}y}}}/n/n/n/n/n(5)/nDent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known.[156]:\u200a1049\u200a Dent's maximum likelihood estimator is the geometric mean of \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{x}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{y}}\n\n, equivalent to:[155]:\u200a184/n\u03b8\n\nM\nL\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\n\n\n\ny\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\theta _{ML}\\equiv {\\sqrt {{\\frac {x^{T}y}{x^{T}x}}\\times {\\frac {y^{T}y}{x^{T}y}}}}\\equiv {\\sqrt {\\frac {y^{T}y}{x^{T}x}}}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nT\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\n\n is positive./n/n/n/n/n(6)/nDennis Lindley repeated Dent's analysis and stated that Dent's geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function,[157]:\u200a235\u2013236,\u200a241\u200a and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.[158]:\u200a15\u200a Subsequently, Theodore Anderson pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.[159]:\u200a3\u200a Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then National Bureau of Standards, responded to Lindley, stating Lindley's own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction.[160] Furthermore, Albert Madansky, late H.

Smith has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in \"A Problem in Least Squares\" (1878) and Charles Kummell in \"Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity\" (1879).[97][98] It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope,[163][164] and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.[152]:\u200a106\u200a Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.[150][158]:\u200a3/nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency.[165] On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, \"The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers.[165] The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:[166]/nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the university's library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:[167]/n/nThe first problem of calculating the impulse voltage distribution on transformer windings took about five hours of machine time. Conversely, a hand calculation, using a method described by Thomas John Lewis in \"The Transient Behaviour of Ladder Networks of the Type Representing Transformer and Machine Windings\" (1954), took around three months.[168]:\u200a486\u200a The use of a computer in the second problem allowed for a more accurate solution as it was possible to include nonlinear magnetic characteristics in the calculation. In the last problem, the torque and speed curves for the synchronous motors were calculated in around fifteen minutes.[168]:\u200a486\u200a Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.[113]/nSignificant research had been devoted to determining a transformer's internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers.[169] It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in \"A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer\" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.[170]/nThe surface plane of a face-centred cubic lattice was derived by Lennard\u2011Jones and Dent and this result has been used extensively in physisorption studies. They simplified the calculation of the Lennard-Jones potential by noting that the ions under study were isoelectronic with inert gas atoms, and thus, there was no need to introduce additional empirical L\u2011J parameters into the equation.\nIn rock-salt or sodium chloride (halite) structure, each of the two atom types forms a separate face-centred cubic lattice. Examples of compounds with this structure include sodium chloride itself, along with the other alkali halides, and divalent metal oxides, sulphides, selenides, and tellurides.[174]:\u200a16\u200a[175][176]:\u200a682\u2013683", "2793081": "Achyuta Pisharodi  (c. 1550 at Thrikkandiyur (aka Kundapura), Tirur, Kerala, India \u2013 7 July 1621 in Kerala) was a Sanskrit grammarian, astrologer, astronomer and mathematician who studied under Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva and was a member of Madhava of Sangamagrama's Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics.

As a result, Pisharati is said to have been cured, but no medicine could cure Narayana. As a last resort, Narayana went to Guruvayur and requested Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan, a great devotee of Guruvayoorappan, to suggest a remedy for his disease. Ramajunan Ezhuthachan advised him to compose a poetical work on the Avatars (incarnations) of Lord Vishnu beginning with that of Matsya (Fish).

He is considered the forerunner of non-Euclidean geometry.[2][3]/nThe son of a lawyer, Saccheri was born in Sanremo, Genoa (now Italy) on September 5, 1667.[4] From his youth he showed extreme precociousness and a spirit of inquiry.[2] He entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1685. He studied philosophy and theology at the Jesuit College of Brera in Milan.[5]/nHis mathematics teacher at the Brera college was Tommaso Ceva, who introduced him to his brother Giovanni.[4] Ceva convinced Saccheri to devote himself to mathematical research and became the young man's mentor. Saccheri was in close scientific communion with both brothers. He used Ceva's ingenious methods in his first published work, 1693, solutions of six geometric problems proposed by the Sicilian mathematician Ruggero Ventimiglia (1670-1698).[6]/nSaccheri was ordained as a priest in March 1694. He taught philosophy at the University of Turin from 1694 to 1697 and philosophy, theology and mathematics at the University of Pavia from 1697 until his death.[3] He published several works including Quaesita geometrica (1693), Logica demonstrativa (1697), and Neo-statica (1708). Saccheri died in Milan on 25 October 1733.[4]/nThe Logica demonstrativa, reissued in Turin in 1701 and in Cologne in 1735, gives Saccheri the right to an eminent place in the history of modern logic.[7] According to Thomas Heath \u201cMill\u2019s account of the true distinction between real and nominal definitions was fully anticipated by Saccheri.\u201d[8]/nSaccheri is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered an early exploration of non-Euclidean geometry, Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus (Euclid Freed of Every Flaw) languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by Eugenio Beltrami, in the mid-19th century.[9]/nThe intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a reductio ad absurdum proof of any alternative to Euclid's parallel postulate.  To do so, he assumed that the parallel postulate was false and attempted to derive a contradiction.[3]/nSince Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180\u00b0./nThe first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, the principle is now accepted as the basis of elliptic geometry, where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected./nThe second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: \"the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines\". Today, his results are theorems of hyperbolic geometry.[10]/nThere is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant that, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri concluded as he did only to avoid the criticism that might come from seemingly-illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry./nOne tool that Saccheri developed in his work (now called a Saccheri quadrilateral) has a precedent in the 11th-century Persian polymath Omar Khayy\u00e1m's Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid (Ris\u00e2la f\u00ee sharh m\u00e2 ashkala min mus\u00e2dar\u00e2t Kit\u00e2b 'Ugl\u00eedis).

He was a mathematical linguist (vyakarana). His most important scholarly work, Prakriya-sarvasvam, sets forth an axiomatic system elaborating on the classical system of Panini. However, he is most famous for his masterpiece, Narayaneeyam, a devotional composition in praise of Guruvayurappan (Krishna) that is still sung at Guruvayur Temple./nBhattathri was from a village named Melpathur at Kurumbathur in Athavanad Panchayat near Kadampuzha, very close to the Tirur River, as well as near to the holy town of Thirunavaya and Bharathappuzha, that was famed as the theatre of the Mamankam festival, in Malappuram district. He was born in 1560 in a pious Brahmin family, as the son of Mathrudattan Bhattathiri, a pandit himself. Bhattathiri studied from his father as a child. He learned the Rig Veda from Madhava, Tharka sastra (science of debate in Sanskrit) from Damodara and Vyakarana (Sanskrit grammar) from Achyuta Pisharati. He became a pandit by the age of 16. He married his guru Achuta Pisharati's niece and settled at Thrikkandiyur in Tirur./nHe was one of the last mathematicians of the Sangamagrama school, which had been founded by Madhava in Kerala, South India and included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. It flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Bhattathiri./nIt seems that he had a younger brother named after his father (Mathrudattan Jr.,). One of the manuscripts of Narayaneeyam says that it was copied by the author's younger brother Matrdatta. The Melpathur family is now extinct and it is said that it was merged into the Maravancheri Thekkedathu family. [1]/nThe Narayaniyam is a devotional Sanskrit work, in the form of a poetical hymn, consisting of 1036 verses (called 'slokas' in Sanskrit). It was written by Bhattathiri in 1586 AD and gives a summary of 18,000 verses of the Bhagavata Purana./nPisharadi has been affected by rheumatism. Unable to see his pain, by yogic strength and by way of Gurdakshina, Bhattathri is said to have taken the disease upon himself and relieved his guru. To relieve Narayana of this disease, Ezhuthachan, a Malayalam poet and Sanskrit scholar hinted- \"meen thottu koottuka\" (start with the fish). On the face of it, the suggestion would seem offensive to an orthodox Malayali Brahmin, who are strict vegetarians. However, Bhattathiri, understanding the hidden meaning, decided to present the various incarnations of Vishnu starting with the fish, as narrated in the Bhagavata Purana in a series of Dasakas (groups of ten slokas). Upon reaching Guruvayur, he started composing one dasaka a day in the presence of the Lord. The refrain in last sloka of every dasaka is a prayer to him to remove his ailments and sufferings. Every day, he sang 10 shlokas on Sri Guruvayoorappan. Each set of 10 poems ends with a prayer for early cure. In 100 days he finished his compositions, and his condition gradually improved day by day. On 27 November 1587 when he finished the last dashakam (\"Ayuraarogya Sowkhyam\") he was completely cured. The 100th canto composed on that day gives a graphic description of this form of the Lord from the head to the foot. On that day he had a vision of the Lord in the form of Venugopalan. He was 27 then. He was a propounder of Purva Mimamsa, Uttara Mimamsa and Vyakarana./nThe Chakorasandesa which was earlier than Narayaneeyam also refers to rheumatic patients going to the Guruvayoor Temple. Worship in the Guruvayoor Temple is considered to be sure remedy for all diseases.[1] It may be because of this belief that Bhattathiri went to Guruvayoor.There is another story saying that when Bhattathiri was about to finish his masterpiece Narayaneeyam. Bhattathiri pleaded to Lord Guruvayoorapan for the relief of his disease. Lord Guruvayoorapan appeared himself before Bhattathiri and showed Lord's two hand and said that one of his hands did have the power to cure his disease. And showed his other hand and said that it had Karunyam.\nBhattathiri thought for a moment and chose the hand which had Karunyam. \nHe later explained that \nif we have Karunyam we all automatically get all the prosperity and well-being. \nLord gave the Karunyam and it is said that Bhattathiri's disease was cured./nWhile Narayana Bhattathiri was composing Narayaneeyam in Guruvayur temple, Poonthanam, another great devotee of Lord Guruvayoorapa and also a poet who wrote many great works about Lord Guruvayoorapa including the njanappana in Malayalam, had also come there to worship Lord Guruvayoorapan. One day he took some of his poems of the njanappana to Bhattathiri in order to correct them and improve them, but this was dismissed by Bhattathiri with a haughty remark that Poonthanam didn't know the correct meaning of words and he didn't want to waste his time on such silly works. Later that night lord Guruvayoorapan himself appeared in Bhattathiri's dream and criticized him by saying that he preferred Poonthanam's bhakthi than Bhattathiri 's knowledge. And then the next day itself Bhattathiri apologized to poonthanam and corrected mistakes then they became friends./nHe wrote on diverse subjects including scientific ones. His works are:[1]/nUnder the patronage of Cochin Vira Keralavarman (1601-1615 A.D) Melputtur wrote the Gosrinagaravarnana and Virakeralaprasasti.[1]:\u200a164/nIt is said that Bhattathiri lived at least for 86 years, since his wish was to have a happy, healthy, long life as seen at the end of Narayaneeyam. One poem says that he lived for 106 years, and accordingly he should have died in 1666. But, 86 is considered more reliable. Accordingly, he lived in many places after his cure of rheumatism, like Kochi, Ambalapuzha, Kozhikode and finally he settled in Mookkola near Changaramkulam in the present-day Malappuram district. He stayed in the Devi temple there for around 20 years, and he wrote his last work there. One day, after returning from Mookkola Temple, he collapsed and died instantly.

He was a pioneer in the field of moment problems and contributed to the study of continued fractions. The Thomas Stieltjes Institute for Mathematics at Leiden University, dissolved in 2011, was named after him, as is the Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral./nStieltjes was born in Zwolle on 29 December 1856. His father (who had the same first names) was a civil engineer and politician. Stieltjes Sr. was responsible for the construction of various harbours around Rotterdam, and also seated in the Dutch parliament. Stieltjes Jr. went to university at the Polytechnical School in Delft in 1873. Instead of attending lectures, he spent his student years reading the works of Gauss and Jacobi \u2014 the consequence of this being he failed his examinations. There were 2 further failures (in 1875 and 1876), and his father despaired. His father was friends with H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen (who was the director of Leiden University), and Stieltjes Jr. was able to get a job as an assistant at Leiden Observatory./nSoon afterwards, Stieltjes began a correspondence with Charles Hermite which lasted for the rest of his life. He originally wrote to Hermite concerning celestial mechanics, but the subject quickly turned to mathematics and he began to devote his spare time to mathematical research./nThe director of Leiden Observatory, van de Sande-Bakhuyzen, responded quickly to Stieltjes' request on 1 January 1883 to stop his observational work to allow him to work more on mathematical topics. In 1883, he also married Elizabeth Intveld in May. She also encouraged him to move from astronomy to mathematics. And in September, Stieltjes was asked to substitute at University of Delft for F.J. van den Berg. From then until December of that year, he lectured on analytical geometry and on descriptive geometry. He resigned his post at the observatory at the end of that year./nIn 1884, Stieltjes applied for a chair in Groningen. He was initially accepted, but in the end turned down by the Department of Education, since he lacked the required diplomas. In 1884, Hermite and professor David Bierens de Haan arranged for an honorary doctorate to be granted to Stieltjes by Leiden University, enabling him to become a professor. In 1885, he was appointed as member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, KNAW), the next year he became foreign member.[1] In 1889, he was appointed professor of differential and integral calculus at Toulouse University./nStieltjes worked on almost all branches of analysis, continued fractions and number theory, and for his work, he is sometimes called \"the father of the analytic theory of continued fractions\"./nHis work is also seen as important as a first step towards the theory of Hilbert spaces. Other important contributions to mathematics that he made involved discontinuous functions and divergent series, differential equations, interpolation, the gamma function and elliptic functions.

The Maclaurin series, a special case of the Taylor series, is named after him./nOwing to changes in orthography since that time (his name was originally rendered as M'Laurine[3]), his surname is alternatively written MacLaurin.[4]/nMaclaurin was born in Kilmodan, Argyll. His father, John Maclaurin, minister of Glendaruel, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother died before he reached nine years of age. He was then educated under the care of his uncle, Daniel Maclaurin, minister of Kilfinan. A child prodigy, he entered university at age 11./nAt eleven, Maclaurin, a child prodigy at the time, entered the University of Glasgow. He graduated Master of Arts three years later by defending a thesis on the Power of Gravity, and remained at Glasgow to study divinity until he was 19, when he was elected professor of mathematics in a ten-day competition at Marischal College and University in Aberdeen. This record as the world's youngest professor endured until March 2008, when the record was officially given to Alia Sabur.[5]/nIn the vacations of 1719 and 1721, Maclaurin went to London, where he became acquainted with Isaac Newton, Benjamin Hoadly, Samuel Clarke, Martin Folkes, and other philosophers. He was admitted a member of the Royal Society./nIn 1722, having provided a locum for his class at Aberdeen, he travelled on the Continent as tutor to George Hume, the son of Alexander Hume, 2nd Earl of Marchmont. During their time in Lorraine, he wrote his essay on the percussion of bodies (Demonstration des loix du choc des corps), which gained the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1724. Upon the death of his pupil at Montpellier, Maclaurin returned to Aberdeen./nIn 1725, Maclaurin was appointed deputy to the mathematical professor at the University of Edinburgh, James Gregory (brother of David Gregory and nephew of the esteemed James Gregory), upon the recommendation of Isaac Newton. On 3 November of that year Maclaurin succeeded Gregory, and went on to raise the character of that university as a school of science. Newton was so impressed with Maclaurin that he had offered to pay his salary himself./nMaclaurin used Taylor series to characterize maxima, minima, and points of inflection for infinitely differentiable functions in his Treatise of Fluxions. Maclaurin attributed the series to Brook Taylor, though the series was known before to Newton and Gregory, and in special cases to Madhava of Sangamagrama in fourteenth century India.[6]\nNevertheless, Maclaurin received credit for his use of the series, and the Taylor series expanded around 0 is sometimes known as the Maclaurin series.[7]/nMaclaurin also made significant contributions to the gravitation attraction of ellipsoids, a subject that furthermore attracted the attention of d'Alembert, A.-C. Clairaut, Euler, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson and Gauss.  Maclaurin showed that an oblate spheroid was a possible equilibrium in Newton's theory of gravity. The subject continues to be of scientific interest, and Nobel Laureate Subramanyan Chandrasekhar dedicated a chapter of his book Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium to Maclaurin spheroids.[7] Maclaurin corresponded extensively with Clairaut, Maupertuis, and d'Ortous de Mairan.[8][9]/nIndependently from Euler and using the same methods, Maclaurin discovered the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula.  He used it to sum powers of arithmetic progressions, derive Stirling's formula, and to derive the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formulas which includes Simpson's rule as a special case.[7]/nMaclaurin contributed to the study of elliptic integrals, reducing many intractable integrals to problems of finding arcs for hyperbolas.  His work was continued by d'Alembert and Euler, who gave a more concise approach.[7]/nIn his Treatise of Algebra (Ch. XII, Sect 86), published in 1748 two years after his death, Maclaurin proved a rule for solving square linear systems in the cases of 2 and 3 unknowns, and discussed the case of 4 unknowns.[10][11] This publication preceded by two years Cramer's publication of a generalization of the rule to n unknowns, now commonly known as Cramer's rule./nIn 1733, Maclaurin married Anne Stewart, the daughter of Walter Stewart, the Solicitor General for Scotland, by whom he had seven children. His eldest son John Maclaurin studied Law, was a Senator of the College of Justice, and became Lord Dreghorn; he was also joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[12]/nMaclaurin actively opposed the Jacobite rising of 1745 and superintended the operations necessary for the defence of Edinburgh against the Highland army. Maclaurin compiled a diary of his exertions against the Jacobites, both within and without the city.[13] When the Highland army entered the city, however, he fled to York, where he was invited to stay by the Archbishop of York./nOn his journey south, Maclaurin fell from his horse, and the fatigue, anxiety, and cold to which he was exposed on that occasion laid the foundations of dropsy. He returned to Edinburgh after the Jacobite army marched south, but died soon after his return./nHe is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The simple table stone is inscribed simply \"C. M.

He is also remembered for his treatise Trait\u00e9 des triangles rectangles en nombres published (posthumously) in 1676[1] and reprinted in 1729.[2]/nBessy was a member of many of the scientific circles of his day, including the French Academy of Sciences, and corresponded with many prominent mathematicians, such as Mersenne and Pascal. Bessy was also particularly close to Fermat, Descartes and Wallis, and was best known for his insights into number theory.[3]/nIn 1661[4] he proposed to John Wallis a problem of what amounted to the following system of equations in integers,/nA solution was given by Th\u00e9ophile P\u00e9pin in 1880.[5]/nFr\u00e9nicle's La M\u00e9thode des exclusions was published (posthumously) in 1693,[6] which appeared in the fifth volume of M\u00e9moires de l'acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences depuis 1666 jusq'\u00e0 (1729, Paris),[7] though the work appears to have been written around 1640. The book contains a short introduction followed by ten rules, intended to serve as a \"method\" or general rules one should apply in order to solve mathematical problems.[3] During the Renaissance, \"method\" was primarily used for educational purposes, rather than for professional mathematicians (or natural philosophers). However, Fr\u00e9nicle's rules imply slight methodological preferences which suggests a turn towards explorational purposes.[8]/nFr\u00e9nicle's text provided a number of examples on how his rules ought to be applied. He proposed the problem of determining whether or not a given integer can be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (it is not clear if Fr\u00e9nicle initially intended the other two sides of the triangle to have integral length). He considers the case where the integer is 221 and promptly applies his second rule, which states that \"if you do not know, even generally, what is proposed, find its properties by systematically constructing similar numbers.\" He then goes on and exploits the Pythagorean Theorem. Next, the third rule is applied, which states that \"in order not to omit any necessary number, establish the order of investigation as simple as possible.\" Fr\u00e9nicle then takes increasing sums of perfect squares. He produces tables of computations and is able to reduce computations by rules four to six, which all deal with simplifying matters. He eventually arrives at the conclusion that it is possible for 221 to satisfy the property under certain conditions and checks his assertion by experimentation.[9]/nThe example in La M\u00e9thode des exclusions represents an experimental approach to mathematics. This is in contrast with the standard Euclidean approach of the time, which emphasized axioms and deductive reasoning. Fr\u00e9nicle instead relied on structured and careful observations to find interesting patterns and constructions rather than producing proofs in the axiomatic Euclidean sense. He himself even said that \"this research is mainly useful for possible questions, using for most of them no proof other than construction.\"[10]", "696025": "Lionel Sharples Penrose, FRS (11 June 1898 \u2013 12 May 1972) was an English psychiatrist, medical geneticist, paediatrician, mathematician and chess theorist, who carried out pioneering work on the genetics of intellectual disability.[6][7] Penrose was initially the Galton professor of eugenics (1945\u20131963) at University College London,  before having his title changed to professor of human genetics (1963\u20131965) at his bequest. He was later emeritus professor.[8]/nPenrose was educated at the Downs School, Colwall and the Quaker Leighton Park School, Reading.[8] On leaving school in 1916, he served, as a conscientious objector, with the Friends' Ambulance Unit/British Red Cross in France until the end of the First World War. He went on to study at St John's College, Cambridge, where he was a Cambridge Apostle.[8] At Cambridge, he gained a first class degree in moral sciences before leaving for Vienna for a year, to study at the psychological department at the University of Vienna.[8] In 1928, he qualified with the conjoint in 1928 at St Thomas' Hospital before qualifying for a Doctor of Medicine in 1930.[9]/nPenrose undertook research into schizophrenia, designing tests of intelligence that were non-verbal in nature that are still in use.

He found that the relatives of patients with severe intellectual disability were usually unaffected but some of them were affected with similar severity to the original patient, whereas the relatives of patients with mild intellectual disability tended mostly to have mild or borderline disability. Penrose went on to identify and study many of the genetic and chromosomal causes of intellectual disability (then called mental deficiency). This body of work culminated in the book, The Biology of Mental Defect (Sidgwick and Jackson, Ltd., London, UK, 1949)./nPenrose was a central figure in British medical genetics following World War II. From 1945 to 1965, he worked as Galton Professor at the Galton Laboratory at University College London. The first title of his chair was \"Professor of Eugenics\" (1945\u20131963), then he had it changed to \"Professor of Human Genetics\" (1963\u20131965). According to his successor, Professor Harry Harris, Penrose \u201cnever liked the name 'eugenics\u2019, because it seemed to him to be too much associated with uninformed and dangerous policies of racial purification.\" Harris also reported the \"long delay\" in changing this name was due to \"legal problems\" associated with the original donation from Francis Galton and described how Penrose simply ignored the \"eugenics\" element of his job title.[9]/nPenrose's Law[5][6] states that the population size of prisons and psychiatric hospitals are inversely related, although this is generally viewed as something of an oversimplification.[10]/nPenrose, a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers), was a lead figure in the Medical Association for the Prevention of War in the 1950s./nPenrose developed the Penrose method, a method for apportioning seats in a global assembly based on the square root of each nation's population. Such a voting system is based on the voting power of any voter (measured by the Penrose\u2013Banzhaf index) decreasing with the size of the voting body as one over its square root.  See also Penrose square root law./nPenrose was particularly interested in different facets of biology, for example fingerprint, demography, and cytogenetics, which were a result of his research into the etiology of intellectual disability, especially Down syndrome. He did intensive research on the latter, communicating the results of his investigations in 1963 and winning the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation Award for his contributions to the understanding of the causes of intellectual disability.[8]/nPenrose received a number of awards and honours including the 1960 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.[2] The Lasker citation read:/n\"Professor Penrose and his associates have been responsible over the years for studies which touch all aspects of human genetics, include genetic analyses of most of the known hereditary diseases, contributions to mathematical genetics, biochemical genetics, the study of gene linkage in man, and theoretical work on the mutagenic effect of ionizing radiations.

His doctoral thesis \"Stability for characterizations of distributions\" was published as a monograph.[5]/nCharacterization theorems in probability theory and mathematical statistics are such theorems that establish a connection between the type of the distribution of random variables or random vectors and certain general properties of functions in them. For example, the assumption that two linear (or non-linear) statistics are identically distributed (or independent, or have a constancy regression and so on) can be used to characterize various populations. Verification of conditions of this or that characterization theorem in practice is possible only with some error, i.e., only to a certain degree of accuracy. Such a situation is observed, for instance, in the cases where a sample of finite size is considered. That is why there arises the following natural question. Suppose that the conditions of the characterization theorem are fulfilled not exactly but only approximately. May we assert that the conclusion of the theorem is also fulfilled approximately? Questions of this kind give rise to a following problem: determine the degree of realizability of the conclusions of mathematical statements in the case of approximate validity of conditions./nIn solving these problems, a special place is given to the convolution equation.

Broadly speaking, Artin\u2013Verdier duality, a consequence of class field theory, is an arithmetic analogue of Poincar\u00e9 duality, a duality for sheaf cohomology on a compact manifold. In this parallel, the (spectrum of the) ring of integers in a number field corresponds to a 3-manifold. Following work of Mazur, Deninger (1984) extended Artin\u2013Verdier duality to function fields. Deninger then extended these results in various directions, such as non-torsion sheaves (1986), arithmetic surfaces (1987), as well as higher-dimensional local fields (with Wingberg, 1986). The appearance of Bloch's motivic complexes considered in the latter papers influenced work of several authors including Geisser (2010), who identified Bloch's complexes to be the dualizing complexes over higher-dimensional schemes./nAnother group of Deninger's papers studies L-functions and their special values. A classical example of an L-function is the Riemann zeta function \u03b6(s), for which formulas such as/nare known since Euler. In a landmark paper, Beilinson (1984) had proposed a set of far-reaching conjectures describing the special values of L-functions, i.e., the values of L-functions at integers. In very rough terms, Beilinson's conjectures assert that for a smooth projective algebraic variety X over Q,  motivic cohomology of X should be closely related to Deligne cohomology of X. In addition, the relation between these two cohomology theories should explain, according to Beilinson's conjecture, the pole orders and the values of/nat integers s. Bloch and Beilinson proved essential parts of this conjecture for h1(X) in the case where X is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication and s=2. In 1988, Deninger & Wingberg gave an exposition of that result. In 1989 and 1990, Deninger extended this result to certain elliptic curves considered by Shimura, at all s\u22652. Deninger & Nart (1995) expressed the height pairing, a key ingredient of Beilinson's conjecture, as a natural pairing of Ext-groups in a certain category of motives. In 1995, Deninger  studied Massey products in Deligne cohomology and conjectured therefrom a formula for the special value for the L-function of an elliptic curve at s=3, which was subsequently confirmed by Goncharov (1996). As of 2018, Beilinson's conjecture is still wide open, and Deninger's contributions remain some of the few cases where Beilinson's conjecture has been successfully attacked (surveys on the topic include Deninger & Scholl (1991), Nekov\u00e1\u0159 (1994))./nThe Riemann \u03b6-function is defined using a product of Euler factors/nfor each prime number p. In order to obtain a functional equation for \u03b6(s), one needs to multiply them with an additional term involving the Gamma function:/nMore general L-functions are also defined by Euler products, involving, at each finite place, the determinant of the Frobenius endomorphism acting on l-adic cohomology of some variety X / Q, while the Euler factor for the infinite place are, according to Serre, products of Gamma functions depending on the Hodge structures attached to X / Q. Deninger (1991) expressed these \u0393-factors in terms of regularized determinants and moved on, in 1992 and in greater generality in 1994, to unify the Euler factors of L-functions at both finite and infinite places using regularized determinants. For example, for the Euler factors of the Riemann zeta-function this uniform description reads/nHere p is either a prime number or infinity, corresponding to the non-Archimedean Euler factors and the Archimedean Euler factor respectively, and Rp is the space of finite real valued Fourier series on R/log(p)Z for a prime number p, and R\u221e = R[exp(\u22122y)]. Finally, \u0398 is the derivative of the R-action given by shifting such functions.\nDeninger (1994) also exhibited a similar unifying approach for \u03b5-factors (which express the ratio between completed L-functions at s and at 1\u2212s)./nThese results led Deninger to propose a program concerning the existence of an \"arithmetic site\" Y associated to the compactification of Spec Z. Among other properties, this site would be equipped with an action of R, and each prime number p would correspond to a closed orbit of the R-action of length log(p). Moreover, analogies between formulas in analytic number theory and dynamics on foliated spaces led Deninger to conjecture the existence of a foliation on this site. Moreover, this site is supposed to be endowed with an infinite-dimensional cohomology theory such that the L-function of a motive M is given by/nHere M is a motive, such as the motives hn(X) occurring in Beilinson's conjecture, and F(M) is conceived to be the sheaf on Y attached to the motive M. The operator \u0398 is the infinitesimal generator of the flow given by the R-action. The Riemann hypothesis would be, according to this program, a consequence of properties parallel to the positivity of the intersection pairing in Hodge theory. A version of the Lefschetz trace formula on this site, which would be part of this conjectural setup, has been proven by other means by Deninger (1993). In 2010, Deninger proved that  classical conjectures of Beilinson and Bloch concerning the intersection theory of algebraic cycles would be further consequences of his program./nThis program was surveyed by Deninger in his talks at the European Congress of Mathematicians in 1992, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1998, and also by Leichtnam (2005). In 2002, Deninger constructed a foliated space which corresponds to an elliptic curve over a finite field, and Hesselholt (2016) showed that the Hasse-Weil zeta-function of a smooth proper variety over Fp can be expressed using regularized determinants involving topological Hochschild homology. In addition, the analogy between knots and primes has been fruitfully studied in arithmetic topology. However, as of 2018, the construction of a foliated space corresponding to Spec Z remains elusive./nA series of joint papers with Annette Werner examines vector bundles on p-adic curves. A classical result motivating this study is the Narasimhan\u2013Seshadri theorem, a cornerstone of the Simpson correspondence. It asserts that a vector bundle on a compact Riemann surface X is stable if it arises from a unitary representation of the fundamental group \u03c01(X)./nIn Deninger & Werner (2005) established a p-adic analogue thereof: for a smooth projective algebraic curve over Cp, obtained by base change from \n\n\n\nX\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n\nQ\n\n\u00af\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X/{\\overline {\\mathbf {Q} }}_{p}}\n\n, they constructed an action of the etale fundamental group \u03c01(X) on the fibers on certain vector bundles, including those of degree 0 and having potentially strongly semistable reduction. In another paper of 2005, they related the resulting representations of the fundamental group of the curve X with representations of the Tate module of the Jacobian variety of X. In 2007 and 2010 they continued this work by showing that such vector bundles form a Tannakian category which amounts to identifying this class of vector bundles as a category of representations of a certain group./nIn several joint papers, Deninger and Wilhelm Singhof studied quotients of the n-dimensional Heisenberg group H  by the standard lattice consisting of integer-valued matrices,/nfrom various points of view. In 1984, they computed the e-invariant of X in terms of \u03b6(\u2212n), which leads to a construction of elements in the stable homotopy groups of spheres of arbitrarily large order. In 1988, they used methods of analytic number theory to give estimates on the dimension of the cohomology of nilpotent Lie algebras./nThe classical fact from Hodge theory that any cohomology class on a K\u00e4hler manifold admits a unique harmonic had been generalized by \u00c1lvarez L\u00f3pez & Kordyukov (2001) to Riemannian foliations. Deninger & Singhof (2001) show that foliations on the above space X, which satisfy only slightly weaker conditions, do not admit such Hodge theoretic properties. In another joint paper from 2001, they established a dynamical Lefschetz trace formula: it relates the trace of an operator on harmonic forms the local traces appearing at the closed orbits (on certain foliated spaces with an R-action). This result serves as a corroboration of Deninger's program mentioned above in the sense that it verifies a prediction made by this program on the analytic side, i.e., the one concerning dynamics on foliated spaces./nAnother group of Deninger's papers revolves around the space/nwhere \u0393 is a discrete group, f is an element of its group ring Z\u0393, and the hat denotes the Pontryagin dual.

In 1997, Deninger observed that the integrand in the definition of the Mahler measure has a natural explanation in terms of Deligne cohomology. Using known cases of the Beilinson conjecture, he deduced that m(f) is the image of the symbol {f, t1, ..., tn} under the Beilinson regulator, where the variety is the complement in the n-dimensional torus of the zero set of f. This led to a conceptual explanation for the afore-mentioned formulas for Mahler measures. Besser & Deninger (1999) and Deninger later in 2009 carried over these ideas to the p-adic world, by replacing the Beilinson regulator map to Deligne cohomology by a regulator map to syntomic cohomology, and the logarithm appearing in the definition of the entropy by a p-adic logarithm./nIn 2006 and 2007, Deninger and Klaus Schmidt pushed the parallel between entropy and Mahler measures beyond abelian groups, namely residually finite, countable discrete amenable groups \u0393. They showed that the \u0393-action on Xf is expansive if and only if f is invertible in the L1-convolution algebra of \u0393. Moreover, the logarithm of the Fuglede-Kadison determinant on the von Neumann algebra N\u0393 associated to \u0393 (which replaces the Mahler measure for Zn) agrees with the entropy of the above action./nJoachim Cuntz and Deninger worked together on Witt vectors. In two papers around 2014, they simplified the theory by giving a presentation of the ring of Witt vectors in terms of a completion of the monoid algebra ZR.

Inspired by this discussion and a publication by the Swedish scientist Anders \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m in 1855, Van der Willigen decided to dedicate himself first to the determination of the refractive index and the wavelength of light, in order to be able to more accurately define the unit of length.

There he also kept an astronomical regulator, heliostat, spectroscope, diffraction gratings, microscope with micrometer, balance, thermometers and barometers.

He has also written Wittgenstein and the Foundations of Mathematics (1980)./nIn general metaphysics, his most important work is Truth and Objectivity (Harvard University Press, 1992). He argues in this book that there need be no single, discourse-invariant thing in which truth consists, making an analogy with identity. There need only be some principles regarding how the truth predicate can be applied to a sentence, some 'platitudes' about true sentences. Wright also argues that in some contexts, probably including moral contexts, superassertibility will effectively function as a truth predicate. He defines a predicate as superassertible if and only if it is \"assertible\" in some state of information and then remains so no matter how that state of information is enlarged upon or improved. Assertiveness is warrant by whatever standards inform the discourse in question.[12] Many of his most important papers in philosophy of language, epistemology, philosophical logic, meta-ethics, and the interpretation of Wittgenstein have been collected in the two volumes published by Harvard University Press in 2001 and 2003./nIn epistemology, Wright has argued that G. E. Moore's proof of an external world (\"Here is one hand\") is logically valid but cannot transmit warrant from its premise to the conclusion, as it instantiates a form of epistemic circularity called by him \"warrant transmission failure\".[13] Wright has also developed a variant of Ludwig Wittgenstein's hinge epistemology, introduced in Wittgenstein's On Certainty as a response to radical skepticism. According to hinge epistemology, there are assumptions or presuppositions of any enquiry \u2013 called \"hinge propositions\" \u2013 that cannot themselves be rationally doubted, challenged, established or defended. Wright contends that certain hinge propositions can actually be rationally held because there exists a type of non-evidential, a priori warrant \u2013 which Wright calls \"epistemic entitlement\" \u2013 for accepting them as true.[14]", "72195876": "Indira Lara Chatterji (born 25 January 1973) is a Swiss-Indian mathematician working in France as a professor of mathematics in the J.

Only some of them are outlined here. His main research papers are gathered in four Selecta volumes.[2][3][4][5] More details can also be found in two books published by EMS Press in 2022 on the occasion of his 90th birthday.[25] His research is reviewed there in more than 50 chapters./nLieb is famous for many groundbreaking results in statistical mechanics concerning, in particular, soluble systems. His numerous works have been collected in the Selecta \u2033Statistical mechanics\u2033[2] and \u2033Condensed matter physics and exactly soluble models\u2033,[3] as well as in a book with Daniel Mattis.[26] They treat (among other things) Ising-type models, models for ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, the exact solution of the six-vertex model of ice in two dimensions, the one-dimensional delta Bose gas (now called the Lieb-Liniger model) and the Hubbard model./nTogether with Daniel Mattis and Theodore Schultz he solved in 1964 the two-dimensional Ising model (with a new derivation of the exact solution by Lars Onsager via the Jordan-Wigner transformation of the transfer matrices) and in 1961 the XY model, an explicitly solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model. In 1968, together with Fa-Yueh Wu, he gave the exact solution of the one-dimensional Hubbard model./nIn 1971 he and Neville Temperley introduced the Temperley-Lieb algebra in order to build certain transfer matrices. This algebra also has links with knot theory and the braid group, quantum groups and subfactors of von Neumann algebras./nTogether with Derek W. Robinson in 1972 he derived bounds on the propagation speed of information in non-relativistic spin systems with local interactions. They have become known as Lieb-Robinson bounds and play an important role, for instance, in error bounds in the thermodynamic limit or in quantum computing. They can be used to prove the exponential decay of correlations in spin systems or to make assertions about the gap above the ground state in higher-dimensional spin systems (generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems)./nIn 1972 he and Mary Beth Ruskai proved the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy, a theorem that is fundamental for quantum information theory. This is closely related to what is known as the data processing inequality in quantum information theory. The Lieb-Ruskai proof of strong subadditivity is based on an earlier paper where Lieb solved several important conjectures about operator inequalities, including the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson conjecture.[27]/nIn the years 1997\u201399, Lieb provided a rigorous treatment of the increase of entropy in the second law of thermodynamics and adiabatic accessibility with Jakob Yngvason.[28]/nIn 1975, Lieb and Walter Thirring found a proof of the stability of matter that was shorter and more conceptual than that of Freeman Dyson and Andrew Lenard in 1967. Their argument is based on a new inequality in spectral theory, which became known as the Lieb-Thirring inequality. The latter has become a standard tool in the study of large fermionic systems, e.g. for (pseudo-)relativistic fermions in interaction with classical or quantized electromagnetic fields. On the mathematical side, the Lieb-Thirring inequality has also generated a huge interest in the spectral theory of Schr\u00f6dinger operators.[29] This fruitful research program has led to many important results that can be read in his Selecta \u2033The stability of matter\u00a0: from atoms to stars\u2033[4] as well as in his book \u2033The stability of matter in quantum mechanics\u2033 with Robert Seiringer.[30]/nBased on the original Dyson-Lenard theorem of stability of matter, Lieb together with Joel Lebowitz had already provided in 1973 the first proof of the existence of thermodynamic functions for quantum matter. With Heide Narnhofer he did the same for Jellium, also called the homogeneous electron gas, which is at the basis of most functionals in Density Functional Theory./nIn the 1970s, Lieb together with Barry Simon studied several nonlinear approximations of the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation, in particular Hartree-Fock theory and the Thomas-Fermi model of atoms. They provided the first rigorous proof that the latter furnishes the leading order of the energy for large non-relativistic atoms. With Rafael Benguria and Ha\u00efm Brezis, he studied several variations of the Thomas-Fermi model./nThe ionization problem in mathematical physics asks for a rigorous upper bound on the number of electrons that an atom with a given nuclear charge can bind. Experimental and numerical evidence seems to suggest that there can be at most one, or possibly two extra electrons. To prove this rigorously is an open problem. A similar question can be asked concerning molecules. Lieb proved a famous upper bound on the number of electrons a nucleus can bind. Moreover, together with Israel Michael Sigal, Barry Simon and Walter Thirring, he proved, for the first time, that the excess charge is asymptotically small compared to the nuclear charge./nTogether with Jakob Yngvason, he gave a rigorous proof of a formula for the ground state energy of dilute Bose gases. Subsequently, together with Robert Seiringer and Jakob Yngvason he studied the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the ground state energy of dilute bosons in a trap, starting with many-body quantum mechanics.[31] Lieb's works with Joseph Conlon and Horng-Tzer Yau and with Jan Philip Solovej on what is known as the \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n7\n\n/\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N^{7/5}}\n\n law for bosons provide the first rigorous justification of Bogoliubov's pairing theory./nIn quantum chemistry Lieb is famous for having provided in 1983 the first rigorous formulation of Density Functional Theory using tools of convex analysis. The universal Lieb functional gives the lowest energy of a Coulomb system with a given density profile, for mixed states. In 1980, he proved with Stephen Oxford the Lieb-Oxford inequality[32] which provides an estimate on the lowest possible classical Coulomb energy at fixed density and was later used for calibration of some functionals such as PBE and SCAN. More recently, together with Mathieu Lewin and Robert Seiringer he gave the first rigorous justification of the Local-density approximation for slowly varying densities.[33]/nIn the 70s Lieb entered the mathematical fields of calculus of variations and partial differential equations, where he made fundamental contributions. An important theme was the quest of best constants in several inequalities of functional analysis, which he then used to rigorously study nonlinear quantum systems. His results in this direction are collected in the Selecta \u2033Inequalities\u2033.[5] Among the inequalities where he determined the sharp constants are Young's inequality and the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, to be further discussed below. He also developed tools now considered standard in analysis, such as rearrangement inequalities or the Brezis-Lieb lemma which provides the missing term in Fatou's lemma for sequences of functions converging almost everywhere./nWith Herm Brascamp and Joaquin Luttinger, he proved in 1974 a generalization of the Riesz rearrangement inequality, stating that certain multilinear integrals increase when all the functions are replaced by their symmetric decreasing rearrangement. With Frederick Almgren, he clarified the continuity properties of rearrangement. Rearrangement is often used to prove the existence of solutions for some nonlinear models./nIn two papers (one in 1976 with Herm Brascamp and another one alone in 1990), Lieb determined the validity and the best constants of a whole family of inequalities that generalizes, for instance, the H\u00f6lder's inequality, Young's inequality for convolutions, and the Loomis-Whitney inequality. This is now known as the Brascamp-Lieb inequality. The spirit is that the best constant is determined by the case where all functions are Gaussians. The Brascamp-Lieb inequality has found applications and extensions, for instance, in harmonic analysis./nUsing rearrangement inequalities and compactness methods, Lieb proved in 1983 the existence of optimizers for the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and of the Sobolev inequality. He also determined the best constant in some cases, discovering and exploiting the conformal invariance of the problem and relating it, via stereographic projection, to a conformally equivalent, but more tractable problem on the sphere. A new rearrangement-free proof was provided later with Rupert Frank, allowing to treat the case of the Heisenberg group.[34]/nIn a 1977 work he also proved the uniqueness (up to symmetries) of the ground state for the Choquard-Pekar equation, also called Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Newton equation,[35] which can describe a self gravitating object or an electron moving in a polarizable medium (polaron). With Lawrence Thomas he provided in 1997 a variational derivation of the Choquard-Pekar equation from a model in quantum field theory (the Fr\u00f6hlich Hamiltonian). This had been solved earlier by Monroe Donsker and Srinivasa Varadhan using a probabilistic path integral method./nIn another work with Herm Brascamp in 1976, Lieb extended the Pr\u00e9kopa-Leindler inequality to other types of convex combinations of two positive functions. He strengthened the inequality and the Brunn-Minkowski inequality by introducing the notion of essential addition./nLieb also wrote influential papers on harmonic maps, among others with Frederick Almgren, Ha\u00efm Brezis and Jean-Michel Coron. In particular, Algrem and Lieb proved a bound on the number of singularities of energy minimizing harmonic maps./nFinally, his textbook \u2033Analysis\u2033 with Michael Loss should be mentioned.[36]\nIt has become a standard for graduate courses in mathematical analysis. It develops all the traditional tools of analysis in a concise, intuitive and eloquent form, with a view towards applications./nThese are two books published by EMS Press on the occasion of Lieb's 90th birthday, which contain around 50 chapters about his impact on a very broad range of topics and the resulting subsequent developments.

In 1823 he won a mathematical competition and was admitted to the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique, from which he graduated with top honours in 1825. Like many of his fellow Polytechniciens, (e.g., Prosper Enfantin, Olinde Rodrigues, Jules Lechevalier, Michel Chevalier and others), he was attracted to the doctrines of Henri de Saint-Simon. He contributed to Le Globe and was a frequent and popular orator at the Salle Taitbout. Like other Saint-Simonians, Transon believed in the equality of the sexes, but his special rapport with women induced the Saint-Simonian leader 'P\u00e8re' Enfantin, to proclaim him the sect's 'apostle to the ladies'.[1] However, when the Saint-Simonian school split in 1832, after a dispute between its leaders, Prosper Enfantin and Saint-Amand Bazard, Transon defected to the followers of Charles Fourier. He contributed to the journals of Victor Considerant, notably writing a number of articles on education. In 1834 he gave a series of lectures at the Society of Civilisation, concerning certain proposals for the mechanisation of agriculture. In 1834 he returned to the Catholic Church. He was an admirer of the Polish mystic J\u00f3zef Maria Hoene-Wro\u0144ski. He seems to have taken little part in politics after 1835, though he remained on friendly terms with his former utopian socialist colleagues, especially Jules Lechevalier, Hippolyte Renaud and Charles Pellarin. Transon's mother died in 1835, an event that greatly affected him and accelerated his transition to Catholicism and mysticism. Unlike more conservative Catholic philosophers of the time, Transon was and remained in favour of democracy./nIn later years, he concentrated mostly on mathematics. He worked as a tutor and later as an examiner at the Polytechnique, was a member of the Mining Corps and wrote mathematical articles for the Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es, the Nouvelles Annales de Math\u00e9matiques, the Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique and other publications. He made numerous contributions to geometry, calculus and algebra. For example, he was a pioneer of the calculus of aberrancy. Transon's parabola is named for him. Transon's theorem states that the effect of any analytic transformation upon an infinitesimal region is the same as that of a projective transformation. Among the many topics he worked on was Fermat's Last Theorem. He complained: \"I am tormented by two maladies, my rheumatism and my Fermatism.\"[2] In 1845, he married F\u00e9licie Desnoyers. In 1849 Transon had the first serious bout of rheumatism, an ailment that plagued him the rest of his life. He also developed a heart condition as well as arteriosclerosis, according to the physician Pellarin. Charles Pellarin, in his Notice sur Jules Lechevalier et Abel Transon (1877), contrasts Transon's nervous, artistic temperament and sincere piety with Lechevalier's expansive love of the finer things, and attributes a certain lack of psychological freedom on Transon's part to his 'religious distraction.'[3] Pellarin draws an affectionate portrait of Transon and his wife as very charitable. In the late 1860s, Transon was informed that the aged and ailing socialist Pierre Leroux was in financial distress. Transon arranged to purchase all of Leroux' publications. When Leroux found out who the buyer was, he visited Transon and said: \"My dear Transon, I know you have neither need of, nor interest in, my books, but I divine the intention, thank you.\" Transon protested that, even though their ideas were very different, the works of a man of such value as Leroux were always interesting, and that he was curious about his book on Job.[2]/nTranson lived in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, but he was already ill, and the privations of that time made his health worse. Nevertheless, he volunteered for the National Guard and was used to keep order at butcheries and bakeries during the distribution of rations. In the aftermath of the Paris Commune, Transon reproached himself and his former socialist colleagues for, as he now saw it, raising false hopes among the people and propounding erroneous doctrines. Pelarin accepted Transon's criticisms as being motivated by his \"esteem and affection\", but categorically rejected the accusation. \"The scrupulous Transon calumnies his past,\" he wrote, pointing out that neither the Saint-Simonians nor the Fourierists had ever encouraged insurrection and had often been criticised by revolutionary socialists for this.[4] In 1872 he was awarded the French Legion of Honour. He died on 23 August 1876 of complications from his heart disease.

He was born as Ho\u00ebn\u00e9 to a municipal architect in 1776 but changed his name in 1815 to J\u00f3zef Wro\u0144ski.[2] Later in life he changed his name to J\u00f3zef Maria Hoene-Wro\u0144ski,[2] without using his family's original French spelling Ho\u00ebn\u00e9. At no point in his life, neither in Polish or French, was he known as Ho\u00ebn\u00e9-Wro\u0144ski; nor was the common French transliteration, Josef Ho\u00ebn\u00e9-Wronski, ever his official name in his native Poland (though it might have served as his chosen French nom de plume on some work).[citation needed]/nIn 1803, Wro\u0144ski joined the Marseille Observatory but was forced to leave the observatory after his theories were dismissed as grandiose rubbish. In mathematics, Wro\u0144ski introduced a novel series expansion for a function in response to Joseph Louis Lagrange's use of infinite series. The coefficients in Wro\u0144ski's new series form the Wronskian, a determinant Thomas Muir named in 1882./nHis father, Antoni H\u00f6hne (pl, de), was the municipal architect of Pozna\u0144. Antoni originally came from the small Bohemian village of Leukersdorf (present-day \u010cermn\u00e1 which is now a part of Libouchec). In later life, he settled in western Poland marrying El\u017cbieta Pernicka in Wolsztyn in 1773. In the same place and a few years later on, in 1776, their son J\u00f3zef Maria was born. J\u00f3zef was educated in Pozna\u0144 and Warsaw. In 1794 he served in Poland's Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising as a second lieutenant of artillery, was taken prisoner, and remained until 1797 in the Russian Army.  After resigning in the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1798, he studied in the Holy Roman Empire until 1800, when he enlisted in the Polish Legion at Marseille.  There he began his scientific and scholarly work and conceived the idea of a great philosophical system. Ten years later he moved to Paris where he would spend most of his life working unremittingly to the last in the most difficult material circumstances./nHe wrote exclusively in French, in the desire that his ideas, of whose immortality he was convinced, be accessible to all; he worked, he said, \"through France for Poland.\"   He published over a hundred works, and left many more in manuscript; at 75 years of age and nearing death, he exclaimed:  \"God Almighty, there's still so much more I wanted to say!\"/nIn science, Hoene-Wro\u0144ski set himself an extraordinary task:  the complete reform of philosophy as well as that of mathematics, astronomy and  technology.  He elaborated not only a system of philosophy, but also applications to politics, history, economics, law, psychology, music and pedagogy.  It was his aspiration to reform human knowledge in an \"absolute, that is, ultimate\" manner./nIn 1803, Wro\u0144ski joined the Marseille Observatory, and began developing an enormously complex theory of the structure and origin of the universe.  During this period, he took up a correspondence with nearly all of the major scientists and mathematicians of his day, and was well respected at the observatory. In 1803 Wro\u0144ski \"experienced a mystical illumination, which he regarded as the discovery of the Absolute.\"[3]/nIn 1810, he published the results of his scientific research in a massive tome, which he advocated as a new foundation for all of science and mathematics.  His theories were strongly Pythagorean, holding numbers and their properties to be the fundamental underpinning of essentially everything in the universe.  His claims were met with little acceptance, and his research and theories were generally dismissed as grandiose rubbish.  His earlier correspondence with major figures meant that his writings garnered more attention than a typical crackpot theory, even earning a review from the great mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange (which turned out to be categorically unfavorable).[4]  In the ensuing controversy, he was forced to leave the observatory./nHe immediately turned his focus towards applying philosophy to mathematics (his critics believed that this meant dispensing with mathematical rigor in favor of generalities).  In 1812, he published a paper purporting to show that every equation has an algebraic solution, directly contradicting results which had been recently published by Paolo Ruffini; Ruffini turned out to be correct./nHe later turned his attention to disparate and largely unsuccessful pursuits such as a fantastical design for caterpillar-like vehicles which he intended to replace railroad transportation, but did not manage to persuade anyone to give the design serious attention.  In 1819, he travelled to England in an attempt to obtain financial backing from the Board of Longitude to build a device to determine longitude at sea.  After initial difficulties, he was given an opportunity to address the Board, but his pretentious address, On the Longitude, contained much philosophizing and generalities, but no concrete plans for a working device, and thus failed to gain any support from the Board.[5]  He remained for several years in England and, in 1821, published an introductory text on mathematics in London, which moderately improved his financial situation./nIn 1822, he returned to France, and again took up a combination of mathematics and far-fetched ideas, despite being in poverty and scorned by intellectual society. Along with his continuing Pythagorean obsession, he spent much time working on several notoriously futile endeavors, including attempts to build a perpetual motion machine, to square the circle and to build a machine to predict the future (which he dubbed the prognometre).\nIn 1852, shortly before his death, he did find a willing audience for his ideas: the occultist Eliphas Levi who met Wro\u0144ski and was greatly impressed and \"attracted by his religious and scientific utopianism.\" Wro\u0144ski was \"a powerful catalyst\" for Levi's occultism.[3]/nWro\u0144ski died in 1853 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, on the outskirts of Paris./nDuring his lifetime nearly all his work was dismissed as nonsense. However, some of it came to be regarded in a more favourable light in later years. Although most of his inflated claims were groundless, his mathematical work contains flashes of deep insight and many important intermediary results, the most significant of which was his work on series. He had strongly criticized Lagrange for his use of infinite series, introducing instead a novel series expansion for a function.

Born in Bologna, he is the author of a treatise on algebra and is a central figure in the understanding of imaginary numbers./nHe was the one who finally managed to address the problem with imaginary numbers. In his 1572 book, L'Algebra, Bombelli solved equations using the method of del Ferro/Tartaglia. He introduced the rhetoric that preceded the representative symbols +i and -i and described how they both worked./nRafael Bombelli was baptised on 20 January 1526[3] in Bologna, Papal States.  He was born to Antonio Mazzoli, a wool merchant, and Diamante Scudieri, a tailor's daughter. The Mazzoli family was once quite powerful in Bologna.  When Pope Julius II came to power, in 1506, he exiled the ruling family, the Bentivoglios. The Bentivoglio family attempted to retake Bologna in 1508, but failed.  Rafael's grandfather participated in the coup attempt, and was captured and executed.  Later, Antonio was able to return to Bologna, having changed his surname to Bombelli to escape the reputation of the Mazzoli family.  Rafael was the oldest of six children.  Rafael received no college education, but was instead taught by an engineer-architect by the name of Pier Francesco Clementi./nBombelli felt that none of the works on algebra by the leading mathematicians of his day provided a careful and thorough exposition of the subject.  Instead of another convoluted treatise that only mathematicians could comprehend, Rafael decided to write a book on algebra that could be understood by anyone.  His text would be self-contained and easily read by those without higher education./nBombelli died in 1572 in Rome./nIn the book that was published in 1572, entitled Algebra, Bombelli gave a comprehensive account of the algebra known at the time.  He was the first European to write down the way of performing computations with negative numbers.  The following is an excerpt from the text:/n\"Plus times plus makes plus \n\tMinus times minus makes plus \n\tPlus times minus makes minus \n\tMinus times plus makes minus \n\tPlus 8 times plus 8 makes plus 64 \n\tMinus 5 times minus 6 makes plus 30 \n\tMinus 4 times plus 5 makes minus 20 \n\tPlus 5 times minus 4 makes minus 20\"/nAs was intended, Bombelli used simple language as can be seen above so that anybody could understand it.  But at the same time, he was thorough./nBombelli introduced, for the first time in a printed text (in Book II of his Algebra), a form of index notation in which the equation \n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n=\n6\nx\n+\n40\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{3}=6x+40}\n\n\nappeared as\n1U3 a. 6U1 p. 40.[4]\nin which he wrote the U3 as a raised bowl-shape (like the curved part of the capital letter U) with the number 3 above it.  Full symbolic notation was developed  shortly thereafter by the French mathematician Fran\u00e7ois_Vi\u00e8te./nPerhaps more importantly than his work with algebra, however, the book also includes Bombelli's monumental contributions to complex number theory.  Before he writes about complex numbers, he points out that they occur in solutions of equations of the form \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n=\na\nx\n+\nb\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{3}=ax+b,}\n\n given that \n\n\n\n(\na\n\n/\n\n3\n\n)\n\n3\n\n\n>\n(\nb\n\n/\n\n2\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a/3)^{3}>(b/2)^{2},}\n\n which is another way of stating that the discriminant of the cubic is negative.  The solution of this kind of equation requires taking the cube root of the sum of one number and the square root of some negative number./nBefore Bombelli delves into using imaginary numbers practically, he goes into a detailed explanation of the properties of complex numbers.  Right away, he makes it clear that the rules of arithmetic for imaginary numbers are not the same as for real numbers.  This was a big accomplishment, as even numerous subsequent mathematicians were extremely confused on the topic./nBombelli avoided confusion by giving a special name to square roots of negative numbers, instead of just trying to deal with them as regular radicals like other mathematicians did.  This made it clear that these numbers were neither positive nor negative.  This kind of system avoids the confusion that Euler encountered.  Bombelli called the imaginary number i \"plus of minus\" and used \"minus of minus\" for -i./nBombelli had the foresight to see that imaginary numbers were crucial and necessary to solving quartic and cubic equations.  At the time, people cared about complex numbers only as tools to solve practical equations.  As such, Bombelli was able to get solutions using Scipione del Ferro's rule, even in the irreducible case, where other mathematicians such as Cardano had given up./nIn his book, Bombelli explains complex arithmetic as follows:/n\"Plus by plus of minus, makes plus of minus. \n\tMinus by plus of minus, makes minus of minus. \n\tPlus by minus of minus, makes minus of minus. \n\tMinus by minus of minus, makes plus of minus. \n\tPlus of minus by plus of minus, makes minus. \n\tPlus of minus by minus of minus, makes plus. \n\tMinus of minus by plus of minus, makes plus. \n\tMinus of minus by minus of minus makes minus.\"/nAfter dealing with the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers, Bombelli goes on to talk about the rules of addition and subtraction.  He is careful to point out that real parts add to real parts, and imaginary parts add to imaginary parts./nBombelli is generally regarded as the inventor of complex numbers, as no one before him had made rules for dealing with such numbers, and no one believed that working with imaginary numbers would have useful results.  Upon reading Bombelli's Algebra, Leibniz praised Bombelli as an \". . . outstanding master of the analytical art.\"  Crossley writes in his book, \"Thus we have an engineer, Bombelli, making practical use of complex numbers perhaps because they gave him useful results, while Cardan found the square roots of negative numbers useless.  Bombelli is the first to give a treatment of any complex numbers. . . It is remarkable how thorough he is in his presentation of the laws of calculation of complex numbers. . .\"[5]/nIn honor of his accomplishments, a Moon crater was named Bombelli./nBombelli used a method related to continued fractions to calculate square roots. He did not yet have the concept of a continued fraction, and below is the algorithm of a later version given by Pietro Cataldi (1613).[6]/nThe method for finding \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}}\n\n begins with \n\n\n\nn\n=\n(\na\n\u00b1\nr\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\u00b1\n2\na\nr\n+\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=(a\\pm r)^{2}=a^{2}\\pm 2ar+r^{2}\\ }\n\n with \n\n\n\n0\n<\nr\n<\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0<r<1\\ }\n\n, from which it can be shown that \n\n\n\nr\n=\n\n\n\n\n|\n\nn\n\u2212\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n2\na\n\u00b1\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r={\\frac {|n-a^{2}|}{2a\\pm r}}}\n\n.

The value chosen for \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n is either of the whole numbers whose squares \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n lies between.

Correspondence with Einstein suggests that Einstein was unwilling to accept the idea of an evolving Universe and worked instead to revise his equations to support the static, eternal Universe of Newton's time.  In 1929 Hubble published the redshift vs distance relationship showing that all the galaxies in the neighborhood recede at a rate proportional to their distance, formalizing an observation made earlier by Carl Wilhelm Wirtz.

His teachings followed those of Plato, which he attempted to define more closely, often with mathematical elements.  He distinguished three forms of being: the sensible, the intelligible, and a third compounded of the two, to which correspond respectively, sense, intellect and opinion. He considered unity and duality to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul a self-moving number. God pervades all things, and there are daemonical powers, intermediate between the divine and the mortal, which consist in conditions of the soul. He held that mathematical objects and the Platonic Ideas are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. In ethics, he taught that virtue produces happiness, but external goods can minister to it and enable it to effect its purpose./nXenocrates was a native of Chalcedon.[2] By the most probable calculation[3] he was born 396/5 BC, and died 314/3 BC at the age of 82.

Soon after the death of Demosthenes (c. 322 BC), he declined the citizenship offered to him at the insistence of Phocion[10] as a reward for his services in negotiating peace with Antipater after Athens' unsuccessful rebellion.  The settlement was reached \"at the price of a constitutional change: thousands of poor Athenians were disenfranchised,\" and Xenocrates said \"that he did not want to become a citizen within a constitution he had struggled to prevent\".[12]  Being unable to pay the tax levied upon resident aliens, he is said to have been saved only by the courage of the orator Lycurgus,[13] or even to have been bought by Demetrius Phalereus, and then emancipated.[14] In 314/3, he died from hitting his head, after tripping over a bronze pot in his house.[14]/nXenocrates was succeeded as scholarch by Polemon, whom he had reclaimed from a life of profligacy. Besides Polemon, the statesman Phocion, Chaeron (tyrant of Pellene), the academic Crantor, the Stoic Zeno and Epicurus are said to have frequented his lectures./nWanting in quickness of apprehension and natural grace[15] he compensated by persevering and thorough-going industry,[16] pure benevolence,[17] purity of morals,[18] unselfishness,[19] and a moral earnestness, which compelled esteem and trust even from the Athenians of his own age.[20]/nXenocrates adhered closely to the Platonist doctrine, and he is accounted the typical representative of the Old Academy.

He is said to have made more explicit the division of philosophy into the three parts of Physics, Dialectic and Ethics./nWhen Alexander the Great sent him 30 talents of gold, he sent it back, saying that a king, not a philosopher, needs money.[4]/nWith a comprehensive work on Dialectic (\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03b9\u03b4\u0384) there were also separate treatises On Knowledge, On Knowledgibility (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u0384, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u0384), On Divisions (\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b7\u0384), On Genera and Species (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b1\u0384), On Ideas (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f30\u03b4\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd), On the Opposite (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5), and others, to which probably the work On Mediate Thought (\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd \u03b7\u0384)[21] also belonged.

He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which is the object of pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavored, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception.[32] All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into the absolutely existent, and the relatively existent,[33] attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories./nWe know from Plutarch[34] that Xenocrates, if he did not explain the Platonic construction of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the Timaeus; and further[35] that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not give us any further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number.[36] Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (monas and duas) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven,[37] or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, the last, or outermost.[38]/nIf, like other Platonists, he designated the material principle as undefined duality, the world-soul was probably described by him as the first defined duality, the conditioning or defining principle of every separate definitude in the sphere of the material and changeable, but not extending beyond it. He appears to have called it in the highest sense the individual soul, in a derivative sense a self-moving number, that is, the first number endowed with motion. To this world-soul Zeus, or the world-spirit, has entrusted - in what degree and in what extent, we do not learn - dominion over that which is liable to motion and change. The divine power of the world-soul is then again represented, in the different spheres of the universe, as infusing soul into the planets, Sun and Moon, - in a purer form, in the shape of Olympic gods. As a sublunary daemonical power (as Hera, Poseidon, Demeter), it dwells in the elements, and these daemonical natures, midway between gods and men, are related to them as the isosceles triangle is to the equilateral and the scalene.[39] The divine world-soul which reigns over the whole domain of sublunary changes he appears to have designated as the last Zeus, the last divine activity./nIt is not until we get to the sphere of the separate daemonical powers of nature that the opposition between good and evil begins,[40] and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad one.[41]/nHow Xenocrates tried to establish and connect scientifically these assumptions, which appear to be taken chiefly from his books on the nature of the gods,[42] we do not learn, and can only discover the one fundamental idea at the basis of them, that all grades of existence are penetrated by divine power, and that this grows less and less energetic in proportion as it descends to the perishable and individual. Hence he also appears to have maintained that as far as consciousness extends, so far also extends an intuition of that all-ruling divine power, of which he represented even irrational animals as partaking.[43] But neither the thick nor the thin, to the different combinations of which he appears to have tried to refer the various grades of material existence, were regarded by him as in themselves partaking of soul;[44] doubtless because he referred them immediately to the divine activity, and was far from attempting to reconcile the duality of the principia, or to resolve them into an original unity. Hence too he was for proving the incorporeality of the soul by the fact that it is not nourished as the body is.[45]/nIt is probable, that, after the example of Plato, he designated the divine principium as alone indivisible, and remaining like itself; the material, as the divisible, partaking of multiformity, and different, and that from the union of the two, or from the limitation of the unlimited by the absolute unity, he deduced number, and for that reason called the soul of the universe, like that of individual beings, a self-moving number, which, by virtue of its twofold root in the same and the different, shares equally in permanence and motion, and attains to consciousness by means of the reconciliation of this opposition./nAristotle, in his Metaphysics,[46] recognized amongst contemporary Platonists three principal views concerning the ideal numbers, and their relation to the ideas and to mathematical numbers:/nAristotle has much to say against the Xenocratean interpretation of the theory, and in particular points out that, if the ideal numbers are made up of arithmetical units, they not only cease to be principles, but also become subject to arithmetical operations./nIn the derivation of things according to the series of the numbers he seems to have gone further than any of his predecessors.[47] He approximated to the Pythagoreans in this, that (as is clear from his explanation of the soul) he regarded number as the conditioning principle of consciousness, and consequently of knowledge also; he thought it necessary, however, to supply what was wanting in the Pythagorean assumption by the more accurate definition, borrowed from Plato, that it is only insofar as number reconciles the opposition between the same and the different, and has raised itself to self-motion, that it is soul. We find a similar attempt at the supplementation of the Platonic doctrine in Xenocrates's assumption of indivisible lines.[48] In them he thought he had discovered what, according to Plato,[49] God alone knows, and he among men who is loved by him, namely, the elements or principia of the Platonic triangles. He seems to have described them as first, original lines, and in a similar sense to have spoken of original plain figures and bodies,[50] convinced that the principia of the existent should be sought not in the material, not in the divisible which attains to the condition of a phenomenon, but merely in the ideal definitude of form. He may very well, in accordance with this, have regarded the point as a merely subjectively admissible presupposition, and a passage of Aristotle respecting this assumption[51] should perhaps be referred to him./nThe information on his Ethics is scanty. He tried to supplement the Platonic doctrine at various points, and at the same time to give it a more direct applicability to life. He distinguished from the good and the bad something which is neither good nor bad.[52] Following the ideas of his Academic predecessors, he viewed the good as that which should be striven after for itself, that is, which has value in itself, while the bad is the opposite of this.[53] Consequently, that which is neither good nor bad is what in itself is neither to be striven after nor to be avoided, but derives value or the opposite according as it serves as means for what is good or bad, or rather, is used by us for that purpose./nWhile, however, Xenocrates (and with him Speusippus and the other philosophers of the older Academy)[54] would not accept that these intermediate things, such as health, beauty, fame, good fortune, etc. were valuable in themselves, he did not accept that they were absolutely worthless or indifferent.[55] According, therefore, as what belongs to the intermediate region is adapted to bring about or to hinder the good, Xenocrates appears to have designated it as good or evil, probably with the proviso, that by misuse what is good might become evil, and vice versa, that by virtue, what is evil might become good.[56]/nStill he maintained that virtue alone is valuable in itself, and that the value of every thing else is conditional.[57] According to this, happiness should coincide with the consciousness of virtue,[58] though its reference to the relations of human life requires the additional condition, that it is only in the enjoyment of the good things and circumstances originally designed for it by nature that it attains to completion; to these good things, however, sensuous gratification does not belong.[59] In this sense he on the one hand denoted (perfect) happiness as the possession of personal virtue, and the capabilities adapted to it, and therefore reckoned among its constituent elements, besides moral actions conditions and facilities, those movements and relations also without which external good things cannot be attained,[60] and on the other hand did not allow that wisdom, understood as the science of first causes or intelligible essence, or as theoretical understanding, is by itself the true wisdom which should be striven after by people,[61] and therefore seems to have regarded this human wisdom as at the same time exerted in investigating, defining, and applying.[62] How decidedly he insisted not only on the recognition of the unconditional nature of moral excellence, but on morality of thought, is shown by his declaration, that it comes to the same thing whether one casts longing eyes, or sets one's feet upon the property of others.[63] His moral earnestness is also expressed in the warning that the ears of children should be guarded against the poison of immoral speeches.[64]/nXenocrates is known to have written a book On Numbers, and a Theory of Numbers, besides books on geometry.[29] Plutarch writes that Xenocrates once attempted to find the total number of syllables that could be made from the letters of the alphabet.[65] According to Plutarch, Xenocrates result was 1,002,000,000,000 (a \"myriad-and-twenty times a myriad-myriad\"). This possibly represents the first instance that a combinatorial problem involving permutations was attempted. Xenocrates also supported the idea of \"indivisible lines\" (and magnitudes) in order to counter Zeno's paradoxes.[66]/nAttributio", "52600654": "Olle H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m (born 4 October 1967) is a professor of mathematical statistics at Chalmers University of Technology.

In 1125 he became an adviser to King Kumarapala and wrote Arhanniti, a work on politics from a Jain perspective. He also produced Trishashti-shalaka-purusha-charita (\u201cDeeds of the 63 Illustrious Men\u201d), a Sanskrit epic poem on the history of important figures of Jainism. Later in his life, he changed his name to Hemachandra./nHemachandra was born in Dhandhuka, in present-day Gujarat, on Kartika Sud Purnima (the full moon day of Kartika month). His date of birth differs according to sources but 1088 is generally accepted.[note 1][6] His father, Chachiga-deva was a Modh Bania Vaishnava. His mother, Pahini, was a Jain.[7][8] Hemchandra's original given name was Changadeva. In his childhood, the Jain monk Devachandra Suri visited Dhandhuka and was impressed by the young Hemachandra's intellect. His mother and maternal uncle concurred with Devachandra, in opposition to his father, that Hemachandra be a disciple of his. Devachandra took Hemachandra to Khambhat, where Hemachandra was placed under the care of the local governor Udayana. Chachiga came to Udayana's place to take his son back, but was so overwhelmed by the kind treatment he received, that he decided to willingly leave his son with Devachandra.[9]/nSome years later, Hemachandra was initiated a Jain monk on Magha Sud Chauth (4th day of the bright half of Magha month) and was given a new name, Somchandra. Udayana helped Devchandra Suri in the ceremony.[7][8] He was trained in religious discourse, philosophy, logic and grammar and became well versed in Jain and non\u2013Jain scriptures. At the age of 21, he was ordained an acharya of the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara school of Jainism at Nagaur in present-day Rajasthan. At this time, he was named Hemachandra Suri.[7][8][10][11]/nAt the time, Gujarat was ruled by the Chaulukya dynasty from Anhilavada (Patan). It is not certain when Hemachandra visited Patan for the first time. As Jain monks are mendicants for eight months and stay at one place during Chaturmas, the four monsoon months, he started living at Patan during these periods and produced the majority of his works there.[7][8]/nProbably around 1125, he was introduced to Jayasimha Siddharaja (fl. 1092\u20131141) and soon rose to prominence in the Chaulukya royal court.[8] According to the Prabhavakacarita of Prabh\u0101candra, the earliest biography of Hemachandra, Jayasimha spotted Hemachandra while passing through the streets of his capital. The king was impressed with an impromptu verse uttered by the young monk.[12]/nIn 1135, when Siddharaja conquered Malwa, he brought the works of Bhoja from Dhar along with other things. One day Siddhraja came across the manuscript of Sarasvati-Kanthabharana (also known as the Lakshana Prakash), a treatise on Sanskrit grammar. He was so impressed by it that he told the scholars in his court to produce a grammar that was as easy and lucid. Hemachandra requested Siddharaja to find the eight best grammatical treatises from Kashmir. He studied them and produced a new grammar work in the style of P\u0101\u1e47ini's A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.[7][8] He named his work Siddha-Hema-\u015aabdanu\u015b\u0101\u015bana after himself and the king. Siddharaja was so pleased with the work that he ordered it to be placed on the back of an elephant and paraded through the streets of Anhilwad Patan.[13] Hemachandra also composed the Dvyashraya Kavya, an epic on the history of the Chaulukya dynasty, to illustrate his grammar.[8]/nAccording to the Prabhachandra, there was an incident where Siddharaja wanted to kill his nephew Kumarapala because it was prophesied that the kingdom would meet its demise at Kumarapala's hands. Hemachandra hid Kumarapala under a pile of manuscripts to save him.[7] However, such motifs are common in Indian folk literature, so it is unlikely it was an actual historical event. Also, many sources differ on Siddharaja's motives.[7]/nHemachandra became the advisor to Kumarapala.[7][8] During Kumarapala's reign, Gujarat became a center of culture. Using the Jain approach of Anekantavada, Hemchandra is said to have displayed a broad-minded attitude, which pleased Kumarapala.[10] Kumarapala was a Shaiva and ordered the rebuilding of Somnath at Prabhas Patan. Some Hindu saints who were jealous of Hemachandra's rising popularity with the Kumarapala complained that Hemachandra was a very arrogant person, that he did not respect the vedic deities and that he refused to bow down to Hindu God Shiva. When called upon to visit the temple on the inauguration with Kumarapala, Hemachandra readily bowed before the lingam but said:/nBhava Bijankaura-janana Ragadyam Kshayamupagata Yasya, Brahma va Vishnu va Haro Jino va Namastasmai. I bow down to him who has destroyed the passions like attachment and malice which are the cause of the cycle of birth and death; whether he is Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva or Jina.[10][14]/nUltimately, the king became a devoted follower of Hemachandra and a champion of Jainism.[7][10]/nStarting in 1121, Hemachandra was involved in the construction of the Jain temple at Taranga. His influence on Kumarapala resulted in Jainism becoming the official religion of Gujarat and animal slaughter was banned in the state. The tradition of animal sacrifice in the name of religion was completely uprooted in Gujarat. As a result, even almost 900 years after Hemchandra, Gujarat still continues to be a predominantly lacto-vegetarian state, despite having an extensive coastline.[7][8]/nHe announced about his death six months in advance and fasted in his last days, a Jain practice called sallekhana. He died at Anhilavad Patan. The year of death differs according to sources but 1173 is generally accepted.[6]/nA prodigious writer, Hemachandra wrote grammars of Sanskrit and Prakrit, poetry, prosody, lexicons, texts on science and logic and many branches of Indian philosophy./nHis systematic exposition of the Jain path in the Yoga\u015b\u0101stra and its auto-commentary is a very influential text in Jain thought. According to Olle Quarnstr\u00f6m it is \"the most comprehensive treatise on Svetambara Jainism known to us\".[15]/nThe Siddha-Hema-\u015aabdanu\u015b\u0101\u015bana includes six languages: Sanskrit, the \"standard\" Prakrit (virtually Maharashtri Prakrit), Shauraseni, Magahi, Pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b, the otherwise-unattested C\u016blik\u0101pai\u015b\u0101c\u012b and Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba (virtually Gurjar Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba, prevalent in the area of Gujarat and Rajasthan at that time and the precursor of Gujarati language). He gave a detailed grammar of Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba and also illustrated it with the folk literature of the time for better understanding. It is the only known Apabhra\u1e43\u015ba grammar.[8] He wrote the grammar in form of rules, with 8 Adhyayas (Chapters) and \"Tattvaprakaashika prakash\" with \"maharnav nyaas\" in one year.

From a modern point of view (i.e., since Ethan Devinatz, Michael J. Hopkins, and Jeffrey H.

He was the father of Greek radiology.[1]  He replaced Dimitrios Stroumpos as the chair of physics at the University of Athens.  Initially, the school of Physics and Mathematics was part of the School of Philosophy. Argyropoulos along with other world-renowned Greek scientists Anastassios Christomanos, Konstantinos M. Mitsopoulos, Spyridon Miliarakis, Nikolaos Apostolidis, and Anastasios Damvergis filed a memorandum to the Greek state to separate the schools in the late 1800s.

Argyropoulos and his contemporaries in Greece and abroad were part of the new scientific movement introducing new theories and concepts.  Argyropoulos was a proponent of Aether theories prior to the development of special relativity. Scientist proposed the existence of a space-filling substance or field as the transmission medium for the propagation of electromagnetic or gravitational forces.  Argyropoulos and Greek physicist Vassilios Lakon believed that the absolute vacuum was not possible within the ether.  He also introduced the concept of atomic powers.  He did not clarify their nature or mode of action.  He introduced the notion of power within the quantitative framework.  Power described the physical condition of a body combined with the repulsive forces caused by heat.[1]/nArgyropoulos also contributed to the field of kinematics. Argyropoulos and his contemporaries began to accept the mathematical approach of kinematics replacing the theoretical qualitative approach dominated by the philosophical interpretation of the universe. Argyropoulos and Lakon introduced a definition for mass.  Argyropoulos and Lakon accepted the principle of Earth's rotation proposed by the foucault pendulum.  Argyropoulos defined active energy in relation to kinetic energy and potential energy.  He also accepted the principle of the conservation of energy.  Argyropoulos heavily researched electricity and proposed the concept of providing electric lighting to cities.

This produced the work on the Hasse\u2013Davenport relations for Gauss sums, and contact with Hans Heilbronn, with whom Davenport would later collaborate. In fact, as Davenport later admitted, his inherent prejudices against algebraic methods (\"what can you do with algebra?\") probably limited the amount he learned, in particular in the \"new\" algebraic geometry and Artin/Noether approach to abstract algebra./nHe took an appointment at the University of Manchester in 1937, just at the time when Louis Mordell had recruited \u00e9migr\u00e9s from continental Europe to build an outstanding department.

His family was Jewish, his father Aron Iakovlevich Naimark a professional artist, and his mother was Zefir Moiseevna.[1] He was four years old at the onset of World War I in 1914, and seven when the tumultuous Russian Revolution began in 1917. Showing an early talent for mathematics, Naimark enrolled in a technical college at the age of fifteen in 1924 soon after the Russian Civil War had ended.

His early work with Krein included development of the theory of separation of roots of algebraic equations. Naimark also began to take interest in pedagogical techniques at this time, an interest that stayed with him for the rest of his life.[4] After moving to the Steklov Institute of Mathematics for his D.Sc. Naimark worked intensively on spectral theory, extensions of symmetric operators, and the representation theory of locally compact operators.[4] His collaboration with Israel Gelfand in the 1930s and 1940s led to several fundamental results in functional analysis, including the 1943 Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem and the GNS theorem./nDuring his service in World War II Naimark wrote several papers on seismology and helped to develop the Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations.

A beggar named Alexander Agnew was refused a handout by Campbell.[9] Agnew had promised to cause the family harm and over the next two years strange phenomena were alleged to have occurred at the house. This included the mysterious cutting of warp thread, demonic voices, strange whistling noises and stones being thrown.[10] The poltergeist claims have been dismissed by researchers as a hoax. Magic historian Thomas Frost suggested that the phenomena was the result of conjuring trickery.[11] The story was given to Sinclair by Campbell's son Thomas, a philosophy student from a college in Glasgow who was living at the household. Folklorist Andrew Lang suggested that Thomas had produced the phenomena fraudulently.[12]/nHistorian David Damrosch has noted that Alexander Agnew commonly called the \"Jock of Broad Scotland\" was the first person in Scottish history to publicly deny the existence of God.[13] He was hanged at Dumfries for blasphemy on 21 May 1656.[14]/nA long-neglected aspect deriving from Sinclair's work as a mineral surveyor is that the last part of Hydrostaticks - a short History of Coal - includes the first published  geological cross section in which he treats the strata in purely geometric terms.[15]/nJames Gregory, then a professor at the University of St Andrews, attacked Sinclair in a 1672 pamphlet The New and Great Art of Weighing Vanity, under the name of Patrick Mather or Mathers, archbeadle of the University of St Andrews.

An appendix to the work, Tentamina de motu penduli et projectorum,[16] was a more important essay on dynamics, regarded by D. T.

He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science.[4] Knuth has been called the \"father of the analysis of algorithms\".[5]/nKnuth is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process, he also popularized the asymptotic notation. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces./nAs a writer and scholar, Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming, and designed the MIX/MMIX instruction set architectures. He strongly opposes the granting of software patents, and has expressed his opinion to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation./nDonald Knuth was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning.[6] He describes his heritage as \"Midwestern Lutheran German\".[7]:\u200a66\u200a His father owned a small printing business and taught bookkeeping.[8] While a student at Milwaukee Lutheran High School, Knuth thought of ingenious ways to solve problems. For example, in eighth grade, he entered a contest to find the number of words that the letters in \"Ziegler's Giant Bar\" could be rearranged to create; the judges had identified 2,500 such words. With time gained away from school due to a fake stomach ache, and working the problem the other way, Knuth used an unabridged dictionary and determined whether each dictionary entry could be formed using the letters in the phrase. Using this algorithm, he identified over 4,500 words, winning the contest.[7]:\u200a3\u200a As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.[9]/nKnuth received a scholarship in physics to the Case Institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland, Ohio, enrolling in 1956.[10] He also joined the Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity. While studying physics at Case, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650, an early commercial computer. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school because he believed he could do it better.[11]/nIn 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win its games.[12] He assigned \"values\" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.[11]/nKnuth was one of the founding editors of the Case Institute's Engineering and Science Review, which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.[13][14] He then switched from physics to mathematics, and received two degrees from Case in 1960:[10] his Bachelor of Science, and simultaneously a master of science by a special award of the faculty, who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.[4][11]/nIn 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser,[2] he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, with a thesis titled Finite Semifields and Projective Planes.[15]/nIn 1963, after receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an assistant professor.[16]/nKnuth accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, he decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book, but as he developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.[17]/nJust before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division, then situated on the Princeton campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency.[citation needed]/nIn 1967, Knuth attended a Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics conference and someone asked what he did. At the time, computer science was partitioned into numerical analysis, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. Based on his study and The Art of Computer Programming book, Knuth decided the next time someone asked he would say, \"Analysis of algorithms\".[18]/nIn 1969, Knuth left his position at Princeton to join the Stanford University faculty,[19] where he became Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, emeritus.[20][21]/nKnuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist.[16]/n\"The best way to communicate from one human being to another is through story.\"/nIn the 1970s, Knuth called computer science \"a totally new field with no real identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high. A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong.\u00a0... So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told.\"[22]/nFrom 1972 to 1973, Knuth spent a year at the University of Oslo among people such as Ole-Johan Dahl. This is where he had originally intended to write the seventh volume in his book series, which was to deal with programming languages. But Knuth had finished only the first two volumes when he came to Oslo, and thus spent the year on the third volume, next to teaching. The third volume came out just after Knuth returned to Stanford in 1973.[23]/nBy 2011, Volume 4A had been published.[17] Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science 2nd ed., which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume 1 of TAoCP, was published in 1994. In April 2020, Knuth said he anticipated that Volume 4 will have at least parts A through F.[18] Volume 4B was published in October 2022./nKnuth is also the author of Surreal Numbers,[24] a mathematical novelette on John Conway's set theory construction of an alternate system of numbers. Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research./nIn 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book A=B by Marko Petkov\u0161ek, Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger.[25] He also occasionally contributes language puzzles to Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics.[26]/nKnuth has delved into recreational mathematics. He contributed articles to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in Joseph Madachy's Mathematics on Vacation.[27]/nKnuth also appears in a number of Numberphile[28] and Computerphile videos on YouTube, where he discusses topics from writing Surreal Numbers[29] to why he does not use email.[30]/nIn addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a Lutheran,[31] is also the author of 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated,[32] in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling, namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book.  Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers led by Hermann Zapf. Knuth was invited to give a set of lectures at MIT on the views on religion and computer science behind his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About, where he published the lectures God and Computer Science.[33][non-primary source needed]/nKnuth strongly opposes granting software patents to trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the interior-point method of linear programming.[34] He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.[35]/nIn the 1970s the publishers of TAOCP abandoned Monotype in favor of phototypesetting. Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, which were typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created TeX and Metafont.[36]/nWhile developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called literate programming, because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature:/nInstead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.[37]/nKnuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the WEB system. The same WEB source is used to weave a TeX file, and to tangle a Pascal source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, CWEB, replaces Pascal with C, C++, and Java.[38]/nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books, both originally published the same year: TeX: The Program (1986); and METAFONT: The Program (1986).[39]  Around the same time, LaTeX, the now-widely adopted macro package based on TeX, was first developed by Leslie Lamport, who later published its first user manual in 1986.[40]/nDonald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. They have two children: John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth.[41]/nKnuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at Stanford University, which he calls \"Computer Musings\". He was a visiting professor at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science in the United Kingdom until 2017 and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College.[42][43]/nKnuth is an organist and a composer. He and his father served as organists for Lutheran congregations. Knuth and his wife have a 16-rank organ in their home.[44] In 2016 he completed a piece for organ, Fantasia Apocalyptica, which he calls a \"translation of the Greek text of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine into music\". It was premi\u00e8red in Sweden on January 10, 2018.[45]/nKnuth's Chinese name is Gao Dena (simplified Chinese: \u9ad8\u5fb7\u7eb3; traditional Chinese: \u9ad8\u5fb7\u7d0d; pinyin: G\u0101o D\u00e9n\u00e0).[46][3] He was given this name in 1977 by Frances Yao shortly before making a three-week trip to China.[3][47] In the 1980 Chinese translation of Volume 1 of The Art of Computer Programming (simplified Chinese: \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u827a\u672f; traditional Chinese: \u8a08\u7b97\u6a5f\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a2d\u8a08\u85dd\u8853; pinyin: J\u00ecsu\u00e0nj\u012b ch\u00e9ngx\u00f9 sh\u00e8j\u00ec y\u00ecsh\u00f9), Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time. In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the Journal of Computer Science and Technology's header, which Knuth says \"makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language\".[47]/nIn 2006, Knuth was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He underwent surgery in December that year and said, \"a little bit of radiation therapy\u00a0... as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good\" in his video autobiography.[48]/nKnuth used to pay a finder's fee of $2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because \"256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar\", and $0.32 for \"valuable suggestions\". According to an article in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Technology Review, these Knuth reward checks are \"among computerdom's most prized trophies\". Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and now gives each error finder a \"certificate of deposit\" from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious \"Bank of San Serriffe\".[49]/nHe once warned a correspondent, \"Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.\"[3]/nKnuth published his first \"scientific\" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title \"The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures\". In it, he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of Mad No. 26, and named the fundamental unit of force \"whatmeworry\". Mad published the article in issue No. 33 (June 1957).[50][51]/nTo demonstrate the concept of recursion, Knuth intentionally referred \"Circular definition\" and \"Definition, circular\" to each other in the index of The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1./nThe preface of Concrete Mathematics has the following paragraph:/nWhen DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft.  He announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was not going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor Stone's Embedding Theorem, nor even the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification. (Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)/nAt the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical XML-based successor to TeX, titled \"iTeX\" (pronounced [i\u02d0\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6t\u025bks\u02e7\u02e5], performed with a bell ringing), which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D printing, input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound.[52][53][54]/nIn 1971, Knuth received the first ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award.[4] He has received various other awards, including the Turing Award, the National Medal of Science, the John von Neumann Medal, and the Kyoto Prize.[4]/nKnuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1980 in recognition of his contributions to the field of computer science.[55]/nIn 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title Professor of The Art of Computer Programming, which has since been revised to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming./nKnuth was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. He was also elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1981 for organizing vast subject areas of computer science so that they are accessible to all segments of the computing community. In 1992, he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish The Art of Computer Programming. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2003.[1]/nKnuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.[56] He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[57] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society[58] and a member of the American Philosophical Society.[59] Other awards and honors include:/nA short list of his publications include:[74]/nThe Art of Computer Programming:/nComputers and Typesetting (all books are hardcover unless otherwise noted):/nBooks of collected papers:/nOther books:", "33988516": "Helmut Grunsky (11 July 1904 \u2013 5 June 1986) was a German mathematician who worked in complex analysis and geometric function theory.

He has written extensively in the field of differential geometry, as a critic of scientism and as a proponent of a new interpretation of quantum mechanics that draws heavily from premodern ontology and realism./nSmith graduated in 1948 from Cornell University with baccalaureate degrees in philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Two years later he obtained his M.S. in physics from Purdue University and, some time later, a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University./nHe worked as an aerodynamicist at Bell Aircraft Corporation, and while there researched and published on the problem of atmospheric reentry.[1] He was a mathematics professor at MIT, UCLA and Oregon State University, doing research in the field of differential geometry and publishing in academic journals such as the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Journal of Mathematics, and others. He retired from academic life in 1992./nIn parallel with his academic duties, he developed and still develops philosophical inquiries in the fields of metaphysics and the philosophy of science, publishing in specialized journals such as The Thomist, Sacred Web: A Journal of Tradition and Modernity, and Sophia: The Journal of Traditional Studies.[1]/nSmith is a member of the Traditionalist School of metaphysics, having contributed extensively to its criticism of modernity while exploring the philosophical underpinnings of the scientific method and emphasizing the idea of bringing science back into a Platonist and Aristotelian framework of traditional ontological realism./nIdentifying with Alfred North Whitehead's critique of the \"bifurcationism\" and \"physical reductionism\" of scientism \u2014 i.e., the belief that, first, the qualitative properties of the objects of perception (\"corporeal\" objects) are ultimately distinct from their respective quantitative properties (the \"physical\" objects studied by the various sciences); and second, that physical objects are in fact all there is, meaning corporeal objects are reduced to their physical counterparts \u2014 Smith examines critically in his work Cosmos and Transcendence (1984) the Cartesian roots of modern science./nProceeding with his critique of scientism in his monograph, The Quantum Enigma (1995), Smith raises the questions of whether the scientific method is in fact dependent on the scientistic philosophy and, if it is not, whether linking it to other philosophical frameworks would provide better solutions to the way physical phenomena are interpreted. Demonstrating that neither the scientific method nor its results require adhering to a scientistic metaphysics, he answers in the negative to the first question, resulting in the conclusion that it is possible to link the scientific method to any underlying ontology, or to none at all. Working then into the second question, he proposes linking the scientific method \u2014 and thus the modern sciences \u2014 to a non-bifurcationist, non-reductionist metaphysics in the form of a modified Thomistic ontology, showing how such a move resolves the apparent incoherences of quantum mechanics.[2]/nAccording to Smith, this interpretation of quantum mechanics allows for the usage of the hylomorphic concepts of potency and act to properly understand quantum superposition. For example, instead of considering that a photon is \"simultaneously a wave and a particle\" or \"a particle in two distinct positions,\" one may consider that the photon (or any other physical object) at first does not exist in act, but only in potency; i.e., as \"matter\" in the hylomorphic meaning of the term, having the potential of becoming \"a wave or a particle,\" or \"of being here or there.\" Whether one of these outcomes will happen to this undifferentiated matter is dependent on the determination imposed upon it by the macroscopic corporeal object that provides its actualization. A photon, thus, would be no more strange for having many potentials than, say, an individual who has the \"superposed\" potentials of learning French and/or Spanish and/or Greek, all the while reading and/or walking and/or stretching his arms. A further consequence of this interpretation is that a corporeal object and its \"associated physical object\" are not dichotomized or reduced one to the other anymore but, on the contrary, altogether constitute a whole of which different aspects are dealt with depending upon perspective.[3]/nSmith's understanding of the relationship between corporeal and physical objects extends to his interpretation of biology, where he has become an opponent of Darwinian evolution, as the fundamental element in a species would be its form, not its causal history, which evolutionists favor. This leads him to be a supporter of the intelligent design movement, though his own hylomorphic approach is not widely adopted by mainstream intelligent design theorists (who, like evolutionists, also favor causal history, albeit differently).[citation needed]/nSmith has also taken a stance towards a relativistic rehabilitation of geocentrism. He does not support a Ptolemaic or medieval geocentrism unequivocally, nor assert that heliocentrism is absolutely false. Rather, he argues that, according to the theory of relativity, both heliocentrism and geocentrism have scientific merit, insofar as scientific observation depends upon the reference frame of the observer. Consequently, any observations made from Earth (or any near-Earth satellites) are in effect geocentric.[4][5]/nSmith participated in Miracle (2019), a documentary by Mauro Ventura, with the participation of Raphael De Paola and Olavo de Carvalho.[6][7]/nThe End of Quantum Reality (2020), a documentary film about Smith's life and thought, ran in a limited national theatrical release in the U.S.[8][9][10]/nCosmos and Transcendence: Breaking Through the Barrier of Scientistic Belief (1984)/nTheistic Evolution: The Teilhardian Heresy (1988; originally published as Teilhardism and the New Religion)/nThe Quantum Enigma: Finding the Hidden Key (1995)/nAncient Wisdom and Modern Misconceptions: A Critique of Contemporary Scientism (2004; originally published as The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology)/nChristian Gnosis: From Saint Paul to Meister Eckhart (2008)/nScience & Myth: With a Response to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design (2012)/nIn Quest of Catholicity: Malachi Martin Responds to Wolfgang Smith (2016)/nPhysics and Vertical Causation: The End of Quantum Reality (2019)/nThe Vertical Ascent: From Particles to the Tripartite Cosmos and Beyond (2021)/nVedanta in Light of Christian Wisdom (2022)/nPhysics: A Science in Quest of an Ontology (2023)/nArticles on philosophy, religion, physics and non-mathematical subjects in general:/nAcademic articles on mathematics signed as \"J.

The Outer space Xn, associated to a free group Fn, is a free group analog[35] of the Teichm\u00fcller space of a Riemann surface. Instead of marked conformal structures (or, in an equivalent model, hyperbolic structures) on a surface, points of the Outer space are represented by volume-one marked metric graphs. A marked metric graph consists of a homotopy equivalence between a wedge of n circles and a finite connected graph \u0393 without degree-one and degree-two vertices, where \u0393 is equipped with a volume-one metric structure, that is, assignment of positive real lengths to edges of \u0393 so that the sum of the lengths of all edges is equal to one. Points of Xn can also be thought of as free and discrete minimal isometric actions Fn on real trees where the quotient graph has volume one./nBy construction the Outer space Xn is a finite-dimensional simplicial complex equipped with a natural action of Out(Fn) which is properly discontinuous and has finite simplex stabilizers. The main result of Culler\u2013Vogtmann 1986 paper,[2] obtained via Morse-theoretic methods, was that the Outer space Xn is contractible. Thus the quotient space Xn /Out(Fn) is \"almost\" a classifying space for Out(Fn) and it can be thought of as a classifying space over Q. Moreover, Out(Fn) is known to be virtually torsion-free, so for any torsion-free subgroup H of Out(Fn) the action of H on Xn is discrete and free, so that Xn/H is a classifying space for H. For these reasons the Outer space is a particularly useful object in obtaining homological and cohomological information about Out(Fn). In particular, Culler and Vogtmann proved[2] that Out(Fn) has virtual cohomological dimension 2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03./nIn their 1986 paper Culler and Vogtmann do not assign Xn a specific name. According to Vogtmann,[36] the term Outer space for the complex Xn was later coined by Peter Shalen. In subsequent years the Outer space became a central object in the study of Out(Fn). In particular, the Outer space has a natural compactification, similar to Thurston's compactification of the Teichm\u00fcller space, and studying the action of Out(Fn) on this compactification yields interesting information about dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups.[37][38][39][40]/nMuch of Vogtmann's subsequent work concerned the study of the Outer space Xn, particularly its homotopy, homological and cohomological properties, and related questions for Out(Fn). For example, Hatcher and Vogtmann[41][42] obtained a number of homological stability results for Out(Fn) and Aut(Fn)./nIn her papers with Conant,[43][44][45] Vogtmann explored the connection found by Maxim Kontsevich between the cohomology of certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and the homology of Out(Fn)./nA 2001 paper of Vogtmann, joint with Louis Billera and Susan P. Holmes, used the ideas of geometric group theory and CAT(0) geometry to study the space of phylogenetic trees, that is trees showing possible evolutionary relationships between different species.[46]  Identifying precise evolutionary trees is an important basic problem in mathematical biology and one also needs to have good quantitative tools for estimating how accurate a particular evolutionary tree is. The paper of Billera, Vogtmann and Holmes produced a method for quantifying the difference between two evolutionary trees, effectively determining the distance between them.[47] The fact that the space of phylogenetic trees has \"non-positively curved geometry\", particularly the uniqueness of shortest paths or geodesics in CAT(0) spaces, allows using these results for practical statistical computations of estimating the confidence level of how accurate particular evolutionary tree is. A free software package implementing these algorithms has been developed and is actively used by biologists.[47]", "33792013": "Joseph A.

Sgro relocated to Richmond, Virginia where he was an Associate Professor of Neurology and the Head of Neurophysiology (1987\u20131991) and finally, as Chief of the Division of Clinical Neurophysiology (1991\u20131994) at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center.  He was also appointed as an adjunct associate professor of Neurology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1994 until 2004./nDuring his post-doctoral fellowship at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, Sgro achieved recognition in the medical community for his research and findings on the theory of evoked potentials, with a particular focus on Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs).  A summary of Sgro's efforts to improve evoked potential recording recording technology is found in Keith Chiappa's book.[15] This article covers many one and two dimensional, linear and non-linear digital filters.  Two approaches to improve recording fidelity is by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio  (SNR) by the reduction of coherent electrical noise[16]  and second the development of a two dimensional DFT digital filtering of evoked potentials which trades off the SNR improvement of the moving average technique with the detection of changes in the averaged waveform.[17]  Using this technology, Sgro proved that SSEPs were \u201cstate dependent,\u201d varying depending on whether the patient was awake or asleep (anesthetized).[18]  Following these findings with funding from the Whitaker Foundation,[19] Sgro developed technology and techniques to analyze evoked potentials based on stimulation run by an ultra fast (i.e. hundreds of hertz) pseudorandom m-sequences.[15][20][21]  This work was demonstrated to be a more effective method of identification and predictor of sub-clinical diseases or damage such as mortality from status epilepticus[18][22][23] (diseases that otherwise went undetected until they become severe enough to qualify as clinically apparent when compared to conventional evoked potentials)./nWhile conducting research into the (afferent) sensory nervous system with evoked potentials, Sgro also began to investigate devices and techniques to determine the state of the (efferent) motor nervous system using TMS with the goal of more effective detection of sub-clinical diseases and increased sensitivity of the motor system during intra-operative patient monitoring. Sgro[24] and his associates studied the theoretical and practical issues involved in the design of a high magnetic field strength and rapid transcranial magnetic stimulator which could exceed the historical safety limit of electrical brain stimulation[25][26] (40 uC/cm2/phase at a stimulation rate of 20 to 50 Hertz over several hours).  These studies resulted in the construction of a rapid high magnetic field strength device[27] which was suitable for safety studies.  The safety of TMS in rats with a maximal field strength of 3.4 Tesla at 8 Herz for 20 minutes or 10uC/cm2/phase was demonstrated in Sgro[28]/nWhile working as a neurology researcher Sgro began work in biomedical engineering and machine vision, specifically the use of imaging and machine vision technologies, to assess the function and integrity of the nervous system in various states of consciousness, during medical procedures, and disease.  The research was performed initially using computer programs written in Fortran running on a DEC PDP minicomputer.  In the mid 1980s the widespread adoption of IBM PC compatible computers with the ISA bus enabled the development of PC based expansion cards to increase the functionality of the PC. To facilitate lower cost advanced hardware development, Sgro co-founded Alacron, Inc. to develop advanced medical research equipment and commercial PC based products./nDuring the mid 1990s, Sgro began to study the use of artificial intelligence methods in the automation of neurophysiological monitoring.[29]  Sgro conducted research into the use of backpropagation neural networks in clinical monitoring and automatic neurophysiological interpretation of EEG and evoked potentials. An overview of this approach to evoked potentials was outlined in[30] where it was shown in a pilot study that using a multiple hidden layer neural network, e.g.deep learning, the classification and latency measurements of visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials is comparable to human expert classification.  Additional research[31]  into the machine learning of EEG using Higher-Order Neural Networks (HONN)[32][33] also produced comparable results when compared to human expert classification./nIn 1985, Sgro co-founded Alacron, Inc. in Nashua, New Hampshire.  Sgro and the Alacron engineering team focused on the development and production of frame grabbers and high speed image processing computational subsystems.  The product family currently includes frame grabbers, software, data recording devices and supporting peripherals. Despite initial focus on neurophysiology research and medical imaging, Alacron saw uses for its products expand outside the field of medicine into other applications, such as manufacturing, military, and other industries that use robotics extensively.  Alacron is one of the largest frame grabber manufacturers in the Automated Imaging Association's annual market data report.[34]/nExamples of broader machine vision uses of frame grabbers originally developed for use in medical imaging include AS&E, which incorporated Alacron technology in backscatter X-ray equipment used for border security, and as image capture used for Voyage Data Recorders, the maritime equivalent of aviation \u201cblack boxes.\u201d/nIn addition to the commercial product lines offered by Alacron, Sgro continued to perform basic research in integrating frame grabber technology with specialized systems for various disciplines.  The company received SBIR grants where Sgro acted as principal investigators, including:/nAcademic presentations of Alacron's technology and research include:/nIn 2002, Sgro launched FastVision, LLC.  FastVision builds high-speed megapixel-plus digital cameras, based on CMOS and CCD image sensors . The company's goal is to produce smart cameras, i.e. cameras with high-speed scalable integrated image processing capabilities built into the same package housing the opto-electronics.  Like most smart camera vendors, FastVision's suite includes FPGA processing and memory subsystems to enable in-camera image processing. When integrated with a high powered frame grabber or vision processor board (or a host subsystem), the resulting system capabilities can be expanded beyond simple image compression.  The smart camera subsystem can be integrated with disk or non-volatile semiconductor storage inside or outside the camera to hold sustained real-time data acquisition, a valuable aid to system effectiveness when network connectivity is overloaded or is unavailable./nApplications for smart cameras range from security and surveillance, to robotics in medicine and manufacturing, to military applications such as bots, drones and intelligent weaponry, to satellites and inner and outer space exploration.", "64593933": "Mireille Martin-Deschamps is a French mathematician who studies the algebraic geometry of space curves.

(Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Democritus, Vol. IX, 44)\nNow his principal doctrines were these. That atoms and the vacuum were the beginning of the universe; and that everything else existed only in opinion. (trans. Yonge 1853)/nThe theory of Democritus held that everything is composed of \"atoms,\" which are physically, but not geometrically, indivisible; that between atoms, there lies empty space; that atoms are indestructible, and have always been and always will be in motion; that there is an infinite number of atoms and of kinds of atoms, which differ in shape and size. Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said, \"The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is.\" However, his exact position on atomic weight is disputed.[3] His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the 19th-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.[4]/nDemocritus, along with Leucippus and Epicurus, proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved.[4] Using analogies from humans' sense experiences, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes, others with balls and sockets.[e]/nThe Democritean atom is an inert solid (merely excluding other bodies from its volume) that interacts with other atoms mechanically. In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and magnetic forces and are dynamic./nThe theory of the atomists appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. Classical atomists could not have had an empirical basis for modern concepts of atoms and molecules./nThe atomistic void hypothesis was a response to the paradoxes of Parmenides and Zeno, the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult-to-answer arguments in favor of the idea that there can be no movement. They held that any movement would require a void\u2014which is nothing\u2014but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was \"You say there is a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void.\"[5][f] The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is something, for instance light waves./nThe atomists agreed that motion required a void, but simply ignored the argument of Parmenides on the grounds that motion was an observable fact. Therefore, they asserted, there must be a void. This idea survived in a refined version as Newton's theory of absolute space, which met the logical requirements of attributing reality to not-being. Einstein's theory of relativity provided a new answer to Parmenides and Zeno, with the insight that space by itself is relative and cannot be separated from time as part of a generally curved space-time manifold. Consequently, Newton's refinement is now considered superfluous.[6]/nDemocritus held that originally the universe was composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger units\u2014including the earth and everything on it.[1] He surmised that there are many worlds, some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end and that a world could be destroyed by collision with another world.[g]/nDemocritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in particular. According to Archimedes,[h] Democritus was among the first to observe that a cone and pyramid with the same base area and height has one-third the volume of a cylinder or prism respectively, a result which Archimedes states was later proved by Eudoxus of Cnidus.[i][8] Plutarch[j] also reports that Democritus worked on a problem involving the cross-section of a cone that Thomas Heath suggests may be an early version of infinitesimal calculus.[8]/nDemocritus thought that the first humans lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, going out to forage individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit which grew wild on the trees. They were driven together into societies for fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.[1][k]/nThe ethics and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims. As such, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has gone as far as to say that: \"despite the large number of ethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of Democritus's ethical views,\" noting that there is a \"difficulty of deciding which fragments are genuinely Democritean.\"[4]/nLater Greek historians consider Democritus to have established aesthetics as a subject of investigation and study,[9] as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings on these matters, only a small percentage of his thoughts and ideas can be known./nDiogenes Laertius attributes several works to Democritus, but none of them have survived in a complete form.[4]/nA collections of sayings credited to Democritus have been preserved by Stobaeus, as well as a collection of sayings ascribed to \"Democrates\" which some scholars including Diels and Kranz have also ascribed to Democritus.[4]/nDiogenes Laertius claims that Plato disliked Democritus so much that he wished to have all of his books burned.[m] He was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle, and was the teacher of Protagoras.[n]", "8527892": "Valentin Alexandre Po\u00e9naru (born 1932 in Bucharest) is a Romanian\u2013French mathematician.

In 1974, he became an associate professor at Stanford University.[8]  In 1976 he took a visiting faculty position with UCLA and married physicist Yu-Yun Kuo, who he knew from his time as a graduate student at Berkeley. From 1984 to 1987 he worked at University of California, San Diego.[9] Since 1987, he has been at Harvard University.[10] In April 2022, Yau announced a forthcoming move from Harvard to Tsinghua University.[2]/nIn 1978, Yau became \"stateless\" after the British Consulate revoked his Hong Kong residency due to his United States permanent residency status.[11][12]  Regarding his status when receiving his Fields Medal in 1982, Yau stated \"I am proud to say that when I was awarded the Fields Medal in mathematics, I held no passport of any country and should certainly be considered Chinese.\"[13] Yau remained \"stateless\" until 1990, when he obtained United States citizenship.[11][14]/nWith science journalist Steve Nadis, Yau has written a non-technical account of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string theory,[YN10] a history of Harvard's mathematics department,[NY13] and an autobiography.[YN19]/nYau has made major contributions to the development of modern differential geometry and geometric analysis. As said by William Thurston in 1981:[15]/nWe have rarely had the opportunity to witness the spectacle of the work of one mathematician affecting, in a short span of years, the direction of whole areas of research. In the field of geometry, one of the most remarkable instances of such an occurrence during the last decade is given by the contributions of Shing-Tung Yau./nHis most widely celebrated results include the resolution (with Shiu-Yuen Cheng) of the boundary-value problem for the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation, the positive mass theorem in the mathematical analysis of general relativity (achieved with Richard Schoen), the resolution of the Calabi conjecture, the topological theory of minimal surfaces (with William Meeks), the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theorem (done with Karen Uhlenbeck), and the Cheng\u2212Yau and Li\u2212Yau gradient estimates for partial differential equations (found with Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Peter Li). Many of Yau's results (in addition to those of others) were written into textbooks co-authored with Schoen.[SY94][SY97]/nIn addition to his research, Yau is the founder and director of several mathematical institutes, mostly in China. John Coates has commented that \"no other mathematician of our times has come close\" to Yau's success at fundraising for mathematical activities in Mainland China and Hong Kong.[6] During a sabbatical year at National Tsinghua University in Taiwan, Yau was asked by Charles Kao to start a mathematical institute at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. After a few years of fundraising efforts, Yau established the multi-disciplinary Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1993, with his frequent co-author Shiu-Yuen Cheng as associate director. In 1995, Yau assisted Yongxiang Lu with raising money from Ronnie Chan and Gerald Chan's Morningside Group for the new Morningside Center of Mathematics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Yau has also been involved with the Center of Mathematical Sciences at Zhejiang University,[16] at Tsinghua University,[17] at National Taiwan University,[18] and in Sanya.[19] More recently, in 2014, Yau raised money to establish the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (of which he is the director), the Center for Green Buildings and Cities, and the Center for Immunological Research, all at Harvard University.[20]/nModeled on an earlier physics conference organized by Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, Yau proposed the International Congress of Chinese Mathematicians, which is now held every three years. The first congress was held at the Morningside Center from December 12 to 18, 1998. He co-organizes the annual \"Journal of Differential Geometry\" and \"Current Developments in Mathematics\" conferences. Yau is an editor-in-chief of the Journal of Differential Geometry,[21] Asian Journal of Mathematics,[22] and Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics.[23] As of 2021, he has advised over seventy Ph.D. students.[7]/nIn Hong Kong, with the support of Ronnie Chan, Yau set up the Hang Lung Award for high school students. He has also organized and participated in meetings for high school and college students, such as the panel discussions Why Math? Ask Masters! in Hangzhou, July 2004, and The Wonder of Mathematics in Hong Kong, December 2004. Yau also co-initiated a series of books on popular mathematics, \"Mathematics and Mathematical People\"./nIn 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted preprints to the arXiv claiming to prove the Thurston geometrization conjecture and, as a special case, the renowned Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Although his work contained many new ideas and results, his proofs lacked detail on a number of technical arguments. Over the next few years, several mathematicians devoted their time to fill in details and provide expositions of Perelman's work to the mathematical community.[24] A well-known August 2006 article in the New Yorker written by Sylvia Nasar and David Gruber about the situation brought some professional disputes involving Yau to public attention.[13][14]/nYau claimed that Nasar and Gruber's article was defamatory and contained several falsehoods, and that they did not give him the opportunity to represent his own side of the disputes. He considered filing a lawsuit against the magazine, claiming professional damage, but says he decided that it wasn't sufficiently clear what such an action would achieve.[YN19] He established a public relations website, with letters responding to the New Yorker article from several mathematicians, including himself and two others quoted in the article.[29]/nIn his autobiography, Yau said that his statements in 2006 such as that Cao and Zhu gave \"the first complete and detailed account of the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture\" should have been phrased more carefully. Although he does believe Cao and Zhu's work to be the first and most rigorously detailed account of Perelman's work, he says he should have clarified that they had \"not surpassed Perelman's work in any way.\"[YN19] He has also maintained the view that (as of 2019) the final parts of Perelman's proof should be better understood by the mathematical community, with the corresponding possibility that there remain some unnoticed errors./nYau has made a number of major research contributions, centered on differential geometry and its appearance in other fields of mathematics and science. In addition to his research, Yau has compiled influential sets of open problems in differential geometry, including both well-known old conjectures with new proposals and problems. Two of Yau's most widely cited problem lists from the 1980s have been updated with notes on progress as of 2014.[30] Particularly well-known are a conjecture on existence of minimal hypersurfaces and on the spectral geometry of minimal hypersurfaces./nIn 1978, by studying the complex Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation, Yau resolved the Calabi conjecture, which had been posed by Eugenio Calabi in 1954.[Y78a] As a special case, this showed that K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics exist on any closed K\u00e4hler manifold whose first Chern class is nonpositive. Yau's method adapted earlier work of Calabi, J\u00fcrgen Moser, and Aleksei Pogorelov, developed for quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations and the real Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation, to the setting of the complex Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation.[31][32][33][34]/nThe understanding of the Calabi conjecture in the noncompact setting is less definitive. Gang Tian and Yau extended Yau's analysis of the complex Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation to the noncompact setting, where the use of cutoff functions and corresponding integral estimates necessitated the conditional assumption of certain controlled geometry near infinity.[TY90] This reduces the problem to the question of existence of K\u00e4hler metrics with such asymptotic properties; they obtained such metrics for certain smooth quasi-projective complex varieties. They later extended their work to allow orbifold singularities.[TY91] With Brian Greene, Alfred Shapere, and Cumrun Vafa, Yau introduced an ansatz for a K\u00e4hler metric on the set of regular points of certain surjective holomorphic maps, with Ricci curvature approximately zero.[G+90] They were able to apply the Tian\u2212Yau existence theorem to construct a K\u00e4hler metric which is exactly Ricci-flat. The Greene\u2212Shapere\u2212Vafa\u2212Yau ansatz and its natural generalization, now known as a semi-flat metric, has become important in several analyses of problems in K\u00e4hler geometry.[39][40]/nThe positive energy theorem, obtained by Yau in collaboration with his former doctoral student Richard Schoen, can be described in physical terms:/nIn Einstein's theory of general relativity, the gravitational energy of an isolated physical system is nonnegative./nHowever, it is a precise theorem of differential geometry and geometric analysis, in which physical systems are modeled by Riemannian manifolds with nonnegativity of a certain generalized scalar curvature. As such, Schoen and Yau's approach originated in their study of Riemannian manifolds of positive scalar curvature, which is of interest in and of itself. The starting point of Schoen and Yau's analysis is their identification of a simple but novel way of inserting the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations into the second variation formula for the area of a stable minimal hypersurface of a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. The Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem then highly constrains the possible topology of such a surface when the ambient manifold has positive scalar curvature.[SY79a][41][42]/nSchoen and Yau exploited this observation by finding novel constructions of stable minimal hypersurfaces with various controlled properties.[SY79a] Some of their existence results were developed simultaneously with similar results of Jonathan Sacks and Karen Uhlenbeck, using different techniques. Their fundamental result is on the existence of minimal immersions with prescribed topological behavior. As a consequence of their calculation with the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem, they were able to conclude that certain topologically distinguished three-dimensional manifolds cannot have any Riemannian metric of nonnegative scalar curvature.[43][44]/nSchoen and Yau then adapted their work to the setting of certain Riemannian asymptotically flat initial data sets in general relativity. They proved that negativity of the mass would allow one to invoke the Plateau problem to construct stable minimal surfaces which are geodesically complete. A noncompact analogue of their calculation with the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem then provides a logical contradiction to the negativity of mass. As such, they were able to prove the positive mass theorem in the special case of their Riemannian initial data sets.[SY79c][45]/nSchoen and Yau extended this to the full Lorentzian formulation of the positive mass theorem by studying a partial differential equation proposed by Pong-Soo Jang. They proved that solutions to the Jang equation exist away from the apparent horizons of black holes, at which solutions can diverge to infinity.[SY81] By relating the geometry of a Lorentzian initial data set to the geometry of the graph of such a solution to the Jang equation, interpreting the latter as a Riemannian initial data set, Schoen and Yau proved the full positive energy theorem.[45] Furthermore, by reverse-engineering their analysis of the Jang equation, they were able to establish that any sufficient concentration of energy in general relativity must be accompanied by an apparent horizon.[SY83]/nDue to the use of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem, these results were originally restricted to the case of three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds. Schoen and Yau established an induction on dimension by constructing Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on minimal hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds which have positive scalar curvature.[SY79b] Such minimal hypersurfaces, which were constructed by means of geometric measure theory by Frederick Almgren and Herbert Federer, are generally not smooth in large dimensions, so these methods only directly apply up for Riemannian manifolds of dimension less than eight. Without any dimensional restriction, Schoen and Yau proved the positive mass theorem in the class of locally conformally flat manifolds.[SY88][31] In 2017, Schoen and Yau published a preprint claiming to resolve these difficulties, thereby proving the induction without dimensional restriction and verifying the Riemannian positive mass theorem in arbitrary dimension./nGerhard Huisken and Yau made a further study of the asymptotic region of Riemannian manifolds with strictly positive mass. Huisken had earlier initiated the study of volume-preserving mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces of Euclidean space.[46] Huisken and Yau adapted his work to the Riemannian setting, proving a long-time existence and convergence theorem for the flow. As a corollary, they established a new geometric feature of positive-mass manifolds, which is that their asymptotic regions are foliated by surfaces of constant mean curvature.[HY96]/nTraditionally, the maximum principle technique is only applied directly on compact spaces, as maxima are then guaranteed to exist. In 1967, Hideki Omori found a novel maximum principle which applies on noncompact Riemannian manifolds whose sectional curvatures are bounded below. It is trivial that approximate maxima exist; Omori additionally proved the existence of approximate maxima where the values of the gradient and second derivatives are suitably controlled. Yau partially extended Omori's result to require only a lower bound on Ricci curvature; the result is known as the Omori\u2212Yau maximum principle.[Y75b] Such generality is useful due to the appearance of Ricci curvature in the Bochner formula, where a lower bound is also typically used in algebraic manipulations. In addition to giving a very simple proof of the principle itself, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau were able to show that the Ricci curvature assumption in the Omori\u2212Yau maximum principle can be replaced by the assumption of the existence of cutoff functions with certain controllable geometry.[CY75][31][47][48][49]/nYau was able to directly apply the Omori\u2212Yau principle to generalize the classical Schwarz\u2212Pick lemma of complex analysis. Lars Ahlfors, among others, had previously generalized the lemma to the setting of Riemann surfaces. With his methods, Yau was able to consider the setting of a mapping from a complete K\u00e4hler manifold (with a lower bound on Ricci curvature) to a Hermitian manifold with holomorphic bisectional curvature bounded above by a negative number.[Y78b][35][49]/nCheng and Yau extensively used their variant of the Omori\u2212Yau principle to find K\u00e4hler\u2212Einstein metrics on noncompact K\u00e4hler manifolds, under an ansatz developed by Charles Fefferman. The estimates involved in the method of continuity were not as difficult as in Yau's earlier work on the Calabi conjecture, due to the fact that Cheng and Yau only considered K\u00e4hler\u2212Einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature. The more subtle question, where Fefferman's earlier work became important, is to do with geodesic completeness. In particular, Cheng and Yau were able to find complete K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature on any bounded, smooth, and strictly pseudoconvex subset of complex Euclidean space.[CY80] These can be thought of as complex geometric analogues of the Poincar\u00e9 ball model of hyperbolic space.[35][50]/nYau's original application of the Omori\u2212Yau maximum principle was to establish gradient estimates for a number of second-order elliptic partial differential equations.[Y75b] Given a function on a complete and smooth Riemannian manifold which satisfies various conditions relating the Laplacian to the function and gradient values, Yau applied the maximum principle to various complicated composite expressions to control the size of the gradient. Although the algebraic manipulations involved are complex, the conceptual form of Yau's proof is strikingly simple.[51][47]/nYau's novel gradient estimates have come to be called \"differential Harnack inequalities\" since they can be integrated along arbitrary paths in to recover inequalities which are of the form of the classical Harnack inequalities, directly comparing the values of a solution to a differential equation at two different input points. By making use of Calabi's study of the distance function on a Riemannian manifold, Yau and Shiu-Yuen Cheng gave a powerful localization of Yau's gradient estimates, using the same methods to simplify the proof of the Omori\u2212Yau maximum principle.[CY75] Such estimates are widely quoted in the particular case of harmonic functions on a Riemannian manifold, although Yau and Cheng\u2212Yau's original results cover more general scenarios.[51][47]/nIn 1986, Yau and Peter Li made use of the same methods to study parabolic partial differential equations on Riemannian manifolds.[LY86][47] Richard Hamilton generalized their results in certain geometric settings to matrix inequalities. Analogues of the Li\u2212Yau and Hamilton\u2212Li\u2212Yau inequalities are of great importance in the theory of Ricci flow, where Hamilton proved a matrix differential Harnack inequality for the curvature operator of certain Ricci flows, and Grigori Perelman proved a differential Harnack inequality for the solutions of a backwards heat equation coupled with a Ricci flow.[52][51]/nCheng and Yau were able to use their differential Harnack estimates to show that, under certain geometric conditions, closed submanifolds of complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian spaces are themselves complete. For instance, they showed that if M is a spacelike hypersurface of Minkowski space which is topologically closed and has constant mean curvature, then the induced Riemannian metric on M is complete.[CY76a] Analogously, they showed that if M is an affine hypersphere of affine space which is topologically closed, then the induced affine metric on M is complete.[CY86] Such results are achieved by deriving a differential Harnack inequality for the (squared) distance function to a given point and integrating along intrinsically defined paths./nIn 1985, Simon Donaldson showed that, over a nonsingular projective variety of complex dimension two, a holomorphic vector bundle admits a hermitian Yang\u2013Mills connection if and only if the bundle is stable. A result of Yau and Karen Uhlenbeck generalized Donaldson's result to allow a compact K\u00e4hler manifold of any dimension.[UY86] The Uhlenbeck\u2013Yau method relied upon elliptic partial differential equations while Donaldson's used parabolic partial differential equations, roughly in parallel to Eells and Sampson's epochal work on harmonic maps. The results of Donaldson and Uhlenbeck\u2013Yau have since been extended by other authors. Uhlenbeck and Yau's article is important in giving a clear reason that stability of the holomorphic vector bundle can be related to the analytic methods used in constructing a hermitian Yang\u2013Mills connection. The essential mechanism is that if an approximating sequence of hermitian connections fails to converge to the required Yang\u2013Mills connection, then they can be rescaled to converge to a subsheaf which can be verified to be destabilizing by Chern\u2013Weil theory.[33][53]/nLike the Calabi\u2013Yau theorem, the Donaldson\u2013Uhlenbeck\u2013Yau theorem is of interest in theoretical physics.[37] In the interest of an appropriately general formulation of supersymmetry, Andrew Strominger included the hermitian Yang\u2013Mills condition as part of his Strominger system, a proposal for the extension of the Calabi\u2212Yau condition to non-K\u00e4hler manifolds.[36] Ji-Xiang Fu and Yau introduced an ansatz for the solution of Strominger's system on certain three-dimensional complex manifolds, reducing the problem to a complex Monge\u2212Amp\u00e8re equation, which they solved.[FY08]/nYau's solution of the Calabi conjecture had given a reasonably complete answer to the question of how K\u00e4hler metrics on compact complex manifolds of nonpositive first Chern class can be deformed into K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics.[Y78a] Akito Futaki showed that the existence of holomorphic vector fields can act as an obstruction to the direct extension of these results to the case when the complex manifold has positive first Chern class.[35] A proposal of Calabi's suggested that K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics exist on any compact K\u00e4hler manifolds with positive first Chern class which admit no holomorphic vector fields.[Y82b] During the 1980s, Yau and others came to understand that this criterion could not be sufficient. Inspired by the Donaldson\u2212Uhlenbeck\u2212Yau theorem, Yau proposed that the existence of K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics must be linked to stability of the complex manifold in the sense of geometric invariant theory, with the idea of studying holomorphic vector fields along projective embeddings, rather than holomorphic vector fields on the manifold itself.[Y93][Y14a] Subsequent research of Gang Tian and Simon Donaldson refined this conjecture, which became known as the Yau\u2013Tian\u2013Donaldson conjecture relating K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein metrics and K-stability. In 2019, Xiuxiong Chen, Donaldson, and Song Sun were awarded the Oswald Veblen prize for resolution of the conjecture.[54]/nIn 1982, Li and Yau resolved the Willmore conjecture in the non-embedded case.[LY82] More precisely, they established that, given any smooth immersion of a closed surface in the 3-sphere which fails to be an embedding, the Willmore energy is bounded below by 8\u03c0. This is complemented by a 2012 result of Fernando Marques and Andr\u00e9 Neves, which says that in the alternative case of a smooth embedding of the 2-dimensional torus S1 \u00d7 S1, the Willmore energy is bounded below by 2\u03c02.[55] Together, these results comprise the full Willmore conjecture, as originally formulated by Thomas Willmore in 1965. Although their assumptions and conclusions are quite similar, the methods of Li\u2212Yau and Marques\u2212Neves are distinct. Nonetheless, they both rely on structurally similar minimax schemes. Marques and Neves made novel use of the Almgren\u2013Pitts min-max theory of the area functional from geometric measure theory; Li and Yau's approach depended on their new \"conformal invariant\", which is a min-max quantity based on the Dirichlet energy. The main work of their article is devoted to relating their conformal invariant to other geometric quantities./nWilliam Meeks and Yau produced some foundational results on minimal surfaces in three-dimensional manifolds, revisiting points left open by older work of Jesse Douglas and Charles Morrey.[MY82][41] Following these foundations, Meeks, Leon Simon, and Yau gave a number of fundamental results on surfaces in three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds which minimize area within their homology class.[MSY82] They were able to give a number of striking applications. For example, they showed that if M is an orientable 3-manifold such that every smooth embedding of a 2-sphere can be extended to a smooth embedding of the unit ball, then the same is true of any covering space of M. Interestingly, Meeks-Simon-Yau's paper and Hamilton's foundational paper on Ricci flow, published in the same year, have a result in common, obtained by very distinct methods: any simply-connected compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature is diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere./nIn the geometry of submanifolds, both the extrinsic and intrinsic geometries are significant. These are reflected by the intrinsic Riemannian metric and the second fundamental form. Many geometers have considered the phenomena which arise from restricting these data to some form of constancy. This includes as special cases the problems of minimal surfaces, constant mean curvature, and submanifolds whose metric has constant scalar curvature./nOutside of the setting of submanifold rigidity problems, Yau was able to adapt J\u00fcrgen Moser's method of proving Caccioppoli inequalities, thereby proving new rigidity results for functions on complete Riemannian manifolds. A particularly famous result of his says that a subharmonic function cannot be both positive and Lp integrable unless it is constant.[Y76][47][60] Similarly, on a complete K\u00e4hler manifold, a holomorphic function cannot be Lp integrable unless it is constant.[Y76]/nThe Minkowski problem of classical differential geometry can be viewed as the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature. In the 1950s, Louis Nirenberg and Aleksei Pogorelov resolved the problem for two-dimensional surfaces, making use of recent progress on the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation for two-dimensional domains. By the 1970s, higher-dimensional understanding of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation was still lacking. In 1976, Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau resolved the Minkowski problem in general dimensions via the method of continuity, making use of fully geometric estimates instead of the theory of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation.[CY76b][61]/nAs a consequence of their resolution of the Minkowski problem, Cheng and Yau were able to make progress on the understanding of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation.[CY77a] The key observation is that the Legendre transform of a solution of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation has its graph's Gaussian curvature prescribed by a simple formula depending on the \"right-hand side\" of the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation. As a consequence, they were able to prove the general solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation, which at the time had been a major open question except for two-dimensional domains.[61]/nCheng and Yau's papers followed some ideas presented in 1971 by Pogorelov, although his publicly available works (at the time of Cheng and Yau's work) had lacked some significant detail.[62] Pogorelov also published a more detailed version of his original ideas, and the resolutions of the problems are commonly attributed to both Cheng\u2013Yau and Pogorelov.[63][61] The approaches of Cheng\u2212Yau and Pogorelov are no longer commonly seen in the literature on the Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation, as other authors, notably Luis Caffarelli, Nirenberg, and Joel Spruck, have developed direct techniques which yield more powerful results, and which do not require the auxiliary use of the Minkowski problem.[63]/nAffine spheres are naturally described by solutions of certain Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equations, so that their full understanding is significantly more complicated than that of Euclidean spheres, the latter not being based on partial differential equations. In the parabolic case, affine spheres were completely classified as paraboloids by successive work of Konrad J\u00f6rgens, Eugenio Calabi, and Pogorelov. The elliptic affine spheres were identified as ellipsoids by Calabi. The hyperbolic affine spheres exhibit more complicated phenomena. Cheng and Yau proved that they are asymptotic to convex cones, and conversely that every (uniformly) convex cone corresponds in such a way to some hyperbolic affine sphere.[CY86] They were also able to provide new proofs of the previous classifications of Calabi and J\u00f6rgens\u2013Calabi\u2013Pogorelov.[61][64]/nA Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is a compact K\u00e4hler manifold which is Ricci-flat; as a special case of Yau's verification of the Calabi conjecture, such manifolds are known to exist.[Y78a] Mirror symmetry, which is a proposal developed by theoretical physicists dating from the late 1980s, postulates that Calabi\u2212Yau manifolds of complex dimension three can be grouped into pairs which share certain characteristics, such as Euler and Hodge numbers. Based on this conjectural picture, the physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes proposed a formula of enumerative geometry which encodes the number of rational curves of any fixed degree in a general quintic hypersurface of four-dimensional complex projective space. Bong Lian, Kefeng Liu, and Yau gave a rigorous proof that this formula holds.[LLY97] A year earlier, Alexander Givental had published a proof of the mirror formulas; according to Lian, Liu, and Yau, the details of his proof were only successfully filled in following their own publication.[25] The proofs of Givental and Lian\u2013Liu\u2013Yau have some overlap but are distinct approaches to the problem, and each have since been given textbook expositions.[65][66]/nThe works of Givental and of Lian\u2212Liu\u2212Yau confirm a prediction made by the more fundamental mirror symmetry conjecture of how three-dimensional Calabi\u2212Yau manifolds can be paired off. However, their works do not logically depend on the conjecture itself, and so have no immediate bearing on its validity. With Andrew Strominger and Eric Zaslow, Yau proposed a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry might be systematically understood and proved to be true.[SYZ96] Their idea is that a Calabi\u2212Yau manifold with complex dimension three should be foliated by special Lagrangian tori, which are certain types of three-dimensional minimal submanifolds of the six-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlying the Calabi\u2212Yau structure. Mirror manifolds would then be characterized, in terms of this conjectural structure, by having dual foliations. The Strominger\u2212Yau\u2212Zaslow (SYZ) proposal has been modified and developed in various ways since 1996. The conceptual picture that it provides has had a significant influence in the study of mirror symmetry, and research on its various aspects is currently an active field. It can be contrasted with the alternative homological mirror symmetry proposal by Maxim Kontsevich. The viewpoint of the SYZ conjecture is on geometric phenomena in Calabi\u2013Yau spaces, while Kontsevich's conjecture abstracts the problem to deal with purely algebraic structures and category theory.[32][39][65][66]/nIn one of Yau's earliest papers, written with Blaine Lawson, a number of fundamental results were found on the topology of closed Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive curvature.[LY72] Their flat torus theorem characterizes the existence of a flat and totally geodesic immersed torus in terms of the algebra of the fundamental group. The splitting theorem says that the splitting of the fundamental group as a maximally noncommutative direct product implies the isometric splitting of the manifold itself. Similar results were obtained at the same time by Detlef Gromoll and Joseph Wolf.[67][68] Their results have been extended to the broader context of isometric group actions on metric spaces of nonpositive curvature.[69]/nJeff Cheeger and Yau studied the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold. They established the special case of Riemannian metrics for which geodesic spheres have constant mean curvature, which they proved to be characterized by radial symmetry of the heat kernel.[CY81] Specializing to rotationally symmetric metrics, they used the exponential map to transplant the heat kernel to a geodesic ball on a general Riemannian manifold. Under the assumption that the symmetric \"model\" space under-estimates the Ricci curvature of the manifold itself, they carried out a direct calculation showing that the resulting function is a subsolution of the heat equation. As a consequence, they obtained a lower estimate of the heat kernel on a general Riemannian manifold in terms of lower bounds on its Ricci curvature.[70][71] In the special case of nonnegative Ricci curvature, Peter Li and Yau were able to use their gradient estimates to amplify and improve the Cheeger\u2212Yau estimate.[LY86][47]/nA well-known result of Yau's, obtained independently by Calabi, shows that any noncompact Riemannian manifold of nonnegative Ricci curvature must have volume growth of at least a linear rate.[Y76][47] A second proof, using the Bishop\u2013Gromov inequality instead of function theory, was later found by Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, and Michael Taylor./nGiven a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary, spectral geometry studies the eigenvalues of the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator, which in the case that the manifold has a boundary is coupled with a choice of boundary condition, usually Dirichlet or Neumann conditions. Paul Yang and Yau showed that in the case of a closed two-dimensional manifold, the first eigenvalue is bounded above by an explicit formula depending only on the genus and volume of the manifold.[YY80][41] Earlier, Yau had modified Jeff Cheeger's analysis of the Cheeger constant so as to be able to estimate the first eigenvalue from below in terms of geometric data.[Y75a][72]/nIn the 1910s, Hermann Weyl showed that, in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions on a smooth and bounded open subset of the plane, the eigenvalues have an asymptotic behavior which is dictated entirely by the area contained in the region. His result is known as Weyl's law. In 1960, George P\u00f3lya conjectured that the Weyl law actually gives control of each individual eigenvalue, and not only of their asymptotic distribution. Li and Yau proved a weakened version of P\u00f3lya's conjecture, obtaining control of the averages of the eigenvalues by the expression in the Weyl law.[LY83][73]/nIn 1980, Li and Yau identified a number of new inequalities for Laplace\u2013Beltrami eigenvalues, all based on the maximum principle and the differential Harnack estimates as pioneered five years earlier by Yau and Cheng\u2212Yau.[LY80] Their result on lower bounds based on geometric data is particularly well-known,[74][51][47] and was the first of its kind to not require any conditional assumptions.[75] Around the same time, a similar inequality was obtained by isoperimetric methods by Mikhael Gromov, although his result is weaker than Li and Yau's.[70] In collaboration with Isadore Singer, Bun Wong, and Shing-Toung Yau, Yau used the Li\u2013Yau methodology to establish a gradient estimate for the quotient of the first two eigenfunctions.[S+85] Analogously to Yau's integration of gradient estimates to find Harnack inequalities, they were able to integrate their gradient estimate to obtain control of the fundamental gap, which is the difference between the first two eigenvalues. The work of Singer\u2013Wong\u2013Yau\u2013Yau initiated a series of works by various authors in which new estimates on the fundamental gap were found and improved.[76]/nIn 1982, Yau identified fourteen problems of interest in spectral geometry, including the above P\u00f3lya conjecture.[Y82b] A particular conjecture of Yau's, on the control of the size of level sets of eigenfunctions by the value of the corresponding eigenvalue, was resolved by Alexander Logunov and Eugenia Malinnikova, who were awarded the 2017 Clay Research Award in part for their work.[77]/nXianfeng Gu and Yau considered the numerical computation of conformal maps between two-dimensional manifolds (presented as discretized meshes), and in particular the computation of uniformizing maps as predicted by the uniformization theorem. In the case of genus-zero surfaces, a map is conformal if and only if it is harmonic, and so Gu and Yau are able to compute conformal maps by direct minimization of a discretized Dirichlet energy.[GY02] In the case of higher genus, the uniformizing maps are computed from their gradients, as determined from the Hodge theory of closed and harmonic 1-forms.[GY02] The main work is thus to identify numerically effective discretizations of the classical theory. Their approach is sufficiently flexible to deal with general surfaces with boundary.[GY03][78] With Tony Chan, Paul Thompson, and Yalin Wang, Gu and Yau applied their work to the problem of matching two brain surfaces, which is an important issue in medical imaging. In the most-relevant genus-zero case, conformal maps are only well-defined up to the action of the M\u00f6bius group. By further optimizing a Dirichlet-type energy which measures the mismatch of brain landmarks such as the central sulcus, they obtained mappings which are well-defined by such neurological features.[G+04]/nIn the field of graph theory, Fan Chung and Yau extensively developed analogues of notions and results from Riemannian geometry. These results on differential Harnack inequalities, Sobolev inequalities, and heat kernel analysis, found partly in collaboration with Ronald Graham and Alexander Grigor'yan, were later written into textbook form as the last few chapters of her well-known book \"Spectral Graph Theory\".[79] Later, they introduced a Green's function as defined for graphs, amounting to a pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian.[CY00] Their work is naturally applicable to the study of hitting times for random walks and related topics.[80][81]/nIn the interest of finding general graph-theoretic contexts for their results, Chung and Yau introduced a notion of Ricci-flatness of a graph.[79] A more flexible notion of Ricci curvature, dealing with Markov chains on metric spaces, was later introduced by Yann Ollivier. Yong Lin, Linyuan Lu, and Yau developed some of the basic theory of Ollivier's definition in the special context of graph theory, considering for instance the Ricci curvature of Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs.[LLY11] Lin and Yau also considered the curvature\u2013dimension inequalities introduced earlier by Dominique Bakry and Michel \u00c9mery, relating it and Ollivier's curvature to Chung\u2013Yau's notion of Ricci-flatness.[LY10] They were further able to prove general lower bounds on Bakry\u2013\u00c9mery and Ollivier's curvatures in the case of locally finite graphs.[82]/nYau has received honorary professorships from many Chinese universities, including Hunan Normal University, Peking University, Nankai University, and Tsinghua University.

He was born in Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Republic of Ragusa, where he was first schooled. He moved to Rome by the order of his uncle, a vicar general of Ragusa, Petar Benessa. In Rome and in Bologna he studied philosophy, theology, law and mathematics. His mathematics professor in Rome was Bonaventura Cavalieri and in Bologna his mathematics professor was Benedetto Castelli. He became a priest in 1643, the year he returned home and soon became abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Cosmas and Damian on the island of Pa\u0161man, canon of cathedral choir in Ragusa and Ragusan deputy Archbishop. After a private trip to Rome he remained there until his death as the official diplomatic representative of the Republic of Ragusa to the Holy See.

He cooperated with the historian Joannes Lucius in defending the honor and reputation of their native country of unjust attacks of some Italian and French writers, translated classical authors, wrote a biography of the Ragusan writer Junije Palmoti\u0107 and a poem about the earthquake in Ragusa. In the literary and scientific circle of pope Alexander VII and Queen Christina of Sweden Gradi\u0107 discussed scientific and philosophical issues.[1]/nHis philosophical works are written in the spirit of Aristotelianism and scholasticism. Gradi\u0107 was a member of the Royal Academy in Padua, having correspondence with many notable Europeans. He described the disastrous earthquake in Ragusa in 1667 in Latin verses and organized help from all over Europe for the devastated city.[1]/nAlong with philosophy, he engaged in mathematics, physics, astronomy, literature and diplomacy. In mathematics, he dealt with Galileo's paradox. This work went unnoticed and was even unknown to Roger Joseph Boscovich who was a professor of mathematics at the Collegium Romanum where a century before Gradi\u0107 had been an alumnus. In his only printed mathematical treatise De loco Galilaei quo punctum lineae aequale pronuntiat published in the collection Dissertationes physico-mathematicae quatuor he disputed the concept of indivisible and developed a series of ideas en route to infinitesimal method.[3][4][5] He was solving many mathematical problems which are left in his own inheritance and correspondence with other mathematicians as well, including those of Ghetaldus such as the first problem from Ghetaldus' work Apollonius redivivus.

After the intervention of Laurent Schwartz, Baouendi was allowed to return to France for his graduate studies.[3] He completed a doctorate in 1967 from the University of Paris-Sud (then part of the University of Paris), under the supervision of Bernard Malgrange, with a dissertation concerning elliptic operators.[4] Schwartz attempted to secure for him a suitable academic position in Tunis, in which he would be allowed to conduct research and collaborate with mathematicians from other countries,[3] and Baouendi became an associate professor at Tunis University in 1968, but his administrative struggles there were too much, and he left in 1970.

Further explanation is provided under Beth definability./nBeth's most famous contribution to formal logic is semantic tableaux, which are decision procedures for propositional logic and first-order logic. It is a semantic method\u2014like Wittgenstein's truth tables or J. Alan Robinson's resolution\u2014as opposed to the proof of theorems in a formal system, such as the axiomatic systems employed by Frege, Russell and Whitehead, and Hilbert, or even Gentzen's natural deduction.  Semantic tableaux are an effective decision procedure for propositional logic, whereas they are only semi-effective for first-order logic, since first-order logic is undecidable, as showed by Church's theorem. This method is considered by many to be intuitively simple, particularly for students who are not acquainted with the study of logic, and it is faster than the truth-table method (which requires a table with 2n rows for a sentence with n propositional letters). For these reasons, Wilfrid Hodges for example presents semantic tableaux in his introductory textbook, Logic, and Melvin Fitting does the same in his presentation of first-order logic for computer scientists, First-order logic and automated theorem proving./nOne starts out with the intention of proving that a certain set \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma \\,}\n\n of formulae entail another formula \n\n\n\n\u03c6\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varphi \\,}\n\n, given a set of rules determined by the semantics of the formulae's connectives (and quantifiers, in first-order logic).

In recent times his research was on quantum groups and non-commutative geometry, subjects of importance both for mathematics and physics. He authored more than 70 original mathematical papers, singly or with colleagues in Ireland, Europe and North America. He will also be remembered for his book, C*-algebras and Operator Theory, which was published in 1990 to worldwide acclaim./nGerard's principal interests were in the general theory of C*-algebras, the spectral and index theory of Toeplitz operators on Hardy spaces of ordered groups and bounded symmetric domains, and the C*-algebra approach to quantum groups.[1]/nRoyal Irish Academy: He was a member of the Publications Committee of the Royal Irish Academy and Editor-in-Chief of the Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

He came from a large family of 3 boys and 5 girls: John, Derek, Rita, Linda, Joan, Carol and Lauren. Gerard left school at 14 and worked in a variety of menial jobs, but all the while continued to educate himself at home with quiet determination./nGerard worked his way into Trinity College, Dublin on the strength of his performance on a correspondence course. In 1970 he was admitted to Trinity College and read for a degree in pure mathematics. His brilliant undergraduate career in Trinity College meant that he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to support his studies. In 1974 he graduated with a First Class Honours BA, and he won the Berkeley Gold Medal. His success at Trinity marked him out as something special, and he was soon after awarded the Gulbenkian Scholarship to enable him to study for a PhD in Cambridge University. He acquired this in 1977 and won the Knight Prize for the quality of his research./nHe returned to Trinity College in 1977 and took up a postdoctoral research fellowship, funded by the Department of Education and he commenced his career as a university lecturer. He then spent four years in North America in Dalhousie University, University of New Hampshire and University of Oregon.

He died peacefully at 57 and is survived by his wife Mary, one son and three daughters, his mother and siblings./nProfessor Richard Timoney of Trinity College Dublin, in his contribution to the book Trevor West: The Bold Collegian about the multi-talented Trevor West, wrote the following remembrance of Gerard: \nAmong the students he (Trevor) had, some were deserving of his particular interest ever after. One of those was Gerard Murphy (1948 - 2006) who was not a Ph.D. student of Trevor's but had a close relationship with him. Gerard came from a working-class background in Dublin and missed out on a normal secondary education, but came to the notice of the School of Mathematics in Trinity. Trevor took a special interest in him, and was pleased that Gerard turned out as a very good undergraduate in Mathematics. Gerard did\nhis doctorate at Cambridge, not with Trevor's supervisor Smithies but with one of Smithies' mathematical descendants, finishing in 1977. Then he got a postdoctoral fellowship back at Trinity, where he worked productively with Trevor. Following three years at TCD, Gerard held some positions in North America before being appointed in Cork, where he was again within close reach of Trevor from the West family home in Midleton. Trevor encouraged Gerard to organise international research meetings in Cork, of which there were quite a few, and Trevor was always in the thick of them./nAmong the several joint papers between Murphy and West, Finbarr Holland picks out a spectral radius formula for special mention in an obituary of Gerard that appeared in the Bulletin of the Irish Mathematical Society (no. 59, 2007). It is a particularly elegant formula for the spectral radius of an element in a C*-algebra that was published in a paper in the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1979. Gerard was elected to membership of the RIA and became editor of the Mathematical Proceedings, both of which events were surely engineered by Trevor. As with many things, Trevor would not miss opportunities to plug his favourites and the considerable merits of Gerard were easy to extol, but of course Gerard's terminal illness was a blow. Maybe the most notable joint effort between them was Trevor's second mathematical monograph, often referred to as \u2018the little red book\u2019, which was a joint effort between four authors, Bruce Barnes of Oregon, Gerard Murphy, Roger Smyth (former doctoral student) and Trevor. The book appeared in 1982 and has a lasting value that is really noteworthy. It is not so much that the overall thrust of the book is still current, but rather that there are definitions and lemmas in it that remain useful and are not available elsewhere./nRoger Smyth was the first of Trevor's two Ph.D. students and Trevor always spoke enthusiastically about their work together, which spanned many years. Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and so did his Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters. In a different way, Alastair Gillespie was well placed in Edinburgh where there were rugby matches to attend every now and again, while the Cork connection with Gerard was a different kind of overlap of interests. By the way, the collaboration with Rien Kaashoek did not seem to have any similar coincidence but they did travel often between Dublin and Amsterdam to collaborate. Rainer Nagel of T\u00fcbingen was also a close contact of Trevor's but not a co-author./nWith regard to the red book, actually entitled Riesz and Fredholm Theory in Banach Algebras and published by Pitman in 1982, Roger Smyth credits Trevor with being the mastermind and driving force behind the book. For instance, Trevor would have been the host for Bruce Barnes during his sabbatical year in Trinity (1979- 0) and Roger also recalls Trevor deciding rather late on that a significant section of the book was not written in the \u2018right way\u2019 and coming up with a new and clearer approach during the final\nstages of preparation. It seems Trevor also did the management work such as dealing with the publisher and managing the production of the camera- ready copy (in those days using a typist with a golf ball typewriter). Roger's influence on the book is quite clearly related to his doctoral work and subsequent work with Trevor, Bruce Barnes\u2019 research at the time was also close to the topics discussed and perhaps Gerard was more interested in the parts where C*-algebras enter. It is appropriate to quote the last paragraph from\nthe Mathematical Review of the book:/n\u2018The aim of the authors is \u201cto highlight the interplay between algebra and spectral theory which emerges in any penetrating analysis of compact, Riesz and Fredholm operators on Banach spaces\u201d. Their little book proves, among other things, that they have fully (and beautifully) achieved this aim.\u2019/nPossibly an important contribution from Gerard Murphy to the book, or maybe something he picked up while engaged in it, was a facility for explaining things particularly well. Later, in 1990, Gerard published a book called C*-algebras and operator theory (Academic Press) which has remained a standard reference. It covers the basics of the theory but also dips in to the more advanced and modern aspects in such a way that many new students of C*-algebras continue to fnd it a valuable introduction, preferable for the beginner to many fatter and more encyclopedic volumes./nThis remembrance was added on the eleventh anniversary of Gerard's death by Carol Murphy, Gerard's sister, with permission from Dr Timoney and Maura Lee West (author) The Bold Collegian./nC*-Algebras and Operator Theory/nThis book has become a standard textbook in many countries, and is often cited as a reference in research articles.

Instead of the metonic cycle, they proposed to simply use the true astronomic calculation for the full moon dates to determine Paschal Full Moon. Furthermore, they pointed out that the true astronomic March equinox and full moons, on which the whole calculation of the Easter date and thus other Church holidays was based, would occur at different times, sometimes even different dates in places at different longitudes around the globe, leading to Church holidays falling on different days in different places.

John von Neumann was his assistant. At the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Hilbert was surrounded by a social circle of some of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century, such as Emmy Noether and Alonzo Church./nAmong his 69 Ph.D. students in G\u00f6ttingen were many who later became famous mathematicians, including (with date of thesis): Otto Blumenthal (1898), Felix Bernstein (1901), Hermann Weyl (1908), Richard Courant (1910), Erich Hecke (1910), Hugo Steinhaus (1911), and Wilhelm Ackermann (1925).[13] Between 1902 and 1939 Hilbert was editor of the Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1907.[14]/nIn 1892, Hilbert married K\u00e4the Jerosch (1864\u20131945), who was the daughter of a K\u00f6nigsberg merchant, \"an outspoken young lady with an independence of mind that matched [Hilbert's].\"[15] While at K\u00f6nigsberg they had their one child, Franz Hilbert\u00a0[de] (1893\u20131969).\nFranz suffered throughout his life from mental illness, and after he was admitted into a psychiatric clinic, Hilbert said, \"From now on, I must consider myself as not having a son.\" His attitude toward Franz brought K\u00e4the considerable sorrow.[16]/nHilbert considered the mathematician Hermann Minkowski to be his \"best and truest friend\".[17]/nHilbert was baptized and raised a Calvinist in the Prussian Evangelical Church.[a] He later left the Church and became an agnostic.[b] He also argued that mathematical truth was independent of the existence of God or other a priori assumptions.[c][d] When Galileo Galilei was criticized for failing to stand up for his convictions on the Heliocentric theory, Hilbert objected: \"But [Galileo] was not an idiot. Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom; that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in due time.\"[e]/nLike Albert Einstein, Hilbert had closest contacts with the Berlin Group whose leading founders had studied under Hilbert in G\u00f6ttingen (Kurt Grelling, Hans Reichenbach and Walter Dubislav).[18]/nAround 1925, Hilbert developed pernicious anemia, a then-untreatable vitamin deficiency whose primary symptom is exhaustion; his assistant Eugene Wigner described him as subject to \"enormous fatigue\" and how he \"seemed quite old,\" and that even after eventually being diagnosed and treated, he \"was hardly a scientist after 1925, and certainly not a Hilbert.\"[19]/nHilbert was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1932.[20]/nHilbert lived to see the Nazis purge many of the prominent faculty members at University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1933.[21] Those forced out included Hermann Weyl (who had taken Hilbert's chair when he retired in 1930), Emmy Noether and Edmund Landau. One who had to leave Germany, Paul Bernays, had collaborated with Hilbert in mathematical logic, and co-authored with him the important book [22]Grundlagen der Mathematik (which eventually appeared in two volumes, in 1934 and 1939). This was a sequel to the Hilbert\u2013Ackermann book Principles of Mathematical Logic from 1928. Hermann Weyl's successor was Helmut Hasse./nAbout a year later, Hilbert attended a banquet and was seated next to the new Minister of Education, Bernhard Rust. Rust asked whether \"the Mathematical Institute really suffered so much because of the departure of the Jews.\" Hilbert replied, \"Suffered? It doesn't exist any longer, does it?\"[23][24]/nBy the time Hilbert died in 1943, the Nazis had nearly completely restaffed the university, as many of the former faculty had either been Jewish or married to Jews. Hilbert's funeral was attended by fewer than a dozen people, only two of whom were fellow academics, among them Arnold Sommerfeld, a theoretical physicist and also a native of K\u00f6nigsberg.[25] News of his death only became known to the wider world several months after he died.[26]/nThe epitaph on his tombstone in G\u00f6ttingen consists of the famous lines he spoke at the conclusion of his retirement address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians on 8 September 1930. The words were given in response to the Latin maxim: \"Ignoramus et ignorabimus\" or \"We do not know and we shall not know\":[27]/nWir m\u00fcssen wissen.\nWir werden wissen./nWe must know.\nWe shall know./nThe day before Hilbert pronounced these phrases at the 1930 annual meeting of the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, Kurt G\u00f6del\u2014in a round table discussion during the Conference on Epistemology held jointly with the Society meetings\u2014tentatively announced the first expression of his incompleteness theorem.[f] G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems show that even elementary axiomatic systems such as Peano arithmetic are either self-contradicting or contain logical propositions that are impossible to prove or disprove within that system./nHilbert's first work on invariant functions led him to the demonstration in 1888 of his famous finiteness theorem. Twenty years earlier, Paul Gordan had demonstrated the theorem of the finiteness of generators for binary forms using a complex computational approach. Attempts to generalize his method to functions with more than two variables failed because of the enormous difficulty of the calculations involved. To solve what had become known in some circles as Gordan's Problem, Hilbert realized that it was necessary to take a completely different path. As a result, he demonstrated Hilbert's basis theorem, showing the existence of a finite set of generators, for the invariants of quantics in any number of variables, but in an abstract form. That is, while demonstrating the existence of such a set, it was not a constructive proof\u2014it did not display \"an object\"\u2014but rather, it was an existence proof[28] and relied on use of the law of excluded middle in an infinite extension./nHilbert sent his results to the Mathematische Annalen. Gordan, the house expert on the theory of invariants for the Mathematische Annalen, could not appreciate the revolutionary nature of Hilbert's theorem and rejected the article, criticizing the exposition because it was insufficiently comprehensive. His comment was:/nDas ist nicht Mathematik. Das ist Theologie./nThis is not Mathematics. This is Theology.[29]/nKlein, on the other hand, recognized the importance of the work, and guaranteed that it would be published without any alterations. Encouraged by Klein, Hilbert extended his method in a second article, providing estimations on the maximum degree of the minimum set of generators, and he sent it once more to the Annalen. After having read the manuscript, Klein wrote to him, saying:/nWithout doubt this is the most important work on general algebra that the Annalen has ever published.[30]/nLater, after the usefulness of Hilbert's method was universally recognized, Gordan himself would say:/nI have convinced myself that even theology has its merits.[31]/nFor all his successes, the nature of his proof created more trouble than Hilbert could have imagined. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that \"many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea\"\u2014in other words (to quote Reid): \"Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction\"; \"the proof\" (i.e. the symbols on the page) was \"the object\".[31] Not all were convinced. While Kronecker would die soon afterwards, his constructivist philosophy would continue with the young Brouwer and his developing intuitionist \"school\", much to Hilbert's torment in his later years.[32] Indeed, Hilbert would lose his \"gifted pupil\" Weyl to intuitionism\u2014\"Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker\".[33] Brouwer the intuitionist in particular opposed the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had used it). Hilbert responded:/nTaking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.[34]/nThe text Grundlagen der Geometrie (tr.: Foundations of Geometry) published by Hilbert in 1899 proposes a formal set, called Hilbert's axioms, substituting for the traditional axioms of Euclid. They avoid weaknesses identified in those of Euclid, whose works at the time were still used textbook-fashion. It is difficult to specify the axioms used by Hilbert without referring to the publication history of the Grundlagen since Hilbert changed and modified them several times. The original monograph was quickly followed by a French translation, in which Hilbert added V.2, the Completeness Axiom. An English translation, authorized by Hilbert, was made by E.J. Townsend and copyrighted in 1902.[35][36] This translation incorporated the changes made in the French translation and so is considered to be a translation of the 2nd edition. Hilbert continued to make changes in the text and several editions appeared in German. The 7th edition was the last to appear in Hilbert's lifetime. New editions followed the 7th, but the main text was essentially not revised.[g]/nHilbert's approach signaled the shift to the modern axiomatic method. In this, Hilbert was anticipated by Moritz Pasch's work from 1882.  Axioms are not taken as self-evident truths. Geometry may treat things, about which we have powerful intuitions, but it is not necessary to assign any explicit meaning to the undefined concepts. The elements, such as point, line, plane, and others, could be substituted, as Hilbert is reported to have said to Schoenflies and K\u00f6tter, by tables, chairs, glasses of beer and other such objects.[37] It is their defined relationships that are discussed./nHilbert first enumerates the undefined concepts: point, line, plane, lying on (a relation between points and lines, points and planes, and lines and planes), betweenness, congruence of pairs of points (line segments), and congruence of angles. The axioms unify both the plane geometry and solid geometry of Euclid in a single system./nHilbert put forth the most influential list consisting of 23 unsolved problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. This is generally reckoned as the most successful and deeply considered compilation of open problems ever to be produced by an individual mathematician.[by whom?]/nAfter re-working the foundations of classical geometry, Hilbert could have extrapolated to the rest of mathematics. His approach differed, however, from the later \"foundationalist\" Russell\u2013Whitehead or \"encyclopedist\" Nicolas Bourbaki, and from his contemporary Giuseppe Peano. The mathematical community as a whole could engage in problems of which he had identified as crucial aspects of important areas of mathematics./nThe problem set was launched as a talk \"The Problems of Mathematics\" presented during the course of the Second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris. The introduction of the speech that Hilbert gave said:/nWho among us would not be happy to lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come? What will be the ends toward which the spirit of future generations of mathematicians will tend? What methods, what new facts will the new century reveal in the vast and rich field of mathematical thought?[38]/nHe presented fewer than half the problems at the Congress, which were published in the acts of the Congress. In a subsequent publication, he extended the panorama, and arrived at the formulation of the now-canonical 23 Problems of Hilbert. See also Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem. The full text is important, since the exegesis of the questions still can be a matter of inevitable debate, whenever it is asked how many have been solved./nSome of these were solved within a short time. Others have been discussed throughout the 20th century, with a few now taken to be unsuitably open-ended to come to closure. Some continue to remain challenges./nIn an account that had become standard by the mid-century, Hilbert's problem set was also a kind of manifesto that opened the way for the development of the formalist school, one of three major schools of mathematics of the 20th century. According to the formalist, mathematics is manipulation of symbols according to agreed upon formal rules. It is therefore an autonomous activity of thought. There is, however, room to doubt whether Hilbert's own views were simplistically formalist in this sense./nIn 1920, Hilbert proposed a research project in metamathematics that became known as Hilbert's program. He wanted mathematics to be formulated on a solid and complete logical foundation. He believed that in principle this could be done by showing that:/nHe seems to have had both technical and philosophical reasons for formulating this proposal. It affirmed his dislike of what had become known as the ignorabimus, still an active issue in his time in German thought, and traced back in that formulation to Emil du Bois-Reymond./nThis program is still recognizable in the most popular philosophy of mathematics, where it is usually called formalism. For example, the Bourbaki group adopted a watered-down and selective version of it as adequate to the requirements of their twin projects of (a) writing encyclopedic foundational works, and (b) supporting the axiomatic method as a research tool. This approach has been successful and influential in relation with Hilbert's work in algebra and functional analysis, but has failed to engage in the same way with his interests in physics and logic./nHilbert wrote in 1919:/nWe are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules.  Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.[39]/nHilbert published his views on the foundations of mathematics in the 2-volume work, Grundlagen der Mathematik./nHilbert and the mathematicians who worked with him in his enterprise were committed to the project. His attempt to support axiomatized mathematics with definitive principles, which could banish theoretical uncertainties, ended in failure./nG\u00f6del demonstrated that any non-contradictory formal system, which was comprehensive enough to include at least arithmetic, cannot demonstrate its completeness by way of its own axioms. In 1931 his incompleteness theorem showed that Hilbert's grand plan was impossible as stated. The second point cannot in any reasonable way be combined with the first point, as long as the axiom system is genuinely finitary./nNevertheless, the subsequent achievements of proof theory at the very least clarified consistency as it relates to theories of central concern to mathematicians. Hilbert's work had started logic on this course of clarification; the need to understand G\u00f6del's work then led to the development of recursion theory and then mathematical logic as an autonomous discipline in the 1930s. The basis for later theoretical computer science, in the work of Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, also grew directly out of this \"debate\".[40]/nAround 1909, Hilbert dedicated himself to the study of differential and integral equations; his work had direct consequences for important parts of modern functional analysis. In order to carry out these studies, Hilbert introduced the concept of an infinite dimensional Euclidean space, later called Hilbert space. His work in this part of analysis provided the basis for important contributions to the mathematics of physics in the next two decades, though from an unanticipated direction. Later on, Stefan Banach amplified the concept, defining Banach spaces. Hilbert spaces are an important class of objects in the area of functional analysis, particularly of the spectral theory of self-adjoint linear operators, that grew up around it during the 20th century./nUntil 1912, Hilbert was almost exclusively a pure mathematician. When planning a visit from Bonn, where he was immersed in studying physics, his fellow mathematician and friend Hermann Minkowski joked he had to spend 10\u00a0days in quarantine before being able to visit Hilbert. In fact, Minkowski seems responsible for most of Hilbert's physics investigations prior to 1912, including their joint seminar on the subject in 1905./nIn 1912, three years after his friend's death, Hilbert turned his focus to the subject almost exclusively. He arranged to have a \"physics tutor\" for himself.[41] He started studying kinetic gas theory and moved on to elementary radiation theory and the molecular theory of matter. Even after the war started in 1914, he continued seminars and classes where the works of Albert Einstein and others were followed closely./nBy 1907, Einstein had framed the fundamentals of the theory of gravity, but then struggled for nearly 8\u00a0years to put the theory into its final form.[42] By early summer\u00a01915, Hilbert's interest in physics had focused on general relativity, and he invited Einstein to G\u00f6ttingen to deliver a week of lectures on the subject.[43] Einstein received an enthusiastic reception at G\u00f6ttingen.[44] Over the summer, Einstein learned that Hilbert was also working on the field equations and redoubled his own efforts. During November\u00a01915, Einstein published several papers culminating in The Field Equations of Gravitation (see Einstein field equations).[h] Nearly simultaneously, Hilbert published \"The Foundations of Physics\", an axiomatic derivation of the field equations (see Einstein\u2013Hilbert action). Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.[i] See more at priority./nAdditionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. His work was a key aspect of Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann's work on the mathematical equivalence of Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation, and his namesake Hilbert space plays an important part in quantum theory. In 1926, von\u00a0Neumann showed that, if quantum states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, they would correspond with both Schr\u00f6dinger's wave function theory and Heisenberg's matrices.[j]/nThroughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics. While highly dependent on higher mathematics, physicists tended to be \"sloppy\" with it. To a pure mathematician like Hilbert, this was both ugly, and difficult to understand. As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found \u2013 most importantly in the area of integral equations. When his colleague Richard Courant wrote the now classic Methoden der mathematischen Physik (Methods of Mathematical Physics) including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing. Hilbert said \"Physics is too hard for physicists\", implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them./nHilbert unified the field of algebraic number theory with his 1897 treatise Zahlbericht (literally \"report on numbers\"). He also resolved a significant number-theory problem formulated by Waring in 1770.  As with the finiteness theorem, he used an existence proof that shows there must be solutions for the problem rather than providing a mechanism to produce the answers.[45] He then had little more to publish on the subject; but the emergence of Hilbert modular forms in the dissertation of a student means his name is further attached to a major area./nHe made a series of conjectures on class field theory. The concepts were highly influential, and his own contribution lives on in the names of the Hilbert class field and of the Hilbert symbol of local class field theory. Results were mostly proved by 1930, after work by Teiji Takagi.[k]/nHilbert did not work in the central areas of analytic number theory, but his name has become known for the Hilbert\u2013P\u00f3lya conjecture, for reasons that are anecdotal./nHis collected works (Gesammelte Abhandlungen) have been published several times. The original versions of his papers contained \"many technical errors of varying degree\";[46] when the collection was first published, the errors were corrected and it was found that this could be done without major changes in the statements of the theorems, with one exception\u2014a claimed proof of the continuum hypothesis.[47][48] The errors were nonetheless so numerous and significant that it took Olga Taussky-Todd three years to make the corrections.[48]/nThe Hilberts had by this time [around 1902] left the Reformed Protestant Church in which they had been baptized and married. It was told in G\u00f6ttingen that when [David Hilbert's son] Franz had started to school he could not answer the question, \"What religion are you?\" (1970, p.\u00a091)", "66396274": "Maria Colombo (born 25 May 1989)[1] is an Italian mathematician specializing in mathematical analysis.

The Fuhrmann circle and the Fuhrmann triangle are named after him.[1]/nFuhrmann was born on 28 February 1833 in Burg bei Magdeburg. Fuhrmann had shortly worked as sailor before he returned to school and attended the Altstadt Gymnasium in K\u00f6nigsberg, where his teachers noticed his interest and talent in mathematics and geography. He graduated in 1853 and went on to study mathematics and physics at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. One of his peers later remembered him as the most talented and diligent student of his class. Fuhrmann however despite his talent did not pursue a career at the university, instead he became a math and science teacher at the Burgschule in K\u00f6nigsberg after his graduation. He joined the school in 1860 and remained there until his death in 1904.[2]/nFuhrmann authored several books and a number of papers on different mathematical subjects. Today he is best remembered for his interest in and contribution to elementary geometry. With Synthetische Beweise planimetrischer S\u00e4tze he wrote an influential book on the subject and in 1890 he published an article entitled Sur un nouveau cercle associ\u00e9 \u00e0 un triangle in the Belgian math journal Mathesis.

Highly reputed in his lifetime, he published little, but was an active private teacher of mathematics. He was also well connected in the English intellectual networks of the period.[1]/nHe was born in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. He was admitted scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1561; and graduated as M.A. in 1567. In 1571 he left his college and fellowship, and moved to Gloucester Hall.[1] He became known for his knowledge of antiquity, philosophy, and mathematics.[2]/nGloucester Hall suited Allen, a sympathiser at least with Catholicism, because there was no stringent religious observance required there; indeed there was no chapel in the Hall.[3] Allen's beliefs have been classified as \"church papist\", but also his posture as \"crypto-Catholic\": a Catholic faith combined with outward conformity to the Church of England.[4][5] He joined there his friends Edmund Reynolds, Miles Windsor, and George Napper, who had also left their colleges at a time of increasing religious tensions on Oxford; Napper was to be a Catholic martyr. Trinity shed six more of its Fellows within a few years.[6][7]/nAllen encouraged other scholars to migrate there, such as John Budden[8] and William Burton.[9] He had a wide range of pupils and followers: Kenelm Digby[3] and Brian Twyne[10] in natural philosophy, with Theodore Haak coming later.[11] The mathematical school of Allen included Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner,[12] and Sir John Davies (to whom Allen taught Catholic doctrine).[13]/nMathematical geography was an important topical subject in which Allen was reputed, pursued by several groups in England, including another around Henry Briggs: Allen may have taught the geographer Richard Hakluyt. He did teach Robert Fludd and Sir Thomas Aylesbury.[14] In the humanities there were Robert Hegge,[15] and William Fulbecke.[16] When the Camden Chair of Ancient History was being set up in the early 1620s, Allen successfully supported the candidacy of Degory Wheare with William Camden; and a few years later, in 1626, Wheare came to Gloucester Hall as Principal.[17]/nAllen died at Gloucester Hall./nAllen corresponded with Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland.[14] Northumberland invited Allen to visit, and he spent some time with the Syon House group around the Earl; he became acquainted with Thomas Harriot, John Dee, and other mathematicians. He also knew well Sir Robert Cotton, William Camden, and their antiquarian associates.[2] He pointed out the historian \u00c6thelweard (Fabius Quaestor) to Camden.[18]/nAllen was noted as astrologer to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, as Dee was for Queen Elizabeth.[19] Foster believes Allen probably met Leicester through Lady Paulet, wife of Hugh Paulet, n\u00e9e Elizabeth Blount, who was the widow of Sir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity College, Oxford.[20]/nThere is a surviving 62-page horoscope cast for the teenage Philip Sidney in the Ashmole manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, in the period 1570\u20132 when he was studying at Oxford, where Leicester was Chancellor, and it has been attributed to Allen; the case has also been made that it was by Dee. A link between the two is that Edward Kelley is said to have worked briefly for Allen.[21][22] Allen definitely cast a natal horoscope for Robert Pierrepont (1584), and cast also for William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, a later Chancellor of Oxford, in 1626.[23]/nAllen's skill in mathematics and astrology earned him the credit of being a magician. In an incident related in John Aubrey's Brief Lives, it was in a visit to Holme Lacy as the guest of Sir John Scudamore that the servants threw his ticking watch into the moat, thinking it the Devil.[24] The author of Leicester's Commonwealth accuses him of employing the art of \"figuring\" to further the earl of Leicester's unlawful designs, and of endeavouring by the \"black art\" to bring about a match between his patron and the Queen.[2] There Allen's name is coupled with Dee's as atheists, in a series of claims that Leicester found physicians and other lackeys for his evil-doing at Oxford and elsewhere.[25]/nAfter his death, funeral orations praising Allen were given by William Burton and George Bathurst (1610\u20131644).[26][27] Burton's retailed the story of how Leicester had offered a bishopric to Allen, who declined the offer. Allen in fact was, by choice, not in holy orders.[28]/nHe wrote a Latin commentary on the second and third books of Claudius Ptolemy of Pelusium, Concerning the Judgment of the Stars, or, as it is commonly called, Of the Quadripartite Construction, with an Exposition. He also wrote notes on John Bale's De Scriptoribus M. Britanniae.[2]/nAllen collected manuscripts relating to history, antiquity, astronomy and astrology, philosophy, and mathematics. At least 250 items from his library can still be traced.[1] He also acquired manuscripts from dissolved monasteries, such as Reading Abbey, for which his sources may have been Gerbrand Harkes, the Protestant dealer, and Clement Burdett.[29] While in Allen's possession, most of his manuscripts were unbound or had simple covers.[30]/nA considerable part of Allen's collection was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby, to whom it had been left:[2] over 200 manuscripts, which were rebound in calf. This bequest was strong in works by early English scientists, including Roger Bacon, Simon Bredon, John Eschenden, Robert Grosseteste, John Sharp, and Richard Wallingford. But Allen's library was in flux during his lifetime, as he lent or gave items, and was consulted by others. He was a significant supporter of Sir Thomas Bodley's effort to found the Library; and gave it a number of works. Some went to the Cottonian Library, presumably via Richard James. Sir Thomas Aylesbury, another former pupil,[14] was another one of Allen's major legatees.[31] The Cuthbert Gospel of St John, seen in his library by James Ussher, appears to have left his possession by 1622, as it is not in a catalogue of that date. Ussher wrote to Camden in 1606 of the help he had had from Allen's collection, consulting William of Malmesbury, and a papal bull from Giraldus Cambrensis via Johannes Rossus.[32]", "30711941": "Benjamin Donn or Donne (1729\u20131798) was an English mathematician./nDonn was born at Bideford, Devon, where his father and brother Abraham (1718\u20131746) kept a school.

As the head of a leading mathematical institute, Vinogradov enjoyed significant influence in the Academy of Sciences and was regarded as an informal leader of Soviet mathematicians, not always in a positive way: his anti-Semitic feelings led him to hinder the careers of many prominent Soviet mathematicians.[4]/nAlthough he was always faithful to the official line, he was never a member of the Communist Party and his overall mindset was nationalistic rather than communist. This can at least partly be attributed to his origins: his father was a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Vinogradov was enormously strong: in some recollections it is stated that he could lift a chair with a person sitting on it by holding the leg of the chair in his hands. He was never married and was very attached to his dacha in Abramtsevo, where he spent all his weekends and vacations (together with his sister Nadezhda, also unmarried) enjoying flower gardening.

March 1642 \u2013 December 5, 1708),[1] also known as Seki K\u014dwa (\u95a2 \u5b5d\u548c),[2] was a Japanese mathematician and author of the Edo period.[3]/nSeki laid foundations for the subsequent development of Japanese mathematics, known as wasan.[2] He has been described as \"Japan's Newton\".[4]/nHe created a new algebraic notation system and, motivated by astronomical computations, did work on infinitesimal calculus and Diophantine equations. Although he was a contemporary of German polymath mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and British polymath physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton, Seki's work was independent. His successors later developed a school dominant in Japanese mathematics until the end of the Edo period./nWhile it is not clear how much of the achievements of wasan are Seki's, since many of them appear only in writings of his pupils, some of the results parallel or anticipate those discovered in Europe.[5] For example, he is credited with the discovery of Bernoulli numbers.[6] The resultant and determinant (the first in 1683, the complete version no later than 1710) are attributed to him./nSeki also calculated the value of pi correct to the 10th decimal place, having used what is now called the Aitken's delta-squared process, rediscovered later by Alexander Aitken./nSeki has been influenced by Japanese mathematics books such as the Jink\u014dki.[7]/nNot much is known about Seki's personal life. His birthplace has been indicated as either Fujioka in Gunma Prefecture, or Edo. His birth date ranges from 1635 to 1643./nHe was born to the Uchiyama clan, a subject of Ko-shu han, and adopted into the Seki family, a subject of the sh\u014dgun. While in Ko-shu han, he was involved in a surveying project to produce a reliable map of his employer's land. He spent many years in studying 13th-century Chinese calendars to replace the less accurate one used in Japan at that time./nHis mathematics (and wasan as a whole) was based on mathematical knowledge accumulated from the 13th to 15th centuries.[8] The material in these works consisted of algebra with numerical methods, polynomial interpolation and its applications, and indeterminate integer equations. Seki's work is more or less based on and related to these known methods./nChinese algebraists discovered numerical evaluation (Horner's method, re-established by William George Horner in the 19th century) of arbitrary-degree algebraic equation with real coefficients. By using the Pythagorean theorem, they reduced geometric problems to algebra systematically. The number of unknowns in an equation was, however, quite limited. They used notations of an array of numbers to represent a formula; for example, \n\n\n\n(\na\n\u00a0\nb\n\u00a0\nc\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a\\ b\\ c)}\n\n for \n\n\n\na\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\nb\nx\n+\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ax^{2}+bx+c}\n\n./nLater, they developed a method that uses two-dimensional arrays, representing four variables at most, but the scope of this method was limited. Accordingly, a target of Seki and his contemporary Japanese mathematicians was the development of general multivariable algebraic equations and elimination theory./nIn the Chinese approach to polynomial interpolation, the motivation was to predict the motion of celestial bodies from observed data. The method was also applied to find various mathematical formulas. Seki learned this technique, most likely, through his close examination of Chinese calendars./nIn 1671, Sawaguchi Kazuyuki (\u6ca2\u53e3 \u4e00\u4e4b), a pupil of Hashimoto Masakazu (\u6a4b\u672c \u6b63\u6570) in Osaka, published Kokon Sanp\u014d Ki (\u53e4\u4eca\u7b97\u6cd5\u8a18), in which he gave the first comprehensive account of Chinese algebra in Japan. He successfully applied it to problems suggested by his contemporaries. Before him, these problems were solved using arithmetical methods. In the end of the book, he challenged other mathematicians with 15 new problems, which require multi-variable algebraic equations./nIn 1674, Seki published Hatsubi Sanp\u014d (\u767a\u5fae\u7b97\u6cd5), giving solutions to all the 15 problems. The method he used is called b\u014dsho-h\u014d. He introduced the use of kanji to represent unknowns and variables in equations. Although it was possible to represent equations of an arbitrary degree (he once treated the 1458th degree) with negative coefficients, there were no symbols corresponding to parentheses, equality, or division. For example, \n\n\n\na\nx\n+\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ax+b}\n\n could also mean \n\n\n\na\nx\n+\nb\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ax+b=0}\n\n. Later, the system was improved by other mathematicians, and in the end it became as expressive as the ones developed in Europe./nIn his book of 1674, however, Seki gave only single-variable equations resulting from elimination, but no account of the process at all, nor his new system of algebraic symbols. There were a few errors in the first edition. A mathematician in Hashimoto's school criticized the work, saying \"only three out of 15 are correct.\" In 1678, Tanaka Yoshizane (\u7530\u4e2d \u7531\u771f), who was from Hashimoto's school and was active in Kyoto, authored Sanp\u014d Meiki (\u7b97\u6cd5\u660e\u8a18), and gave new solutions to Sawaguchi's 15 problems, using his version of multivariable algebra, similar to Seki's. To answer criticism, in 1685, Takebe Katahiro (\u5efa\u90e8 \u8ce2\u5f18), one of Seki's pupils, published Hatsubi Sanp\u014d Genkai (\u767a\u5fae\u7b97\u6cd5\u8afa\u89e3), notes on Hatsubi Sanp\u014d, in which he showed in detail the process of elimination using algebraic symbols./nThe effect of the introduction of the new symbolism was not restricted to algebra. With it, mathematicians at that time became able to express mathematical results in more general and abstract way. They concentrated on the study of elimination of variables./nIn 1683, Seki pushed ahead with elimination theory, based on resultants, in the Kaifukudai no H\u014d (\u89e3\u4f0f\u984c\u4e4b\u6cd5). To express the resultant, he developed the notion of the determinant.[9] While in his manuscript the formula for 5\u00d75 matrices is obviously wrong, being always 0, in his later publication, Taisei Sankei (\u5927\u6210\u7b97\u7d4c), written in 1683-1710 with Katahiro Takebe (\u5efa\u90e8 \u8ce2\u5f18) and his brothers, a correct and general formula (Laplace's formula for the determinant) appears./nTanaka came up with the same idea independently. An indication appeared in his book of 1678: some of equations after elimination are the same as resultant. In Sanp\u014d Funkai (\u7b97\u6cd5\u7d1b\u89e3) (1690?), he explicitly described the resultant and applied it to several problems.  In 1690, Izeki Tomotoki (\u4e95\u95a2 \u77e5\u8fb0), a mathematician active in Osaka but not in Hashimoto's school, published Sanp\u014d Hakki (\u7b97\u6cd5\u767a\u63ee), in which he gave resultant and Laplace's formula of determinant for the n\u00d7n case. The relationships between these works are not clear. Seki developed his mathematics in competition with mathematicians in Osaka and Kyoto, at the cultural center of Japan./nIn comparison with European mathematics, Seki's first manuscript was as early as Leibniz's first commentary on the subject, which treated matrices only up to the 3x3 case. The subject was forgotten in the West until Gabriel Cramer in 1750 was brought to it by the same motivations. Elimination theory equivalent to the wasan form was rediscovered by \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout in 1764. Laplace's formula was established no earlier than 1750./nWith elimination theory in hand, a large part of the problems treated in Seki's time became solvable in principle, given the Chinese tradition of geometry almost reduced to algebra. In practice, the method could founder under huge computational complexity. Yet this theory had a significant influence on the direction of development of wasan. After the elimination is complete, one is left to find numerically the real roots of a single-variable equation. Horner's method, though well known in China, was not transmitted to Japan in its final form. So Seki had to work it out by himself independently. He is sometimes credited with Horner's method, which is not historically correct. He also suggested an improvement to Horner's method: to omit higher order terms after some iterations. This practice happens to be the same as that of Newton\u2013Raphson method, but with a completely different perspective. Neither he nor his pupils had, strictly speaking, the idea of derivative./nSeki also studied the properties of algebraic equations for assisting in numerical solution. The most notable of these are the conditions for the existence of multiple roots based on the discriminant, which is the resultant of a polynomial and its \"derivative\": His working definition of \"derivative\" was the O(h) -term in f(x + h), which was computed by the binomial theorem./nHe obtained some evaluations of the number of real roots of a polynomial equation./nAnother of Seki's contributions was the rectification of the circle, i.e., the calculation of pi; he obtained a value for \u03c0 that was correct to the 10th decimal place, using what is now called the Aitken's delta-squared process, rediscovered in the 20th century by Alexander Aitken./nThe asteroid 7483 Sekitakakazu is named after Seki Takakazu./nIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Seki Takakazu, OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 50+ works in 50+ publications in three languages and 100+ library holdings.[10]", "22519985": "Chi-Wang Shu (Chinese: \u8212\u5176\u671b, born 1 January 1957) is the Theodore B.

For instance, if M is a closed and connected Riemannian manifold with positive Bakry-\u00c9mery Ricci tensor, then the fundamental group of M must be finite; if instead the Bakry-\u00c9mery Ricci tensor is negative, then the isometry group of the Riemannian manifold must be finite. The comparison geometry of the Bakry-\u00c9mery Ricci tensor was taken further in an influential article of Guofang Wei and William Wylie.[3] Additionally, Lott showed that if a Riemannian manifold with smooth density arises as a collapsed limit of Riemannian manifolds with a uniform upper bound on diameter and sectional curvature and a uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature, then the lower bound on Ricci curvature is preserved in the limit as a lower bound on Bakry-\u00c9mery's Ricci curvature. In this sense, the Bakry-\u00c9mery Ricci tensor is shown to be natural in the context of Riemannian convergence theory./nIn 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted two papers to the arXiv which claimed to provide a proof for William Thurston's geometrization conjecture, using Richard Hamilton's theory of Ricci flow.[4][5] Perelman's papers attracted immediate attention for their bold claims and the fact that some of their results were quickly verified. However, due to Perelman's abbreviated style of presentation of highly technical material, many mathematicians were unable to understand much of his work, especially in his second paper. Beginning in 2003, Lott and Bruce Kleiner posted a series of annotations of Perelman's work to their websites, which was finalized in a 2008 publication.[6] Their article was most recently updated for corrections in 2013. In 2015, Kleiner and Lott were awarded the Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences of the United States for their work.

Similar work was done at the same time by Sturm, with the accumulated results typically referred to as \"Lott-Sturm-Villani theory\".[10][11] The papers of Lott-Villani and Sturm have initiated a very large amount of research in the mathematical literature, much of which is centered around extending classical work on Riemannian geometry to the setting of metric measure spaces.[12][13][14] An essentially analogous program for sectional curvature bounds (from either below or above) was initiated in the 1990s by an article of Yuri Burago, Mikhail Gromov, and Grigori Perelman, following foundations laid in the 1950s by Aleksandr Aleksandrov.[15]/nMedia related to John Lott (mathematician) at Wikimedia Commons", "401631": "Ulisse Dini (14 November 1845 \u2013 28 October 1918) was an Italian mathematician and politician, born in Pisa.

During World War I he was involved in war work, but also produced one of his major results, proving in 1917 the multiplicative property of Srinivasa Ramanujan's tau-function. The proof was by means, in effect, of the Hecke operators, which had not yet been named after Erich Hecke; it was, in retrospect, one of the major advances in modular form theory, beyond its status as an odd corner of the theory of special functions./nIn 1920, he took a teaching position in UMIST, becoming the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester in 1922 and Professor in 1923. There he developed a third area of interest within number theory, the geometry of numbers. His basic work on Mordell's theorem is from 1921 to 1922, as is the formulation of the Mordell conjecture.

In Manchester he also built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in Reinhold Baer, G. Billing, Paul Erd\u0151s, Chao Ko, Kurt Mahler, and Beniamino Segre. He also recruited J. A. Todd, Patrick du Val, Harold Davenport and Laurence Chisholm Young, and invited distinguished visitors./nIn 1945, he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of St. John's, when elected to the Sadleirian Chair, and became Head of Department. He officially retired in 1953. It was at this time that he had his only formal research students, of whom J. W. S. Cassels was one. His idea of supervising research was said to involve the suggestion that a proof of the transcendence of the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant was probably worth a doctorate. His book Diophantine Equations (1969) is based on lectures, and gives an idea of his discursive style. Mordell is said to have hated administrative duties.[7]/nWhile visiting the University of Calgary, the elderly Mordell attended the Number Theory seminars and would frequently fall asleep during them. According to a story by number theorist Richard K. Guy, the department head at the time, after Mordell had fallen asleep, someone in the audience asked \"Isn't that Stickelberger's theorem?\" The speaker said \"No it isn't.\" A few minutes later the person interrupted again and said \"I'm positive that's Stickelberger's theorem!\" The speaker again said no it wasn't.

In science he is principally remembered for his experimental work in physical optics, mostly concerned with the study of the polarization of light and including the discovery of Brewster's angle. He studied the birefringence of crystals under compression and discovered photoelasticity,[2] thereby creating the field of optical mineralogy.[3] For this work, William Whewell dubbed him the \"father of modern experimental optics\" and \"the Johannes Kepler of optics.\"[4]/nA pioneer in photography, Brewster invented an improved stereoscope,[5] which he called \"lenticular stereoscope\" and which became the first portable 3D-viewing device.[6] He also invented the stereoscopic camera,[7][8] two types of polarimeters,[9] the polyzonal lens, the lighthouse illuminator,[10] and the kaleidoscope./nBrewster was a devout Presbyterian and marched arm-in-arm with his brother during the events of the Disruption of 1843, which led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.[11] As a historian of science, Brewster focused on the life and work of his hero, Isaac Newton.  Brewster published a detailed biography of Newton in 1831 and later became the first scientific historian to examine many of the papers in Newton's Nachlass.  Brewster also wrote numerous works of popular science,[12] and was one of the founders of the British Science Association,[13][14] of which he was elected President in 1849.  He became the public face of higher education in Scotland, serving as Principal of the University of St Andrews (1837\u20131859) and later of the University of Edinburgh (1859\u20131868). Brewster also edited the 18-volume Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia./nDavid Brewster was born in the Canongate in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, to Margaret Key (1753\u20131790) and James Brewster (c. 1735\u20131815), the rector of Jedburgh Grammar School and a teacher of high reputation.[15] David was the third of six children, two daughters and four sons: James (1777\u20131847), minister at Craig, Ferryden; David; George (1784\u20131855), minister at Scoonie, Fife; and Patrick (1788\u20131859), minister at the abbey church, Paisley.[3]/nAt the age of 12, David Brewster matriculated at the University of Edinburgh with the intention of becoming a clergyman.  He received his MA in 1800, was licensed as a minister of the Church of Scotland, and then preached around Edinburgh on several occasions.[16] By then, Brewster had already shown a strong inclination for the natural sciences and had established a close association with James Veitch of Inchbonny. Veitch, who enjoyed a local reputation as a man of science and was particularly skilled in making telescopes, was characterized by Sir Walter Scott as a \"self-taught philosopher, astronomer and mathematician\".[17]/nBrewster is buried in the grounds of Melrose Abbey, in Roxburghshire./nThough Brewster duly finished his theological studies and was licensed to preach, his other interests distracted him from the duties of his profession. In 1799 fellow-student Henry Brougham persuaded him to study the diffraction of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to the Philosophical Transactions of London and other scientific journals. The fact that other scientists \u2013 notably \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus and Augustin Fresnel \u2013 were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others.[17] A lesser-known classmate of his, Thomas Dick, also went on to become a popular astronomical writer./nThe most important subjects of his inquiries can be enumerated under the following five headings:/nIn this line of investigation, the prime importance belongs to the discovery of/nThese discoveries were promptly recognised. As early as 1807 the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon Brewster by Marischal College, Aberdeen; in 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and received the Copley Medal; and in 1816 the French Institute awarded him one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years.[17] In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[18]/nAmong the non-scientific public, his fame spread more effectually by his invention in about 1815 of the kaleidoscope, for which there was a great demand in both the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.[17] As a reflection of this fame, Brewster portrait was later printed in some cigar boxes. Brewster chose renowned achromatic lens developer Philip Carpenter as the sole manufacturer of the kaleidoscope in 1817. Although Brewster patented the kaleidoscope in 1817 (GB 4136),[19][20] a copy of the prototype was shown to London opticians and copied before the patent was granted. As a consequence, the kaleidoscope became produced in large numbers, but yielded no direct financial benefits to Brewster.[21][22][23] It proved to be a massive success with two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes sold in London and Paris in just three months.[24]/nAn instrument of more significance, the stereoscope, which \u2013 though of much later date (1849) \u2013 along with the kaleidoscope did more than anything else to popularise his name, was not as has often been asserted the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles Wheatstone discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a cumbersome but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made to combine by means of mirrors.[17] A dogged rival of Wheatstone's, Brewster was unwilling to credit him with the invention, however, and proposed that the true author of the stereoscope was a Mr. Elliot, a \"Teacher of Mathematics\" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, had conceived of the principles as early as 1823 and had constructed a lensless and mirrorless prototype in 1839, through which one could view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to be invented.[25] Brewster's personal contribution was the suggestion to use prisms for uniting the dissimilar pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said to be his invention./nA much more valuable and practical result of Brewster's optical researches was the improvement of the British lighthouse system. Although Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation, perfected the dioptric apparatus independently, Brewster was active earlier in the field than Fresnel, describing the dioptric apparatus in 1812. Brewster pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two years before Fresnel suggested it, and it was finally introduced into lighthouses mainly through Brewster's persistent efforts.[17]/nAlthough Brewster's own discoveries were important, they were not his only service to science. He began writing in 1799 as a regular contributor to the Edinburgh Magazine,[26] of which he acted as editor 1802\u20131803 at the age of twenty.[27] In 1807, he undertook the editorship of the newly projected Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia, of which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he was one of the leading contributors to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (seventh and eighth editions) writing, among others, the articles on electricity, hydrodynamics, magnetism, microscope, optics, stereoscope, and voltaic electricity.  He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.[28]/nIn 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with Robert Jameson (1774\u20131854), the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, which took the place of the Edinburgh Magazine. The first ten volumes (1819\u20131824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825\u20131826) being edited by Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the Edinburgh Journal of Science in 1824, 16 volumes of which appeared under his editorship during the years 1824\u20131832, with very many articles from his own pen./nHe contributed around three hundred papers[3] to the transactions of various learned societies, and few of his contemporaries wrote as much for the various reviews. In the North British Review alone, seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important of them all: his biography of Sir Isaac Newton. In 1831 he published the Life of Sir Isaac Newton,[29] a short popular account of the philosopher's life, in Murray's Family Library, followed by an 1832 American edition in Harper's Family Library;[30] but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much fuller Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton, a work which embodied the results of more than 20 years' investigation of original manuscripts and other available sources.[31][32]/nBrewster's position as editor brought him into frequent contact with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to recognise the benefit that would accrue from regular communication among those in the field of science. In a review of Charles Babbage's book Decline of Science in England in John Murray's Quarterly Review, he suggested the creation of \"an association of our nobility, clergy, gentry and philosophers\".[33] This was taken up by various Declinarians and found speedy realisation in the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and Brewster, along with Babbage and Sir John Herschel, had the chief part in shaping its constitution.[31]/nIn the same year in which the British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the decoration of the Royal Guelphic Order. In 1838, he was appointed principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, University of St Andrews. In 1849, he acted as president of the British Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Institute of France in succession to J. J. Berzelius; and ten years later, he accepted the office of principal of the University of Edinburgh, the duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death.[31] In 1855, the government of France made him an Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur./nHe was a close friend of William Henry Fox Talbot, inventor of the calotype process, who sent Brewster early examples of his work. It was Brewster who suggested Talbot only patent his process in England, initiating the development of early photography in Scotland and eventually allowing for the formation of the first photographic society in the world, the Edinburgh Calotype Club, in 1843.[3] Brewster was a prominent member of the club until its dissolution sometime in the mid-1850s; however, his interest in photography continued, and he was elected the first President of the Photographic Society of Scotland when it was founded in 1856.[34]/nOf a high-strung and nervous temperament, Brewster was somewhat irritable in matters of controversy; but he was repeatedly subjected to serious provocation. He was a man of highly honourable and fervently religious character. In estimating his place among scientific discoverers, the chief thing to be borne in mind is that his genius was not characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws that he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy although he did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never explicitly adopted the wave theory of light. Few would dispute the verdict of James David Forbes, an editor of the eighth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: \"His scientific glory is different in kind from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age.\" In addition to the various works of Brewster already mentioned, the following may be added: Notes and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's Elements of Geometry (1824); Treatise on Optics (1831);  Letters on Natural Magic, addressed to Sir Walter Scott (1832) The Martyrs of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (1841); More Worlds than One (1854).[31]/nIn his Treatise he demonstrated that vegetal colors were related with the absorption spectra[35] and he described for the first time the red fluorescence of chlorophyll./nAs well as his many scientific works and biographies of notable scientists, Brewster also wrote The History of Free Masonry, Drawn from Authentic Sources of Information; with an Account of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, from Its Institution in 1736, to the Present Time,[36] published in 1804, when he was only 23. The work was commissioned by Alexander Lawrie, publisher to the Grand Lodge of Scotland, to whom the work has been, frequently, mis-attributed. Given that the book bears Lawrie's name and not Brewster's this is understandable. The book became one of the standard works on early Scottish freemasonry although it has been largely superseded by later works. There is no evidence that Brewster was a Freemason at the time he wrote the book, nor any that he became one later.[37]/nBrewster's Christian beliefs stirred him to respond against the idea of the transmutation of species and the theory of evolution. His opinion was that \"science and religion must be one since each dealt with Truth, which had only one and the same Author.\"[38] In 1845 he wrote a highly critical review of the evolutionist work Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, in the North British Review.[39] which he considered to be an insult to Christian revelation and a dangerous example of materialism./nIn 1862, he responded to Darwin's On the Origin of Species and published the article The Facts and Fancies of Mr Darwin in Good Words. He stated that Darwin's book combined both \"interesting facts and idle fancies\" which made up a \"dangerous and degrading speculation\". He accepted adaptive changes, but he strongly opposed Darwin's statement about the primordial form, which he considered an offensive idea to \"both the naturalist and the Christian.\"[40]/nBrewster married twice. His first wife, Juliet Macpherson (c. 1776\u20131850), was a daughter of James Macpherson (1736\u20131796), a probable translator of Ossian poems. They married on 31 July 1810 in Edinburgh and had four sons and a daughter:[41]/nBrewster married a second time in Nice, on 26 (or 27) March 1857, to Jane Kirk Purnell (b. 1827), the second daughter of Thomas Purnell of Scarborough.[46] Lady Brewster famously fainted at the Oxford evolution debate of 30 June 1860. Brewster died in 1868, and was buried at Melrose Abbey, next to his first wife and second son.[3][47] The physics building at Heriot-Watt University is named in his honour./nA bust of Brewster is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling./nBrewster's views on the possibility of evolution of intelligence on other planets, contrasted with the opinion of William Whewell, are cited in the novel Barchester Towers.[48]/nHe appears as a minor antagonist in the 2015 video game Assassin's Creed Syndicate as a scientist working for the game's opposing faction.[49] He is assassinated by one of the protagonists, Evie Frye.[50][51]/nA street within the Kings Buildings complex (science buildings linked to Edinburgh University) was named in his memory in 2015.", "63709480": "Gerd Grubb (born 1939)[1][2] is a Danish mathematician known for her research on pseudo-differential operators.

His results for hyperbolic equations (combined with earlier results obtained by Andrey Tikhonov, O.A. Oleinik, and G. Tautz for parabolic and elliptic equations) demonstrated that in terms of domain boundary conditions the solvability of all the three problems reduces to the solvability of a simplest problem of mathematical physics, the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. In the late 1960s Ilyin developed a universal method that made it possible for an arbitrary selfadjoint second-order operator in an arbitrary (not necessarily bounded) domain to establish the final conditions of uniform (on any compact) convergence for both spectral expansions themselves and their Riesz means in each of the classes of functions (Nikolsky, Sobolev-Liouville, Besov and Sigmund-Holder function classes). These conditions also proved to be novel and final for expansions into both the multiple Fourier integral and the trigonometric Fourier series./nIn 1971 Ilyin published a negative solution to the problem posed by Israel Gelfand concerning the validity of the theorem on equiconvergence of spectral expansion with the expansion into a Fourier integral for the case when the expansion itself has no uniform convergence./nIn 1972 he published a negative solution to the problem posed by Sergei Sobolev on the convergence for \n\n\n\np\n\u2260\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\neq 2}\n\n in the spectral expansion metric \n\n\n\np\n\u2260\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p\\neq 2}\n\n of a finite function from this class.

He called these estimates \u00abanti-a priori estimates\u00bb. He also showed that these estimates are central to the theory of nonselfadjoint operators./nIn a joint work with Evgeny Moiseev and K.V. Malkov in 1989, he demonstrated that the previously established conditions for the basis property of the system of eigenfunctions and associated functions of an operator \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n are both necessary and sufficient existence conditions for a complete system of motion integrals of a nonlinear system generated \n\n\n\n(\nL\n,\nA\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (L,A)}\n\n by a Lax pair./nFrom 1999, and for the rest of his life Ilyin focused on boundary control problems for processes described by hyperbolic equations, specifically by the wave equation. \nFor a number of cases, he obtained formulas describing optimal boundary controls (in terms of minimizing the boundary energy) that transfer the system from a given initial state to a given finite state (the results obtained in co-authorship with Evgeny Moiseev are among the best achievements of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2007 year).", "72786222": "Maarten Herman van Emden (December 31, 1937 \u2013 January 4, 2023) was a Dutch-Canadian mathematician and computer scientist whose research in the foundations of logic programming and constraint logic programming was highly influential./nVan Emden was born in Velp, the Netherlands, and his early childhood was spent mostly in the Dutch East Indies.

How he came to understand the relative proportions of numbers and their progressive denominations, he did not remember. However, this was his interest. He frequently took no notice of objects, and when he did, it was only with reference to their numbers. After hearing a sermon he knew nothing about its content other than that it contained a certain number of words which he had counted during its delivery./nHe measured the lands of Elmton, consisting of some thousand acres (4\u00a0km2), simply by striding over it. He gave the area not only in acres, roods and perches, but even in square inches. After this, he reduced them into square hairs'-breadths, reckoning forty-eight to each side of the inch. His memory was so great, that in resolving a question he could leave off and resume the operation again at the same point after the lapse of several months. His perpetual application to figures prevented the acquisition of other knowledge. Among the examples of Buxton's arithmetical feats which are given are his calculation of the product of a farthing doubled 139 times. The result, expressed in pounds, extends to thirty-nine figures, and is correct so far as it can be readily verified by the use of logarithms.[1] Buxton afterwards multiplied this enormous number by itself. It appears that he had invented an original nomenclature for large numbers, a 'tribe' being the cube of a million, and a 'cramp' (if Mr. Holliday's statement can be trusted) a thousand 'tribes of tribes'.[1]/nHis mental acuity was tested in 1754 by the Royal Society when he walked to London,[1] who acknowledged their satisfaction by presenting him with a handsome gratuity. During his visit to the metropolis, he was taken to see the tragedy of Richard III. performed at Drury Lane theatre, but his whole mind was given to the counting of the words uttered by David Garrick.[1] Similarly, he set himself to count the steps of the dancers; and he declared that the innumerable sounds produced by the musical instruments had perplexed him beyond measure./nA memoir appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine for June 1754, to which (probably through the medium of a Mr Holliday, of Haughton Hall, Nottinghamshire), Buxton had contributed several letters. In this memoir, his age is given as forty-nine, which points to his birth in 1705; the date adopted above is on the authority of Daniel and Samuel Lysons' Magna Britannia (Derbyshire)./nHis image can be seen online in the New York Library.[4] A portrait by Miss Maria Hartley in 1764 hangs in Elmton Church./nJedediah Buxton was the son of William Buxton, a farmer and also the schoolmaster at Elmton.

In 1832, Hamilton published a prediction of conical refraction. In 1833, MacCullagh claimed that it is a special case of a theorem he published in 1830 that he did not explicate, since it was not relevant to that particular paper. In 1842, Hamilton speculated on a model of ether, to which MacCullagh claimed that he had speculated on the same model.[6]/nAlthough he worked mostly on optics, he is also remembered for his work on geometry; his most significant work in optics was published in the mid-to-late 1830s; his most significant work on geometry On surfaces of the second order was published in 1843. He was awarded the Cunningham Medal of the Royal Irish Academy in 1838 for his paper on On the laws of crystalline reflexion and refraction.[7][1] He won the Copley medal for his work on the nature of light in 1842.[1]/nMacCullagh was involved with the British Association for the Advancement of Science.[3] He corresponded with many notable scientists, including John Herschel and Charles Babbage.[2] In Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, Charles Babbage wrote that MacCullagh was \"an excellent friend of mine\" and discussed the benefits and drawbacks of the analytical engine with him./nMacCullagh's most important paper on optics, An essay towards a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction, was presented to the Royal Irish Academy in December 1839.  The paper begins by defining what was then a new concept, the curl of a vector field. (The term 'curl' was first used by James Clerk Maxwell in 1870.)  MacCullagh first showed that the curl is a covariant vector in the sense that its components are transformed in the appropriate manner under coordinate rotation. Taking his cue from George Green, he set out to develop a potential function for a dynamical theory for the transmission of light./nMacCullagh found that a conventional potential function proportional to the squared norm of the displacement field was incompatible with known properties of light waves. In order to support only transverse waves, he found that the potential function must be proportional to the squared norm of the curl of the displacement field. It was accepted  that his radical choice ruled out any hope for a mechanical model for the ethereal medium. Nevertheless, the field equations stemming from this purely gyrostatic medium were shown to be in accord with all known laws, including those of Snell and Augustin-Jean Fresnel./nAt several points, MacCullagh addresses the physical nature of an ethereal medium having such properties. Not surprisingly, he argues against a mechanical interpretation of the luminiferous aether because he readily admits that no known physical medium could have such a potential function resisting only rotation of its elements. \"Concerning the peculiar constitution of the ether, we know nothing and shall suppose nothing, except what is involved in the foregoing assumptions [rectilinear vibrations in a medium of constant density]... Having arrived at the value of [the potential function], we may now take it for the starting point of our theory, and dismiss the assumptions by which we were conducted to it.\"/nDespite the success of the theory, physicists and mathematicians were not receptive to the idea of reducing physics to a set of abstract field equations divorced from a mechanical model. The notion of the ether as a compressible fluid or similar physical entity was too deeply ingrained in nineteenth century physical thinking, even for decades after the publication of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory in 1864. MacCullagh's ideas were largely abandoned and forgotten until 1880, when George Francis FitzGerald re-discovered and re-interpreted his findings in the light of Maxwell's work.[8]/nWilliam Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin succeeded in developing a physically realizable model of MacCullagh's rotationally elastic but translationally insensitive ether, consisting of gyrostats mounted on a framework of telescoping rods, described in his paper On a Gyrostatic Adynamic Constitution for Ether (1890)./nMacCullagh was an idealistic nationalist, in the sense of the time.[9][3] He unsuccessfully contested the election for the Dublin University constituency in 1847.[1] Suffering from overwork and a bout of depression, he died in 1847 by cutting his throat in his rooms at Trinity College Dublin.[3]/nAfter his death, Hamilton helped obtain pensions for his sisters.[10]/nIn May 2009, an Ulster History Circle plaque was unveiled at his family tomb at St Patrick's Church in Upper Badoney.[5] The plaque was part of events organised by the Glenelly Historical Society to mark his life./n... my intercourse with poor MacCullogh, who was constantly fancying that people were plundering his stores, which certainly were worth the robbing.

Peuerbach was instrumental in making astronomy, mathematics and literature simple and accessible for Europeans during the Renaissance and beyond./nPeuerbach's life remains relatively unknown until he enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1446.[3] He was born in the Austrian town of Peuerbach in upper Austria. A horoscope published eighty-nine years after his death places his date of birth specifically on May 30, 1423, though other evidence only indicates that he was born sometime after 1421.[4] He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1448./nGeorg's intellect was discovered by a priest of his hometown, Dr. Heinrich Barucher. Dr. Barucher recognized Peuerbach's  academic abilities from a young age and put him in contact with the Augustinian provost of Klosterneuburg Monastery, Georg Muestinger.[5] Georg Muestinge taught a course at the University of Vienna entitled Theoricae Planetarum.  These lectures was the first that George von Peuerbach attended at the University of Vienna and inspired him to enroll./nDuring his time at University of Vienna, Georg received a master of philosophy in 1446 and a second master's degree in 1448, studying mathematics under the guidelines of Johann von Gm\u00fcnden.[6] His curriculum was composed primarily of humanities courses, as was usual at the time.[7] His knowledge of astronomy derived from independent study, possibly from studying under followers of John von Gm\u00fcnden.[4] During his enrollment, there were no professors of astronomy at the University of Vienna.[7] However, under his tutelage astronomic studies emerged at the University of Vienna throughout the 15th and 16th centuries./nPeuerbach observed the occultation of Jupiter by the Moon in 1451, signifying the beginning of his personal astronomy career. After this point Peuerbach essentially devoted his life to astronomy, he developed tools and theories, and collaborated with his pupil Regiomontanus (Johannes M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigsberg) to make astrology more digestible to common people.[8] Majority of Georg's astrological discoveries were made in the last ten years of his life.[9]/nGeorg Peuerbach traveled through central and southern Europe, most notably in Italy, giving lectures on astronomy. His lectures led to offers of professorships at several universities, including those at Bologna and Padua. During this time he also met Italian astronomer Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara, perhaps the leading astronomer at the time, and the Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa.[7] He returned to the University of Vienna in 1453, earned his Masters of Arts, and began lecturing on Latin poetry.[3] He is often credited as a leader in reviving classical Greek and Roman literature in arts and sciences.[4]/nPeuerbach attended many university lectures that focused on Roman poets, which led to him playing one of the leading roles in the revitalization of classical learning introduced by Aenaes Silvius Piccolomini.[4] Peuerbach eventually followed the advice of the court astrologer to Emperor Friedrich III in Wiener-Nestadt, Johann Nihil, and took the position of court astrologer to the king of Hungary. After being court astrologer for a few years, Peuerbach eventually went on to become imperial astrologer.[4]/nWhile at Vienna in 1454, Peuerbach taught planetary motion to students at the university. Peuerbach's lectures were based on Ptolemaic teachings and became so famous that from 1472 they were printed under the title \u2018Theoricae Novae Planetarum\u2018.[10]/nIn 1454 Peuerbach was appointed court astrologer to King Ladislas V of Bohemia and Hungary. It was in this capacity that Peuerbach first met Ladislas' cousin Frederick who was then serving as guardian to the 14-year-old king and who would later become Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. Ladislas resided primarily in Prague and Vienna, allowing Peuerbach to maintain his position at the University of Vienna. During this time Peuerbach met Regiomontanus, who was then a student at the university. After Regiomontanus graduated in 1452 at the age of 15, he began collaborating extensively with Peuerbach in his astronomical work.[7]\nIn 1457, following the assassination of two notable political figures, Ladislas fled Vienna and died in 1458. Peurbach did not receive an appointment from either of Ladislas' two successors.[7] However he was asked to be the Astronomus caesaris for Emperor Frederick III, which is the position he held until his death.[5]/nGeorg von Peuerbach passed away on April 8, 1461. His work set the path for future scholars, scientists, and astronomers for years to come; Peurbach\u2019s early death was a serious loss to the progress of astronomy, [11] although Regiomontanus, his successor, was able to continue his work./nPeuerbach is best-known for his workTheoricae Novae Planetarum, written in 1454, and published by his disciple Regiomontanus in 1472.[12] Theoricae Novae Planetarum presented a version of Claudius Ptolemy geocentric system in a more colloquial and comprehensible way.[13] Based on a series of Peuerbach's lectures at B\u00fcrgerschule in Vienna that were transcribed by Regiomontanus.[14] The book introduced the \"New Planetary Theory of Georg von Peuerbach\" based on the already successful Ptolomaic system, this new theory presented the physical realities of eccentric planetary spheres.[15] In his model of the sun Peuerbach removed simple eccentric shells and added partial orbs, some of which were eccentric and some concentric to the center of the world. Similar models for the planets replaced the body of the sun with an epicycle sphere carrying each planet./nPeuerbach ideas replaced Theorica Planetarum Communis, a work credited to Gerardus Cremonensis, as the standard university text on astronomy and was studied by many influential astronomers including Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.[3]/nIn 1457 Peuerbach observed an eclipse and noted that it had occurred 8 minutes earlier than had been predicted by the Alphonsine Tables, the best available astronomical tables at the time. He then computed his own set of eclipse tables, the Tabulae Eclipsium. Widely read in manuscript form beginning around 1459 and formally published in 1514, these tables remained highly influential for many years.[3][7]/nPeuerbach wrote various papers on practical mathematics and constructed various astronomical instruments. Most notably, he computed sine tables based on techniques developed by Islamicate mathematicians.[3] Peuerbach's work was instrumental in establishing a more modern understanding of mathematics./nIn 1460, Cardinal Johannes Bessarion, while visiting Frederick's court seeking assistance in a crusade to reclaim Constantinople from the Turks, proposed that Peuerbach and Regiomontanus create a new translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from the original Greek. Bessarion thought that a shorter and more clearly written version of the work would make a suitable teaching text. Peuerbach accepted the task and worked on it with Regiomontanus until his death in 1461, at which time 6 volumes had been completed. Regiomontanus completed the project, and the final version containing 13 volumes was published in 1496.[7]/nGeorg von Peuerbach work outlives him because of his ability to communicate astronomy, mathematics and art. His contributions simplified seeming difficult ideas, making them more digestible and inspiring critical thought. Through his tutelage he was able to create an astronomy program at his alma mater, further expanding the understanding of astronomy./nPeuerbach's and Regiomontanus's contribution expanded the European understanding of astronomy by translating Ptolemy's Almagest in a book that later influenced Nicolaus Copernicus.[3] Though the work   was completed after Peuerbach's death in 1461, Regiomontanus carried on with the task and eventually the Epitome of the Almagest was published in 1496, nearly 35 years after his teacher\u2019s passing, and 20 years after his own (Regiomontanus died in 1476).[4] This book would go on to be an important reference for Nicholas Copernicus for the creation of his book De Revolutionibus.[3]/nIronically Nicolaus Copernicus work, and later Sir Issac Newtons disproved many of the ideas that Peuerbach supported while defending the Ptolemaic system, nonetheless his advancement in technology and theory help modernize the study of astronomy./nA Peuerbach's input in Regiomontanus's trigonometric tables was used by future astronomers in the coming century.[4]  Though a fair amount of Peuerbach's work is believed to have circulated in academia, his full observations were only published by Johann Sch\u00f6ner nearly a century after Peuerbach's death.[3] His Theoricae Novae Planetarum would be released in numerous editions between 1472 and 1596, with additions by scholars such as Regiomontanus, Peter Apian, Erasmus Reinhold, and Philip Melanchthon. It is believed that by 1653, at least 56 Latin printings of the text had been published with numerous editions in other languages as well.[4]/nPeuerbach\u2019s Theoricae Novae Planetarum became one of the most common astronomy textbooks used to train future scholars.[4] He is credited with being instrumental in the European understanding of astronomy and the Ptolemaic system. The descriptions of the solid spheres model (common to the Ptolemaic planetary system) seen in the Theoricae Novae Planetarum would remain the accepted view of the nature of the spheres until the time of Tycho Brahe, who disproved the existence of solid spheres.[4] The Theoricae Novae Planetarum is also credited with helping to establish much of the technical vocabulary used by astronomers through the seventeenth century.[4]/nPeuerbach is also known to have developed and distributed tables that were capable of predicting eclipses of both the sun and the moon, and this practice was continued by Regiomontanus.[3] The manuscript, titled Tabulae Eclipsium, saw continued use, as late as Tycho Brahe near the end of the sixteenth century.\u00a0 He is also believed to have overseen the collection and duplication of numerous astronomical manuscripts.[3] This culminated in the development of a scientific printing press in Nuremberg by Regiomontanus. The printing press was further used to publish astronomical works such as Peuerbach's own Theoricae Novae Planetarum, as well as the Astronomicon written by the poet Manilius[3]", "34349418": "Giuseppe Battaglini (11 January 1826 \u2013 29 April 1894) was an Italian mathematician.[1]/nHe studied mathematics at the Scuola d'Applicazione di Ponti e Strade (School of Bridges and Roads) of Naples.

When just four months old, Sachs moved with his family to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up and attended school.[2]/nIn March 1945, when Sachs was 17 years old, he enlisted to serve in the US Navy during World War II.[3] The Sachs family moved back to the United States to Los Angeles where other family members had already moved from Portland. From middle of 1945 onward, Sachs considered Los Angeles to be his hometown. After the war, in August 1945 Sachs enrolled in the Navy Eddy program in Chicago learning about electronics and radar equipment. He was then assigned to an aircraft carrier based in San Francisco that had been badly damaged in the war by a kamikaze airplane. In July 1946 Sachs spoke with the executive officer of the ship, explaining that he wanted to go to college and study physics and received an early honorable discharge from the Navy in August 1946.[4]/nSachs earned his bachelors at the University of California, Los Angeles,[1] he then moved to Columbia University, New York for postgraduate study. Sachs had heard of the research at Columbia University while at UCLA. During that time Columbia's physics department was chaired by Isidor Isaac Rabi and was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and seven future laureates (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa) While at Columbia Sachs was taught by Willis Lamb and Hideki Yukawa.[5] Yukawa had agreed to be Sach's thesis advisor, but Sachs decided to complete his doctorate back at UCLA so that he could be reunited with Yetty Herman, whom he married in 1952.[6]/nFollowing the award of his PhD in 1954 Sachs first post-doctoral position was at the new University of California Radiation Laboratory at both Berkeley and Livermore,[7] which was run by Edward Teller and Ernest Lawrence and was also home to Bryce DeWitt, who Sachs would later co-author articles with in Physics Today. The new laboratory was intended to spur innovation and provide competition to the nuclear weapon design laboratory at Los Alamos in New Mexico, home of the Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic weapons. In his new job Sachs intended to get in contact with Albert Einstein at his office  at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton to arrange an appointment to discuss his research program. Sachs wanted to explore with him the features of nonlocality and nonlinearity that are absent in the quantum theory, but must be present in a field theory. Unfortunately Einstein died in April 1955 and Sachs never had the opportunity to talk to him about his ideas.[7]/nIn 1956 Sachs became a senior scientist at Lockheed Missiles and Space Laboratory,[1][8] Based in Sunnyvale and adjacent to the NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center, Moffett Field, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Systems was and continues to be one of the most important satellite development and manufacturing plants in the United States, covering 412 acres. While at Lockheed Sachs began developing with Solomon Schwebel a field theory of quantum electrodynamics that included broken symmetries that did not require recourse to renormalization or perturbation techniques \u2013 the \"Schwebel-Sachs\" model. During this time Sachs was also employed as assistant professor of physics at San Jose State College. In 1961 he became a research professor at McGill University; this was followed by a post as associate professor of physics at Boston University (1962\u20131966)./nIn 1964 while at Boston University Sachs received an invitation from Paul Dirac to visit Cambridge University. Sachs, his wife and children first stayed for one month in Ireland, at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies where Sachs discuss various problems with Cornelius Lanczos, who had been one of Einstein's assistants in Berlin in the 1920s.[9] Sachs also had discussions with Lanczos' colleagues John Lighton Synge, J. R. McConnell and Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh.[10] Following his trip to Ireland, Sachs stayed in England for three months, where his wife Yetty had family. Sachs worked with Paul Dirac at the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics, Cambridge University. While working with Dirac, Sachs also had the opportunity to discuss ideas with John G. Taylor, John Polkinghorne and graduate students at DAMTP.[9]/nIn 1965 Sachs had had a breakthrough while at the Aspen Center for Physics, Colorado. Sachs was able to derive a result for a unified field theory if quantum mechanics was considered to be a linear approximation for a field theory of inertia expressed in general relativity. Sachs argued that the work of Albert Einstein and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in general relativity did not yet take account of the inertia of matter, which required consideration of the Mach principle. In the summer of 1966 Abdus Salam invited Sachs to spend a few months at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, in Trieste, Italy. During this time Sachs published the details of his formal structure of quantum mechanics from a generally covariant field theory of inertia in the Italian journal, Il Nuovo Cimento./nIn the autumn of 1966 he was appointed professor of physics at State University of New York at Buffalo./nSachs was an editor for the International Journal of Theoretical Physics.[11]/nOn his retirement in 1997 he was given the title Professor of Physics Emeritus.[8] A symposium was held in Sachs honour to mark his retirement, the event was attended by Nobel laureates Willis E. Lamb and Herbert A. Hauptman and a subsequent festschrift was published.[12] Sachs published 13 books and over 200 journal articles during his life.[13]/nSachs progressed towards completing Albert Einstein's unified field theory, i.e. unifying the fields in general relativity, from which quantum mechanics emerges under certain conditions./nHis theory rests on three axioms. The general idea is (1) to make precise the principle of relativity, aka general covariance. To do this, Sachs found, requires (2) generalizing Einstein's Mach principle, positing that all manifestations of matter, not only inertial mass, derive from the interaction of matter. From this, (3) quantum mechanics can be seen to emerge via the correspondence principle, as a nonrelativistic approximation for a theory of inertia in relativity./nThe result is a continuous quaternion-based formalism modeling all manifestations of matter. Sachs called the transformation symmetry group that Einstein sought in completing general covariance 'the Einstein group', which approaches the Poincar\u00e9 group towards the flat spacetime of special relativity. Sachs described how quantum mechanics, first in relativistic two-component spinor form, and then under low energy-momentum as Schr\u00f6dinger's equation emerges therefrom.[14] Quoting Sachs, \"...by dropping the (unnecessary) space and time reflection symmetry elements from Einstein's field equations, they factorize from 10 independent relations to 16 independent relations. This generalization then yielded a unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. This factorization is entirely analogous to Dirac's factorization of the Klein Gordon equation to yield the special relativistic spinor form of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave mechanics.\"/n\"The well known trouble with RQFT,\" Sachs wrote, \"is that when its formal expression is examined for its solutions, it is found that it does not have any! This is because of infinities that are automatically generated in this formulation.\"[8] Through general relativity, he instead produced a myriad of theoretical results without resorting to arbitrary parameters or renormalization, some in closer agreement with experiment than derived from quantum field theory, e.g. for the Lamb splitting with N\u00a0=\u00a04.[15]/nYet another phenomenon that Sachs' theory can accommodate (that standard cosmology might not) is the Huge-LQG large quasar group, since general relativity does not presuppose homogeneity or isotropy, i.e. the cosmological principle./nSachs believed that fundamental incompatibilities between relativity theory and quantum theory preclude there from being a quantum theory of gravity.[16]", "1352049": "Franti\u0161ek Miklo\u0161ko (born 2 June 1947) is a Slovak politician.

She was raised in Edmonton, London, and found a passion for mathematics and music. At the age of 5, Broni-Mensah experienced prejudice at primary school, \"I was met with shrills from other children during playtime, who couldn't contemplate the idea of playing with a black girl\". In secondary school she was repeatedly denied access to higher level maths classes despite achieving the highest grades in the intermediate class.

He left Ireland after leading republican insurgents in the Rebellion of 1798, and settled in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. With Nathaniel Bowditch, he shares the distinction of being the first scholar to publish original mathematical research in America. This included his formulation of the method of least squares while working on a surveying problem (in two proofs of the exponential law of error published independently of Carl Friedrich Gauss) for which he is chiefly remembered.[1][2][3] His fields of applied mathematical interest included physics, astronomy and geodesy. Many of his mathematical investigations focussed on the shape of the Earth.[4]/nAdrain was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland. His father, of French Huguenot descent, was a school teacher and maker of mathematical instruments, and he apparently received a good education until he was fifteen when both his parents died. He then supported himself and his four siblings by assuming his father's position as a teacher and as a private tutor.[3][4] In the cause of democratic reform and national independence, on 7 June 1798 he led a contingent of United Irishmen in the rebel army commanded by Henry Joy McCracken at the Battle of Antrim.[5] In the confrontation with British Crown forces, he was near fatally wounded by one of his own men. After being nursed back to health, with a bounty on his head he, his wife and infant child escaped to America.[3]/nAlthough he was himself largely self-taught in mathematics, he secured a teaching position at the academy at Princeton, New Jersey. In 1801 he became president of the York County Academy in York, Pennsylvania. He wrote for the Mathematical Correspondent (edited by George Baron), the first mathematical journal in the United States, contributing the first article published in America on diophantine algebra. Later he twice attempted, in 1808 and 1814, to found his own journal, The Analyst, or, Mathematical Museum. While he failed to attract sufficient subscribers,[6] the first volume of the Analyst has been considered \"the best collection of mathematical work produced in the United States up to that time\".  As well as from Adrain, it included contributions from Nathaniel Bowditch, Robert Patterson, John Gummere and Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler.[3] Recognition followed./nIn 1809 Adrain was called to a professorship at Rutgers (then Queen's) College which, in 1810, awarded him an honorary M.A..

He returned to New Brunswick. He rented a school room and offered private tutoring until 1836. Local records in New Brunswick indicate that during the 1830s, he held in slavery a woman named Caroline and her son Alfred.[9][10]  After 1836, he returned to New York and taught at the Columbia College Grammar School before retiring to New Brunswick in 1840 where three years later he died.[3]/nIt is suggested that Adrain, today, consistent with his conviction that \"the last and highest department of mathematical science consists in its application to the laws and phenomenon of the natural world\", would be considered an applied mathematician. Among his broad interests in physics, astronomy and geography, his paramount concern was dynamic geodesy, specifically the mathematical investigation of the shape of the earth.[4]/nAdrain was the father of Congressman Garnett B.

He presented some of his results to Ehresmann's seminar in Strasbourg, extending Cartan's classification of complex irreducible Lie algebras to the case of real Lie algebras.[2]/nIn spring 1960, Matsushima became a professor of Osaka University as successor to the chair of Shoda.[1] His research took a somewhat different direction and he wrote a series of papers on cohomology of locally symmetric spaces, collaborating with Murakami. He went to the Institute for Advanced Study in September 1962 and returned to Osaka after one year. He jointly began to organize the United States-Japan Seminar in Differential Geometry, which was held in Kyoto in June 1965. After this, he went to France and spent the academic year 1965-66 as visiting professor at the University of Grenoble. He accepted a chair at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, in September 1966.[1] He continued to collaborate with Murakami. He introduced Matsushima's formula for the Betti numbers of quotients of symmetric spaces. In 1967, he became an editor of the Journal of Differential Geometry and remained on the editorial board for the rest of his life. After 14 years at Notre Dame, he returned to Japan in 1980. A conference was organized in his honor in May 1980 before he left Notre Dame.[2]/nIn February 1981,  a volume of papers Manifolds and Lie groups, Papers in honour of Yozo Matsushima was published by his colleagues and former students at Osaka. It also contained some papers presented to the conference held in Notre Dame in the previous May. He died on April 9, 1983, in Osaka, Japan.[2]/nMatsushima received the Asahi Prize for his research on continuous groups in 1962.[2]", "4071848": "Jean-Baptiste Morin (February 23, 1583 \u2013 November 6, 1656), also known by the Latinized name as Morinus, was a French mathematician, astrologer, and astronomer./nBorn in Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne, in the Beaujolais, he began studying philosophy at Aix-en-Provence at the age of 16.  He studied medicine at Avignon in 1611 and received his medical degree two years later.  He was employed by the Bishop of Boulogne from 1613 to 1621 and was sent to Germany and Hungary during this time.  He served the bishop as an astrologer and also visited mines and studied metals.  He subsequently worked for the Duke of Luxembourg until 1629.  Morin published a defense of Aristotle in 1624.  He also worked in the field of optics, and continued to study in astrology.  He worked with Pierre Gassendi on observational astronomy./nIn 1630, Morin was appointed professor of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal, a post he held until his death./nA firm believer of the idea that the Earth remained fixed in space, Morin is best known for being an opponent of Galileo and the latter's ideas.  He continued his attacks after the Trial of Galileo.  Morin seems to have been a rather contentious figure, as he also attacked Descartes' ideas after meeting the philosopher in 1638.  These disputes isolated Morin from the scientific community at large./nMorin believed that improved methods of solving spherical triangles had to be found and that better lunar tables were needed./nMorin attempted to solve the longitude problem.  In 1634, he proposed his solution, based on measuring absolute time by the position of the Moon relative to the stars.  His method was a variation of the lunar distance method first put forward by Johann Werner in 1514.  Morin added some improvements to this method, such as better scientific instruments and taking lunar parallax into account.  Morin did not believe that Gemma Frisius' transporting clock method for calculating out longitude would work.  Morin, unfailingly irascible, remarked, \"I do not know if the Devil will succeed in making a longitude timekeeper but it is folly for man to try.\"[1]/nA prize was to be awarded, so a committee was set up by Richelieu to evaluate Morin's proposal.  Serving on this committee were \u00c9tienne Pascal, Claude Mydorge, and Pierre H\u00e9rigone.  The committee remained in dispute with Morin for the five years after he made his proposal.  Morin refused to listen to objections to his proposal, which was considered impractical.  In his attempts to convince the committee members, Morin proposed that an observatory be set up in order to provide accurate lunar data.  He wrangled with the committee for five years./nIn 1645, Cardinal Mazarin, Richelieu's successor, awarded Morin a pension of 2,000 livres for his work on the longitude problem./nPerhaps most famous for his work as an astrologer, towards the end of his life Morin completed Astrologia Gallica (\"French Astrology\"), a treatise which he did not live to see in print. The 26 books of intricate, complex, Latin text were published at the Hague in 1661 as one thick folio 850 pages long. The work covers natal, judicial, mundane, electional and meteorological astrology, and parts that are most concerned with astrological techniques (as compared to theological discussion on which they are based) have been translated or paraphrased into French, Spanish, German, and English./nAt least among English-speaking astrologers, Morin is known as having been particularly concerned with prediction through methodical extrapolation of what is promised in the natal chart. His techniques were directions, solar and lunar return, and he regarded transits a subsidiary technique though one key to accurate timing of events nonetheless./nMorin challenged much of classical astrological theory, including the astrology of Ptolemy, in an attempt to present a solid set of tools while rendering reasons for and against particular techniques, some of which may be considered crucial to many astrologers before and during Morin\u2019s lifetime. At the same time, Morin vested himself heavily in promoting in mundo directions, a technique largely based on the work of Regiomontanus that became available thanks to then-recent advancement in mathematics. In his work, Morin provides examples of successful delineation of events  that otherwise could not be delineated with the same relative degree of certainty./nMorin\u2019s life has been that of trial and tribulation by his own testament.

Henderson was thus in a good position to be this person.

This figure is reasonably accurate, being 25.6% too small./nHenderson did not immediately publish his results, however (there had been previous, discredited attempts to claim a measurement of stellar parallax), and eventually he was beaten to the punch by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, who published a parallax of 10.3 light years (9.6% too small) for 61 Cygni in 1838.[2] Henderson published his results in 1839,[3] but was relegated to second place because of his lack of confidence. He later published confirming observations by Thomas Maclear.[4] Alpha Centauri remained the nearest known star until the discovery of Proxima Centauri in 1915 by Robert T. A.

This was proven by Ethan Devinatz, Hopkins and Jeff Smith (published in 1988).[2] The rest of the Ravenel conjectures (except for the telescope conjecture) were proven by Hopkins and Smith soon after (published in 1998).[3] Another result in this spirit proven by Hopkins and Douglas Ravenel is the chromatic convergence theorem, which states that one can recover a finite CW-complex from its localizations with respect to wedges of Morava K-theories./nThis part of work is about refining a homotopy commutative diagram of ring spectra up to homotopy to a strictly commutative diagram of highly structured ring spectra. The first success of this program was the Hopkins\u2013Miller theorem: It is about the action of the Morava stabilizer group on Lubin\u2013Tate spectra (arising out of the deformation theory of formal group laws) and its refinement to \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{\\infty }}\n\n-ring spectra \u2013 this allowed to take homotopy fixed points of finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer groups, which led to higher real K-theories. Together with Paul Goerss, Hopkins later set up a systematic obstruction theory for refinements to \n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E_{\\infty }}\n\n-ring spectra.[4]  This was later used in the Hopkins\u2013Miller construction of topological modular forms.[5] Subsequent work of Hopkins on this topic includes papers on the question of the orientability of TMF with respect to string cobordism (joint work with Ando, Strickland and Rezk).[6][7]/nOn April 21, 2009, Hopkins announced the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem, in joint work with Mike Hill and Douglas Ravenel.[8] This problem is connected to the study of exotic spheres, but got transformed by work of William Browder into a problem in stable homotopy theory. The proof by Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel works purely in the stable homotopy setting and uses equivariant homotopy theory in a crucial way.[9]/nThis includes papers on smooth and twisted K-theory and its relationship to loop groups[10] and also work about (extended) topological field theories,[11] joint with Daniel Freed, Jacob Lurie, and Constantin Teleman./nHe gave invited addresses at the 1990 Winter Meeting of\nthe American Mathematical Society in Louisville, Kentucky, at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich,[12] and was a plenary speaker at the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing.[13] He presented the 1994 Everett Pitcher Lectures at Lehigh University, the 2000 Namboodiri Lectures at the University of Chicago, the 2000 Marston Morse Memorial Lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, the 2003 Ritt Lectures at Columbia University and the 2010 Bowen Lectures in Berkeley.

He was an Augustinian who became an early supporter of Martin Luther. He was later appointed professor of mathematics at Jena University./nStifel was born in Esslingen am Neckar in southern Germany. He joined the Order of Saint Augustine and was ordained a priest in 1511. Tensions in the abbey grew after he published  the poem Von der Christf\u00f6rmigen, rechtgegr\u00fcndeten leer Doctoris Martini Luthers (1522, i.e. On the Christian, righteous doctrine of Doctor Martin Luther) and came into conflict with Thomas Murner. Stifel then left for Frankfurt, and soon went to Mansfeld, where he began his mathematical studies. In 1524, upon a recommendation by Luther, Stifel was called by the J\u00f6rger family to serve at their residence, Tollet Castle in Tollet (close to Grieskirchen, Upper Austria).[1] Due to the tense situation in the Archduchy of Austria in the wake of the execution of Leonhard Kaiser in Sch\u00e4rding, Stifel returned to Wittenberg in 1527. At this time Stifel started writing a book collecting letter transcripts of Martin Luther, completed in 1534.[2]/nBy intercession of Martin Luther, Stifel became minister in Lochau (now Annaburg). Luther also confirmed his marriage to the widow of his predecessor in the ministry. Michael Stifel was fascinated regarding the properties and possibilities of numbers; he studied number theory and numerology. He also performed the \"Wortrechnung\" (i.e. word-calculation), studying the statistical properties of letters and words in the bible (a common method at that time). In 1532, Stifel published anonymously his \"Ein Rechenbuchlin vom EndChrist. Apocalyps in Apocalypsim\" (A Book of Arithmetic about the AntiChrist. A Revelation in the Revelation). This predicted that Judgement Day would occur and the world would end at 8am on October 19, 1533. The German saying \"to talk a Stiefel\" or \"to calculate a Stiefel\" (Stiefel is the German word for boot), meaning to say or calculate something based on an unusual track, can be traced back to this incident.[3] When this prediction failed, he did not make any other predictions./nIn 1535 he became minister in Holzdorf near Wittenberg and stayed there for 12 years. He studied \"Die Coss\" (the first algebra book written in German) by Christoph Rudolff and Euclid's Elements in the Latin edition by Campanus of Novara. Jacob Milich supported his scientific development and encouraged him to write a comprehensive work on arithmetic and algebra.[4][5] In 1541 he registered for mathematics at the University of Wittenberg[6] to extend his mathematical knowledge. In 1558 Stifel became first professor of mathematics at the new founded University of Jena.[7]/nStifel's most important work Arithmetica integra (1544) contained important innovations in mathematical notation.  It has the first use of multiplication by juxtaposition (with no symbol between the terms) in Europe.  He is the first to use the term \"exponent\" and also included the following rules for calculating powers: \n\n\n\n\nq\n\nm\n\n\n\nq\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\nq\n\nm\n+\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle q^{m}q^{n}=q^{m+n}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq\n\nm\n\n\n\nq\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nq\n\nm\n\u2212\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {q^{m}}{q^{n}}}=q^{m-n}}\n\n.[8] The book contains a table of integers and powers of 2 that some have considered to be an early version of a logarithmic table.\nStifel explicitly points out, that multiplication and division operations in the (lower) geometric series can be mapped by addition and subtraction in the (upper) arithmetic series. On the following page 250, he shows  examples also using negative exponents. He also realized that this would create a lot of work. So he wrote, that regarding this issue marvelous books could be written, but he himself will refrain and keep his eyes shut.[9][10][11]/nStifel was the first, who had a standard method to solve quadratic equations. He was able to reduce the different cases  known to one case, because he uses both, positive and negative coefficients. He called his method/rule AMASIAS. The letters A, M, A/S, I, A/S each are representing a single operation step when solving a quadratic equation. Stifel, however avoided to show the negative results.[12][13]/nAnother topic dealt with in the Arithmetica integra are negative numbers (which Stifel calls numeri absurdi). Negative numbers were refused and considered as preposterous by the authorities at that time. Stifel however, used negative numbers equal to the other numbers. He also discussed the properties of irrational numbers and if the irrationals are real numbers, or only fictitious (AI page 103). Stifel found them very useful for mathematics, and not dispensable.

He graduated with distinction in mathematics from Stanford University in 1965, and received his Ph.D. in physics[2][13] from the University of Oregon in 1975, where his study of the energy levels of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field led to his discovery of the fractal known as Hofstadter's butterfly.[13]/nSince 1988, Hofstadter has been the College of Arts and Sciences Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Comparative Literature at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he directs the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition which consists of himself and his graduate students, forming the \"Fluid Analogies Research Group\" (FARG).[14] He was initially appointed to the Indiana University's Computer Science Department faculty in 1977, and at that time he launched his research program in computer modeling of mental processes (which he called \"artificial intelligence research\", a label he has since dropped in favor of \"cognitive science research\"). In 1984, he moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was hired as a professor of psychology and was also appointed to the Walgreen Chair for the Study of Human Understanding. In 1988 he returned to Bloomington as \"College of Arts and Sciences Professor\" in both cognitive science and computer science. He was also appointed adjunct professor of history and philosophy of science, philosophy, comparative literature, and psychology, but has said that his involvement with most of those departments is nominal.[15][16][17] In 1988 Hofstadter received the In Praise of Reason award, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's highest honor.[18] In April 2009 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences[19] and a member of the American Philosophical Society.[20] In 2010 he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden.[21]/nAt the University of Michigan and Indiana University, he and Melanie Mitchell coauthored a computational model of \"high-level perception\"\u2014Copycat\u2014and several other models of analogy-making and cognition, including the Tabletop project, co-developed with Robert M. French.[22] The Letter Spirit project, implemented by Gary McGraw and John Rehling, aims to model artistic creativity by designing stylistically uniform \"gridfonts\" (typefaces limited to a grid). Other more recent models include Phaeaco (implemented by Harry Foundalis) and SeqSee (Abhijit Mahabal), which model high-level perception and analogy-making in the microdomains of Bongard problems and number sequences, respectively, as well as George (Francisco Lara-Dammer), which models the processes of perception and discovery in triangle geometry.[23][24][25]/nHofstadter has had several exhibitions of his artwork in various university galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by \"oscillation\", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his \"Whirly Art\" (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India). Hofstadter invented the term \"ambigram\" in 1984; many ambigrammists have since taken up the concept.[26]/nHofstadter collects and studies cognitive errors (largely, but not solely, speech errors), \"bon mots\", and analogies of all sorts, and his longtime observation of these diverse products of cognition. His theories about the mechanisms that underlie them have exerted a powerful influence on the architectures of the computational models he and FARG members have developed.[27]/nHofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first expressed in G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach but also present in several of his later books, is that it is \"an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain\". In G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent \"colony\" of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an \"I\" comes from the abstract pattern he terms a \"strange loop\", an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and video feedback that Hofstadter has defined as \"a level-crossing feedback loop\". The prototypical example of a strange loop is the self-referential structure at the core of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter's 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human \"I\" is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to one.[28]\nLe Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language is a long book devoted to language and translation, especially poetry translation, and one of its leitmotifs is a set of 88 translations of \"Ma Mignonne\", a highly constrained poem by 16th-century French poet Cl\u00e9ment Marot. In this book, Hofstadter jokingly describes himself as \"pilingual\" (meaning that the sum total of the varying degrees of mastery of all the languages that he has studied comes to 3.14159\u00a0...), as well as an \"oligoglot\" (someone who speaks \"a few\" languages).[29][30]/nIn 1999, the bicentennial year of the Russian poet and writer Alexander Pushkin, Hofstadter published a verse translation of Pushkin's classic novel-in-verse Eugene Onegin. He has translated other poems and two novels: La Chamade (That Mad Ache) by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, and La Scoperta dell'Alba (The Discovery of Dawn) by Walter Veltroni, the then-head of the Partito Democratico in Italy. The Discovery of Dawn was published in 2007, and That Mad Ache was published in 2009, bound together with Hofstadter's essay Translator, Trader: An Essay on the Pleasantly Pervasive Paradoxes of Translation./nHofstadter's Law is \"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.\" The law is stated in G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach./nHofstadter's former Ph.D. students[31] include (with dissertation title):/nHofstadter has said that he feels \"uncomfortable with the nerd culture that centers on computers\". He admits that \"a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology\", but when it was suggested that his work \"has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence\" he replied that he was pleased about that, but that he himself has \"no interest in computers\".[32][33] In that interview he also mentioned a course he has twice given at Indiana University, in which he took a \"skeptical look at a number of highly touted AI projects and overall approaches\".[17] For example, upon the defeat of Garry Kasparov by Deep Blue, he commented that \"It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers becoming intelligent\".[34] In his book Metamagical Themas, he says that \"in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?\".[35]/nProvoked by predictions of a technological singularity (a hypothetical moment in the future of humanity when a self-reinforcing, runaway development of artificial intelligence causes a radical change in technology and culture), Hofstadter has both organized and participated in several public discussions of the topic. At Indiana University in 1999 he organized such a symposium, and in April 2000, he organized a larger symposium titled \"Spiritual Robots\" at Stanford University, in which he moderated a panel consisting of Ray Kurzweil, Hans Moravec, Kevin Kelly, Ralph Merkle, Bill Joy, Frank Drake, John Holland and John Koza. Hofstadter was also an invited panelist at the first Singularity Summit, held at Stanford in May 2006. Hofstadter expressed doubt that the singularity will occur in the foreseeable future.[36][37][38][39][40][41]/nIn 1988 Dutch director Piet Hoenderdos created a docudrama about Hofstadter and his ideas, Victim of the Brain, based on The Mind's I. It includes interviews with Hofstadter about his work.[42]/nWhen Martin Gardner retired from writing his \"Mathematical Games\" column for Scientific American magazine, Hofstadter succeeded him in 1981\u201383 with a column titled Metamagical Themas (an anagram of \"Mathematical Games\"). An idea he introduced in one of these columns was the concept of \"Reviews of This Book\", a book containing nothing but cross-referenced reviews of itself that has an online implementation.[43] One of Hofstadter's columns in Scientific American concerned the damaging effects of sexist language, and two chapters of his book Metamagical Themas are devoted to that topic, one of which is a biting analogy-based satire, \"A Person Paper on Purity in Language\" (1985), in which the reader's presumed revulsion at racism and racist language is used as a lever to motivate an analogous revulsion at sexism and sexist language; Hofstadter published it under the pseudonym William Satire, an allusion to William Safire.[44] Another column reported on the discoveries made by University of Michigan professor Robert Axelrod in his computer tournament pitting many iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies against each other, and a follow-up column discussed a similar tournament that Hofstadter and his graduate student Marek Lugowski organized.[citation needed] The \"Metamagical Themas\" columns ranged over many themes, including patterns in Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's piano music (particularly his \u00e9tudes), the concept of superrationality (choosing to cooperate when the other party/adversary is assumed to be equally intelligent as oneself), and the self-modifying game of Nomic, based on the way the legal system modifies itself, and developed by philosopher Peter Suber.[45]/nHofstadter was married to Carol Ann Brush until her death. They met in Bloomington, and married in Ann Arbor in 1985. They had two children, Danny and Monica.

Bogomolov worked at the Steklov Institute in Moscow before he became a professor at the Courant Institute in New York. He is most famous for his pioneering work on hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds./nBorn in Moscow, Bogomolov graduated from Moscow State University, Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, and earned his doctorate (\"candidate degree\") in 1973, at the Steklov Institute. His doctoral advisor was Sergei Novikov./nBogomolov's Ph.D. thesis was entitled Compact K\u00e4hler varieties. In his early papers[1][2][3] Bogomolov studied the manifolds which were later called Calabi\u2013Yau and hyperk\u00e4hler. He proved a decomposition theorem, used for the classification of manifolds with trivial canonical class. It has been re-proven using the Calabi\u2013Yau theorem and Berger's classification of Riemannian holonomies, and is foundational for modern string theory./nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s Bogomolov studied the deformation theory for manifolds with trivial canonical class.[4][5] He discovered what is now known as Bogomolov\u2013Tian\u2013Todorov theorem, proving the smoothness and un-obstructedness of the deformation space for hyperkaehler manifolds (in 1978 paper) and then extended this to all Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds in the 1981 IHES preprint. Some years later, this theorem became the mathematical foundation for Mirror Symmetry./nWhile studying the deformation theory of hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds, Bogomolov discovered what is now known as the Bogomolov\u2013Beauville\u2013Fujiki form on \n\n\n\n\nH\n\n2\n\n\n(\nM\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H^{2}(M)}\n\n. Studying properties of this form, Bogomolov erroneously concluded that compact hyperkaehler manifolds do not exist, with the exception of K3 surfaces, tori, and their products. Almost four years passed since this publication before Akira Fujiki found a counterexample./nBogomolov's paper on \"Holomorphic tensors and vector bundles on projective manifolds\" proves what is now known as the Bogomolov\u2013Miyaoka\u2013Yau inequality, and also proves that a stable bundle on a surface, restricted to a curve of sufficiently big degree, remains stable. In \"Families of curves on a surface of general type\",[6] Bogomolov laid the foundations to the now popular approach to the theory of diophantine equations through geometry of hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. In this paper Bogomolov proved that on any surface of general type with \n\n\n\n\nc\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n>\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c_{1}^{2}>c_{2}}\n\n, there is only a finite number of curves of bounded genus. Some 25 years later, Michael McQuillan[7] extended this argument to prove the famous Green\u2013Griffiths conjecture for such surfaces. In \"Classification of surfaces of class \n\n\n\nV\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle VII_{0}}\n\n with \n\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{2}=0}\n\n\",[8]  Bogomolov made the first step in a famously difficult (and still unresolved) problem of classification of surfaces of Kodaira class VII. These are compact complex surfaces with \n\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{2}=1}\n\n. If they are in addition minimal, they are called class \n\n\n\nV\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle VII_{0}}\n\n. Kunihiko Kodaira classified all compact complex surfaces except class VII, which are still not understood, except the case \n\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{2}=0}\n\n (Bogomolov) and \n\n\n\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b_{2}=1}\n\n (Andrei Teleman, 2005).[9]/nBogomolov has contributed to several aspects of arithmetic geometry. He posed the Bogomolov conjecture about small points. Twenty years ago[when?] he contributed a proof (among many proofs) of the geometric Szpiro's conjecture which appears to be the nearest to Shinichi Mochizuki's claimed proof of the arithmetic Szpiro conjecture./nBogomolov obtained his Habilitation (Russian \"Dr. of Sciences\") in 1983. In 1994, he emigrated to the United States and became a full professor at the Courant Institute. He is very active in algebraic geometry and number theory.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954, the Wolf Prize in 2000 and the inaugural Abel Prize in 2003./nBorn in Bages, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, to pharmacist parents, Serre was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e de N\u00eemes and then from 1945 to 1948 at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris.[1] He was awarded his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1951. From 1948 to 1954 he held positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. In 1956 he was elected professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, a position he held until his retirement in 1994. His wife, Professor Josiane Heulot-Serre, was a chemist; she also was the director of the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Jeunes Filles. Their daughter is the former French diplomat, historian and writer Claudine Monteil. The French mathematician Denis Serre is his nephew.  He practices skiing, table tennis, and rock climbing (in Fontainebleau)./nFrom a very young age he was an outstanding figure in the school of Henri Cartan,[2] working on algebraic topology, several complex variables and then commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, where he introduced sheaf theory and homological algebra techniques. Serre's thesis concerned the Leray\u2013Serre spectral sequence associated to a fibration. Together with Cartan, Serre established the technique of using Eilenberg\u2013MacLane spaces for computing homotopy groups of spheres, which at that time was one of the major problems in topology./nIn his speech at the Fields Medal award ceremony in 1954, Hermann Weyl gave high praise to Serre, and also made the point that the award was for the first time awarded to a non-analyst. Serre subsequently changed his research focus./nIn the 1950s and 1960s, a fruitful collaboration between Serre and the two-years-younger Alexander Grothendieck led to important foundational work, much of it motivated by the Weil conjectures. Two major foundational papers by Serre were Faisceaux Alg\u00e9briques Coh\u00e9rents (FAC, 1955),[3] on coherent cohomology, and G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Analytique (GAGA, 1956).[4]/nEven at an early stage in his work Serre had perceived a need to construct more general and refined cohomology theories to tackle the Weil conjectures. The problem was that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf over a finite field could not capture as much topology as singular cohomology with integer coefficients.  Amongst Serre's early candidate theories of 1954\u201355 was one based on Witt vector coefficients./nAround 1958 Serre suggested that isotrivial principal bundles on algebraic varieties \u2013 those that become trivial after pullback by a finite \u00e9tale map \u2013 are important. This acted as one important source of inspiration for Grothendieck to develop the \u00e9tale topology and the corresponding theory of \u00e9tale cohomology.[5] These tools, developed in full by Grothendieck and collaborators in S\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique (SGA) 4 and SGA 5, provided the tools for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures by Pierre Deligne./nFrom 1959 onward Serre's interests turned towards group theory, number theory, in particular Galois representations and modular forms./nAmongst his most original contributions were: his \"Conjecture II\" (still open) on Galois cohomology; his use of group actions on trees (with Hyman Bass); the Borel\u2013Serre compactification; results on the number of points of curves over finite fields; Galois representations in \u2113-adic cohomology and the proof that these representations have often a \"large\" image; the concept of p-adic modular form; and the Serre conjecture (now a theorem) on mod-p representations that made Fermat's Last Theorem a connected part of mainstream arithmetic geometry./nIn his paper FAC, Serre asked whether a finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.

Alpheus Trueblood of the Society of Friends,[1] and the niece of pacifist Benjamin Franklin Trueblood.[2] She did her undergraduate studies at Earlham College in Richmond,[1] graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1893,[3] and became a mathematics and Latin teacher there. Her cousin, Thomas Trueblood, taught at the University of Michigan, and she went there for graduate study in mathematics and astronomy,[1] earning a master's degree in 1896.[3]/nTrueblood became a fellow at the Boston School of Housekeeping, and was hired by the Women's Educational and Industrial Union to survey job satisfaction among working women in Massachusetts. Her research found that domestic servants were much less happy than workers in factories, restaurants, and shops, in part because of their long working hours and inability to control their free time. She suggested that better education would improve their happiness and job performance.[2][4]/nAfter this she studied for a year with Felix Klein at the University of G\u00f6ttingen,[1] in 1900\u20131901, as a fellow of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae.[2][3] Returning to the US, she became an instructor at Mount Holyoke College.

She became an instructor in the extension division of the University of California, Berkeley in 1915,[1] and by 1918 was head of mathematics in the extension program.[6] There, she taught officers in training during World War I, and later \"engineers from the airlines, the telephone company, and other fields, lawyers who wanted to keep their minds limber on calculus, insurance actuaries, chemists from the oil companies, sound experts, opticians, and many others\".[1]/nShe died in Berkeley, on November 19, 1939.[1]", "205488": "William Whewell FRS FGS FRSE (/\u02c8hju\u02d0\u0259l/ HEW-\u0259l; 24 May 1794\u00a0\u2013 6 March 1866) was an English polymath, scientist, Anglican priest, philosopher, theologian, and historian of science. He was Master at Trinity College, Cambridge.  In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics./nThe breadth of Whewell's endeavours is his most remarkable feature.   In a time of increasing specialization, Whewell belonged in an earlier era when natural philosophers investigated widely. He published work in mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics, while also composing poetry, writing a Bridgewater Treatise, translating the works of Goethe, and writing sermons and theological tracts.  In mathematics, Whewell introduced what is now called the Whewell equation, defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system. He also organized thousands of volunteers internationally to study ocean tides, in what is now considered one of the first citizen science projects. He received the Royal Medal for this work in 1837.[1]/nOne of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his word-smithing. He corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with neologisms for their discoveries. Whewell coined, among other terms, scientist,[2] physicist, linguistics, consilience, catastrophism, uniformitarianism, and astigmatism;[3] he suggested to Michael Faraday the terms electrode, ion, dielectric, anode, and cathode.[4][5]/nWhewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse./nWhewell was born in Lancaster, the son of John Whewell and his wife, Elizabeth Bennison.[6]\nHis father was a master carpenter, and wished him to follow his trade, but William's success in mathematics at Lancaster Royal Grammar School and Heversham grammar school won him an exhibition (a type of scholarship) at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1812. He was the eldest of seven children having three brothers and three sisters born after him. Two brothers died as infants; the third died in 1812. Two of his sisters married; he corresponded with them in his career as a student and then a professor. His mother died in 1807, when Whewell was 13 years old. His father died in 1816, the year Whewell received his bachelor degree at Trinity College, but before his most significant professional accomplishments.[7]/nWhewell married, firstly, in 1841, Cordelia Marshall, daughter of John Marshall. Within days of his marriage, Whewell was recommended to be master of Trinity College in Cambridge, following Christopher Wordsworth. Cordelia died in 1855. In 1858 he married again, to Everina Frances (n\u00e9e Ellis), widow of Sir Gilbert Affleck, 5th Baronet who had died in 1854.[8] He had no children./nIn 1814 he was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal for poetry.[9] He was Second Wrangler in 1816, President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1817, became fellow and tutor of his college./nHe was professor of mineralogy from 1828 to 1832 and Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy (then called \"moral theology and casuistical divinity\") from 1838 to 1855.[10][11] During the years as professor of philosophy, in 1841, Whewell succeeded Christopher Wordsworth as master./nWhewell influenced the syllabus of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge, which undergraduates studied. He was a proponent of 'mixed mathematics': applied mathematics, descriptive geometry and mathematical physics, in contrast with pure mathematics. Under Whewell, analytic topics such as elliptical integrals were replaced by physical studies of electricity, heat and magnetism. He believed an intuitive geometrical understanding of mathematics, based on Euclid and Newton, was most appropriate.[12]/nWhewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.[13] He was buried in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, whilst his wives are buried together in the Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge. A window dedicated to Lady Affleck, his second wife, was installed in her memory in the chancel of All Saints' Church, Cambridge and made by Morris & Co./nA list of his writings was prepared after his death by Isaac Todhunter in two volumes, the first being an index of the names of persons with whom Whewell corresponded.[14][15] Another book was published five years later, as a biography of Whewell's life interspersed with his letters to his father, his sisters, and other correspondence, written and compiled by his niece by marriage, Janet Mary Douglas, called Mrs Stair Douglas on the book's title page.[7] These books are available online in their entirety as part of the Internet Archive./nIn 1826 and 1828, Whewell was engaged with George Airy in conducting experiments in Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, in order to determine the density of the earth. Their united labours were unsuccessful, and Whewell did little more in the way of experimental science. He was the author, however, of an Essay on Mineralogical Classification, published in 1828, and carried out extensive work on the tides.[16][11]/nWhen Whewell started his work on tides, there was a theory explaining the forces causing the tides, based on the work of Newton, Bernoulli, and Laplace. But this explained the forces, not how tides actually propagated in oceans bounded by continents. There was a series of tidal observations for a few ports, such as London and Liverpool, which allowed tide tables to be produced for these ports. However the methods used to create such tables, and in some cases the observations, were closely guarded trade secrets. John Lubbock, a former student of Whewell's, had analysed the available historic data (covering up to 25 years) for several ports to allow tables to be generated on a theoretical basis, publishing the methodology.[17][18] This work was supported by Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer of the Navy, and contributed to the publication of the Admiralty Tide Tables starting in 1833.[19]/nWhewell built on Lubbock's work to develop an understanding of tidal patterns around the world that could be used to generate predictions for many locations without the need for long series of tidal observations at each port. This required extensive new observations, initially obtained through an informal network, and later through formal projects enabled by Beaufort at the Admiralty. In the first of these, in June 1834, every Coast Guard station in the United Kingdom recorded the tides every fifteen minutes for two weeks.[20]:\u200a169\u2013173\u200a The second, in June 1835, was an international collaboration, involving Admiralty Surveyors, other Royal Navy and British observers, as well as those from the United States, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands. Islands, such as the Channel Islands, were particularly interesting, adding important detail of the progress of the tides through the ocean. The Admiralty also provided the resources for data analysis, and J.F. Dessiou, an expert calculator on the Admiralty staff, was in charge of the calculations. [20]:\u200a175\u2013182/nWhewell made extensive use of graphical methods, and these became not just ways of displaying results, but tools in the analysis of data.[20]:\u200a182\u200a He published a number of maps showing cotidal lines (a term coined by Lubbock) \u2013 lines joining points where high tide occurred at the same time. These allowed a graphical representation of the progression of tidal waves through the ocean. From this, Whewell predicted that there should be a place where there was no tidal rise or fall in the southern part of the North Sea.[21] Such a \"no-tide zone\" is now called an amphidromic point. In 1840, the naval surveyor William Hewett confirmed Whewell's prediction. This involved anchoring his ship, HMS Fairy, and taking repeated soundings at the same location with lead and line, precautions being needed to allow for irregularities in the sea bed, and the effects of tidal flow. The data showed a rise of no more than 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m).[22][23] He was also an accomplished artist of geological landscapes and his pencil drawing of the Wren's Nest, Dudley was printed in Roderick Murchison's 'Siluria'./nWhewell published about 20 papers over a period of 20 years on his tidal researches. This was his major scientific achievement, and was an important source for his understanding of the process of scientific enquiry, the subject of one of his major works Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences./nHis best-known works are two voluminous books that attempt to systematize the development of the sciences, History of the Inductive Sciences (1837) and The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History (1840, 1847, 1858\u201360).  While the History traced how each branch of the sciences had evolved since antiquity, Whewell viewed the Philosophy as the \"Moral\" of the previous work as it sought to extract a universal theory of knowledge through history./nIn the latter, he attempted to follow Francis Bacon's plan for discovery. He examined ideas (\"explication of conceptions\") and by the \"colligation of facts\" endeavored to unite these ideas with the facts and so construct science.[11] This colligation is an \"act of thought\", a mental operation consisting of bringing together a number of empirical facts by \"superinducing\" upon them a conception which unites the facts and renders them capable of being expressed in general laws.[24] Whewell refers to as an example Kepler and the discovery of the elliptical orbit: the orbit's points were colligated by the conception of the ellipse, not by the discovery of new facts. These conceptions are not \"innate\" (as in Kant), but being the fruits of the \"progress of scientific thought (history) are unfolded in clearness and distinctness\".[25]/nWhewell analyzed inductive reasoning into three steps:/nUpon these follow special methods of induction applicable to quantity: the method of curves, the method of means, the method of least squares and the method of residues, and special methods depending on resemblance (to which the transition is made through the law of continuity), such as the method of gradation and the method of natural classification.[11] In Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Whewell was the first to use the term \"consilience\" to discuss the unification of knowledge between the different branches of learning./nHere, as in his ethical doctrine, Whewell was moved by opposition to contemporary English empiricism. Following Immanuel Kant, he asserted against John Stuart Mill the a priori nature of necessary truth, and by his rules for the construction of conceptions he dispensed with the inductive methods of Mill.[11] Yet, according to Laura J. Snyder, \"surprisingly, the received view of Whewell's methodology in the 20th century has tended to describe him as an anti-inductivist in the Popperian mold, that is it is claimed that Whewell endorses a 'conjectures and refutations' view of scientific discovery. Whewell explicitly rejects the hypothetico-deductive claim that hypotheses discovered by non-rational guesswork can be confirmed by consequentialist testing. Whewell explained that new hypotheses are 'collected from the facts' (Philosophy of Inductive Sciences, 1849, 17)\".[26] In sum, the scientific discovery is a partly empirical and partly rational process; the \"discovery of the conceptions is neither guesswork nor merely a matter of observations\", we infer more than we see.[27]/nOne of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing. He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with new terms for their discoveries.  In fact, Whewell came up with the term scientist itself in 1833, and it was first published in Whewell's anonymous 1834 review of Mary Somerville's On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences published in the Quarterly Review.[28] (They had previously been known as \"natural philosophers\" or \"men of science\")./nWhewell was prominent not only in scientific research and philosophy but also in university and college administration. His first work, An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics (1819), cooperated with those of George Peacock and John Herschel in reforming the Cambridge method of mathematical teaching. His work and publications also helped influence the recognition of the moral and natural sciences as an integral part of the Cambridge curriculum.[11]/nIn general, however, especially in later years, he opposed reform: he defended the tutorial system, and in a controversy with Connop Thirlwall (1834), opposed the admission of Dissenters; he upheld the clerical fellowship system, the privileged class of \"fellow-commoners\", and the authority of heads of colleges in university affairs.[11]/nHe opposed the appointment of the University Commission (1850) and wrote two pamphlets (Remarks) against the reform of the university (1855). He stood against the scheme of entrusting elections to the members of the senate and instead, advocated the use of college funds and the subvention of scientific and professorial work.[11]/nHe was elected Master of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1841, and retained that position until his death in 1866./nThe Whewell Professorship of International Law and the Whewell Scholarships were established through the provisions of his will.[29][30]/nAside from Science, Whewell was also interested in the history of architecture throughout his life.  He is best known for his writings on Gothic architecture, specifically his book, Architectural Notes on German Churches (first published in 1830).  In this work, Whewell established a strict nomenclature for German Gothic churches and came up with a theory of stylistic development.  His work is associated with the \"scientific trend\" of architectural writers, along with Thomas Rickman and Robert Willis./nHe paid from his own resources for the construction of two new courts of rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, built in a Gothic style.  The two courts were completed in 1860 and (posthumously) in 1868, and are now collectively named Whewell's Court (in the singular)./nBetween 1835 and 1861 Whewell produced various works on the philosophy of morals and politics, the chief of which, Elements of Morality, including Polity, was published in 1845. The peculiarity of this work\u2014written from what is known as the intuitional point of view\u2014is its fivefold division of the springs of action and of their objects, of the primary and universal rights of man (personal security, property, contract, family rights, and government), and of the cardinal virtues (benevolence, justice, truth, purity and order).[11]/nAmong Whewell's other works\u2014too numerous to mention\u2014were popular writings such as:/nWhewell was one of the Cambridge dons whom Charles Darwin met during his education there, and when Darwin returned from the Beagle voyage he was directly influenced by Whewell, who persuaded Darwin to become secretary of the Geological Society of London. The title pages of On the Origin of Species open with a quotation from Whewell's Bridgewater Treatise about science founded on a natural theology of a creator establishing laws:[35]/nBut with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this\u2014we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws./nThough Darwin used the concepts of Whewell as he made and tested his hypotheses regarding the theory of evolution, Whewell did not support Darwin's theory itself./n\u201cWhewell also famously opposed the idea of evolution. First he published a new book, Indications of the Creator, 1845, composed of extracts from his earlier works to counteract the popular anonymous evolutionary work Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Later Whewell opposed Darwin's theories of evolution.\u201d[36]/nIn the 1857 novel Barchester Towers  Charlotte Stanhope uses the topic of the theological arguments, concerning the possibility of intelligent life on other planets, between Whewell and David Brewster in an attempt to start up a conversation between her impecunious brother and the wealthy young widow Eleanor Bold.[40]", "57483965": "Sergey Lozhkin (Russian: \u041b\u043e\u0301\u0436\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447; born March 29, 1951) is a Russian mathematician, Professor, Dr.Sc., a professor at the Faculty of Computer Science at the Moscow State University.[1]/nHe defended the thesis \u00abAsymptotic estimates of a high degree of accuracy for the complexity of control systems\u00bb for the degree of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (1998)./nAuthor of 8 books and more than 80 scientific articles.[2][3]", "336574": "Saunders Mac Lane (4 August 1909 \u2013 14 April 2005) was an American mathematician who co-founded category theory with Samuel Eilenberg./nMac Lane was born in Norwich, Connecticut, near where his family lived in Taftville.[4] He was christened \"Leslie Saunders MacLane\", but \"Leslie\" fell into disuse because his parents, Donald MacLane and Winifred Saunders, came to dislike it. He began inserting a space into his surname because his first wife found it difficult to type the name without a space.[5]\nHe was the oldest of three brothers; one of his brothers, Gerald MacLane, also became a mathematics professor at Rice University and Purdue University. Another sister died as a baby. His father and grandfather were both ministers; his grandfather had been a Presbyterian, but was kicked out of the church for believing in evolution, and his father was a Congregationalist. His mother, Winifred, studied at Mount Holyoke College and taught English, Latin, and mathematics.[4]/nIn high school, Mac Lane's favorite subject was chemistry. While in high school, his father died, and he came under his grandfather's care. His half-uncle, a lawyer, was determined to send him to Yale University, where many of his relatives had been educated, and paid his way there beginning in 1926.\nAs a freshman, he became disillusioned with chemistry. His mathematics instructor, Lester S. Hill, coached him for a local mathematics competition which he won, setting the direction for his future work. He went on to study mathematics and physics as a double major, taking courses from Jesse Beams, Ernest William Brown, Ernest Lawrence, F. S. C. Northrop, and \u00d8ystein Ore, among others. He graduated from Yale with a B.A. in 1930.[4] During this period, he published his first scientific paper, in physics and co-authored with Irving Langmuir./nIn 1929, at a party of Yale football supporters in Montclair, New Jersey, Mac Lane (there to be presented with a prize for having the best grade point average yet recorded at Yale) had met Robert Maynard Hutchins, the new president of the University of Chicago, who encouraged him to go there for his graduate studies and soon afterwards offered him a scholarship. Mac Lane neglected to actually apply to the program, but showed up and was admitted anyway. At Chicago, the subjects he studied included set theory with E. H. Moore, number theory with Leonard Eugene Dickson, the calculus of variations with Gilbert Ames Bliss, and logic with Mortimer J. Adler.[4]/nIn 1931, having earned his master's degree and feeling restless at Chicago, he earned a fellowship from the Institute of International Education and became one of the last Americans to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen prior to its decline under the Nazis. His greatest influences there were Paul Bernays and Hermann Weyl. By the time he finished his doctorate in 1934, Bernays had been forced to leave because he was Jewish, and Weyl became his main examiner. At G\u00f6ttingen, Mac Lane also studied with Gustav Herglotz and Emmy Noether. Within days of finishing his degree, he married Dorothy Jones, from Chicago, and soon returned to the U.S.[4][6][7]/nFrom 1934 through 1938, Mac Lane held short-term appointments at Yale University, Harvard University, Cornell University, and the University of Chicago. He then held a tenure track appointment at Harvard from 1938 to 1947. In 1941, while giving a series of visiting lectures at the University of Michigan, he met Samuel Eilenberg and began what would become a fruitful collaboration on the interplay between algebra and topology. In 1944 and 1945, he also directed Columbia University's Applied Mathematics Group, which was involved in the war effort as a contractor for the Applied Mathematics Panel; the mathematics he worked on in this group concerned differential equations for fire-control systems.[4]/nIn 1947, he accepted an offer to return to Chicago, where (in part because of the university's involvement in the Manhattan Project, and in part because of the administrative efforts of Marshall Stone) many other famous mathematicians and physicists had also recently moved. He traveled as a Guggenheim Fellow to ETH Zurich for the 1947\u20131948 term, where he worked with Heinz Hopf. Mac Lane succeeded Stone as department chair in 1952, and served for six years.[4]/nMac Lane was vice president of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Mathematical Society. While presiding over the Mathematical Association of America in the 1950s, he initiated its activities aimed at improving the teaching of modern mathematics. He was a member of the National Science Board, 1974\u20131980, advising the American government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to China to study the conditions affecting mathematics there. Mac Lane was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1949, and received the National Medal of Science in 1989./nAfter a thesis in mathematical logic, his early work was in field theory and valuation theory. He wrote on valuation rings and Witt vectors, and separability in infinite field extensions. He started writing on group extensions in 1942, and in 1943 began his research on what are now called Eilenberg\u2013MacLane spaces K(G,n), having a single non-trivial homotopy group G in dimension n. This work opened the way to group cohomology in general./nAfter introducing, via the Eilenberg\u2013Steenrod axioms, the abstract approach to homology theory, he and Eilenberg originated category theory in 1945. He is especially known for his work on coherence theorems. A recurring feature of category theory, abstract algebra, and of some other mathematics as well, is the use of diagrams, consisting of arrows (morphisms) linking objects, such as products and coproducts. According to McLarty (2005), this diagrammatic approach to contemporary mathematics largely stems from Mac Lane (1948). Mac Lane also coined the term Yoneda lemma for a lemma which is an essential background to many central concepts of category theory and which was discovered by Nobuo Yoneda.[8]/nMac Lane had an exemplary devotion to writing approachable texts, starting with his very influential A Survey of Modern Algebra, coauthored in 1941 with Garrett Birkhoff. From then on, it was possible to teach elementary modern algebra to undergraduates using an English text. His Categories for the Working Mathematician remains the definitive introduction to category theory./nMac Lane supervised the Ph.Ds of, among many others, David Eisenbud, William Howard, Irving Kaplansky, Michael Morley, Anil Nerode, Robert Solovay, and John G. Thompson./nIn addition to reviewing a fair amount of his mathematical output, the obituary articles McLarty (2005, 2007) clarify Mac Lane's contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. Mac Lane (1986) is an approachable introduction to his views on this subject.", "8135359": "Robert Harris Kupperman (May 12, 1935 \u2013 November 24, 2006) was an American  government official and academic, and a leading expert on terrorism./nKupperman received his doctorate in applied mathematics from New York University in 1962 and went on to teach at the University of Maryland as well as NYU./nDuring his years working for the US government he served as director of the transition team for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as executive director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, and finally at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, where he helped President Nixon in creating the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism. This first interagency study of foreign and domestic terrorism was created in response to the Black September terrorist attack in which 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games./nAfter he left the public sector, Kupperman joined the Center for Strategic and International Studies as an advisor and authored several books, most notably Strategic Requirements for the Army to the Year 2000 (Lexington Books, 1984) and Final Warning: Averting Disaster in the New Age of Terrorism, which he co-wrote with journalist Jeff Kamen (Doubleday, 1989)/nKupperman died in his home in Washington, D.C., aged 71.

He had, however, long been a student of science; and Dr Dircks, a physician practising at T\u00f8nder, prevailed with his father to send him in 1820 to Copenhagen, where he won the patronage of H.C. Schumacher and attracted the personal notice of King Frederick VI. The Danish survey was then in progress, and he acted as Schumacher's assistant in work connected with it, chiefly at the new observatory of Altona, from 1821 to 1825.[2]/nThence he passed on to Gotha as director of the Gotha Observatory; nor could he be tempted to relinquish the post by successive invitations to replace F.G.W. Struve at Dorpat in 1829, Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander at Helsinki in 1837, and F.W. Bessel at K\u00f6nigsberg in 1847. The problems of gravitational astronomy engaged the chief part of Hansen's attention. A research into the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn secured for him the prize of the Berlin Academy in 1830, and a memoir on cometary disturbances was crowned by the Paris Academy in 1850.[2]/nIn 1838 he published a revision of the lunar theory, entitled Fundamenta nova investigationis, &c., and the improved Tables of the Moon (\"Hansen's Lunar Tables\")[3] based upon it were printed in 1857, at the expense of the British government, their merit being further recognized by a grant of \u00a31000, and by their adoption in the Nautical Almanac as from the issue for the year 1862,[4] and other Ephemerides. A theoretical discussion of the disturbances embodied in them (long familiarly known to lunar experts as the Darlegung) appeared in the Abhandlungen of the Saxon Academy of Sciences in 1862 to 1864.[2]  At the time of publication of Hansen's Tables of the Moon in 1857, astronomers generally believed that the lunar theory was at last complete;  but within about a decade, it was noticed, and shown by Simon Newcomb, that the optimism had been unfounded: deviations between computed and observed positions began to grow at a rate showing that further refinement was necessary.[5]  For some years Hansen's theory continued to be used with Newcomb's corrections (from the Nautical Almanac's issue for 1883), but it was eventually (as from 1923) superseded by E W Brown's theory.[6]/nHansen twice visited Britain and was twice (in 1842 and 1860) the recipient of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He communicated to that society in 1847 an able paper on a long-period lunar inequality (Memoirs Roy. Astr. Society, xvi. 465), and in 1854 one on the Moon's figure, advocating the mistaken hypothesis of its deformation by a huge elevation directed towards the Earth (ib. xxiv. 29). He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1850, and his Solar Tables, compiled with the assistance of Christian Olufsen, appeared in 1854. Hansen gave in 1854 the first intimation that the accepted distance of the sun was too great by some millions of miles (Month. Notices Roy. Astr. Soc. xv. 9), the error of J.F. Encke's result having been rendered evident through his investigation of a lunar inequality.[2] In 1865, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]/nHe died on 28 March 1874, at the new observatory in the town of Gotha, erected under his care in 1857.[2]/nMinor planet 4775 Hansen is named after him.[7]", "3318467": "Franz Leopold Alt (November 30, 1910 \u2013 July 21, 2011) was an Austrian-born American mathematician who made major contributions to computer science in its early days.  He was best known as one of the founders of the Association for Computing Machinery, and served as its president from 1950 to 1952./nAlt was born in Vienna, Austria, on November 30, 1910 to a secular Jewish family.  He received a PhD in mathematics in 1932 from the University of Vienna, with a thesis entitled Metrische Definition der Kr\u00fcmmung einer Kurve (\"Metrical Definition of the Curvature of a Curve\"). His principal teachers were Hans Hahn and Karl Menger. He was one of the regular participants in, and contributors to, Menger's \"Mathematisches Kolloquium.\" [Afterword, Karl Menger, Ergebnisse eines Mathematischen Kolloquiums, Springer-Verlag/Wien, 1998] Alt engaged in research in set-theoretic topology  and logical foundations of geometry./nIn addition, in the next few years he became interested in econometrics, stimulated by Oskar Morgenstern, then professor of economics at the University of Vienna, later at Princeton University.  In 1936, Alt developed an axiomatic foundation for economic concepts, described in \"Ueber die Messbarkeit des Nutzens,\" which he presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo (published in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie, VII/2, 1936; in German). The English translation of this paper was published as \"On the Measurability of Utility\" in Preferences, Utility, and Demand: A Minnesota Symposium (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1971)./nAlt left Austria at the time of its occupation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and came to New York City with his wife Alice Modern, whom he married just before leaving Vienna. In the next few years it was their highest priority to save relatives and friends endangered by the Nazi terror in Austria or Germany. This involved finding Americans willing to serve as sponsors for immigration visas, and they were successful in helping about 30 adults and children to escape./nBetween 1938 and 1946 Alt worked for six years at the Econometric Institute in New York City, interrupted by two years of service in the United States Army. At the Econometric Institute he served successively as Research Principal and Assistant Director of Research engaged in the analysis of economic time series by methods such as multiple correlation, used for business forecasting.  He was concerned with the use of mathematical and statistical methods for the study and forecasting of business conditions in the economy as a whole and in a number of industries, commodity and security markets.  One of the clients advised by Alt was the General Motors Corporation./nWhen the United States entered World War II, he volunteered for military service but was at first rejected as an alien; he was drafted into the Army in 1943. (Citizenship was granted in 1944.) He then served in the elite 10th Mountain Division, trained for skiing, rock climbing and mountain fighting. On the weekends, Alt liked to go out alone or with a friend to ski cross-country or climb the peaks near Camp Hale; his field notes on three of these climbs were published in \"Appalachia,\" the journal of the Appalachian Mountain Club, Summer/Fall 2014. Toward the end of the war he graduated from officers' training as a Second Lieutenant./nWhile in military service he was assigned to the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1945, in charge of planning for electronic computation. On discharge from the Army, he returned to the Econometric Institute for one year.  As a civilian he returned to Aberdeen in 1946\u201348, and was Deputy Chief of the Computing Laboratory, which was a general-purpose mathematical service organization operating large digital and analog computing machines, punched card installation, and data reduction facility./nAs Deputy Chief of the Computation Laboratory (1948\u201352), then of the Applied Mathematics Division (1952\u201367), he directed the early use of computers throughout the National Bureau of Standards and elsewhere in the federal government, as well as research in numerical analysis, statistical engineering and some other branches of applied mathematics. From 1959 to 1961, he was one of the editors of the NBS Journal of Research./nFor several years he also served as administrator of the Bureau of Standards' program to award research grants in physics and chemistry in India, Pakistan and Israel, where foreign currency (PL 480) available for such purposes had been allocated to the Bureau./nAlso during this time, he became interested in the use of computers for automatic translation of languages. This led to the founding of the Association for Computational Linguistics and to the organization of two international meetings jointly with a similar group in Japan, one in Washington, D.C., the other in Tokyo./nAlt has a long history with the Association for Computing Machinery, known as the ACM. He was one of its founders and served as its third president (1950\u201352). He was editor of its Journal (1954\u201358). Alt was the first recipient of its Distinguished Service Award (1970). In 1994, he was in the first group to be inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. Alt represented ACM on the National Research Council from 1961 to 1964. He is also a member of the American Mathematical Society, and formerly a member of the American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Econometric Society, and Association for Computational Linguistics./nAlt has written and been interviewed about the history of ACM several times.

He discussed the need for, and likely impact of, electronic computing.  He mentioned the \"new programming method\" for ENIAC and explained that its seemingly small vocabulary was in fact ample; that future computers, then in the design stage, would get along on a dozen instruction types, and this was known to be adequate for expressing all of mathematics ... Von Neumann went on to say that one need not be surprised at this small number, since about 1,000 words were known to be adequate for most situations of real life, and mathematics was only a small part of life, and a very simple part at that.  This caused some hilarity in the audience, which provoked von Neumann to say: \"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.\"/nAlt was interviewed in 1995 by Janet Benton (excerpted as \"Franz Alt Remembers the Early Years of Computing and the Creation of ACM,\" ACMMemberNet Supplement to Communications of the ACM, Feb. 1996, Vol. 39 #2)./nFor JACM's 50th Anniversary, he contributed \"Journal of the ACM\u2013The Beginnings\" (Journal of the ACM, Jan. 2003, Vol. 50 #1)./nACM interviewed former presidents, including an interview with Alt by Atsushi Akera in 2006; to access this and much other ACM material by and about Alt, go to acm.org and search \"Franz L.

There he was instrumental in establishing a computerized information system on papers in the physics journal literature, including hierarchical classification, subject indexing and a citation index./nAfter his retirement in 1973, he did volunteer work for peace and justice organizations, with an emphasis on work for peace in Southeast Asia and anti-nuclear work, particularly for Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam (1976\u201391) [Sheila Collins, \"A Man for All Seasons: A Tribute to Franz Alt,\" CALC Report, October 1988]. Throughout he continued to pursue his lifelong hobbies of hiking, climbing and skiing, as well as playing violin and viola in chamber music. Janet Hays interviewed him for her book \"Retire in New York City \u2013 Even If you\u2032re Not Rich\" (Chicago: Bonus Books, 2002).

Klasse,\" the highest distinction for science and art in Austria.  In a symposium in the University Dr. Karl Sigmund, professor of mathematics of the University of Vienna, spoke of Alt's place in the history of mathematics in Vienna between the wars.  Dr. Walter Schachermayer, then of the Vienna University of Technology, spoke about Alt's paper \"On the Measurement of Utility,\" presented at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo in 1936, and its relation to the work of John von Neumann, Oskar Morgenstern and Kenneth Arrow, and recent developments in the notion of coherent risk measures.[4]/nWhile he was in Vienna in May 2007, Alt spoke to students of his old gymnasium, the Stubenbastei.[5]  The school established the Franz Alt Preis in his honor.

He was first appointed to the Imperial Astronomy Bureau to help institute a calendar reform. He eventually ascended to deputy of the Imperial Astronomy Bureau and designed the Linde calendar. His father was an educated state official and also a Taoist. Li died in Chang'an in 670./nThe Sui dynasty was integral for uniting China, so it was a good time for learning. But when Li was sixteen the Sui fell, and the Tang rose. Nevertheless, the Tang did not harm the conditions for education. Indeed, it rather strengthened it. The Imperial Academy's math teaching was formalized. He was appointed into the Imperial Astronomy Bureau as an advanced court astronomer and historian, in 627. Once several years had passed, he then was promoted to deputy director of the Imperial Astronomy Bureau in 641, and even director in 648. He was given these titles because the Chinese calendar of the era, despite that it had only been used for several years, was already having accuracy problems in predicting eclipses. In fact, Li was appointed partially because of his critique of the Wuyin calendar. Wang Xiaotong had been chosen to study the problem earlier. This was a very important job because of the Chinese belief in the Mandate of Heaven. So if one altered the calendar, that person would have some control over the connection between the heavens and the emperor./nIn 665, Li introduced a reform calendar. It was called the Linde calendar. It improved the prediction of planets' positions and included an \u201cintercalary month.\u201d That is similar to the idea of a leap day. It would catch up a lunar year to a solar year because twelve lunar months are 1.3906 days short of one solar year. It was added every three years. The Linde calendar is the most prominent accomplishment of Li./nLi wrote a document complaining about the use of outdated equipment in the Imperial Astronomy Bureau, so he was commanded to construct a new armillary sphere. He completed it in 633. His construction had an additional third ring as opposed to the more common design of only two rings./nLi added corrections to certain mathematical works. Examples of this are in Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art by Liu Hui. He demonstrated that the least common multiple of the numbers {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12} was 27720\u2014the answer was flawed in the original text of Nine Chapters. Yet another instance of this was in Zu Geng's work about the area of a circle.[1] Li gave 22/7 (=3.142857 repeating) instead of 3 as a better approximation of what we know now as pi. He began each annotation with the words \u201cYour servant, Chunfeng, and his collaborators comment respectfully on\u2026\u201d Li did write some mathematical works of his own, little is known about them. They are usually dismissed as unimportant in comparison to his other accomplishments. With Liang Shu and Wang Zhenru, he wrote Shibu Suanjing (\u5341\u90e8\u7b97\u7ecf) in 656. These were ten mathematical manuals submitted to the emperor./nLi contributed to the Book of Sui and Book of Jin, which cover the history of the Sui and Jin dynasties. He wrote about the discoveries in astrology, metrology, and music. These are the official histories of the periods. The book Massage-Chart Prophecies (Tui bei tu) is generally credited to Li. The book is a collaboration of attempts to predict the future using numerology. Therefore, Li is often thought of as being a prophet. The book gets it title from a poem near the end, discussing how much time it would take to tell the story of thousands of years, it would be better to take a break and enjoy a massage. Circa 640, Li wrote the Ganying jing \u611f\u61c9\u7d93 to elaborate the concept of ganying cosmic correspondence. Li wrote a book discussing the importance of astrology in Chinese culture called Yisizhan in 645. This is around when he would have been working on the Linde calendar.

He founded what has been called the British algebra of logic./nPeacock was born on 9 April 1791 at Thornton Hall, Denton, near Darlington, County Durham.[1] His father, Thomas Peacock, was a priest of the Church of England, incumbent and for 50 years curate of the parish of Denton, where he also kept a school. In early life Peacock did not show any precocity of genius, and was more remarkable for daring feats of climbing than for any special attachment to study. Initially, he received his elementary education from his father and then at Sedbergh School,[2] and at 17 years of age, he was sent to Richmond School under James Tate, a graduate of Cambridge University. At this school he distinguished himself greatly both in classics and in the rather elementary mathematics then required for entrance at Cambridge. In 1809 he became a student of Trinity College, Cambridge.[3]/nIn 1812 Peacock took the rank of Second Wrangler, and the second Smith's prize, the senior wrangler being John Herschel. Two years later he became a candidate for a fellowship in his college and won it immediately, partly by means of his extensive and accurate knowledge of the classics. A fellowship then meant about 200 pounds a year, tenable for seven years provided the Fellow did not marry meanwhile, and capable of being extended after the seven years provided the Fellow took clerical orders, which Peacock did in 1819./nThe year after taking a Fellowship, Peacock was appointed a tutor and lecturer of his college, which position he continued to hold for many years. Peacock, in common with many other students of his own standing, was profoundly impressed with the need of reforming Cambridge's position ignoring the differential notation for calculus, and while still an undergraduate formed a league with Babbage and Herschel to adopt measures to bring it about. In 1815 they formed what they called the Analytical Society, the object of which was stated to be to advocate the d 'ism of the Continent versus the dot-age of the university./nThe first movement on the part of the Analytical Society was to translate from the French the smaller work of Lacroix on the differential and integral calculus; it was published in 1816.[4] At that time the French language had the best manuals, as well as the greatest works on mathematics. Peacock followed up the translation with a volume containing a copious Collection of Examples of the Application of the Differential and Integral Calculus, which was published in 1820.[5] The sale of both books was rapid, and contributed materially to further the object of the Society. In that time, high wranglers of one year became the examiners of the mathematical tripos three or four years afterwards. Peacock was appointed an examiner in 1817, and he did not fail to make use of the position as a powerful lever to advance the cause of reform. In his questions set for the examination the differential notation was for the first time officially employed in Cambridge. The innovation did not escape censure, but he wrote to a friend as follows: \"I assure you that I shall never cease to exert myself to the utmost in the cause of reform, and that I will never decline any office which may increase my power to effect it. I am nearly certain of being nominated to the office of Moderator in the year 1818-1819, and as I am an examiner in virtue of my office, for the next year I shall pursue a course even more decided than hitherto, since I shall feel that men have been prepared for the change, and will then be enabled to have acquired a better system by the publication of improved elementary books. I have considerable influence as a lecturer, and I will not neglect it. It is by silent perseverance only, that we can hope to reduce the many-headed monster of prejudice and make the University answer her character as the loving mother of good learning and science.\" These few sentences give an insight into the character of Peacock: he was an ardent reformer and a few years brought success to the cause of the Analytical Society./nAnother reform at which Peacock labored was the teaching of algebra. In 1830 he published A Treatise on Algebra which had for its object the placing of algebra on a true scientific basis, adequate for the development which it had received at the hands of the Continental mathematicians. To elevate astronomical science the Astronomical Society of London was founded, and the three reformers Peacock, Babbage and Herschel were again prime movers in the undertaking. Peacock was one of the most zealous promoters of an astronomical observatory at Cambridge, and one of the founders of the Philosophical Society of Cambridge./nIn 1831 the British Association for the Advancement of Science (prototype of the American, French and Australasian Associations) held its first meeting in the ancient city of York. One of the first resolutions adopted was to procure reports on the state and progress of particular sciences, to be drawn up from time to time by competent persons for the information of the annual meetings, and the first to be placed on the list was a report on the progress of mathematical science. Whewell, the mathematician and philosopher, was a vice-president of the meeting: he was instructed to select the reporter. He first asked William Rowan Hamilton, who declined; he then asked Peacock, who accepted. Peacock had his report ready for the third meeting of the Association, which was held in Cambridge in 1833; although limited to Algebra, Trigonometry, and the Arithmetic of Sines, it is one of the best of the long series of valuable reports which have been prepared for and printed by the Association./nIn 1837 Peacock was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy in the University of Cambridge, the chair afterwards occupied by Adams, the co-discoverer of Neptune, and later occupied by Robert Ball, celebrated for his Theory of Screws. An object of reform was the statutes of the university; he worked hard at it and was made a member of a commission appointed by the Government for the purpose./nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1818.[6]/nIn 1842, Peacock was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[7]/nHe was ordained as a deacon in 1819, a priest in 1822 and appointed Vicar of Wymeswold in Leicestershire in 1826 (until 1835).[8]/nIn 1839 he was appointed Dean of Ely cathedral, Cambridgeshire, a position he held for the rest of his life, some 20 years. Together with the architect George Gilbert Scott he undertook a major restoration of the cathedral building. This included the installation of the boarded ceiling.[9]/nWhile holding this position he wrote a text book on algebra, A Treatise on Algebra (1830). Later, a second edition appeared in two volumes, the one called Arithmetical Algebra (1842) and the other On Symbolical Algebra and its Applications to the Geometry of Position (1845)./nPeacock's main contribution to mathematical analysis is his attempt to place algebra on a strictly logical basis. He founded what has been called the British algebra of logic; to which Gregory, De Morgan and Boole belonged. His answer to Maseres and Frend was that the science of algebra consisted of two parts\u2014arithmetical algebra and symbolical algebra\u2014and that they erred in restricting the science to the arithmetical part. His view of arithmetical algebra is as follows: \"In arithmetical algebra we consider symbols as representing numbers, and the operations to which they are submitted as included in the same definitions as in common arithmetic; the signs \n\n\n\n+\n\n\n{\\displaystyle +}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -}\n\n denote the operations of addition and subtraction in their ordinary meaning only, and those operations are considered as impossible in all cases where the symbols subjected to them possess values which would render them so in case they were replaced by digital numbers; thus in expressions such as \n\n\n\na\n+\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a+b}\n\n we must suppose \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n and \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n to be quantities of the same kind; in others, like \n\n\n\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a-b}\n\n, we must suppose \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n greater than \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n and therefore homogeneous with it; in products and quotients, like \n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ab}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {a}{b}}}\n\n we must suppose the multiplier and divisor to be abstract numbers; all results whatsoever, including negative quantities, which are not strictly deducible as legitimate conclusions from the definitions of the several operations must be rejected as impossible, or as foreign to the science.\"/nPeacock's principle may be stated thus: the elementary symbol of arithmetical algebra denotes a digital, i.e., an integer number; and every combination of elementary symbols must reduce to a digital number, otherwise it is impossible or foreign to the science. If \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n and \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n are numbers, then \n\n\n\na\n+\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a+b}\n\n is always a number; but \n\n\n\na\n\u2212\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a-b}\n\n is a number only when \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is less than \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. Again, under the same conditions, \n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ab}\n\n is always a number, but \n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {a}{b}}}\n\n is really a number only when \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is an exact divisor of \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. Hence the following dilemma: Either \n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {a}{b}}}\n\n must be held to be an impossible expression in general, or else the meaning of the fundamental symbol of algebra must be extended so as to include rational fractions. If the former horn of the dilemma is chosen, arithmetical algebra becomes a mere shadow; if the latter horn is chosen, the operations of algebra cannot be defined on the supposition that the elementary symbol is an integer number. Peacock attempts to get out of the difficulty by supposing that a symbol which is used as a multiplier is always an integer number, but that a symbol in the place of the multiplicand may be a fraction. For instance, in \n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ab}\n\n, \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n can denote only an integer number, but \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n may denote a rational fraction. Now there is no more fundamental principle in arithmetical algebra than that \n\n\n\na\nb\n=\nb\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ab=ba}\n\n; which would be illegitimate on Peacock's principle./nOne of the earliest English writers on arithmetic is Robert Recorde, who dedicated his work to King Edward VI. The author gives his treatise the form of a dialogue between master and scholar. The scholar battles long over this difficulty\u2014that multiplying a thing could make it less. The master attempts to explain the anomaly by reference to proportion; that the product due to a fraction bears the same proportion to the thing multiplied that the fraction bears to unity. But the scholar is not satisfied and the master goes on to say: \"If I multiply by more than one, the thing is increased; if I take it but once, it is not changed, and if I take it less than once, it cannot be so much as it was before. Then seeing that a fraction is less than one, if I multiply by a fraction, it follows that I do take it less than once.\" Whereupon the scholar replies, \"Sir, I do thank you much for this reason, \u2013 and I trust that I do perceive the thing.\"/nThe fact is that even in arithmetic the two processes of multiplication and division are generalized into a common multiplication; and the difficulty consists in passing from the original idea of multiplication to the generalized idea of a tensor, which idea includes compressing the magnitude as well as stretching it. Let \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n denote an integer number; the next step is to gain the idea of the reciprocal of \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n, not as \n\n\n\n\n\n1\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{m}}}\n\n but simply as \n\n\n\n\n/\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle /m}\n\n. When \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle /n}\n\n are compounded we get the idea of a rational fraction; for in general \n\n\n\nm\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m/n}\n\n will not reduce to a number nor to the reciprocal of a number./nSuppose, however, that we pass over this objection; how does Peacock lay the foundation for general algebra? He calls it symbolical algebra, and he passes from arithmetical algebra to symbolical algebra in the following manner: \"Symbolical algebra adopts the rules of arithmetical algebra but removes altogether their restrictions; thus symbolical subtraction differs from the same operation in arithmetical algebra in being possible for all relations of value of the symbols or expressions employed. All the results of arithmetical algebra which are deduced by the application of its rules, and which are general in form though particular in value, are results likewise of symbolical algebra where they are general in value as well as in form; thus the product of \n\n\n\n\na\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{m}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\na\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{n}}\n\n which is \n\n\n\n\na\n\nm\n+\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{m+n}}\n\n when \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n are whole numbers and therefore general in form though particular in value, will be their product likewise when \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n are general in value as well as in form; the series for \n\n\n\n(\na\n+\nb\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a+b)^{n}}\n\n determined by the principles of arithmetical algebra when \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is any whole number, if it be exhibited in a general form, without reference to a final term, may be shown upon the same principle to the equivalent series for \n\n\n\n(\na\n+\nb\n\n)\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a+b)^{n}}\n\n when \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is general both in form and value.\"/nThe principle here indicated by means of examples was named by Peacock the \"principle of the permanence of equivalent forms,\" and at page 59 of the Symbolical Algebra it is thus enunciated: \"Whatever algebraic forms are equivalent when the symbols are general in form, but specific in value, will be equivalent likewise when the symbols are general in value as well as in form.\"/nFor example, let \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n denote any integer numbers, but subject to the restrictions that \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is less than \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, and \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n less than \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n; it may then be shown arithmetically that \n\n\n\n(\na\n\u2212\nb\n)\n(\nc\n\u2212\nd\n)\n=\na\nc\n+\nb\nd\n\u2212\na\nd\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a-b)(c-d)=ac+bd-ad-bc}\n\n. Peacock's principle says that the form on the left side is equivalent to the form on the right side, not only when the said restrictions of being less are removed, but when \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n denote the most general algebraic symbol. It means that \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n may be rational fractions, or surds, or imaginary quantities, or indeed operators such as \n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\nd\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {d}{dx}}}\n\n. The equivalence is not established by means of the nature of the quantity denoted; the equivalence is assumed to be true, and then it is attempted to find the different interpretations which may be put on the symbol./nIt is not difficult to see that the problem before us involves the fundamental problem of a rational logic or theory of knowledge; namely, how are we able to ascend from particular truths to more general truths. If \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n, \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n denote integer numbers, of which \n\n\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b}\n\n is less than \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n and \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n less than \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n, then \n\n\n\n(\na\n\u2212\nb\n)\n(\nc\n\u2212\nd\n)\n=\na\nc\n+\nb\nd\n\u2212\na\nd\n\u2212\nb\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (a-b)(c-d)=ac+bd-ad-bc}\n\n./nIt is first seen that the above restrictions may be removed, and still the above equation holds. But the antecedent is still too narrow; the true scientific problem consists in specifying the meaning of the symbols, which, and only which, will admit of the forms being equal. It is not to find \"some meanings\", but the \"most general meaning\", which allows the equivalence to be true. Let us examine some other cases; we shall find that Peacock's principle is not a solution of the difficulty; the great logical process of generalization cannot be reduced to any such easy and arbitrary procedure. When \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n, \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n denote integer numbers, it can be shown that \n\n\n\n\na\n\nm\n\n\n\na\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\na\n\nm\n+\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{m}a^{n}=a^{m+n}}\n\n./nAccording to Peacock the form on the left is always to be equal to the form on the right, and the meanings of \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n, \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n are to be found by interpretation. Suppose that \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n takes the form of the incommensurate quantity \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n, the base of the natural system of logarithms. A number is a degraded form of a complex quantity \n\n\n\np\n+\n\nq\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p+q^{\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n and a complex quantity is a degraded form of a quaternion; consequently one meaning which may be assigned to \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n is that of quaternion. Peacock's principle would lead us to suppose that \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nm\n\n\n\ne\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\ne\n\nm\n+\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{m}e^{n}=e^{m+n}}\n\n, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n denoting quaternions; but that is just what William Rowan Hamilton, the inventor of the quaternion generalization, denies. There are reasons for believing that he was mistaken, and that the forms remain equivalent even under that extreme generalization of \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n; but the point is this: it is not a question of conventional definition and formal truth; it is a question of objective definition and real truth. Let the symbols have the prescribed meaning, does or does not the equivalence still hold? And if it does not hold, what is the higher or more complex form which the equivalence assumes? Or does such equivalence form even exist?/nPolitically, George Peacock was a Whig.[10] He married Frances Elizabeth, the daughter of William Selwyn. They had no children./nHis last public act was to attend a meeting of the university reform commission. He died in Ely on 8 November 1858, in the 68th year of his age, and was buried in Ely cemetery.", "238285": "Frank Plumpton Ramsey (/\u02c8r\u00e6mzi/; 22 February 1903 \u2013 19 January 1930) was a British philosopher, mathematician, and economist who made major contributions to all three fields before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein and, as an undergraduate, translated Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus into English. He was also influential in persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the secret intellectual society, from 1921./nRamsey was born on 22 February 1903 in Cambridge where his father Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867\u20131954), also a mathematician, was President of Magdalene College. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875\u20131927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother Michael Ramsey, the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became Archbishop of Canterbury. He entered Winchester College in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at Trinity College. There he became a student of John Maynard Keynes, and an active member in the Apostles. In 1923, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of first class with distinction, and was named Senior Wrangler (top of his class).[2] Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his mathematical and scientific studies. Even as a teenager Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:/nHe was interested in almost everything. He was immensely widely read in English literature; he was enjoying classics though he was on the verge of plunging into being a mathematical specialist; he was very interested in politics, and well-informed; he had got a political concern and a sort of left-wing caring-for-the-underdog kind of outlook about politics./nIn 1923, Ramsey was befriended by Geoffrey and Margaret Pyke, then on the point of founding the Malting House School in Cambridge; the Pykes took Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday and asking him to be the godfather of their young son. Margaret found herself to be the object of his affection, Ramsey recording in his diary:/nOne afternoon I went out alone with her on Lake Orta and became filled with desire and we came back and lay on two beds side by side she reading, I pretending to, but with an awful conflict in my mind. After about an hour I said (she was wearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the Burne Jones style) 'Margaret will you fuck with me?'[3]/nMargaret wanted time to consider his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result, he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. Like many of his contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), Ramsey was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Freud. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted in a letter to his mother that unconscious impulses might affect even a mathematician's work. While in Vienna, he made a trip to Puchberg in order to visit Wittgenstein, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill's experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes's support he became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis./nRamsey married Lettice Baker in August 1925, the wedding taking place in a Register Office since Ramsey was, as his wife described him, a 'militant atheist'. The marriage produced two daughters. After Ramsey's death, Lettice Ramsey opened a photography studio in Cambridge with photographer Helen Muspratt.[4] Despite his atheism, Ramsey was \"quite tolerant\" towards his brother when the latter decided to become a priest in the Church of England.[5]/nIn 1926 he became a university lecturer in mathematics and later a Director of Studies in Mathematics at King's College.\nThe Vienna Circle manifesto (1929) lists three of his publications[6][7][8] in a bibliography of closely related authors./nWhen I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden, both Fellows of Magdalene, first met Ramsey, he expressed his interest in learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language \"in almost hardly over a week\",[9] although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school.[10] Ramsey was then able, at the age of 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein's work and after graduating as Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1923 he made a journey to Austria to visit Wittgenstein, at that time teaching in a primary school in the small community of Puchberg am Schneeberg. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the Tractatus. Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey's copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933./nRamsey and John Maynard Keynes cooperated to try to bring Wittgenstein back to Cambridge (he had been a student there before World War I). Once Wittgenstein had returned to Cambridge, Ramsey became his nominal supervisor.  Wittgenstein submitted the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus as his doctoral thesis. G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell acted as examiners. Later, the three of them arranged financial aid for Wittgenstein to help him continue his research work./nIn 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein regularly discussed issues in mathematics and philosophy with Piero Sraffa, an Italian economist who had been brought to Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused Benito Mussolini's ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the Manchester Guardian. The contributions of Ramsey to these conversations were acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work, the latter mentioning him in the introduction to his Philosophical Investigations as an influence./nSuffering chronic liver problems, Ramsey developed jaundice after an abdominal operation and died on 19 January 1930 at Guy's Hospital in London at the age of 26. There is a suspicion that the cause of his death might be an undiagnosed leptospirosis with which Ramsey, an avid swimmer, could have become infected while swimming in the Cam.[11]/nHe is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge; his parents are buried in the same plot.[12]/nRamsey's notes and manuscripts were acquired by Nicholas Rescher for the Archives of Scientific Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.[13][14] This collection contains only a few letters but a great many drafts of papers and book chapters, some still unpublished. Other papers, including his diary and letters and memoirs by his widow Lettice Ramsey and his father, are held in the Modern Archives, King's College, Cambridge./nOne of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper On a Problem of Formal Logic now bears his name (Ramsey's theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is probably best remembered for, he proved it only in passing, as a minor lemma along the way to his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel\u2013Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is unsolvable and that first-order logic is undecidable (see Church's theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma used by Ramsey in his decidability proof: this lemma turned out to be an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results./nIn 1926,[15] Ramsey proposed a simplification of the Theory of Types developed by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica. The resulting theory is known today as Theory of Simple Type (TST) or Simple Type Theory. Ramsey observed that a hierarchy of types was sufficient to deal with mathematical paradoxes, so removed Russell's and Whitehead's ramified hierarchy, which was meant to elude semantic paradoxes.[16] Ramsey's version of the theory is the one considered by Kurt G\u00f6del in the original proof of his first incompleteness theorem.[17] Ramsey's Theory of Simple Types was further simplified by Willard van Orman Quine in his New Foundations set theory, in which any explicit reference to types is eliminated from the language of the theory.[18]/nHis main philosophical works included Universals (1925), Facts and propositions (1927) (which proposed a redundancy theory of truth), Universals of law and of fact (1928), Knowledge (1929), Theories (1929), On Truth (1929), Causal Qualities (1929), and General propositions and causality (1929). Ramsey was perhaps the first to propose a reliabilist theory of knowledge.[19] He also produced what philosopher Alan H\u00e1jek has described as an \"enormously influential version of the subjective interpretation of probability.\"[20] His thought in this area was outlined in the paper Truth and Probability (discussed below) which was written in 1926 but first published posthumously in 1931.[21]/nKeynes and Pigou encouraged Ramsey to work on economics as \"From a very early age, about sixteen I think, his precocious mind was intensely interested in economic problems\" (Keynes, 1933). Ramsey responded to Keynes's urging by writing three papers in economic theory all of which were of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists./nRamsey's three papers, described below in detail, were on subjective probability and utility (1926), optimal taxation (1927) and optimal growth in a one-sector economy (1928). The economist Paul Samuelson described them in 1970 as \"three great legacies \u2013 legacies that were for the most part mere by-products of his major interest in the foundations of mathematics and knowledge.\"[22]/nIn A Treatise on Probability (1921), Keynes had argued against the subjective approach in epistemic probabilities. For Keynes, subjectivity of probabilities does not matter as much, as for him there is an objective relationship between knowledge and probabilities, as knowledge is disembodied and not personal./nRamsey disagreed with this approach. In his article \"Truth and Probability\" (1926), he argued that there is a difference between the notions of probability in physics and in logic.[21] For Ramsey, probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome./nRamsey suggested a way of deriving a consistent theory of choice under uncertainty that could isolate beliefs from preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities,[23]\nalthough Ramsey later noted that \"taking the whole field of chance events no generalizations about them are possible (consider e.g. infectious diseases, dactyls in hexameters, deaths from horse kicks, births of great men)\".\n[24]/nDespite the fact that Ramsey's work on probabilities was of great importance, no one paid any attention to it until the publication of Theory of Games and Economic Behavior of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 (1947 2nd ed.)[citation needed], although after Ramsey's death, an approach to probability similar to his was developed independently by the Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti.[25]/nThis paper, first published in 1927 has been described by Joseph E. Stiglitz as \"a landmark in the economics of public finance\"[26][27] In the same, Ramsey contributed to economic theory the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable in situations where a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst at the same time ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved at the beginning of the article: \"a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?\"[27] The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.[citation needed]/nDescribed by Partha Dasgupta, in a Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry devoted to it, as \"one of the dozen or so most influential papers of the 20th century\" in the field of academic economics, \"A Mathematical Theory of Saving\" was originally published in The Economic Journal in 1928.[28][29]  It employed, as Paul Samuelson described it, \"a strategically beautiful application of the calculus of variations\"[22] to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest rather than consume so as to maximise future utility, or as Ramsey put it, \"how much of its income should a nation save?\"[29]/nKeynes described the article as \"one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer's mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article is terribly difficult reading for an economist, but it is not difficult to appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together.\"[30] The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for optimal accumulation theory although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication./nThe main contributions of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C. Koopmans and David Cass modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of population growth at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans model where the objective now is to maximise household's utility function.[citation needed]/nThe Decision Analysis Society[31] annually awards the Frank P.

Her uncle was Edward Hutchinson Synge who is credited as the inventor of the Near-field scanning optical microscope and very large astronomical telescopes, based on multiple mirrors.[5]/nHer childhood was split between Ireland and Canada. Both her parents were supportive of her interest in mathematics and science, and it was a woman mathematician, Cecilia Krieger, who had been a family friend for many years who later encouraged Morawetz to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Morawetz said her father was influential in stimulating her interest in mathematics, but he wondered whether her studying mathematics would be wise (suggesting they might fight like the Bernoulli brothers).[3]/nA graduate of the University of Toronto in 1945, Morawetz received her master's degree in 1946 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Morawetz got a job at New York University where she edited Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves by Richard Courant and Kurt Otto Friedrichs. She earned her Ph.D. in 1951 at New York University, with a thesis on the stability of a spherical implosion, under the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs.[3][6] Her thesis was entitled Contracting Spherical Shocks Treated by a Perturbation Method[3]/nAfter earning her doctorate, Morawetz spent a year as a research associate at MIT before returning to work as a research associate at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, for five more years. During this time she had no teaching requirements and could focus purely on research. She published work on a variety of topics in applied mathematics including viscosity, compressible fluids and transonic flows. Even if an aircraft remains subsonic, the air flowing around the wing can reach supersonic velocity. The mix of air at supersonic and subsonic velocity creates shock waves that can slow the airplane./nTurning to the mathematics of transonic flow, she showed that specially designed shockless airfoils could not, in fact, prevent shocks.  Shocks developed in response to even small perturbations, such as a gust of wind or an imperfection in a wing.[7] This discovery opened up the problem of developing a theory for a flow with shocks. Subsequently, the shocks she predicted mathematically now have been observed in experiments as air flows around the wing of a plane.[1]/nIn 1957 she became an assistant professor at Courant.  At this point she began to work more closely with her colleagues publishing important joint papers with Peter Lax and Ralph Phillips on the decay of solutions to the wave equation around a star shaped obstacle. She continued with important solo work on the wave equation and transonic flow around a profile until she was promoted to full professor by 1965./nAt this point her research expanded to a variety of problems including papers on the Tricomi equation the nonrelativistic wave equation including questions of decay and scattering.

The machinery of group actions on real trees, developed by Eliyahu Rips, played a key role in Sela's approach. The solution of the isomorphism problem also relied on the notion of canonical representatives for elements of hyperbolic groups, introduced by Rips and Sela in a joint 1995 paper.[12] The machinery of the canonical representatives allowed Rips and Sela to prove[12] algorithmic solvability of finite systems of equations in torsion-free hyperbolic groups, by reducing the problem to solving equations in free groups, where the Makanin\u2013Razborov algorithm can be applied. The technique of canonical representatives was later generalized by Dahmani[13] to the case of relatively hyperbolic groups and played a key role in the solution of the isomorphism problem for toral relatively hyperbolic groups.[14]/nIn his work on the isomorphism problem Sela also introduced and developed the notion of a JSJ-decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups,[15] motivated by the notion of a JSJ decomposition for 3-manifolds. A JSJ-decomposition is a representation of a word-hyperbolic group as the fundamental group of a graph of groups which encodes in a canonical way all possible splittings over infinite cyclic subgroups. The idea of JSJ-decomposition was later extended by Rips and Sela to torsion-free finitely presented groups[16] and this work gave rise a systematic development of the JSJ-decomposition theory with many further extensions and generalizations by other mathematicians.[17][18][19][20] Sela applied a combination of his JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques to prove that torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups are Hopfian.[21] This result and Sela's approach were later generalized by others to finitely generated subgroups of hyperbolic groups[22] and to the setting of relatively hyperbolic groups./nSela's most important work came in early 2000s when he produced a solution to a famous Tarski conjecture. Namely, in a long series of papers,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29] he proved that any two non-abelian finitely generated free groups have the same first-order theory. Sela's work relied on applying his earlier JSJ-decomposition and real tree techniques as well as developing new ideas and machinery of \"algebraic geometry\" over free groups./nSela pushed this work further to study first-order theory of arbitrary torsion-free word-hyperbolic groups and to characterize all groups that are elementarily equivalent to (that is, have the same first-order theory as) a given torsion-free word-hyperbolic group. In particular, his work implies that if a finitely generated group G is elementarily equivalent to a word-hyperbolic group then G is word-hyperbolic as well./nSela also proved that the first-order theory of a finitely generated free group is stable in the model-theoretic sense, providing a brand-new and qualitatively different source of examples for the stability theory./nAn alternative solution for the Tarski conjecture has been presented by Olga Kharlampovich and Alexei Myasnikov.[30][31][32][33]/nThe work of Sela on first-order theory of free and word-hyperbolic groups substantially influenced the development of geometric group theory, in particular by stimulating the development and the study of the notion of limit groups and of relatively hyperbolic groups.[34]/nTheorem.

From what can be gathered from various documents and testimonies, he became the regular canon of the church of Cremona. In 1432 or early 1433 he entered the Ca' Giocosa, the school of Vittorino da Feltre in Mantua. During his studies he quickly became a close associate of Vittorino./nIn 1440 he was a student of the Faculty of Arts in Pavia, where he probably accompanied Gianlucido Gonzaga (son of the Marquis of Mantua Gianfrancesco), who studied law at the same university. In Pavia he met important Quattrocento Italian humanists, including Francesco Filelfo, Catone Sacco, Giovanni Marliani, and the Greek Scholar Teodoro Gaza./nIn Mantua in 1446, he succeeded Vittorino, who died in that year, as the director of the Giocosa. The Marquis Ludovico Gonzaga entrusted him with the education of his children Federico (1441\u20131484) and Francesco (1444\u20131483). Iacopo left school and the service of the Marquis in 1449, having to bear to Rome to plead \"a certain cause of his\" in front of Pope Nicholas V. In that same year, however, he was back in Mantua, and would move permanently to Rome only after April 1451./nAt the court of Nicholas V, he was entrusted with various scientific tasks, including revising the translation and commentary of the Almagest done by Trapezuntius. This caused a huge controversy between the two humanists that ended with the flight of Trapezuntius from Rome. In addition to this, he was entrusted with the translation of some books of the Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus./nIt is not clear whether Iacopo had already finished his translation of the Archimedean works in his years in Pavia and Mantua.

As part of the Euclidean quantum gravity programme, he discovered many of the known gravitational instantons and classified their properties. In the more conventional Lorentzian approach to gravity, he has studied the behaviour of solitons in gauge theories and General Relativity and has shown how supersymmetry leads to Bogomolny inequalities on the masses and charges.

In later years he became one of the teachers of Mulla Sadra.[5]/nHe wrote over 100 treatises and books in different topics,[1] in Arabic and Persian. A number of architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.[1] These may have included the Naqsh-e Jahan Square and Charbagh Avenue in Isfahan,.[6] He is buried in Imam Reza shrine in Mashad in Iran./nShaykh Baha' al-Din (also spelled Baha'uddin) Muhammad ibn Husayn al-'Amili was born near Baalbek, in Ottoman Syria (present-day Lebanon) in 1547.[4] His family had moved there from a small village near Jezzine.[4] After the execution of al-Shahid al-Tani in 1558, his father's mentor, he and his family moved to the neighboring Safavid Empire; first to Isfahan, and from there to Qazvin, the then Iranian royal capital.[4] At the time, the Safavid realm was ruled by king Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576).[4]  Tahmasp I appointed Shaykh Bah\u0101\u02be\u012b's father to serve as Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m in several important Safavid cities in order to propagate Twelver Shi'ism amongst the population.[4]/nShaykh Bah\u0101\u02be\u012b completed his studies in Isfahan. Having intended to travel to Mecca in 1570, he visited many Islamic countries including Iraq, Syria and Egypt and after spending four years there, he returned to Iran./nShaykh Baha' al-Din died in 1621 in Isfahan.

The ceramics of the wall are made in 1945. It seems that at that time a research is performed about the exact dates, and, therefore, the information about the day is added to the dates.[citation needed]/nAccording to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith scholar \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Ham\u00edd Ishr\u00e1q-Kh\u00e1vari, Shaykh Baha' al-Din adopted the pen name (takhallus) 'Baha' after being inspired by words of Shi'a Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam) and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (the sixth Imam), who had stated that the Greatest Name of God was included in either Du'ay-i-Sahar or Du'ay-i-Umm-i-Davud. In the first verse of the Du'ay-i-Sahar, a dawn prayer for the Ramadan, the name \"Bah\u00e1\" appears four times: \"Allahumma inni as 'aluka min Bah\u00e1' ika bi Abh\u00e1h va kulla Bah\u00e1' ika Bah\u00ed\".[7]/nHis interest in the sciences is also apparent by some of his works and treaties, although many of his astronomical treatises are yet to be studied.[1] He probably have written 17 tracts and books on astronomy and related subjects. The following are some his works in astronomy:/nShaykh Baha' al-Din was known for his proficiency in mathematics, architecture and geometry. A number of architectural and engineering designs are attributed to him, but none can be substantiated with sources.[1]/nShaykh Baha' al-Din is attributed with the architectural planning of the city of Isfahan during the Safavid era. He was the architect of Isfahan's Imam Square, Imam Mosque and Hessar Najaf. He also made a sun clock to the west of the Imam Mosque./nHe is also known for his mastery of topography. One instance of this is the directing of the water of the Zayandeh River to different areas of Isfahan. He designed a canal called the Zarrin Kamar in Isfahan which is considered one of Iran's greatest canals. He also determined the direction of Qiblah (prayer direction) from the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square./nHe also designed and constructed a furnace for a public bathroom, which still exists in Isfahan, known as Sheikh Bahai's Bathhouse. It is said that the furnace was powered by a single candle which was placed in an enclosure, and that the candle burned for a long time, boiling the bath's water. It is also said that according to his own instructions, the candle's fire would be put out if the enclosure was ever opened. It is believed that this happened during the restoration and repair of the building and it was not possible to make the system work again. In fact, Sheikh Bahaei used flammable gases that were naturally produced in a nearby cesspool for heating the bath's water. In 1969-70, the bathroom heating system was excavated and a series of underground pipelines made of sun-dried clay were discovered. Although there are many theories about the working of this heating system, it was concluded recently that he knew about biogas and the network was to guide toilet wells which were common to Iranian's houses and mosques./nIt is said that he designed the Manar Jonban (Shaking Minarets), which still exist in Isfahan; but this edifice was built in the fourteenth century during the Ilkhanid period on the tomb of Amu Abdollah Soqla, a pious Sheikh and Faqeer, who died in that same century./nThe High Council of Cultural Revolution in Iran designated April 23 as the National Architect Day, marking the birth anniversary of Sheikh Bahaei./nIn the Twelver tradition, Shaykh Bahai is regarded as a leading scholar of his age and a mujaddid of the seventeenth century.[8] His erudition won him the admiration of Shah Abbas, and he was appointed the Sheikh ul-Islam of Isfahan after the death of the previous incumbent.[8] He composed works on tafsir, hadith, grammar and fiqh (jurisprudence).[8]/nShaykh Baha' al-Din was also an adept of mysticism. He had a distinct Sufi leaning for which he was criticized by Mohammad Baqer Majlesi.[8] During his travels he dressed like a Dervish[8] and frequented Sufi circles.[8] He also appears in the chain of both the Nurbakhshi and Ni'matull\u0101h\u012b Sufi orders.[8] In the work called \"Res\u0101la fi\u2019l-wa\u1e25da al-woj\u016bd\u012bya\" (Exposition of the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud (Unity of Existences), he states that the Sufis are the true believers,[8] calls for an unbiased assessment of their utterances,[8] and refers to his own mystical experiences.[8] Both his Persian and Arabic poetry is also replete with mystical allusions and symbols.[8] At the same time, Shaykh Baha' al-Din calls for strict adherence to the Sharia as a prerequisite for embarking on the Tariqah[8] and did not hold a high view of antinomian mysticism.[8]/nShaykh Baha' al-Din contributed numerous works in philosophy, logic, astronomy and mathematics. His works include over 100 articles, epistles and books. Shaykh Baha' al-Din also composed poems in Persian and Arabic. His outstanding works in the Persian language are J\u0101mi\u2019-i Abb\u0101s\u012b and two masnavis (rhymed couplets) by the names of Sh\u012br u Shakar (\"Milk and Sugar\") and N\u0101n u Halw\u0101 (\"Bread and Halva\").[citation needed]/nHis other important work is the Kashk\u016bl, which includes stories, news, scientific topics, Persian and Arabic proverbs./nHe also wrote Khul\u0101\u1e63at al\u2010\u1e25is\u0101b (Arabic: \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628, lit. \"Essentials of arithmetic\"), an Arabic textbook that became popular throughout the Islamic world from Egypt to India until the 19th century. It was translated into German in Berlin by G. H. F. Nesselmann and published in 1843.

Brouwer but known to his friends as Bertus, was a Dutch mathematician and philosopher who worked in topology, set theory, measure theory and complex analysis.[2][3][4] Regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century,[5] he is known as the founder of modern topology,[6] particularly for establishing his fixed-point theorem and the topological invariance of dimension.[7]/nBrouwer also became a major figure in the philosophy of intuitionism, a constructivist school of mathematics which argues that math is a cognitive construct rather than a type of objective truth. This position led to the Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy, in which Brouwer sparred with his formalist colleague David Hilbert. Brouwer's ideas were subsequently taken up by his student Arend Heyting and Hilbert's former student Hermann Weyl. In addition to his mathematical work, Brouwer also published the short philosophical tract Life, Art, and Mysticism (1905)./nBrouwer was born to Dutch Protestant parents.[8] Early in his career, Brouwer proved a number of theorems in the emerging field of topology. The most important were his fixed point theorem, the topological invariance of degree, and the topological invariance of dimension. Among mathematicians generally, the best known is the first one, usually referred to now as the Brouwer fixed point theorem. It is a corollary to the second, concerning the topological invariance of degree, which is the best known among algebraic topologists. The third theorem is perhaps the hardest./nBrouwer also proved the simplicial approximation theorem in the foundations of algebraic topology, which justifies the reduction to combinatorial terms, after sufficient subdivision of simplicial complexes, of the treatment of general continuous mappings. In 1912, at age 31, he was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[9] He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome[10] and in 1912 at Cambridge, UK.[11] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1943.[12]/nBrouwer founded intuitionism, a philosophy of mathematics that challenged the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators, who included Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, and John von Neumann (cf. Kleene (1952), p.\u00a046\u201359). A variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics.[13] It is sometimes (simplistically) characterized by saying that its adherents do not admit the law of excluded middle as a general axiom in mathematical reasoning, although it may be proven as a theorem in some special cases./nBrouwer was a member of the Significs Group. It formed part of the early history of semiotics\u2014the study of symbols\u2014around Victoria, Lady Welby in particular. The original meaning of his intuitionism probably cannot be completely disentangled from the intellectual milieu of that group./nIn 1905, at the age of 24, Brouwer expressed his philosophy of life in a short tract Life, Art and Mysticism, which has been described by the mathematician Martin Davis as \"drenched in romantic pessimism\" (Davis (2002), p.\u00a094). Arthur Schopenhauer had a formative influence on Brouwer, not least because he insisted that all concepts be fundamentally based on sense intuitions.[14][15][16] Brouwer then \"embarked on a self-righteous campaign to reconstruct mathematical practice from the ground up so as to satisfy his philosophical convictions\"; indeed his thesis advisor refused to accept his Chapter II \"as it stands, ... all interwoven with some kind of pessimism and mystical attitude to life which is not mathematics, nor has anything to do with the foundations of mathematics\" (Davis, p.\u00a094 quoting van Stigt, p.\u00a041). Nevertheless, in 1908:/n\"After completing his dissertation, Brouwer made a conscious decision to temporarily keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\" (Davis (2000), p.\u00a095); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert\u2014the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict\u2014admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam (Davis, p.\u00a096). It was then that \"Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism \" (ibid)./nHe was combative as a young man. According to Mark van Atten, this pugnacity reflected his combination of independence, brilliant, high moral standards and extreme sensitivity to issues of justice.[4] He was involved in a very public and eventually demeaning controversy in the later 1920s with Hilbert over editorial policy at Mathematische Annalen, at that time a leading learned journal. According to Abraham Fraenkel,  Brouwer espoused Germanic Aryanness and Hilbert removed him from the editorial board of  Mathematische Annalen after Brouwer objected to contributions from Ostjuden.[17] Brouwer was accused of being a Nazi collaborator, for which there is no evidence.  He retained his Jewish assistant  Hans Freudenthal  in the 30s,  refused the request of a Nazi to remove Jewish mathematicians from the board of his journal Compositio Mathematica, and hid Jews in his home during the war.  Likewise he took on Daniel Kan, who had survived Bergen-Belsen,  as his assistant in 1948.[18] However, Brouwer did encourage his students to sign a loyalty oath to the Nazis in 1943.[19]/nIn later years, he became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting. Dutch mathematician and historian of mathematics Bartel Leendert van der Waerden attended lectures given by Brouwer in later years, and commented: \"Even though his most important research contributions were in topology, Brouwer never gave courses in topology, but always on\u2014and only on\u2014the foundations of his intuitionism. It seemed that he was no longer convinced of his results in topology because they were not correct from the point of view of intuitionism, and he judged everything he had done before, his greatest output, false according to his philosophy.\"[20]/nAbout his last years, Davis (2002) remarks:", "12755808": "Gisiro Maruyama (\u4e38\u5c71 \u5100\u56db\u90ce, Maruyama Gishir\u014d, April 4, 1916 \u2013 July 5, 1986)[1] was a Japanese mathematician, noted for his contributions to the study of stochastic processes. The Euler\u2013Maruyama method for the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations bears his name./nMaruyama was born in 1916 and graduated from Tohoku University, where he studied Fourier analysis and physics. He began his mathematical work with a paper on Fourier analysis in 1939.[2]\nHe became interested in probability theory through the study of Norbert Wiener's work. He was appointed Assistant professor at the Kyushu University in 1941./nWhen Kiyosi It\u00f4 published his papers on stochastic differential equations in 1942, Maruyama immediately recognized the importance of this work and soon published a series of papers on stochastic differential equations and Markov processes.[3]\nMaruyama is known in particular for his 1955 study of the convergence properties of the finite-difference approximations for the numerical solution of stochastic differential equations, now known as the Euler\u2013Maruyama method.[4]\nIn harmonic analysis, he studied the ergodicity and mixing properties of stationary stochastic processes in terms of their spectral properties.[5]\nMaruyama also studied quasi-invariance properties of the Wiener measure, extending previous work by Cameron and Martin to diffusion processes./n/nThis article about a Japanese scientist is a stub.

His thirty-five small landscape etchings, made between 1545 and 1549, assured him a place in the Danube School, a circle of artists in 16th-century Bavaria and Austria./nHe began work in his birthplace, Nuremberg, where he was trained in glass painting by his father, Veit Hirschvogel the elder (1461\u20131525), who was the city's official stained glass painter. In 1525, Nuremberg accepted the Protestant Reformation, putting an end to lavish stained glass commissions. Veit the elder's workshop was then being run by Augustin's elder brother Veit; their father died the same year. The younger Hirschvogel had his own workshop by 1530, and soon formed a partnership with the potters Oswald Reinhart and Hanns Nickel.[citation needed]/nHirschvogel left in 1536 for Laibach (the German name for Ljubljana in present-day Slovenia), returning to Nuremberg in 1543. During this period he produced his earliest known work as a cartographer: maps of Turkish borders (1539) and of Austria (1542), the latter made for Ferdinand I. His commissions for armorials (for Franz Igelshofer and Christoph Khevenh\u00fcller) show that he had been in contact with the Imperial Court of Vienna by 1543./nWith his move to Vienna in 1544, he rendered his services to the city, court, and citizenry. The city employed him in 1547 to develop designs for bastions, to create etched views of Vienna, and to produce a plan for the city following the Siege of Vienna. These views were the first ever rendered according to scale, and the circular city plan was the first ever produced by triangulation, a system of surveying that Hirschvogel developed.[1] Vienna's council sent him to explain his work to Ferdinand I in Prague and to Charles V in Augsburg; Ferdinand granted him a pension of 100 florins for it./nHe died in Vienna in 1553.[2]/nHirschvogel took up etching late in his career, and almost all of his prints date from the last decade of his life, when he resided in Vienna. His etchings, numbering about 300, \"reflect his concern with Italianate problems of space, form, and ornament\",[3] and include portraiture, cartography, and book ornamentation. He was among the first etchers to use copper rather than iron plates. He contributed 23 etchings to Sigismund von Herberstein's 1549 edition of Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii (Notes on Muscovite Affairs), and more than 100 Old and New Testament illustrations for the verses of Hungarian reformer P\u00e9ter Per\u00e9nyi (1502\u201348). A series of 53 hunting scenes for stained glass are of questionable authorship, but Peters asserts that they are by Hirschvogel. Hirschvogel is credited with the single authentic portrait of the Swiss physician Paracelsus, but this attribution is not certain.[4]/nHis pen-and-ink landscapes have been described as \"strong but light, sure but delicate\".[5] The lack of shadow in his landscapes contributes to a tranquil, idyllic mood. Almost 100 drawings are attributed to him; some are likely not his own, but are similar in style to his or Wolf Huber's work. His art shows the influence of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Albrecht Altdorfer, Sebald Beham, Hans Burgkmair, and Agostino del Musi\u2014some of whom had provided his father's workshop with designs."}
