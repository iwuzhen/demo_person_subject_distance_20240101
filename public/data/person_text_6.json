This book, proving the Mohr\u2013Mascheroni theorem 125 years earlier than Lorenzo Mascheroni, would languish in obscurity until its rediscovery in 1928.[3] Mohr served in Franco-Dutch War in 1672\u20131673, and was taken prisoner by the French.[1][2] By 1673, he had published his second book, Compendium Euclidis Curiosi.[2] A third book was later mentioned by Mohr's son; for many years this was believed to be the Gegen\u00fcbung auf Compendium Euclidis Curiosi but Andersen & Meyer (1985) argue that it must be a different book, and that the Gegen\u00fcbung has a different author.[1][4] As well as his work on geometry, Mohr contributed to the theory of nested radicals, with the aim of simplifying Cardano's formula for the roots of a cubic polynomial.[4]/nWhile in the Netherlands, Mohr became a friend of Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus.

He is also viewed as the most important intellectual of his time \u2013 \"the leading light of the ninth-century renaissance\".[4] He was a central figure in both the conversion of the Slavs to Christianity and the Photian schism,[5] and is considered \"[t]he great systematic compiler of the Eastern Church, who occupies a similar position to that of Gratian in the West,\"  and whose \"collection in two parts...formed and still forms the classic source of ancient Church Law for the Greek Church.\"[2]/nPhotios was a well-educated man from a noble Constantinopolitan family. Photios's great uncle was a previous patriarch of Constantinople, Saint Tarasius.[6] He intended to be a monk, but chose to be a scholar and statesman instead. In 858, Emperor Michael III (r. 842\u2013867) decided to confine Patriarch Ignatius in order to force him into resignation, and Photios, still a layman, was appointed to replace him.[7] Amid power struggles between the pope and the Byzantine emperor, Ignatius was reinstated. Photios resumed the position when Ignatius died (877), by order of the Byzantine emperor.[7] The new pope, John VIII, approved Photios's reinstatement.[8] Catholics regard as legitimate a Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic) anathematizing Photios,[7] while Eastern Orthodox regard as legitimate a subsequent Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox), reversing the former.[7] The contested councils mark the end of unity represented by the first seven Ecumenical Councils./nPhotios was canonized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1847./nMost of the popular sources treating Photios's life are written by persons hostile to him. The chief contemporary authority for the life of Photios is his bitter enemy, Nicetas the Paphlagonian, the biographer of his rival Ignatios.[9] Modern scholars are thus cautious when assessing the accuracy of the information these sources provide.[b] Little is known of Photios's origin and early years. It is known that he was born into a notable family and that his uncle Saint Tarasius had been the patriarch of Constantinople from 784\u2013806 under both Empress Irene (r. 797\u2013802) and Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802\u2013811).[10] During the second Iconoclasm, which began in 814, his family suffered persecution since his father, Sergios, was a prominent iconophile. Sergios's family returned to favor only after the restoration of the icons in 842.[11] Certain scholars assert that Photios was, at least in part, of Armenian descent[c] while other scholars merely refer to him as a \"Greek Byzantine\".[12] Byzantine writers also report that Emperor Michael III (r. 842\u2013867) once angrily called Photios \"Khazar-faced\", but whether this was a generic insult or a reference to his ethnicity is unclear.[13]/nAlthough Photios had an excellent education, we have no information about how he received this education. The famous library he possessed attests to his enormous erudition (theology, history, grammar, philosophy, law, the natural sciences, and medicine).[14] Most scholars believe that he never taught at Magnaura or at any other university;[15] Vasileios N. Tatakes asserts that, even while he was patriarch, Photios taught \"young students passionately eager for knowledge\" at his home, which \"was a center of learning\".[14] He was a friend of the renowned Byzantine scholar and teacher Leo the Mathematician.[16]/nPhotios says that, when he was young, he had an inclination for the monastic life, but instead he started a secular career. The way to public life was probably opened for him by (according to one account) the marriage of his brother Sergios to Irene, a sister of Empress Theodora, who upon the death of her husband Emperor Theophilos (r. 829\u2013842) in 842, had assumed the regency of the Byzantine Empire.[17] Photios became a captain of the guard (pr\u014dtospatharios) and subsequently chief imperial secretary (protas\u0113kr\u0113tis). At an uncertain date, Photios participated in an embassy to the Abbasids of Baghdad.[18]/nPhotios achieved a dazzling reputation as a scholar. In a feud with Patriarch Ignatios, Photios invented a fanciful theory that people have two souls, for the sole purpose of tricking Ignatios into embarrassing himself by being seen to take it seriously, whereupon Photius withdrew his proposal and admitted he had not been serious. The historian John Julius Norwich described this as \"perhaps the only really satisfactory practical joke in the whole history of theology.\"[19]/nPhotios's ecclesiastical career took off spectacularly after Caesar Bardas and his nephew, the youthful Emperor Michael, put an end to the administration of the regent Theodora and the logothete of the drome Theoktistos in 856. In 858, Bardas found himself opposed by the then Patriarch Ignatios, who refused to admit him into Hagia Sophia, since it was believed that he was having an affair with his widowed daughter-in-law. In response, Bardas and Michael engineered Ignatios's confinement and removal on the charge of treason, thus leaving the patriarchal throne empty. The throne was soon filled with a kinsman of Bardas, Photios himself, who was tonsured a monk on December 20, 858, and on the four following days was successively ordained lector, sub-deacon, deacon and priest, and then on Christmas Day, the patronal feast[20] of Constantinople's cathedral, Hagia Sophia, Photios's was consecrated a bishop and installed as patriarch.[21]/nThe confinement and removal of Ignatios and the speedy promotion of Photios at first caused only internal controversy within the Church of Constantinople, and in 859 a local council was held, examining the issue and confirming the removal of Ignatios and election of Photios.[22] In the same time, partisans of Ignatios decided to appeal to the Church of Rome, thus initiating ecclesiastical controversy on an ecumenical scale as the Pope and the rest of the western bishops took up the cause of Ignatios. The latter's confinement and removal without a formal ecclesiastical trial meant that Photios's election was uncanonical, and eventually Pope Nicholas I sought to involve himself in determining the legitimacy of the succession. His legates were dispatched to Constantinople with instructions to investigate, but finding Photios well ensconced, they acquiesced in the confirmation of his election at a synod in 861.[23] On their return to Rome, they discovered that this was not at all what Nicholas had intended, and in 863 at a synod in Rome the pope deposed Photios, and reappointed Ignatius as the rightful patriarch, triggering a schism. Four years later, Photios was to respond on his own part by calling a Council and excommunicating the pope on grounds of heresy \u2013 over the question of the double procession of the Holy Spirit.[24] The situation was additionally complicated by the question of papal authority over the entire Church and by disputed jurisdiction over newly converted Bulgaria.[25]/nThis state of affairs changed with the murder of Photios's patron Bardas in 866 and of Emperor Michael III in 867, by his colleague Basil the Macedonian, who now usurped the throne. Photios was deposed as patriarch, not so much because he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bardas and Michael, but because Basil I was seeking an alliance with the Pope and the western emperor. Photios was removed from his office and banished about the end of September 867,[17] and Ignatios was reinstated on November 23. Photios was condemned by the Council of 869\u2013870, thus putting an end to the schism. During his second patriarchate, however, Ignatios followed a policy not very different from that of Photios./nNot long after his condemnation, Photios had reingratiated himself with Basil, and became tutor to the Byzantine emperor's children. From surviving letters of Photios written during his exile at the Skepi monastery, it appears that the ex-patriarch brought pressure to bear on the Byzantine emperor to restore him. Ignatios's biographer argues that Photios forged a document relating to the genealogy and rule of Basil's family, and had it placed in the imperial library where a friend of his was a librarian. According to this document, the Byzantine emperor's ancestors were not mere peasants as everyone believed but descendants of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia.[26] True or not, this story does reveal Basil's dependence on Photios for literary and ideological matters. Following Photios's recall, Ignatios and the ex-patriarch met, and publicly expressed their reconciliation. When Ignatios died on October 23, 877, it was a matter of course that his old opponent replaced him on the patriarchal throne three days later. Shaun Tougher asserts that from this point on Basil no longer simply depended on Photios, but in fact he was dominated by him.[27]/nPhotios now obtained the formal recognition of the Christian world in a council convened at Constantinople in November 879. The legates of Pope John VIII attended, prepared to acknowledge Photios as legitimate patriarch, a concession for which the pope was much censured by Latin opinion. The patriarch stood firm on the main points contested between the Eastern and Western Churches: the demand of an apology to the Pope, the ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Bulgaria, and the addition of the filioque to the Nicene creed by the Western church.[17] Eventually, Photios refused to apologize or accept the filioque, and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of Boris I of Bulgaria (r. 852\u2013889), the papacy was unable to enforce its claims. Photios also promoted a policy of religious reconciliation with the Armenian kingdom to the east of the empire. He sought to bridge the confessional differences between the Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches on two separate occasions, once in 862 and again in 877, but his efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful.[28]/nDuring the altercations between Emperor Basil I and his heir Leo VI, Photios took the side of the Byzantine emperor. In 883, Basil accused Leo of conspiracy and confined the prince to the palace; he would have even have Leo blinded had he not been dissuaded by Photios and Stylianos Zaoutzes, the father of Zoe Zaoutzaina, Leo's mistress.[29] In 886, Basil discovered and punished a conspiracy by the domestic of the Hikanatoi John Kourkouas the Elder and many other officials. In this conspiracy, Leo was not implicated, but Photios was possibly one of the conspirators against Basil's authority.[30]/nBasil died in 886 injured while hunting, according to the official story. Warren T. Treadgold believes that this time the evidence points to a plot on behalf of Leo VI, who became emperor, and deposed Photios, although the latter had been his tutor.[31] Photios was replaced by the Byzantine emperor's brother Stephen, and sent into exile to the monastery of Bordi in Armenia. It is confirmed from letters to and from Pope Stephen that Leo extracted a resignation from Photios. In 887, Photios and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Theodore Santabarenos, were put on trial for treason before a tribunal headed by senior officials, headed by Andrew the Scythian. Although the sources sympathetic to Photios give the impression that the trial ended without a conviction, the chronicle of Pseudo-Symeon clearly states that Photios was banished to the monastery of Gordon, where he later died. Latin sources confirm that while he did not die in a state of complete excommunication, having been reinstated by a council which was approved by Pope John VIII, his ecclesiastical career was viewed in utter disgrace by Catholic authorities and many of his theological opinions were condemned posthumously.[32]   Yet it appears that he did not remain reviled for the remainder of his life.[33]/nPhotios continued his career as a writer throughout his exile, and Leo probably rehabilitated his reputation within the next few years; in his Epitaphios on his brothers, a text probably written in 888, the Emperor presents Photios favorably, portraying him as the legitimate archbishop, and the instrument of ultimate unity, an image that jars with his attitude to the patriarch in the previous year.[34] Confirmation that Photios was rehabilitated comes upon his death: according to some chronicles, his body was permitted to be buried in Constantinople. In addition, according to the anti-Photian biographer of Ignatius, partisans of the ex-patriarch after his death endeavored to claim for him the \"honor of sainthood\". Furthermore, a leading member of Leo's court, Leo Choirosphaktes, wrote poems commemorating the memory of several prominent contemporary figures, such as Leo the Mathematician and the Patriarch Stephen, and he also wrote one on Photios.[35] Shaun Tougher notes, however, that \"yet Photios's passing does seem rather muted for a great figure of Byzantine history [...] Leo [...] certainly did not allow him back into the sphere of politics, and it is surely his absence from this arena that accounts for his quiet passing.\"[36]/nAfter his death, Photius began to be venerated as saint in environs of Constantinople. His name features in a manuscript of the Typicon of the Great Church of Constantinople dated to the middle of the tenth century, where he is referred to a saint with a day of commemoration of February 6.[37] According to Dvornik, Photius must have been venerated as a saint in the second half of the tenth century at the very latest.[38]/nThe contemporary Eastern Orthodox Church venerates Photius as a saint, with his feast day being February 6.[39][40]/nPhotios is one of the most famous figures not only of 9th-century Byzantium but of the entire history of the Byzantine Empire. One of the most learned men of his age, and revered \u2013 even by some of his opponents and detractors \u2013 as the most prolific theologian of his time, he has earned his fame due to his part in ecclesiastical conflicts, and also for his intellect and literary works.[41][42]/nAnalyzing his intellectual work, Tatakes regards Photios as \"mind turned more to practice than to theory\". He believes that, thanks to Photios, humanism was added to Orthodoxy as a basic element of the national consciousness of the medieval Byzantines, returning it to the place it had had in the early Byzantine period.  Tatakes also argues that, having understood this national consciousness, Photios emerged as a defender of the Greek nation and its spiritual independence in his debates with the Western Church.[43] Adrian Fortescue regards him as \"one of the most wonderful men of all the middle ages\", and stresses that \"had [he] not given his name to the great schism, he would always be remembered as the greatest scholar of his time\".[44] Yet, Fortescue is equally adamant of his condemnation of Photios' involvement in the Schism: \"And yet the other side of his character is no less evident. His insatiable ambition, his determination to obtain and keep the patriarchal see, led him to the extreme of dishonesty. His claim was worthless. That Ignatius was the rightful patriarch as long as he lived, and Photius an intruder, cannot be denied by any one who does not conceive the Church as merely the slave of a civil government. And to keep this place Photius descended to the lowest depth of deceit.\"[45]/nThe most important of the works of Photios is his Bibliotheca or Myriobiblon, a collection of extracts and abridgements of 280 volumes of previous authors (usually cited as Codices), the originals of which are now to a great extent lost. The work is especially rich in extracts from historical writers.[17]/nTo Photios, we are indebted for almost all we possess of Ctesias, Memnon of Heraclea, Conon, the lost books of Diodorus Siculus, and the lost writings of Arrian. Theology and ecclesiastical history are also very fully represented, but poetry and ancient philosophy are almost entirely ignored. It seems that he did not think it necessary to deal with those authors with whom every well-educated man would naturally be familiar. The literary criticisms, generally distinguished by keen and independent judgment, and the excerpts vary considerably in length. The numerous biographical notes are probably taken from the work of Hesychius of Miletus.[17]/nSome older scholarship speculated that the Bibliotheca was compiled in Baghdad at the time of Photius's embassy to the Abbasid court, since many of the mentioned works were rarely cited during the so-called Byzantine Dark Ages c. 630 \u2013 c. 800, and it was known that the Abbasids were interested in works of Greek science and philosophy.[46] However, specialists of this period of Byzantine history, such as Paul Lemerle, have shown that Photios could not have compiled his Bibliotheca in Baghdad because he clearly states in both his introduction and his postscript that when he learned of his appointment to the embassy, he sent his brother a summary of books that he read previously, \"since the time I learned how to understand and evaluate literature\" i.e. since his youth.[47] Moreover, the Abbasids were interested only in Greek science, philosophy and medicine; they did not have Greek history, rhetoric, or other literary works translated; nor did they have Christian patristic writers translated.[48] Yet the majority of works in Bibliotheca are by Christian patristic authors, and most of the secular texts in Bibliotheca are histories, grammars or literary works, usually rhetoric, rather than science, medicine or philosophy. This further indicates that the majority of the works cannot have been read while Photios was in the Abbasid empire./nThe Lexicon (\u039b\u03ad\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae), published later than the Bibliotheca, was probably in the main the work of some of his pupils. It was intended as a book of reference to facilitate the reading of old classical and sacred authors, whose language and vocabulary were out of date. For a long time, the only manuscripts of the Lexicon were the Codex Galeanus, which passed into the library of Trinity College, Cambridge[17] and Berolinensis graec. oct. 22, both of which were incomplete. But in 1959, Linos Politis of the University of Thessaloniki discovered a complete manuscript, codex Zavordensis 95, in the Zavorda Monastery (Greek: \u0396\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1) in Grevena, Greece, where it still resides.[49]/nHis most important theological work is the Amphilochia, a collection of some 300 questions and answers on difficult points in Scripture, addressed to Amphilochius, archbishop of Cyzicus. Other similar works are his treatise in four books against the Manichaeans and Paulicians, and his controversy with the Latins on the Procession of the Holy Spirit.[50] Photios also addressed a long letter of theological advice to the newly converted Boris I of Bulgaria. Numerous other Epistles also survive./nPhotios is also the writer of two \"mirrors of princes\", addressed to Boris-Michael of Bulgaria (Epistula 1, ed. Terzaghi) and to Leo VI the Wise (Admonitory Chapters of Basil I).[51]/nPhotios' epitome of Philostorgius' Church History is the principal source for the work, which is now lost./nThe first English translation, by Holy Transfiguration Monastery, of the \"Mystagogy of the Holy Spirit\" by Photios was published in 1983.[52] Another translation was published in 1987 with a preface by Archimandrite (now Archbishop) Chrysostomos of Etna.[53]/n^\u00a0a:\u00a0The exact dates of Photios's birth and death are not known.

He is perhaps best known for his trigonometric tables and as Nicolaus Copernicus's sole pupil.[3] He facilitated the publication of his master's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres)./nRheticus was born at Feldkirch in the Archduchy of Austria. Both his parents, Georg Iserin and Thomasina de Porris, were of Italian heritage and possessed considerable wealth, his father being the town physician as well as a government official. He was educated by his father until the age of 14 when Georg (Iserin) abused the trust of many of his patients, stealing belongings and money from their homes. In 1528 he was convicted and executed for his crimes, and as a result his family was stripped of their surname.[4]/nThe family adopted the mother's maiden name: de Porris. Later as a student at the University of Wittenberg, Georg Joachim adopted the toponym Rheticus, a form of the Latin name for his home region, Rhaetia, a Roman province that had included parts of Austria, Switzerland and Germany. In the matriculation list for the University of Leipzig his family name, de Porris, is translated into German as von Lauchen. The lunar crater Rhaeticus as well as asteroid 15949 Rhaeticus were named for him.[5]/nAfter Georg Iserin's death, Achilles Gasser took over his medical practice, helping Rheticus to continue his studies and supporting him, eventually going so far as to furnish him with a letter of introduction to Philipp Melanchthon, a theologian and educator who would become a major patron, having reorganized the whole educational system of the Lutheran Protestant parts of Germany, reforming and founding several new universities during the Reformation. This relationship in particular would soon serve him well as Melanchton possibly chose him specifically for the University of Wittenberg. Rheticus studied at Feldkirch, Z\u00fcrich and Wittenberg where he received his M.A. in 1536, after which Melanchthon appointed Rheticus as professor of the lower mathematics, arithmetic and astronomy, at the Wittenberg University./nTwo years later, Melanchthon arranged a two-year leave for Rheticus to study with noted astronomers. Leaving Wittenberg in October 1538, he first went to Nuremberg to visit the professor of mathematics at the Eigidien Oberschule, Johannes Sch\u00f6ner. In Nuremberg he also made the acquaintance of other mathematicians such as Georg Hartmann and Thomas Venatorius as well as the printer-publisher Johannes Petreius. During his journey, probably in Nuremberg, Rheticus heard of Copernicus and decided to seek him out. It is unknown whether he had access to Copernicus' Commentariolus, an unsigned, unpublished outline of Copernicus' revolutionary heliocentric theory that Copernicus distributed to friends and colleagues three decades before he published De revolutionibus, prior to this or perhaps on consulting Sch\u00f6ner who is believed to have persuaded him. From Johannes Petreius Rheticus was given works by Regiomontanus and others, intended as presents for Copernicus. He went on to Peter Apian at the University of Ingolstadt and Joachim Camerarius at the University of T\u00fcbingen, then to his hometown when Rheticus would present Gasser with an edition of Sacrobosco. From Feldkirch he set out on his journey to visit Copernicus in Frombork./nIn May 1539, Rheticus arrived in Frauenburg (Frombork), where he spent two years with Copernicus.[3] Despite the effort invested thus far, Copernicus had not finished a manuscript of his work, apparently choosing to not seek publication, presumably due to issues reconciling such findings with the historically held religious attitudes at the time. Eventually though, he would be swayed to allow Rheticus to author an abstract on his research despite being well aware of the criticism and controversy it could bring.[6] Only following its reception, widely considered the best introduction to Copernicus' work, would he then give Rheticus further permission to edit and publish his work in full.[7] In this, Rheticus would prove integral in utilizing previously forged social connections as well as strategically cultivating new ones just to bring it to publication.[6] It was thus only because of this fortuitous meeting that the heliocentric theory, a concept that would still not be accepted for decades to come, would ultimately be brought to light./nIn September 1539, Rheticus went to Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) to visit the mayor, who gave him financial assistance to publish his Narratio Prima (First Report)[8] of Copernicus' forthcoming treatise. Rhode in Danzig published Narratio Prima in 1540.[6] Unexpectedly, it also contains a eulogy of Prussia. In it, the origins, flora, and fauna of the country are discussed as well as descriptions for several of its cities, regarding their commerce and history, demonstrating that his travels frequently served a twin purpose.[9] While in Danzig, Rheticus interviewed maritime pilots to learn about their problems in navigation. Rheticus also visited Copernicus' friend Tiedemann Giese, who was Bishop of Che\u0142mno (Culm) and further encouraged him to publish the former's work.[10]  At some point, he would additionally become a patron./nIn August 1541, Rheticus presented both a copy of Chorographia (containing a systematic approach to the preparation of maps, distinguishing chorography from geography, discussing various methods of cartographic survey by the use of the compass as well as improvements to the aforementioned instrument) and Tabula chorographica auff Preussen und etliche umbliegende lender (Map of Prussia and Neighboring Lands) to Albert, Duke of Prussia.[9] Knowing the duke had been trying to compute the exact time of sunrise, Rheticus made an instrument that determined the length of the day, and through this favor obtained from him a recommendation to Wittenberg that De revolutionibus be published. Albrecht asked Rheticus to end his travels and return to his teaching position. Rheticus returned to the University of Wittenberg in October 1541, then elected dean of the Faculty of Arts as well as joining the theological faculty. In May 1542, he traveled to N\u00fcrnberg to supervise the printing by Johannes Petreius of the first edition of De revolutionibus in which he included tables of trigonometric functions he had calculated in further support of Copernicus' work, but had to leave in fall to take a position at the University of Leipzig, and Andreas Osiander replaced him. A theologian, Osiander would use this role to add an unauthorized preface in a would-be attempt to avoid censorship, explicitly describing the theory discussed therein as a model of pure hypothesis predicated on assumptions that are coincidentally consistent with the calculations.[11] Towards this, Rheticus would allegedly deface every such copy he came across.[10] Copernicus' major work would eventually be published shortly before his death in 1543.[12]/nIn a work now properly attributed to Rheticus tentatively titled Epistolae de Terrae Motu (Letter on the Motion of the Earth), he attempts to reconcile Copernicanism with scripture by employing St. Augustine's principle of accommodation.[13] According to historian Robert Westman, the Epistolae or also known as the Opusculum, published posthumously and anonymously in 1651,[14] demonstrates that Copernicus and Rheticus recognized the problem of conflict between their finding of earthly motion and biblical scripture, and had therefore developed a systematic defense of compatibility.[13] Written in a moderate tone, he would suggest that the bible only contains that which is necessary for salvation, in doctrine and ethical instruction. Considering this tenet, scripture would then lack reference to any specific matter that may be studied by science, such as the movement of the earth with respect to the sun, with the exception being those facts of nature outside mankind's ability to investigate.[11] Rheticus would further argue that biblical language was written in terms meant to be readily comprehensible to a wide audience:/nIt borrows a kind of discourse, a habit of speech, and a method of teaching from popular usage./nWhile relying heavily upon citations to appease religious authorities, Rheticus may have nevertheless refrained from publishing the work in his life in order to avoid angering more conservative Protestants such as Melanchthon./nIn 1542, Rheticus on the recommendation of Joachim Camerarius in conjunction with Melanchthon was then appointed professor of higher mathematics at Leipzig. Rheticus ended up taking another leave of absence in 1545, departing for Italy although the specifics of his itinerary remain unknown. In 1546\u20137, he would suffer from some unspecified severe mental disorder in Lindau, but recovered enough to return to teaching at Constance towards the latter. By 1551, he would publish some of his work in mathematics, trigonometric tables containing all six functions defined directly in terms of right triangles instead of circles, the first of its kind. While serving in this position, he simultaneously pursued other scholarly interests such as releasing a calendar and ephemeris in 1552 as well as the subsequent year. Then in 1552, Rheticus was found guilty of raping the son of Hans Meusel, a merchant, though the exact nature of this encounter has been called into question. According to Meusel, Rheticus \"plied him with a strong drink, until he was inebriated; and finally did with violence overcome him and practice upon him the shameful and cruel vice of sodomy\".[15]  He fled following this accusation, for a time residing in Chemnitz before eventually moving on to Prague.[10] Rheticus was then found guilty in his trial in absentia and consequently exiled from Leipzig for 101 years as well as having his possessions impounded. As a result, he would come to lose the support of many long-time benefactors including Melanchthon./nOften overshadowed by the facilitative role he played in Copernicus' publications, Rheticus would continue to pursue other scientific endeavors following his exile. 1551\u201352 found him studying medicine at the University of Prague, primarily applying his skills toward treatment of patients without any appreciable contributions to the field. Then in 1553, he was offered a position in mathematics at Vienna where he would travel to ultimately decline the appointment, instead relocating to Krak\u00f3w in 1554 for the next 20 years as a practicing doctor. While there, he continued his work within mathematics and astronomy, further compiling his calculations of trigonomic functions with funding from Emperor Maximilian II with the aid of numerous assistants. The canon of Warmia Georg Donner and the bishop of Warmia Johannes Dantiscus were both patrons of Rheticus. Rheticus was also commissioned to make a staff for King Sigismund II of Poland, while he held a position as teacher in Krak\u00f3w for many years. From there he went to Ko\u0161ice in the Kingdom of Hungary, where he died./nFor much of his life, Rheticus displayed a passion for the study of triangles, the branch of mathematics now called trigonometry. In 1542 he had the trigonometric sections of Copernicus' De revolutionibis published separately under the title De lateribus et angulis triangulorum (On the Sides and Angles of Triangles). In 1551 Rheticus produced a tract titled Canon of the Science of Triangles, the first publication of six-function trigonometric tables (although the word trigonometry was not yet coined).[10] This pamphlet was to be an introduction to Rheticus' greatest work, a full set of tables to be used in angular astronomical measurements.[16]/nAt his death, the Science of Triangles was still unfinished. However, paralleling his own relationship with Copernicus, Rheticus had acquired a student from Wittenberg who sought him out.[10] Valentinus Otho, devoted to completing his teacher's work, oversaw the hand computation of approximately 100,000 ratios to at least ten decimal places. When completed in 1596, the volume, Opus palatinum de triangulis, filled nearly 1,500 pages. Its tables were accurate enough to be used in astronomical computation into the early twentieth century.[17][18]/nRheticus narrates the third part of John Banville's 1975 novel Doctor Copernicus, relating how he convinced Copernicus to publish the book. The novel itself is less about Copernicus's work than about his life and the 16th century world in which he lived./nThe episode \"Claudia\" of the U.S. science fiction series Warehouse 13 references a teleportation device in the form of a compass said to have been built by Rheticus./nRheticus is referenced several times in the song \"Like Rheticus\" on the 2004 album Place by British songwriter Owen Tromans.[19]/nDava Sobel's 2011 book A More Perfect Heaven: How Copernicus Revolutionized the Cosmos features a fictional play about Rheticus' visit to Copernicus, sandwiched between chapters about the visit's pre-history and post-history.", "35964120": "Johannes Gessner (18 March 1709 \u2013 6 May 1790) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, botanist, mineralogist and physician.

He formulated the primitive equations that are still in use in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling, and he developed the so-called Bergen School of Meteorology, which was successful in advancing weather prediction and meteorology in the early 20th century./nBorn in Christiania (later renamed Oslo), Bjerknes enjoyed an early exposure to fluid dynamics, as assistant to his father, Carl Anton Bjerknes, who had discovered by mathematical analysis the apparent actions at a distance between pulsating and oscillating bodies in a fluid, and their analogy with the electric and magnetic actions at a distance.[7] Apparently no attempt had been made to demonstrate experimentally the theories arrived at by the older professor until Vilhelm Bjerknes, then about 17 or 18 years of age, turned his mathematical knowledge and mechanical abilities to the devising of a series of instruments by which all the well-known phenomena of electricity and magnetism were illustrated and reproduced by spheres and discs and membranes set into rhythmic vibration in a bath containing a viscous fluid such as syrup. These demonstrations formed the most important exhibit in the department of physics at the Exposition Internationale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 held in Paris in 1881, and aroused greatest interest in the scientific world.[2]/nVilhelm Bjerknes became assistant to Heinrich Hertz in Bonn 1890\u20131891 and made substantial contributions to Hertz' work on electromagnetic resonance. He succeeded in giving the explanation of the phenomenon called \"multiple resonance,\" discovered by Sarasin and De la Rive. Continuing his experiments at the University of Christiania (1891\u20131892), he proved experimentally the influence which the conductivity and the magnetic properties of the metallic conductors exert upon the electric oscillations, and measured the depth to which the electric oscillations penetrate in metals of different conductivity and magnetic permeability (the \"skin effect\"). Finally, in 1895 he furnished a complete theory of the phenomenon of electric resonance, involving a method of utilizing resonance experiments for the determination of the wavelengths, and especially of the damping (the logarithmic decrement) of the oscillations in the transmitter and the receiver of the electric oscillations. These methods contributed much to the development of wireless telegraphy. His papers on electric oscillations were published in Annalen der Physik (1891\u20131895).[2]/nIn 1895, he became professor of applied mechanics and mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm where he had been lecturer since 1893. There he elucidated the fundamental interaction between fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. His major contribution was the primitive equations which are used in climate models.[8]\nIt was this work that inspired both V. Walfrid Ekman and Carl-Gustav Arvid Rossby to apply it to large-scale motions in the oceans and atmosphere and to make modern weather forecasting feasible. Bjerknes himself had foreseen the possible applications as early as 1904. This attack upon the meteorological problems from a hydrodynamical point of view was after 1906 supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C., of which he became a research associate. Two introductory volumes, Statics and Kinematics, of a greater work, Dynamic Meteorology and Hydrography, were published in 1913 under the auspices of the Institution.[2]/nIn his 1906 work Fields of force, Bjerknes was the first to describe and mathematically derive translational forces on bubbles in an acoustic field, now known as Bjerknes forces.[9]/nIn his Vorlesungen \u00fcber Hydrodynamische Fernkr\u00e4fte nach C. A. Bjerknes Theorie (1900\u20131902) he gave the first complete mathematical and experimental exposition of the discoveries of his father, whose age and excessive self-criticism had prevented him from finishing his work himself. In a later book, Die Kraftfelder (1909), he stated the same theory in a very much generalized form according to methods of his own.[2]/nIn 1907, Bjerknes returned to the Royal Frederick University in Oslo before becoming professor of geophysics at the University of Leipzig in 1912. In 1916, he started the publication Synoptische Darstellung atmosph\u00e4rischer Zust\u00e4nde \u00fcber Europa. In 1917, he founded the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen where he wrote his book On the Dynamics of the Circular Vortex with Applications to the Atmosphere and to Atmospheric Vortex and Wave Motion (1921), and laid the foundation for the Bergen School of Meteorology, which was not a literal school but a school of thought on how the practice of weather forecasting and meteorology should be undertaken.

Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend Columbia University, in New York, from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[1] He then attended the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes in Paris from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modelling of the nervous system.[2] His father's death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies.

His first novel, Makavettas (\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2, 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of Yannis Makriyannis, it follows the plot of Shakespeare's Macbeth, of which the eponymous hero's name is a Hellenized form.

The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel laureate John Nash, British mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah, critic George Steiner and psychiatrist Oliver Sacks. Uncle Petros is one of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.[3]/nDoxiadis' next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel Logicomix (2009), a number one bestseller on the New York Times Best Seller list and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. Logicomix was co-authored with computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou, with art work by Alecos Papadatos (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (colour). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the Comics Journal, called Logicomix \"a tour-de-force\" a \"virtuoso performance\",[4] while The Sunday Times' Bryan Appleyard called it \"probably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel\" he has read.

The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.[6] In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on \"epic theatre\", in other words a theatre based on storytelling.[7] His second play, Incompleteness (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician Kurt G\u00f6del, which G\u00f6del spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned.

To contemporaries he was also known as a mathematician and geometer.[5] Nowadays Piero della Francesca is chiefly appreciated for his art. His painting is characterized by its serene humanism, its use of geometric forms and perspective. His most famous work is the cycle of frescoes The History of the True Cross in the church of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of Arezzo./nPiero was born Piero di Benedetto in the town of Borgo Santo Sepolcro,[1][6] modern-day Tuscany, to Benedetto de' Franceschi, a tradesman, and Romana di Perino da Monterchi, members of the Florentine and Tuscan Franceschi noble family. His father died before his birth, and he was called Piero della Francesca after his mother, who was referred to as \"la Francesca\" due to her marriage into the Franceschi family (similar to Lisa Gherardini who was known as \"la Gioconda\" through her marriage into the Giocondo family). Romana supported his education in mathematics and art.[6]/nHe was most probably apprenticed to the local painter Antonio di Giovanni d'Anghiari, because in documents about payments it is noted that he was working with Antonio in 1432 and May 1438.[7][8] He certainly took notice of the work of some of the Sienese artists active in San Sepolcro during his youth; e.g. Sassetta. In 1439 Piero received, together with Domenico Veneziano, payments for his work on frescoes for the church of Sant'Egidio in Florence, now lost. In Florence he must have met leading masters like Fra Angelico, Luca della Robbia, Donatello, and Brunelleschi. The classicism of Masaccio's frescoes and his majestic figures in the Santa Maria del Carmine were for him an important source of inspiration. Dating of Piero's undocumented work is difficult because his style does not seem to have developed over the years./nPiero returned to his hometown in 1442 and was elected to the City Council of Sansepolcro.[9] Three years later, he received his first commission, to paint the Madonna della Misericordia altarpiece for the church of the Misericordia in Sansepolcro,[9] which was completed in the early 1460s. In 1449 he executed several frescoes in the Castello Estense and the church of Sant'Andrea of Ferrara, now also lost. His influence was particularly strong in the later Ferrarese allegorical works of Cosimo Tura./nThe Baptism of Christ, now in the National Gallery in London, was completed in about 1450 for the high altar of the church of the Priory of S. Giovanni Battista at Sansepolcro. Other notable works are the frescoes of The Resurrection in Sansepolcro, and the Madonna del parto in Monterchi, near Sansepolcro./nTwo years later he was in Rimini, working for the condottiero Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. In 1451, during that sojourn, he executed the famous fresco of St. Sigismund and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta[9] in the Tempio Malatestiano, as well as a portrait of Sigismondo. In Rimini, Piero may have met the famous Renaissance mathematician and architect Leon Battista Alberti, who had redesigned the Tempio Malatestiano, although it is known that Alberti directed the execution of his designs for the church by correspondence with his building supervisor. Thereafter Piero was active in Ancona, Pesaro and Bologna./nIn 1454, he signed a contract for the Polyptych of Saint Augustine in the church of Sant'Agostino in Sansepolcro. The central panel of this polyptych is lost, and the four panels of the wings, with representations of saints, are now scattered around the world. A few years later, summoned by Pope Nicholas V, he moved to Rome, where he executed frescoes in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, of which only fragments remain. Two years later he was again in the Papal capital, painting frescoes in the Vatican Palace, which have since been destroyed./nIn 1452, Piero della Francesca was called to Arezzo to replace Bicci di Lorenzo in painting the frescoes of the basilica of San Francesco. The work was finished in 1464.[10]\nThe History of the True Cross cycle of frescoes is generally considered among his masterworks and those of Renaissance painting in general however they are not universally esteemed \" Piero has no love. His painting reveals a bankruptcy of love. If you have no love and no warmth and no passion, all your cleverness comes to nothing.\" [11] The story in these frescoes derives from legendary medieval sources as to how timber relics of the True Cross came to be found.[10] These stories were collected in the Golden Legend of Jacopo da Varazze (Jacopo da Varagine) of the mid-13th century.[12]/nAt some point, Giovanni Santi invited Piero to Urbino.[13] Between 1469 and 1486 Piero worked repeatedly in the service of Count Federico III da Montefeltro (Duke in 1474).[a] The Flagellation is generally considered Piero's oldest work in Urbino (c.\u00a01455\u20131470). It is one of the most famous and controversial pictures of the early Renaissance. As discussed in its own entry, it is marked by an air of geometric sobriety, in addition to presenting a perplexing enigma as to the nature of the three men standing at the foreground./nAnother famous work painted in Urbino is the Double Portrait of Federico and his wife Battista Sforza, in the Uffizi.[14] The portraits in profile take their inspiration from large bronze medals and stucco roundels with the official portraits of Fedederico and his wife. Other paintings made in Urbino are the monumental Montefeltro Altarpiece (1474) in the Brera Gallery in Milan and the Madonna of Senigallia./nIn Urbino Piero met the painters Melozzo da Forl\u00ec, Fra Carnevale, and the Flemish Justus van Gent, the mathematician Fra Luca Pacioli, the architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and probably also Leon Battista Alberti./nIn his later years, painters such as Perugino and Luca Signorelli frequently visited his workshop. He completed the treatise On Perspective in Painting in the mid-1470s to 1480s. By 1480, his vision began to deteriorate,[14] but he continued writing treatises such as Short Book on the Five Regular Solids in 1485.[b] It is documented that Piero rented a house in Rimini in 1482. Piero made his will in 1487 and he died five years later, on 12 October 1492, in his own house in Sansepolcro.[1] He left his possessions to his family and the church.[citation needed]/nRecently, the Frick Collection in New York until 19 May 2013, collected seven of the eight extant paintings of Piero known to exist in the United States for exhibition. Of the seven pieces in the exhibit, critic Jerry Saltz writing in New York magazine singled out Piero's Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels for its exemplary qualities./nSaltz states that, \"The Virgin and child are elevated two steps. They are in a world itself apart from this world apart. Mary isn't looking at her child and looks instead at the rose he reaches for. You begin to glean the revelation she is having. The flower represents love, devotion, and beauty. It also symbolizes blood and the crown of thorns Christ will wear. This child who will suffer a horrendous death reaches for his acceptance of fate. Mary does not pull the flower back. You sense an inner agony, noticing her deep-blue robe open to reveal scarlet beneath, symbol of outward passion and pain to come. In the dead-center vertical line of the painting is Christ's right palm that will be nailed to the cross.\"/nSaltz accepted this oil painting as the most exceptional work of Piero on display in the exhibit.[15]/nPiero's deep interest in the theoretical study of perspective and his contemplative approach to his paintings are apparent in all his work.[16]\nIn his youth, Piero was trained in mathematics, which most likely was for mercantilism.[17] Three treatises written by Piero have survived to the present day: Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)\u00a0[fr], De quinque corporibus regularibus (On the Five Regular Solids)[c] and De Prospectiva pingendi (On Perspective in painting).[18] The subjects covered in these writings include arithmetic, algebra, geometry and innovative work in both solid geometry and perspective. Much of Piero's work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably Luca Pacioli. Piero's work on solid geometry was translated in Pacioli's Divina proportione, a work illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci. Biographers of his patron Federico da Montefeltro of Urbino record that he was encouraged to pursue the interest in perspective which was shared by the Duke./nIn the late 1450s, Piero copied and illustrated the following works of Archimedes:[19] On the Sphere and Cylinder, Measurement of a Circle, On Conoids and Spheroids, On Spirals, On the Equilibrium of Planes, The Quadrature of the Parabola, and The Sand Reckoner. The manuscript consists of 82 folio leaves, is held in the collection of the Biblioteca Riccardiana[20] and is a copy of the translation of the Archimedean corpus made by Italian humanist Iacopo da San Cassiano.[21]/nBohuslav Martin\u016f wrote a three movement work for orchestra entitled Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca. Dedicated to Rafael Kubelik, it was premiered by Kubelik and the Vienna Philharmonic at the 1956 Salzburg Festival./nPiero's geometrical perfection and the almost magic atmosphere of the light in his painting inspired modern painters like Giorgio de Chirico, Massimo Campigli, Felice Casorati, and Balthus./nFootnotes/nCitations", "6341920": "William S.

He was incorporated at Oxford on 13 July 1619.[7] He accompanied his uncle John to the Synod of Dort in 1618, and kept a diary. He was ordained in 1621. From 1615 to 1625 he was a Fellow of Queens', graduating B.D. in 1624. In 1629 he graduated D.D.[2][6] In the aftermath of the Synod, John Davenant gave Cambridge lectures, significant for hypothetical universalism. They were published only in 1650, the delay being for political reasons; this came about because Edward Davenant sent them to James Ussher, who had Thomas Bedford, another Queens' graduate, edit them (in Latin).[8]/nDavenant held incumbencies at Poulshot, North Moreton and Gillingham, Dorset. He was Treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral from 1634.[6] At Gillingham, he pursued mathematical researches, and took pupils, who included John Aubrey.[9] Aubrey recorded that Davenant was unwilling to publish on mathematics, preferring to keep his interest private. His algebra problems for his daughter Anne have survived in Aubrey's copy.[10] Aubrey later took these problems to John Pell, for solution and commentary. What Davenant preferred was to circulate portions of his work in manuscript.[11]/nAccording to John Walker in Sufferings of the Clergy, Davenant suffered sequestration at Gillingham during the First English Civil War, when his family numbered seven sons and five daughters, being replaced by Thomas Andrews.[12] Writing to Ussher in 1646, during these troubles, Davenant introduced mathematical topics.[13]/nDavenant died on 17 March 1679.[14] A memorial slate is in his parish church at Gillingham.[15]/nDavenant proposed mathematical problems as challenges. One, on approximation to rational numbers by rationals with bounded denominator, was taken up by John Wallis.[16] It led to the development of the theory of continued fractions.[17] John Collins in 1676 named the special case, of rational approximations to \u03c0, after Davenant; and Wallis praised him. Jackie Stedall suggests, however, that Wallis was more concerned with misdirection, resisting the attribution of earlier work in the field to John Pell.[18] Another usage of \"Dr. Davenant's problem\" was to an unrelated question in elimination theory.[19] This latter problem was addressed by Isaac Newton using power series, and is documented in correspondence.[20]/nDavenant's wife's name is given as Catherine.[21] Their daughter Katherine married Thomas Lamplugh in 1663.[22] He had two sons, Ralph and John, and another daughter, Anne;[23] she married Anthony Ettrick, Member of Parliament for Christchurch.[24]", "55854381": "Robert Fernand Bernard, Viscount de Montessus de Ballore (20 May 1870, in Villeurbanne \u2013 26 January 1937, in Arcachon) was a French mathematician, known for his work on continued fractions and Pad\u00e9 approximants.[1][2]/nRobert de Montessus was a viscount, born to a noble family originating in the Ancien R\u00e9gime./nHis father Philippe-Georges de Montessus de Ballore (1825\u20131890) was an officer who was trained at Saint Cyr and then resigned from the army to manage a farm in Charolais./nRobert had three brothers:/nIn 1886, Robert obtained his bachelor of science degree.

Subsequently, in September 1889, he too went abroad, to Paris to receive further education, and to prepare for the entrance exam to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. He got a degree in mathematical sciences from Sorbonne University in 1891. He worked on preparing his doctoral dissertation, and on 21 June 1894 he defended his PhD degree at the Sorbonne, and received a title Docteur des sciences mathematiques (doctor of mathematical sciences).

He then studied at the University of Vienna, where he graduated in 1910 with the dissertation Zum System von 3 Strahlenkomplexen im 4-dimensionalen Raum (The system of 3-rays complexes in 4-dimensional space). After further studies at Bonn and G\u00f6ttingen, he became professor at the University of Graz in 1912.

He settled in Blaricum, where he became a fully accepted member of the community. He was a man of few words, without observable political views. Appearances are often, however, deceptive, and in this case the solid imperturbable exterior hid a considerable amount of frustration resulting from the disastrous course of the First World War. As so many German and Austrian ex-service men, Weitzenb\u00f6ck became a hard-core revanchist, and an implacable enemy of France. But whereas Brouwer actively campaigned for the rehabilitation of German scientists, Weitzenb\u00f6ck refrained from political activity. However, after the \u2018Anschluss\u2019 of Austria in 1938, he started to vent his approval of Hitler\u2019s policies in private conversations. Weitzenb\u00f6ck was elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) in May 1924, but suspended in May 1945 because of his attitude during the war.

Due to his family's background, he was also known as B\u00e4r, Latinized to Ursus (\"bear\")./nReimers was born in Hennstedt and received hardly any education in his youth, herding pigs until the age of 18. Yet, Heinrich Rantzau discovered his talents and employed him from 1574 to 1584 as geometer. Accordingly, Reimers in 1580 published a Latin Grammar and in 1583 his Geodaesia Ranzoviana. Rantzau also arranged a meeting with Tycho Brahe./nFrom 1585 to 1586 he was employed as a private tutor in Pomerania and from 1586 to 1587, Reimers stayed at the court of William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in Kassel, where he met Swiss instrument maker Jost B\u00fcrgi (1552\u20131632). Both were autodidacts and thus had a similar background. As B\u00fcrgi did not understand Latin, Reimers translated Copernicus' De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium into German for B\u00fcrgi. A copy of the translation survived in Graz, it is thus called \"Grazer Handschrift\".[1][2][3]/nReimers was a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe (his successor as imperial mathematician) after he tried to claim the Tychonic system as his own. Tycho complained that Ursus had plagiarized both his system of the world, as well as the publication of the mathematical model of prosthaphaeresis. History has sided with Ursus on the later issue, and he had stated that the technique was the invention of Paul Wittich and Jost B\u00fcrgi./nIn 1588 he claimed to have devised a model of the Solar System where the planets revolved around the Sun, while the Earth only spun around on its axis. In this he differed from Copernicus, who had postulated also that the Earth orbited the Sun. Ursus objected to the Copernican model as it violated the Aristotelian principle of not allowing more than one natural movement by a body./nJohannes Kepler committed a faux pas early in his career by sending a laudatory letter to Reimers while seeking the patronage of Tycho. Ursus published the letter in the preface to his work claiming priority for Tycho's cosmological ideas.[4]/nBut unlike Tycho's geoheliocentric system in which the Earth does not rotate and the Martian and Solar orbits intersect, in that of Ursus and his follower Roslin the Earth had a daily rotation and also the Martian and Solar orbits do not intersect, thus avoiding the Tychonic conclusion in respect of the Martian orbit that there are no solid celestial spheres on the ground that they cannot possibly interpenetrate.[5] But on the other hand the orbits of Mercury and Venus would obviously intersect the Martian orbit in Reimers' illustration of his model, and indeed also intersect Jupiter's orbit./nHowever Kepler discovered Tycho had posited intersecting Martian and Solar orbits because he had mistakenly concluded from his data that at opposition Mars was closer to the Earth than the Sun was. The source of the error was a research assistants' mistaken calculation of Mars's daily parallax from observations during its 1582-83 opposition as greater than that of the Sun's presumed 3' parallax.[6] Kepler discovered Tycho's observations revealed little or no Martian parallax, implying it was further than the Sun at opposition. This would have refuted Tycho's system in favour of Ursus's and Roslin's. It seems it has yet to be determined whether the dominant astronomical system of the 17th century was the geoheliocentric system of Tycho or that of Ursus and Roslin at least in respect of non-intersecting Solar and Martian orbits, and also in that of the Earth's rotation or not./nReimers died in Prague.", "1787193": "Carl Christopher Georg Andr\u00e6 (14 October 1812 \u2013 2 February 1893) was a Danish politician and mathematician.

His only other published works were an article, \"Some Remarks on Logical Form\" (1929); a book review; and a children's dictionary.[a][b] His voluminous manuscripts were edited and published posthumously. The first and best-known of this posthumous series is the 1953 book Philosophical Investigations. A 1999 survey among American university and college teachers ranked the Investigations as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as \"the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations\".[9]/nHis philosophy is often divided into an early period, exemplified by the Tractatus, and a later period, articulated primarily in the Philosophical Investigations.[10] The \"early Wittgenstein\" was concerned with the logical relationship between propositions and the world, and he believed that by providing an account of the logic underlying this relationship, he had solved all philosophical problems. The \"later Wittgenstein\", however, rejected many of the assumptions of the Tractatus, arguing that the meaning of words is best understood as their use within a given language game.[11]/nBorn in Vienna into one of Europe's richest families, he inherited a fortune from his father in 1913. Before World War I, he \"made a very generous financial bequest to a group of poets and artists chosen by Ludwig von Ficker, the editor of Der Brenner, from artists in need. These included Trakl as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and the architect Adolf Loos.\"[12] Later, in a period of severe personal depression after World War I, he gave away his remaining fortune to his brothers and sisters.[13][14] Three of his four older brothers died by separate acts of suicide. Wittgenstein left academia several times: serving as an officer on the front line during World War I, where he was decorated a number of times for his courage; teaching in schools in remote Austrian villages, where he encountered controversy for using sometimes violent corporal punishment on girls and a boy (the Haidbauer incident) especially during mathematics classes; working during World War II as a hospital porter in London; and working as a hospital laboratory technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. He later expressed remorse for these incidents, and spent the remainder of his life lecturing and attempting to prepare a second manuscript for publication, which was published posthumously as the hugely influential Philosophical Investigations./nAccording to a family tree prepared in Jerusalem after World War II, Wittgenstein's paternal great-great-grandfather was Moses Meier,[16] an Ashkenazi Jewish land agent who lived with his wife, Brendel Simon, in Bad Laasphe in the Principality of Wittgenstein, Westphalia.[17] In July 1808, Napoleon issued a decree that everyone, including Jews, must adopt an inheritable family surname, so Meier's son, also Moses, took the name of his employers, the Sayn-Wittgensteins, and became Moses Meier Wittgenstein.[18] His son, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein \u2014 who took the middle name \"Christian\" to distance himself from his Jewish background \u2014 married Fanny Figdor, also Jewish, who converted to Protestantism just before they married, and the couple founded a successful business trading in wool in Leipzig.[19] Ludwig's grandmother Fanny was a first cousin of the violinist Joseph Joachim.[20]/nThey had 11 children \u2013 among them Wittgenstein's father.

Gustav Klimt painted Wittgenstein's sister for her wedding portrait, and Johannes Brahms and Gustav Mahler gave regular concerts in the family's numerous music rooms.[33][34]/nWittgenstein, who valued precision and discipline, never considered contemporary classical music acceptable. He said to his friend Drury in 1930:/nMusic came to a full stop with Brahms; and even in Brahms I can begin to hear the noise of machinery.[35]/nLudwig Wittgenstein himself had absolute pitch,[36] and his devotion to music remained vitally important to him throughout his life; he made frequent use of musical examples and metaphors in his philosophical writings, and he was unusually adept at whistling lengthy and detailed musical passages.[37] He also learnt to play the clarinet in his 30s.[38] A fragment of music (three bars), composed by Wittgenstein, was discovered in one of his 1931 notebooks, by Michael Nedo, director of the Wittgenstein Institute in Cambridge.[39]/nRay Monk writes that Karl's aim was to turn his sons into captains of industry; they were not sent to school lest they acquire bad habits, but were educated at home to prepare them for work in Karl's industrial empire.[40] Three of the five brothers later committed suicide.[41][42] Psychiatrist Michael Fitzgerald argues that Karl was a harsh perfectionist who lacked empathy, and that Wittgenstein's mother was anxious and insecure, unable to stand up to her husband.[43] Johannes Brahms said of the family, whom he visited regularly:/nThey seemed to act towards one another as if they were at court.[21]/nThe family appeared to have a strong streak of depression running through it. Anthony Gottlieb tells a story about Paul practicing on one of the pianos in the Wittgensteins' main family mansion, when he suddenly shouted at Ludwig in the next room:/nI cannot play when you are in the house, as I feel your scepticism seeping towards me from under the door![25]/nThe family palace housed seven grand pianos[44] and each of the siblings pursued music \"with an enthusiasm that, at times, bordered on the pathological\".[45] The eldest brother, Hans, was hailed as a musical prodigy. At the age of four, writes Alexander Waugh, Hans could identify the Doppler effect in a passing siren as a quarter-tone drop in pitch, and at five started crying \"Wrong! Wrong!\" when two brass bands in a carnival played the same tune in different keys. But he died in mysterious circumstances in May 1902, when he ran away to America and disappeared from a boat in Chesapeake Bay, most likely having committed suicide.[46][47]/nTwo years later, aged 22 and studying chemistry at the Berlin Academy, the third eldest brother, Rudi, committed suicide in a Berlin bar. He had asked the pianist to play Thomas Koschat's \"Verlassen, verlassen, verlassen bin ich\" (\"Forsaken, forsaken, forsaken am I\"), before mixing himself a drink of milk and potassium cyanide. He had left several suicide notes, one to his parents that said he was grieving over the death of a friend, and another that referred to his \"perverted disposition\". It was reported at the time that he had sought advice from the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, an organization that was campaigning against Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. His father forbade the family from ever mentioning his name again.[48][49][50][25]/nThe second eldest brother, Kurt, an officer and company director, shot himself on 27 October 1918 just before the end of World War I, when the Austrian troops he was commanding refused to obey his orders and deserted en masse.[40] According to Gottlieb, Hermine had said Kurt seemed to carry \"the germ of disgust for life within himself\".[51] Later, Ludwig wrote:/nI ought to have ... become a star in the sky. Instead of which I have remained stuck on earth.[52]/nWittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was 14\u00a0years old. Subsequently, for three years, he attended a school. After the deaths of Hans and Rudi, Karl relented, and allowed Paul and Ludwig to be sent to school. Waugh writes that it was too late for Wittgenstein to pass his exams for the more academic Gymnasium in Wiener Neustadt; having had no formal schooling, he failed his entrance exam and only barely managed after extra tutoring to pass the exam for the more technically oriented k.u.k. Realschule in Linz, a small state school with 300\u00a0pupils.[53][54][c] In 1903, when he was 14, he began his three years of formal schooling there, lodging nearby in term time with the family of Dr. Josef Strigl, a teacher at the local gymnasium, the family giving him the nickname Luki.[55][56]/nOn starting at the Realschule, Wittgenstein had been moved forward a year.[55] Historian Brigitte Hamann writes that he stood out from the other boys: he spoke an unusually pure form of High German with a stutter, dressed elegantly, and was sensitive and unsociable.[57] Monk writes that the other boys made fun of him, singing after him: \"Wittgenstein wandelt wehm\u00fctig widriger Winde wegen Wienw\u00e4rts\"[38] (\"Wittgenstein wanders wistfully Vienna-wards (in) worsening winds\"). In his leaving certificate, he received a top mark (5) in religious studies; a 2 for conduct and English, 3 for French, geography, history, mathematics and physics, and 4 for German, chemistry, geometry and freehand drawing.[55] He had particular difficulty with spelling and failed his written German exam because of it. He wrote in 1931:/nMy bad spelling in youth, up to the age of about 18 or 19, is connected with the whole of the rest of my character (my weakness in study).[55]/nWittgenstein was baptized as an infant by a Catholic priest and received formal instruction in Catholic doctrine as a child, as was common at the time.[32][page\u00a0needed] In an interview, his sister Gretl Stonborough-Wittgenstein says that their grandfather's \"strong, severe, partly ascetic Christianity\" was a strong influence on all the Wittgenstein children.[58] While he was at the Realschule, he decided he lacked religious faith and began reading Arthur Schopenhauer per Gretl's recommendation.[59] He nevertheless believed in the importance of the idea of confession. He wrote in his diaries about having made a major confession to his oldest sister, Hermine, while he was at the Realschule; Monk speculates that it may have been about his loss of faith. He also discussed it with Gretl, his other sister, who directed him to Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation.[59] As a teenager, Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he abandoned epistemological idealism for Gottlob Frege's conceptual realism.[60] In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately \"shallow\" thinker:/nSchopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end.[61]/nWittgenstein's relationship with Christianity and with religion in general, for which he always professed a sincere and devoted sympathy, changed over time, much like his philosophical ideas.[62] In 1912, Wittgenstein wrote to Russell saying that Mozart and Beethoven were the actual sons of God.[63] However, Wittgenstein resisted formal religion, saying it was hard for him to \"bend the knee\",[64] though his grandfather's beliefs continued to influence Wittgenstein \u2013 as he said, \"I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view.\"[65] Wittgenstein referred to Augustine of Hippo in his Philosophical Investigations. Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows alignment with religious discourse.[66] For example, he would become one of the century's fiercest critics of scientism.[67]\nWittgenstein's religious belief emerged during his service for the Austrian army in World War I,[68] and he was a devoted reader of Dostoevsky's and Tolstoy's religious writings.[69] He viewed his wartime experiences as a trial in which he strove to conform to the will of God, and in a journal entry from 29 April 1915, he writes:/nPerhaps the nearness of death will bring me the light of life. May God enlighten me. I am a worm, but through God I become a man. God be with me. Amen.[70]/nAround this time, Wittgenstein wrote that \"Christianity is indeed the only sure way to happiness\", but he rejected the idea that religious belief was merely thinking that a certain doctrine was true.[71] From this time on, Wittgenstein viewed religious faith as a way of living and opposed rational argumentation or proofs for God.\nWith age, a deepening personal spirituality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion\u2014attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.[72] In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote:/nI have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will.[73]/nIn Culture and Value, Wittgenstein writes:/nIs what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above./nHis close friend Norman Malcolm wrote:/nWittgenstein's mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers.[32][page\u00a0needed]/nToward the end, Wittgenstein wrote:/nBach wrote on the title page of his Orgelb\u00fcchlein, 'To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.' That is what I would have liked to say about my work.[73]/nWhile a student at the Realschule, Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger's 1903 book Geschlecht und Charakter (Sex and Character)./nWeininger (1880\u20131903), who was Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the Platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one \u2013 to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.[74] Wittgenstein, then 14, attended Weininger's funeral.[75] Many years later, as a professor at the University of Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.[76] In a letter dated 23\u00a0August 1931, Wittgenstein wrote the following to G. E. Moore:/nDear Moore,Thanks for your letter. I can quite imagine that you don't admire Weininger very much, what with that beastly translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you. It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you just add a \"~\" to the whole book it says an important truth.[77]/nIn an unusual move, Wittgenstein took out a copy of Weininger's work on 1 June 1931 from the Special Order Books in the university library. He met Moore on 2 June, when he probably gave this copy to Moore.[77]/nDespite their and their forebears' Christianization, the Wittgensteins considered themselves Jewish. This was evident during the Nazi era, when Ludwig's sister was assured by an official that they wouldn't be considered as Jews under the racial laws. Indignant at the state's attempt to dictate her identity, she demanded papers certifying their Jewish lineage.[78]/nIn his own writings, Wittgenstein frequently referred to himself as Jewish, often in a self-deprecating manner. For instance, while criticizing himself for being a \"reproductive\" rather than \"productive\" thinker, he attributed this to his Jewish sense of identity. He wrote: 'The saint is the only Jewish \"genius\". Even the greatest Jewish thinker is no more than talented. (Myself for instance).'[79]/nThere is much discussion around the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews. The issue has arisen in particular regarding Wittgenstein's schooldays, because Adolf Hitler was, for a while, at the same school at the same time.[80] Laurence Goldstein argues that it is \"overwhelmingly probable\" that the boys met each other and that Hitler would have disliked Wittgenstein, a \"stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic upstart\u00a0...\"; Strathern flatly states they never met.[81][82] Other commentators have dismissed as irresponsible and uninformed any suggestion that Wittgenstein's wealth and unusual personality might have fed Hitler's antisemitism, in part because there is no indication that Hitler would have seen Wittgenstein as Jewish.[83][84]/nWittgenstein and Hitler were born just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his mathematics exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so they ended up two grades apart at the Realschule.[53][d] Monk estimates that they were both at the school during the 1904\u20131905 school year, but says there is no evidence they had anything to do with each other.[57][86][e] Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner,[57][91][g]/nWhile Wittgenstein would later claim that \"[m]y thoughts are 100% Hebraic\",[95] as Hans Sluga has argued, if so,/nHis was a self-doubting Judaism, which had always the possibility of collapsing into a destructive self-hatred (as it did in Weininger's case) but which also held an immense promise of innovation and genius.[96]/nBy Hebraic, he meant to include the Christian tradition, in contradistinction to the Greek tradition, holding that good and evil could not be reconciled.[97]/nHe began his studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule Berlin in Charlottenburg, Berlin, on 23 October 1906, lodging with the family of professor Dr. Jolles. He attended for three semesters, and was awarded a diploma (Abgangzeugnis) on 5 May 1908.[98]/nDuring his time at the Institute, Wittgenstein developed an interest in aeronautics.[99] He arrived at the Victoria University of Manchester in the spring of 1908 to study for a doctorate, full of plans for aeronautical projects, including designing and flying his own plane. He conducted research into the behavior of kites in the upper atmosphere, experimenting at a meteorological observation site near Glossop in Derbyshire.[100] Specifically, the Royal Meteorological Society researched and investigated the ionization of the upper atmosphere, by suspending instruments on balloons or kites. At Glossop, Wittgenstein worked under Professor of Physics Sir Arthur Schuster.[101]/nHe also worked on the design of a propeller with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908.[102] At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein's ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein's innovative design was created. Wittgenstein's design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel laminates as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and thus creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.[101]/nWork on the jet-powered propeller proved frustrating for Wittgenstein, who had very little experience working with machinery.[103] Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that/nwhen things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.[104]/nAccording to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing on the design of the propeller \u2013 a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.[103]\nIt was at this time that he became interested in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's The Principles of Mathematics (1903), and Gottlob Frege's The Foundations of Arithmetic, vol. 1 (1893) and vol. 2 (1903).[105] Wittgenstein's sister Hermine said he became obsessed with mathematics as a result, and was anyway losing interest in aeronautics.[106] He decided instead that he needed to study logic and the foundations of mathematics, describing himself as in a \"constant, indescribable, almost pathological state of agitation.\"[106] In the summer of 1911 he visited Frege at the University of Jena to show him some philosophy of mathematics and logic he had written, and to ask whether it was worth pursuing.[107] He wrote:/nI was shown into Frege's study. Frege was a small, neat man with a pointed beard who bounced around the room as he talked. He absolutely wiped the floor with me, and I felt very depressed; but at the end he said 'You must come again', so I cheered up. I had several discussions with him after that. Frege would never talk about anything but logic and mathematics, if I started on some other subject, he would say something polite and then plunge back into logic and mathematics.[108]/nWittgenstein wanted to study with Frege, but Frege suggested he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18\u00a0October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in Trinity College.[109] Russell was having tea with C. K. Ogden, when, according to Russell,/nan unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics & has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me.[107]/nHe was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to C. D. Broad, E. H. Neville, and H. T. J. Norton.[107] Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, until it was time for the evening meal in Hall. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover Lady Ottoline Morrell: \"My German friend threatens to be an infliction.\"[110]\nRussell soon came to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, especially after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November\u00a01911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius:/nSome of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced.[111]/nThree months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell:/nI love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for.[112]/nWittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell's encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein's life.[112] The role-reversal between Bertrand Russell and Wittgenstein was soon such that Russell wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work:/nHis [Wittgenstein's] criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy.[113]/nIn 1912 Wittgenstein joined the Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club, an influential discussion group for philosophy dons and students, delivering his first paper there on 29\u00a0November that year, a four-minute talk defining philosophy as/nall those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof by the various sciences.[114][115][116]/nHe dominated the society and for a time would stop attending in the early 1930s after complaints that he gave no one else a chance to speak.[117]\nThe club became infamous within popular philosophy because of a meeting on 25\u00a0October 1946 at Richard Braithwaite's rooms in King's College, Cambridge, where Karl Popper, another Viennese philosopher, had been invited as the guest speaker. Popper's paper was \"Are there philosophical problems?\", in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one \u2013 \"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers\" \u2013 at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein \"stormed out\", but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion). It was the only time the philosophers, three of the most eminent in the 20th CE, were ever in the same room together.[118][119] The minutes record that the meeting was/ncharged to an unusual degree with a spirit of controversy.[120]/nThe economist John Maynard Keynes also invited him to join the Cambridge Apostles, an elite secret society formed in 1820, which both Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore had joined as students, but Wittgenstein did not greatly enjoy it and attended only infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's raucous style of intellectual debate, its precious sense of humour, and the fact that the members were often in love with one another.[121][failed verification] He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the style of discussion. Nevertheless, the Cambridge Apostles allowed Wittgenstein to participate in meetings again in the 1920s when he had returned to Cambridge. Reportedly, Wittgenstein also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Cambridge Moral Sciences Club./nWittgenstein was quite vocal about his depression in his years at Cambridge and before he went to war; on many an occasion, he told Russell of his woes. His mental anguish seemed to stem from two sources: his work and his personal life. Wittgenstein made numerous remarks to Russell about logic driving him mad.[122] Wittgenstein also stated to Russell that he \"felt the curse of those who have half a talent\".[123] He later expressed this same worry and told of being in mediocre spirits due to his lack of progress in his logical work.[124] Monk writes that Wittgenstein lived and breathed logic, and a temporary lack of inspiration plunged him into despair.[125] Wittgenstein told of his work in logic affecting his mental status in an extreme way. However, he also told Russell another story. Around Christmas, in 1913, he wrote:/nhow can I be a logician before I'm a human being? For the most important thing is coming to terms with myself![126]/nHe also told Russell on an occasion in Russell's rooms that he was worried about logic and his sins; also, once upon arriving in Russell's rooms one night Wittgenstein announced to Russell that he would kill himself once he left.[127] Of things Wittgenstein personally told Russell, Ludwig's temperament was also recorded in the diary of David Pinsent. Pinsent wrote/nI have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these sulky fits/nand/nI am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now than usual/nwhen talking about Wittgenstein's emotional fluctuations.[128]/nWittgenstein had romantic relations with both men and women. He is generally believed to have fallen in love with at least three men, and had a relationship with the latter two: David Hume Pinsent in 1912, Francis Skinner in 1930, and Ben Richards in the late 1940s.[129] He later claimed that, as a teenager in Vienna, he had had an affair with a woman.[130] Additionally, in the 1920s Wittgenstein fell in love with a young Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger, sculpting a bust modelled on her and seriously considering marriage, albeit on condition that they would not have children;  she decided that he was not right for her.[131]/nWittgenstein's relationship with David Pinsent occurred during an intellectually formative period, and is well documented. Bertrand Russell introduced Wittgenstein to Pinsent in the summer of 1912. Pinsent was a mathematics undergraduate and a relation of David Hume, and Wittgenstein and he soon became very close.[132] The men worked together on experiments in the psychology laboratory about the role of rhythm in the appreciation of music, and Wittgenstein delivered a paper on the subject to the British Psychological Association in Cambridge in 1912. They also travelled together, including to Iceland in September 1912\u2014the expenses paid by Wittgenstein, including first class travel, the hiring of a private train, and new clothes and spending money for Pinsent. In addition to Iceland, Wittgenstein and Pinsent traveled to Norway in 1913. In determining their destination, Wittgenstein and Pinsent visited a tourist office in search of a location that would fulfill the following criteria: a small village located on a fjord, a location away from tourists, and a peaceful destination to allow them to study logic and law.[133] Choosing \u00d8ystese, Wittgenstein and Pinsent arrived in the small village on 4 September 1913. During a vacation lasting almost three weeks, Wittgenstein was able to work vigorously on his studies. The immense progress on logic during their stay led Wittgenstein to express to Pinsent his notion of leaving Cambridge and returning to Norway to continue his work on logic.[134] Pinsent's diaries provide valuable insights into Wittgenstein's personality: sensitive, nervous, and attuned to the tiniest slight or change in mood from Pinsent.[135][136] Pinsent also writes of Wittgenstein being \"absolutely sulky and snappish\" at times, as well.[128] In his diaries Pinsent wrote about shopping for furniture with Wittgenstein in Cambridge when the latter was given rooms in Trinity.  Most of what they found in the stores was not minimalist enough for Wittgenstein's aesthetics:/nI went and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various shops ... It was rather amusing: He is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance, Vittgenstein [sic] ejaculating \"No \u2013 Beastly!\" to 90\u00a0percent of what he shewed us![137]/nHe wrote in May 1912 that Wittgenstein had just begun to study the history of philosophy:/nHe expresses the most naive surprise that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes![137]/nThe last time they saw each other was on 8\u00a0October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family:/nI got up at 6:15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early\u2014back to Cambridge\u2014as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7:00\u2014to catch a 7:30\u00a0AM train from New Street Station. It was sad parting from him.[136]/nWittgenstein left to live in Norway./nKarl Wittgenstein died on 20\u00a0January 1913, and after receiving his inheritance Wittgenstein became one of the wealthiest men in Europe.[138] He donated some of his money, at first anonymously, to Austrian artists and writers, including Rainer Maria Rilke and Georg Trakl. Trakl requested to meet his benefactor but in 1914 when Wittgenstein went to visit, Trakl had killed himself.  Wittgenstein came to feel that he could not get to the heart of his most fundamental questions while surrounded by other academics, and so in 1913 he retreated to the village of Skjolden in Norway, where he rented the second floor of a house for the winter.[139] He later saw this as one of the most productive periods of his life, writing Logik (Notes on Logic), the predecessor of much of the Tractatus.[109]/nWhile in Norway, Wittgenstein learned Norwegian to converse with the local villagers, and Danish to read the works of the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.[140] He adored the \"quiet seriousness\" of the landscape but even Skjolden became too busy for him. He soon designed a small wooden house which was erected on a remote rock overlooking the Eidsvatnet Lake just outside the village. The place was called \"\u00d8sterrike\" (Austria) by locals. He lived there during various periods until the 1930s, and substantial parts of his works were written there. (The house was broken up in 1958 to be rebuilt in the village. A local foundation collected donations and bought it in 2014; it was dismantled again and re-erected at its original location; the inauguration took place on 20\u00a0June 2019 with international attendance.)[139]/nIt was during this time that Wittgenstein began addressing what he considered to be a central issue in Notes on Logic, a general decision procedure for determining the truth value of logical propositions which would stem from a single primitive proposition. He became convinced during this time that/n[a]ll the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and all generalizations of tautologies are generalizations of logic. There are no other logical propositions.[141]/nBased on this, Wittgenstein argued that propositions of logic express their truth or falsehood in the sign itself, and one need not know anything about the constituent parts of the proposition to determine it true or false. Rather, one simply need identify the statement as a tautology (true), a contradiction (false), or neither.\nThe problem lay in forming a primitive proposition which encompassed this and would act as the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913,/nThe big question now is, how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic![124]/nThe importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live.[142] Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition by the time of the writing of the Tractatus. The Tractatus does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner,/nEvery tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.[143]/nThis shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.\nAt Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, who was now a Cambridge don, visited him in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein exhausted him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, as an example of how far someone could get in life with \"absolutely no intelligence whatever.\"[144] In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong.[145] When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting Logik as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May\u00a01914:/nIf I am not worth your making an exception for me even in some STUPID details then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I am worth it and you don't do it then \u2013 by God \u2013 you might go there.[146]/nMoore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head.[147] The two did not speak again until 1929.[145]/nOn the outbreak of World War\u00a0I, Wittgenstein immediately volunteered for the Austro-Hungarian Army, despite being eligible for a medical exemption.[148][149] He served first on a ship and then in an artillery workshop \"several miles from the action\".[148] He was wounded in an accidental explosion, and hospitalised to Krak\u00f3w.[148] In March\u00a01916, he was posted to a fighting unit on the front line of the Russian front, as part of the Austrian 7th\u00a0Army, where his unit was involved in some of the heaviest fighting, defending against the Brusilov Offensive.[150] Wittgenstein directed the fire of his own artillery from an observation post in no-man's land against Allied troops\u2014one of the most dangerous jobs, since he was targeted by enemy fire.[149] He was decorated with the Military Merit with Swords on the Ribbon, and was commended by the army for \"exceptionally courageous behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism\" that \"won the total admiration of the troops\".[151] In January\u00a01917, he was sent as a member of a howitzer regiment to the Russian front, where he won several more medals for bravery including the Silver Medal for Valour, First Class.[152] In 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant and sent to the Italian front as part of an artillery regiment. For his part in the final Austrian offensive of June\u00a01918, he was recommended for the Gold Medal for Valour, one of the highest honours in the Austrian army, but was instead awarded the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords\u2014it being decided that this particular action, although extraordinarily brave, had been insufficiently consequential to merit the highest honour.[153]/nThroughout the war, he kept notebooks in which he frequently wrote philosophical reflections alongside personal remarks, including his contempt for the character of the other soldiers.[154] His notebooks also attest to his philosophical and spiritual reflections, and it was during this time that he experienced a kind of religious awakening.[68] In his entry from 11 June 1915, Wittgenstein states that/nThe meaning of life, i.e. the meaning of the world, we can call God. And connect with this the comparison of God to a father. To pray is to think about the meaning of life.[155]/nand on 8 July that/nTo believe in God means to understand the meaning of life. To believe in God means to see that the facts of the world are not the end of the matter. To believe in God means to see that life has a meaning [ ... ]When my conscience upsets my equilibrium, then I am not in agreement with Something. But what is this? Is it the world? Certainly it is correct to say: Conscience is the voice of God.[156]/nHe discovered Leo Tolstoy's 1896 The Gospel in Brief at a bookshop in Tarn\u00f3w, and carried it everywhere, recommending it to anyone in distress, to the point where he became known to his fellow soldiers as \"the man with the gospels\".[157][158]/nThe extent to which The Gospel in Brief influenced Wittgenstein can be seen in the Tractatus, in the unique way both books number their sentences.[159] In 1916 Wittgenstein read Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov so often that he knew whole passages of it by heart, particularly the speeches of the elder Zosima, who represented for him a powerful Christian ideal, a holy man \"who could see directly into the souls of other people\".[69][160]/nIain King has suggested that Wittgenstein's writing changed substantially in 1916, when he started confronting much greater dangers during frontline fighting.[161] Russell said he returned from the war a changed man, one with a deeply mystical and ascetic attitude.[162]/nIn the summer of 1918 Wittgenstein took military leave and went to stay in one of his family's Vienna summer houses, Neuwaldegg. It was there in August\u00a01918 that he completed the Tractatus, which he submitted with the title Der Satz (German: proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but also \"leap\") to the publishers Jahoda and Siegel.[163]/nA series of events around this time left him deeply upset. On 13\u00a0August, his uncle Paul died. On 25\u00a0October, he learned that Jahoda and Siegel had decided not to publish the Tractatus, and on 27\u00a0October, his brother Kurt killed himself, the third of his brothers to commit suicide. It was around this time he received a letter from David Pinsent's mother to say that Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash on 8\u00a0May.[164][165] Wittgenstein was distraught to the point of being suicidal. He was sent back to the Italian front after his leave and, as a result of the defeat of the Austrian army, he was captured by Allied forces on 3\u00a0November in Trentino. He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp./nHe returned to his family in Vienna on 25\u00a0August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000\u00a0Kronen a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the United States and the Netherlands. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.[163]/nIn September\u00a01919 he enrolled in the Lehrerbildungsanstalt (teacher training college) in the Kundmanngasse in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.[166] Thomas Bernhard, more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: \"the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity.\"[167]/nIn the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote:/nIt is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family ... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you.[168]/nIn 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in Trattenbach, under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October\u00a01921, he wrote to Russell: \"I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere.\"[169] He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students \"literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations.\"[170]/nTo the less able, it seems that he became something of a tyrant. The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.[171] They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;[172] this was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting \"Krautsalat!\" (\"coleslaw\" \u2013 i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and \"Nonsense!\" when a priest was answering children's questions.[173]/nWhile Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the Tractatus was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, part of Wilhelm Ostwald's journal Annalen der Naturphilosophie, though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition. Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.[174] In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote \"The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s \u2013 i.e. by language \u2013 (and, which comes to the same thing, what can be thought) and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy.\"[175] But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the Tractatus.[176]/nThe whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.\nThus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And in fact both were right and both wrong; though the view of the ancients is clearer insofar as they have an acknowledged terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained./nAn English translation was prepared in Cambridge by Frank Ramsey, a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by C. K. Ogden. It was Moore who suggested Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus for the title, an allusion to Baruch Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.[177] This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by David Pears and Brian McGuinness.[h]/nAn aim of the Tractatus is to reveal the relationship between language and the world: what can be said about it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that the logical structure of language provides the limits of meaning. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: \"What we can say at all can be said clearly,\" he argues. Anything beyond that \u2013 religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical \u2013 cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.[179] He wrote in the preface: \"The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather \u2013 not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be able to think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\"[180]/nThe book is 75\u00a0pages long \u2013 \"As to the shortness of the book, I am awfully sorry for it ... If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing more out of me,\" he told Ogden \u2013 and presents seven numbered propositions (1\u20137), with various sub-levels (1, 1.1, 1.11):[181]/nIn September 1922 he moved to a secondary school in a nearby village, Hassbach, but considered the people there just as bad \u2013 \"These people are not human at all but loathsome worms,\" he wrote to a friend \u2013 and he left after a month. In November he began work at another primary school, this time in Puchberg in the Schneeberg mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were \"one-quarter animal and three-quarters human.\"/nFrank P. Ramsey visited him on 17\u00a0September 1923 to discuss the Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind.[183] He reported in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, a washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free.[184] After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends to persuade him to return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family.[185] Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes:/n[Wittgenstein's family] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity.[185]/nHe moved schools again in September\u00a01924, this time to Otterthal, near Trattenbach; the socialist headmaster, Josef Putre, was someone Wittgenstein had become friends with while at Trattenbach. While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, W\u00f6rterbuch f\u00fcr Volksschulen, published in Vienna in 1926 by H\u00f6lder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the Tractatus that was published in his lifetime.[177] A first edition sold in 2005 for \u00a375,000.[186] In 2020, an English version entitled Word Book translated by art historian Bettina Funcke and illustrated by artist / publisher Paul Chan was released.[187]/nThe W\u00f6rterbuch f\u00fcr Volksschulen is remarkable for its pluricentric conceptualization, decades before such linguistic approach existed. In Wittgenstein's preface to the W\u00f6rterbuch, which was withheld at the publisher's request but which survives in a 1925 typescript, Wittgenstein takes a clear stance for a Standard Austrian German, which he aimed to document for elementary pupils in the text. Wittgenstein states (translated from the German) that/nThe dictionary should include only words, but all such words, that are known to Austrian elementary students. Therefore it excludes many a good German word unusual in Austria.[188]/nWittgenstein is through his school dictionary one of the earliest proponents of a German with more than one standard variety.[188] This is especially noteworthy in the German language context, in which expert debates over the status and relevance of standard varieties are so common that some speak of a One Standard German Axiom in that field today. Wittgenstein was taking a stance for multiple standards, against such an axiom, long before these debates ensued.\nAn incident occurred in April\u00a01926 and became known as Der Vorfall Haidbauer (the Haidbauer incident). Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.[189] Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day:/nI called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away![190]/nPiribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.[190] Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August\u00a01926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig H\u00e4nsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia.[191][192]\nTen years later, in 1936, as part of a series of \"confessions\" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a \"Ja, ja,\" though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not/nto hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it \u2013 to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought./nOf the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote,/nThis brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness.[193]/nThe Tractatus was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, known as the Vienna Circle, had developed purportedly as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the Tractatus.[185] While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not the case. German philosopher Oswald Hanfling writes bluntly: \"Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members.\"[194]/nPhilosopher A. C. Grayling, however, contends that while certain superficial similarities between Wittgenstein's early philosophy and logical positivism led its members to study the Tractatus in detail and to arrange discussions with him, Wittgenstein's influence on the Circle was rather limited. The fundamental philosophical views of Circle had been established before they met Wittgenstein and had their origins in the British empiricists, Ernst Mach, and the logic of Frege and Russell. Whatever influence Wittgenstein did have on the Circle was largely limited to Moritz Schlick and Friedrich Waismann and, even in these cases, had little lasting effect on their positivism. Grayling states that \"it is no longer possible to think of the Tractatus as having inspired a philosophical movement, as most earlier commentators claimed.\"[195]/nFrom 1926, Wittgenstein took part in many discussions with the members of the Vienna Circle. During these discussions it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy from the members of the Circle. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.[196]  In his autobiography, Rudolf Carnap describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who most inspired him. However, he also wrote that \"there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems.\" As for Wittgenstein:/nHis point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer.... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.[197]/nI am not interested in erecting a building, but in [...] presenting to myself the foundations of all possible buildings./nIn 1926 Wittgenstein was again working as a gardener for a number of months, this time at the monastery of H\u00fctteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's Kundmanngasse. Wittgenstein, his friend Paul Engelmann, and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30\u00a0mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that \"This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.\"[199]/nIt took him a year to design the door handles and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150 kilograms (330\u00a0lb), moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein, said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \"It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor.\"[199]/nThe house was finished by December\u00a01928 and the family gathered there at Christmas to celebrate its completion. Wittgenstein's sister Hermine wrote: \"Even though I admired the house very much. ... It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods.\"[198] Wittgenstein said \"the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive ear and good manners, and expression of great understanding... But primordial life, wild life striving to erupt into the open \u2013 that is lacking.\"[200] Monk comments that the same might be said of the technically excellent, but austere, terracotta sculpture Wittgenstein had modelled of Marguerite Respinger in 1926, and that, as Russell first noticed, this \"wild life striving to be in the open\" was precisely the substance of Wittgenstein's philosophical work.[200]/nAccording to Feigl (as reported by Monk), upon attending a conference in Vienna by mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer, Wittgenstein remained quite impressed, taking into consideration the possibility of a \"return to Philosophy\". At the urging of Ramsey and others, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in 1929. Keynes wrote in a letter to his wife: \"Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.\"[201][202][203][204] Despite this fame, he could not initially work at Cambridge as he did not have a degree, so he applied as an advanced undergraduate. Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the Tractatus as his thesis.[205] It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, '\"Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it.\"[206] Moore wrote in the examiner's report: \"I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree.\"[207] Wittgenstein was appointed as a lecturer and was made a fellow of Trinity College./nFrom 1936 to 1937, Wittgenstein lived again in Norway,[208] where he worked on the Philosophical Investigations. In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of \"confessions\" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit Maurice O'Connor Drury, a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish Taoiseach, \u00c9amon de Valera, himself a former mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies which he was soon to set up.[209]/nWhile he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the Anschluss; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a Jew under the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws, because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. He would also, in July, become by law a citizen of the enlarged Germany.[5]/nThe Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (Volljuden) if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (Mischling) if they had one or two. It meant inter alia that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.[210]/nAfter the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for Rassenschande (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.[211]/nWittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.[212]/nA few days before the invasion of Poland, Hitler personally granted Mischling status to the Wittgenstein siblings. In 1939 there were 2,100 applications for this, and Hitler granted only 12.[213] Anthony Gottlieb writes that the pretext was that their paternal grandfather had been the bastard son of a German prince, which allowed the Reichsbank to claim foreign currency, stocks and 1700\u00a0kg of gold held in Switzerland by a Wittgenstein family trust. Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July\u00a01938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.[25]/nAfter G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected. He was naturalised as a British subject shortly after on 12 April 1939.[214] In July\u00a01939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August\u00a01939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets 1,700\u00a0kg of gold.[215] There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher Sophia Janowskaya.[216]/nNorman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938:/nAt a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the Tractatus to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked young \u2013 perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing ... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant ... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial.[217]/nDescribing Wittgenstein's lecture programme, Malcolm continues:/nIt is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings ... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect ... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes.[218]/nAfter work, the philosopher would often relax by watching Westerns, where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by Norbert Davis.[219][220] Norman Malcolm wrote that Wittgenstein would rush to the cinema when class ended.[221]/nBy this time, Wittgenstein's view on the foundations of mathematics had changed considerably. In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young Alan Turing who described Wittgenstein as \"a very peculiar man\". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.[222][223][224]/nWittgenstein's lectures from this period have also been discussed by another of his students, the Greek philosopher and educator Helle Lambridis. Wittgenstein's teachings in the years 1940\u20131941 are used in the mid-1950s by Lambridis to write a long text in the form of an imagined dialogue with him, where she begins to develop her own ideas about resemblance in relation to language, elementary concepts and basic-level mental images. Initially only a part of it was published in 1963 in the German education theory review Club Voltaire, but the entire imagined dialogue with Wittgenstein was published after Lambridis's death by her archive holder, the Academy of Athens, in 2004.[225][226]/nMonk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war (World War II) was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.[i]/nIn September\u00a01941, he asked John Ryle, the brother of the philosopher Gilbert Ryle, if he could get a manual job at Guy's Hospital in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for the Blitz. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, delivering drugs from the pharmacy to the wards where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.[227] In the new year of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein to his home in Sussex to meet his wife who had been determined to meet him. His son recorded the weekend in his diary;/nWink is awful strange [sic] \u2013 not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying 'I mean' and 'its \"tolerable\"' meaning intolerable.[228]/nThe hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him \u2013 at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings \u2013 but they were discreet. \"Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!\" Wittgenstein begged one of them.[229] Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1\u00a0April 1942: \"I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless.\"[227] It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gallstone that had troubled him for some years.[230]/nHe had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of Francis Skinner, the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: \"For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A tragic thought!\"[231] Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.[232]/nWhile Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant,[233] was studying the effect of wound shock[234] (a state associative to hypovolaemia[235]) on air-raid casualties. When the Blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November\u00a01942, Grant and Reeve moved to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of \u00a34 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28\u00a0Brandling Park, Jesmond[233]) from 29\u00a0April 1943 until February\u00a01944.[236] While there he worked\n[237][238] and associated socially with Dr Erasmus Barlow,[238] a great-grandson of Charles Darwin.[239]/nIn the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal Mind. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards (who was a medical student), writing in his diary, \"The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background.\" On 30\u00a0September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, \"Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me.\"[240]/nWittgenstein had only maintained contact with Fouracre, from Guy's hospital, who had joined the army in 1943 after his marriage, only returning in 1947. Wittgenstein maintained frequent correspondence with Fouracre during his time away displaying a desire for Fouracre to return home urgently from the war.[240]/nIn May\u00a01947, Wittgenstein addressed a group of Oxford philosophers for the first time at the Jowett Society. The discussion was on the validity of Descartes' Cogito ergo sum, where Wittgenstein ignored the question and applied his own philosophical method. Harold Arthur Prichard who attended the event was not pleased with Wittgenstein's methods;/nWittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, 'I think it will rain, therefore I exist', I do not understand him.Prichard: That's all very fine; what we want to know is: is the cogito valid or not?[241]/nDeath is not an event in life: We do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present. Our life has no end in the way in which our visual field has no limits./nWittgenstein resigned the professorship at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing, and in 1947 and 1948 travelled to Ireland, staying at Ross's Hotel in Dublin and at a farmhouse in Redcross, County Wicklow, where he began the manuscript MS\u00a0137, volume\u00a0R.[242] Seeking solitude he moved to a holiday cottage in Rosroe overlooking Killary Harbour, Connemara owned by Drury's brother.[243]/nHe also accepted an invitation from Norman Malcolm, then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at Ithaca, New York. He made the trip in April\u00a01949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: \"I haven't done any work since the beginning of March & I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any.\" A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir.[244] During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with philosophical scepticism, that would eventually become the final fragments On Certainty./nHe returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable prostate cancer, which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11\u00a0February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. \"Great loss for me and all of us,\" he wrote. \"Greater than I would have thought.\" He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April\u00a01950, where he stayed with G.H. von\u00a0Wright; to London to stay with Rush Rhees; then to Oxford to see Elizabeth Anscombe, writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27\u00a0November he moved into Storey's End at 76\u00a0Storey's Way, the home of his doctor, Edward Bevan, and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead. Joan at first was afraid of Wittgenstein, but they soon became good friends.[242][245]/nBy the beginning of 1951, it was clear that he had little time left. He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29\u00a0January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von\u00a0Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, \"My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does.\"[245] In February, he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS\u00a0175 and MS\u00a0176. These and other manuscripts were later published as Remarks on Colour and On Certainty.[242] He wrote to Malcolm on 16\u00a0April, 13\u00a0days before his death:/nAn extraordinary thing happened to me. About a month ago I suddenly found myself in the right frame of mind for doing philosophy. I had been absolutely certain that I'd never again be able to do it. It's the first time after more than 2\u00a0years that the curtain in my brain has gone up. \u2013 Of course, so far I've only worked for about 5\u00a0weeks & it may be all over by tomorrow; but it bucks me up a lot now.[246]/nWittgenstein began work on his final manuscript, MS\u00a0177, on 25\u00a0April 1951. It was his 62nd birthday on 26\u00a0April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27\u00a0April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, \"Good!\". Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28\u00a0April, he told her: \"Tell them I've had a wonderful life.\" Norman Malcolm describes this as a \"strangely moving utterance\".[246]/nFour of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside \u2013 Ben Richards, Elizabeth Anscombe, Yorick Smythies, and Maurice O'Connor Drury. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father Conrad Pepler, also attended. (Wittgenstein had asked for a \"priest who was not a philosopher\" and had met with Pepler several times before his death.)[247] They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards./nWittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.[248] Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.[249] In 2015 the ledger gravestone was refurbished by the British Wittgenstein Society.[250]/nOn his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in Catholicism, and was sympathetic to it, but did not consider himself to be a Catholic. According to Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein saw Catholicism more as a way of life than as a set of beliefs he held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.[j]/nWittgenstein has no goal to either support or reject religion; his only interest is to keep discussions, whether religious or not, clear. \u2014 T. Labron (2006)[252]/nWittgenstein was said by some commentators to be agnostic, in a qualified sense.[k][254]/nI won't say 'See you tomorrow' because that would be like predicting the future, and I'm pretty sure I can't do that./nThe Blue Book, a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933\u20131934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language and is widely read as a turning point in his philosophy of language./nPhilosophical Investigations was published in two parts in 1953. Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part\u00a0II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that the bewitchments of philosophical problems arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar \u2014 what he called \"language gone on holiday\".[256]/nAccording to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.[257] Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the \"rough ground\" of ordinary language in use. Much of the Investigations consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: \"The clarity we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear.\"[258]/nWittgenstein's archive of unpublished papers included 83\u00a0manuscripts, 46\u00a0typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000\u00a0pages. Choosing among repeated drafts, revisions, corrections, and loose notes, editorial work has found nearly one third of the total suitable for print.[259] An Internet facility hosted by the University of Bergen allows access to images of almost all the material and to search the available transcriptions.[260] In 2011, two new boxes of Wittgenstein papers, thought to have been lost during the Second World War, were found.[261][262]/nWhat became the Philosophical Investigations was already close to completion in 1951. Wittgenstein's three literary executors prioritized it, both because of its intrinsic importance and because he had explicitly intended publication. The book was published in 1953./nAt least three other works were more or less finished. Two were already \"bulky typescripts\", the Philosophical Remarks and Philosophical Grammar. Literary (co-)executor G. H. von Wright stated, \"They are virtually completed works. But Wittgenstein did not publish them.\"[263] The third was Remarks on Colour. \"He wrote i.a. a fair amount on colour concepts, and this material he did excerpt and polish, reducing it to a small compass.\"[264]/nBertrand Russell described Wittgenstein as/nperhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.[121]/nAs mentioned above, in 1999 a survey among American university and college teachers ranked the Investigations as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy, standing out as \"the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specializations and philosophical orientations.\"[265][266] The Investigations also ranked 54th on a list of most influential twentieth-century works in cognitive science prepared by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences.[267]/nDuncan J. Richter of the Virginia Military Institute, writing for the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, has described Wittgenstein as \"one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, and regarded by some as the most important since Immanuel Kant.\"[268] Peter Hacker argues that Wittgenstein's influence on 20th-century analytical philosophy can be attributed to his early influence on the Vienna Circle and later influence on the Oxford \"ordinary language\" school and Cambridge philosophers.[269]/nHe is considered by some to be one of the greatest philosophers of the modern era.[270]\nBut despite its deep influence on analytical philosophy, Wittgenstein's work did not always gain a positive reception. Argentine-Canadian philosopher Mario Bunge considers that \"Wittgenstein is popular\nbecause he is trivial.\"[271] In\nBunge's opinion, Wittgenstein's philosophy is trivial because it deals with unimportant\nproblems and ignores science.[272] According to Bunge, Wittgenstein's\nphilosophy of language is shallow because it ignores scientific linguistics.[273] Bunge also considers Wittgenstein's philosophy of mind to be speculative because it is not informed by the scientific research performed in psychology.[274]/nThere are many diverging interpretations of Wittgenstein's thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright:/nHe was of the opinion ... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. He once said he felt as though he was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.[60]/nSince Wittgenstein's death, scholarly interpretations of his philosophy have differed. Scholars have differed on the continuity between the so-called early Wittgenstein and the so-called late(r) Wittgenstein (that is, the difference between his views expressed in the Tractatus and those in Philosophical Investigations), with some seeing the two as starkly disparate and others stressing the gradual transition between the two works through analysis of Wittgenstein's unpublished papers (the Nachlass).[275]/nOne significant debate in Wittgenstein scholarship concerns the work of interpreters who are referred to under the banner of The New Wittgenstein school such as Cora Diamond, Alice Crary, and James F. Conant.  While the Tractatus, particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a \"therapeutic\" understanding of Wittgenstein's work \u2013 \"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.\"[276] To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the Tractatus as \"plain nonsense\" \u2013 arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of John Wisdom[277] and the review of The Blue Book written by Oets Kolk Bouwsma.[275][278]/nThe therapeutic approach is not without critics: Hans-Johann Glock argues that the \"plain nonsense\" reading of the Tractatus \"is at odds with the external evidence, writings and conversations in which Wittgenstein states that the Tractatus is committed to the idea of ineffable insight.\"[275]/nHans Sluga and Rupert Read have advocated a \"post-therapeutic\" or \"liberatory\" interpretation of Wittgenstein.[279][280][281]/nIn October 1944, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge around the same time as did Russell, who had been living in the United States for several years. Russell returned to Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury:/nRussell's books should be bound in two colours...those dealing with mathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue \u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them.[282]/nRussell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work:/nI have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.[283]/nSaul Kripke's 1982 book Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language contends that the central argument of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations is a devastating rule-following paradox that undermines the possibility of our ever following rules in our use of language. Kripke writes that this paradox is \"the most radical and original sceptical problem that philosophy has seen to date.\"[284]/nKripke's book generated a large secondary literature, divided between those who find his sceptical problem interesting and perceptive, and others, such as John McDowell, Stanley Cavell, Gordon Baker, Peter Hacker, Colin McGinn,[285] and Peter Winch who argue that his scepticism of meaning is a pseudo-problem that stems from a confused, selective reading of Wittgenstein. Kripke's position has, however, recently been defended against these and other attacks by the Cambridge philosopher Martin Kusch (2006)./nWittgenstein's insights and methods have had a wide-ranging influence within and beyond philosophy. For example, there has been substantial discussion about the implications of Wittgenstein's later work for cognitive science, philosophy of mind and the study of consciousness, including the hard problem of consciousness.[286]/nA collection of Ludwig Wittgenstein's manuscripts is held by Trinity College, Cambridge.", "21415250": "Charles Jasper Joly (27 June 1864 \u2013 4 January 1906) was an Irish mathematician and astronomer who became Royal Astronomer of Ireland.[1][2] He was an important figure in the study of quaternions.[3]/nJoly was born at St Catherine's Rectory, Hop Hill, Tullamore, County Offaly, the eldest of six children of Rev.

The original of this letter was lost, but its existence is known through Toscanelli himself, who later transcribed it along with the map and sent it to Christopher Columbus, who carried them with him during his first voyage to the New World.[4] Toscanelli had miscalculated Asia as being 5,000 miles longer than it really was, and Columbus miscalculated the circumference of the Earth by 25 percent: both of which resulted in Columbus not realizing initially he had found a new continent.[4]/nAn uncorroborated story links Toscanelli\u2019s attendance at a Chinese delegation to the Pope in 1432, when many Chinese inventions were discussed, with a flood of drawings made around the same year by the artist-engineer Taccola (1382 \u2013 c.1453), which were later developed by Brunelleschi and Leonardo da Vinci. In a 1474 letter by Toscanelli to Columbus, the authenticity of which has been a matter of disagreement among scholars,[5] Toscanelli mentions the visit of men from Cathay (China) during the reign of Pope Eugenius IV (1431\u20131447):/nAlso in the time of Eugenius one of them [of Cathay] came to Eugenius, who affirmed their great kindness towards Christians, and I had a long conversation with him on many subjects, about the magnitude of their rivers in length and breath, and on the multitude of cities on the banks of rivers. He said that on one river there were near 200 cities with marble bridges great in length and breadth, and everywhere adorned with columns. This country is worth seeking by the Latins, not only because great wealth may be obtained from it, gold and silver, all sorts of gems, and spices, which never reach us; but also on account of its learned men, philosophers, and expert astrologers, and by what skill and art so powerful and magnificent a province is governed, as well as how their wars are conducted./nIt has been suggested that the man in question may have been Niccolo da Conti, who was returning from the east and is known to have met with Pope Eugenius in 1444.[8]/nIn a second letter, Toscanelli describes further these men as extremely learned and willing to share their knowledge:/nThe said voyage is not only possible, but it is true, and certain to be honourable and to yield incalculable profit, and very great fame among all Christians. But you cannot know this perfectly save through experience and practice, as I have had in the form of the most copious and good and true information from distinguished men of great learning who have come from the said parts, here in the court of Rome, and from others being merchants who have had business for a long time in those parts, men of high authority./nToscanelli is noted for his observations of six comets,[1][10] in 1472, two in 1457, 1456, which was to be named Halley's Comet after Edmond Halley predicted its return in 1759, 1449, and 1433.[11]/nIn 1475 he pierced a hole in the dome of Florence Cathedral making a gnomon[12][13][14] at 91.05 metres (298.7\u00a0ft) above the pavement to create a meridian line.[15] The height precluded the installation of a complete meridian line of the floor of the cathedral, but allowed a short section of approximately 10 metres (33\u00a0ft) to run between the main altar and the north wall of the transept.

The following year he took up a lectureship in the University of Bordeaux, where he proved his celebrated inequality on determinants, which led to the discovery of Hadamard matrices when equality holds. In 1896 he made two important contributions: he proved the prime number theorem, using complex function theory (also proved independently by Charles Jean de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin); and he was awarded the Bordin Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his work on geodesics in the differential geometry of surfaces and dynamical systems. In the same year he was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Rational Mechanics in Bordeaux.

It was translated into Latin as Systema cosmicum[1] (Cosmic System) in 1635 by Matthias Bernegger.[2] The book was dedicated to Galileo's patron, Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632.[3]/nIn the Copernican system, the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the Ptolemaic system, everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The Dialogue was published in Florence under a formal license from the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo was found to be \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" based on the book, which was then placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822).[4] In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.[5]/nWhile writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his Dialogue on the Tides, and  when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the tides using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is Dialogue, which is followed by Galileo's name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744.[6] This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo's motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.[7]/nThe book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:/nThe discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of William Gilbert's work on magnetism.  Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth's motion./nA classic argument against Earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the Earth surface, though it moves, by the Earth's rotation, at about 1700\u00a0km/h at the equator. In this category there is a thought experiment in which a man is below decks on a ship and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is the same whether the ship is moving or not. This is a classic exposition of the inertial frame of reference and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west./nThe bulk of Galileo's arguments may be divided into three classes:/nGenerally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries.  Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue./nGalileo attempted a fourth class of argument:/nAs an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth's motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the \"Fourth Day\" of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is\u2014like nearly anything having to do with Galileo\u2014a matter of controversy.  On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as \"cockamamie.\"[12] On the other hand, Einstein used a rather different description:/nIt was Galileo's longing for a mechanical proof of the motion of the earth which misled him into formulating a wrong theory of the tides. The fascinating arguments in the last conversation would hardly have been accepted as proof by Galileo, had his temperament not got the better of him.  [Emphasis added][13][14]/nThe Dialogue does not treat the Tychonic system, which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect.  The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system;  it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models.  Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the Sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth;  Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the Earth.  The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a stellar parallax, while the Tychonian system predicts none.  Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system./nGalileo never took Tycho's system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise. A reason for the absence of Tycho's system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo's theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the Dialogue. While the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that Foucault's pendulum apparently provided two centuries later. Without reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Copernican and Tychonic systems./nGalileo also fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although Johannes Kepler had sent him a copy of his 1609 book, Astronomia nova, in which he proposes elliptical orbits\u2014correctly calculating that of Mars.[15] Prince Federico Cesi's letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of planetary motion presented in the book as common knowledge;[16][17] Kepler's third law was published in 1619. Four and a half decades after Galileo's death, Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity, from which a heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible./nPreface: To the Discerning Reader\nrefers to the ban on the \"Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves\" and says that the author \"takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis\". He introduces the friends Sagredo and Salviati with whom he had had discussions as well as the peripatetic philosopher Simplicio./nHe starts with Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati cannot understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were \"trifles which later spread among the vulgar\" and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio's response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration was not always needed./nSalviati attacks Aristotle's definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of 1572 and 1604 and sunspots, seen through the new telescope. There is a discussion about Aristotle's use of a priori arguments. Salviati suggests that Arisotle uses Aristotle\u2019s personal experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that Aristotle would change his mind in the present circumstances./nSimplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the Sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, \"it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say 'Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me' than 'Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning.'\"/nExperiments with a mirror are used to show that the Moon's surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He refuses to accept that mountains on the Moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the Earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon./nSagredo holds that he considers the Earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the Moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it would not sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvellous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God's works./nThe second day starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. \"It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself.\"/nThere is one supreme motion\u2014that by which the Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the Earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one./nMotion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized earth? If the Earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?/nThe movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the Earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions./nThe great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the Moon takes only a month. Jupiter's moons take even less. This is not changed if the Earth rotates every day, but if the Earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years./nIn addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the earth the primum mobile and the need for this extra sphere disappears./nThey consider three main objections to the motion of the Earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the Earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the impetus of the cannon./nHe also points out that attempting to prove that the Earth does not move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of paralogism (assuming what is to be proved), because if the Earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated)./nIn rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the Moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material does not make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork./nIn fact, a ball falling from such a height would not fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the Earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to Earth. Calling it gravity does not explain what it is./nSalviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the novas he has been reading overnight.[18] Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere./nSimplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the Earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salviati points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes./nHe points out that if anything is the centre, it must be the Sun not the Earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the Earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the Sun. Mars must also go about the Sun (as well as the Earth) since it is never seen horned, unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest./nSagredo brings up two other common objections. If the Earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend.  Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realises the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still does not understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well./nSalviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the Earth, the unique existence of the Moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the moons of Jupiter, which would appear like Earth's Moon to any Jovian./nCopernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast epicycles. Mars, above the Sun's sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the Earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the Earth's orbit./nSimplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the Earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the Sun and Moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord./nBut still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the Sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that \"it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God's actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us\"./nHas Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the Earth? Do any of them know how much variation is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho's are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away./nSagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the Earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle's axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time./nThey are in Sagredo's house in Venice, where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the Earth's movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: daily (diurnal), generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; monthly, seemingly from the Moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and annual, leading to different sizes at the equinoxes./nHe considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both\u2014this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the Straits of Messina there are very swift currents between Scylla and Charybdis. In the open Mediterranean the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable./nSimplicio counters with the peripatetic explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the Moon over the water, though this does not explain the risings when the Moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle./nWhen the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar? It's much too far away and the currents are too slow./nSo could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the  barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards./nConsider a point on the Earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. The length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations./nThe primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the Hellespont and the Aegean the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the Red Sea has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins./nSimplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the steady winds from east to west in the oceans in the tropical zone./nIt seems that the Moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the Moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It's impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.", "509300": "Pappus of Alexandria (/\u02c8p\u00e6p\u0259s/; Greek: \u03a0\u03ac\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u1f08\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2; c.\u2009290\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009 350 AD) was a Greek mathematician of Late Antiquity known for his Synagoge (\u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae) or Collection (c.\u2009340),[1] and for Pappus's hexagon theorem in projective geometry. Almost nothing is known about his life except for what can be found in his own writings, many of which are lost. Apart from having a son named Hermodorus, Pappus lived in Alexandria were he worked as a mathematics teacher to higher level students.[2]/nThe Collection, his best-known work, is a compendium of mathematics in eight volumes, the bulk of which survives. It covers a wide range of topics that were part of the ancient mathematics curriculum, including geometry, astronomy, and mechanics.[1]/nPappus was active in a period generally considered one of stagnation in mathematical studies, where he stands out as a remarkable exception.[3] In many respects, his fate strikingly resembles that of Diophantus', originally of limited importance but becoming very influential in the late Renaissance and Early Modern periods./nIn his surviving writings, Pappus gives no indication of the date of the authors whose works he makes use of, or of the time (but see below) when he himself wrote. If no other date information were available, all that could be known would be that he was later than Ptolemy (died c. 168 AD), whom he quotes, and earlier than Proclus (born c.\u2009411), who quotes him.[3]/nThe 10th century Suda states that Pappus was of the same age as Theon of Alexandria, who was active in the reign of Emperor Theodosius I (372\u2013395).[4] A different date is given by a marginal note to a late 10th-century manuscript[3] (a copy of a chronological table by the same Theon), which states, next to an entry on Emperor Diocletian (reigned 284\u2013305), that \"at that time wrote Pappus\".[citation needed]/nHowever, a verifiable date comes from the dating of a solar eclipse mentioned by Pappus himself.  In his commentary on the Almagest he calculates \"the place and time of conjunction which gave rise to the eclipse in Tybi in 1068 after Nabonassar\". This works out as 18 October 320, and so Pappus must have been active around 320.[2]/nThe great work of Pappus, in eight books and titled Synagoge or Collection, has not survived in complete form: the first book is lost, and the rest have suffered considerably. The Suda enumerates other works of Pappus: \u03a7\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (Chorographia oikoumenike or Description of the Inhabited World), commentary on the four books of Ptolemy's Almagest, \u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03cd\u1fc3 (The Rivers in Libya), and \u1f48\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (The Interpretation of Dreams).[4] Pappus himself mentions another commentary of his own on the \u1f08\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 (Analemma) of Diodorus of Alexandria. Pappus also wrote commentaries on Euclid's Elements (of which fragments are preserved in Proclus and the Scholia, while that on the tenth Book has been found in an Arabic manuscript), and on Ptolemy's \u1f09\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Harmonika).[3]/nFederico Commandino translated the Collection of Pappus into Latin in 1588. The German classicist and mathematical historian Friedrich Hultsch (1833\u20131908) published a definitive three-volume presentation of Commandino's translation with both the Greek and Latin versions (Berlin, 1875\u20131878). Using Hultsch's work, the Belgian mathematical historian Paul ver Eecke was the first to publish a translation of the Collection into a modern European language; his two-volume, French translation has the title Pappus d'Alexandrie. La Collection Math\u00e9matique. (Paris and Bruges, 1933).[5]/nThe characteristics of Pappus's Collection are that it contains an account, systematically arranged, of the most important results obtained by his predecessors, and, secondly, notes explanatory of, or extending, previous discoveries. These discoveries form, in fact, a text upon which Pappus enlarges discursively. Heath considered the systematic introductions to the various books as valuable, for they set forth clearly an outline of the contents and the general scope of the subjects to be treated. From these introductions one can judge of the style of Pappus's writing, which is excellent and even elegant the moment he is free from the shackles of mathematical formulae and expressions. Heath also found his characteristic exactness made his Collection \"a most admirable substitute for the texts of the many valuable treatises of earlier mathematicians of which time has deprived us\".[3]/nThe surviving portions of Collection can be summarized as follows.[6]/nBook I has been completely lost. We can only conjecture that the lost Book I, like Book II, was concerned with arithmetic due to Book III being clearly introduced as beginning a new subject.[3]/nThe whole of Book II (the former part of which is lost, the existing fragment beginning in the middle of the 14th proposition)[3] discusses a method of multiplication from an unnamed book by Apollonius of Perga. The final propositions deal with multiplying together the numerical values of Greek letters in two lines of poetry, producing two very large numbers approximately equal to 2\u00d71054 and 2\u00d71038.[7]/nBook III contains geometrical problems, plane and solid. It may be divided into five sections:[3]/nOf Book IV the title and preface have been lost, so that the program has to be gathered from the book itself. At the beginning is the well-known generalization of Euclid I.47 (Pappus's area theorem), then follow various theorems on the circle, leading up to the problem of the construction of a circle which shall circumscribe three given circles, touching each other two and two. This and several other propositions on contact, e.g. cases of circles touching one another and inscribed in the figure made of three semicircles and known as arbelos (\"shoemakers knife\") form the first division of the book; Pappus turns then to a consideration of certain properties of Archimedes's spiral, the conchoid of Nicomedes (already mentioned in Book I as supplying a method of doubling the cube), and the curve discovered most probably by Hippias of Elis about 420 BC, and known by the name, \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, or quadratrix. Proposition 30 describes the construction of a curve of double curvature called by Pappus the helix on a sphere; it is described by a point moving uniformly along the arc of a great circle, which itself turns about its diameter uniformly, the point describing a quadrant and the great circle a complete revolution in the same time. The area of the surface included between this curve and its base is found \u2013 the first known instance of a quadrature of a curved surface. The rest of the book treats of the trisection of an angle, and the solution of more general problems of the same kind by means of the quadratrix and spiral. In one solution of the former problem is the first recorded use of the property of a conic (a hyperbola) with reference to the focus and directrix.[9]/nIn Book V, after an interesting preface concerning regular polygons, and containing remarks upon the hexagonal form of the cells of honeycombs, Pappus addresses himself to the comparison of the areas of different plane figures which have all the same perimeter (following Zenodorus's treatise on this subject), and of the volumes of different solid figures which have all the same superficial area, and, lastly, a comparison of the five regular solids of Plato. Incidentally Pappus describes the thirteen other polyhedra bounded by equilateral and equiangular but not similar polygons, discovered by Archimedes, and finds, by a method recalling that of Archimedes, the surface and volume of a sphere.[9]/nAccording to the preface, Book VI is intended to resolve difficulties occurring in the so-called \"Lesser Astronomical Works\" (\u039c\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u00b5\u03bf\u03cd\u00b5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), i.e. works other than the Almagest. It accordingly comments on the Sphaerica of Theodosius, the Moving Sphere of Autolycus, Theodosius's book on Day and Night, the treatise of Aristarchus On the Size and Distances of the Sun and Moon, and Euclid's Optics and Phaenomena.[9]/nSince Michel Chasles cited this book of Pappus in his history of geometric methods,[10] it has become the object of considerable attention./nThe preface of Book VII explains the terms analysis and synthesis, and the distinction between theorem and problem. Pappus then enumerates works of Euclid, Apollonius, Aristaeus and Eratosthenes, thirty-three books in all, the substance of which he intends to give, with the lemmas necessary for their elucidation. With the mention of the Porisms of Euclid we have an account of the relation of porism to theorem and problem. In the same preface is included (a) the famous problem known by Pappus's name, often enunciated thus: Having given a number of straight lines, to find the geometric locus of a point such that the lengths of the perpendiculars upon, or (more generally) the lines drawn from it obliquely at given inclinations to, the given lines satisfy the condition that the product of certain of them may bear a constant ratio to the product of the remaining ones; (Pappus does not express it in this form but by means of composition of ratios, saying that if the ratio is given which is compounded of the ratios of pairs one of one set and one of another of the lines so drawn, and of the ratio of the odd one, if any, to a given straight line, the point will lie on a curve given in position); (b) the theorems which were rediscovered by and named after Paul Guldin, but appear to have been discovered by Pappus himself.[9]/nBook VII also contains/nChasles's citation of Pappus was repeated by Wilhelm Blaschke[12] and Dirk Struik.[13] In Cambridge, England, John J. Milne gave readers the benefit of his reading of Pappus.[14] In 1985 Alexander Jones wrote his thesis at Brown University on the subject. A revised form of his translation and commentary was published by Springer-Verlag the following year. Jones succeeds in showing how Pappus manipulated the complete quadrangle, used the relation of projective harmonic conjugates, and displayed an awareness of cross-ratios of points and lines. Furthermore, the concept of pole and polar is revealed as a lemma in Book VII.[15][full citation needed]/nBook VIII principally treats mechanics, the properties of the center of gravity, and some mechanical powers. Interspersed are some propositions on pure geometry. Proposition 14 shows how to draw an ellipse through five given points, and Prop. 15 gives a simple construction for the axes of an ellipse when a pair of conjugate diameters are given.[9]/nPappus's Collection was virtually unknown to the Arabs and medieval Europeans, but exerted great influence on 17th-century mathematics after being translated to Latin by Federico Commandino.[16] Diophantus's Arithmetica and Pappus's Collection were the two major sources of Vi\u00e8te's Isagoge in artem analyticam (1591).[17] The Pappus's problem and its generalization led Descartes to the development of analytic geometry.[18] Fermat also developed his version of analytic geometry and his method of Maxima and Minima from Pappus's summaries of Apollonius's lost works Plane Loci and On Determinate Section.[19] Other mathematicians influenced by Pappus were Pacioli, da Vinci, Kepler, van Roomen, Pascal,  Newton, Bernoulli, Euler, Gauss, Gergonne, Steiner and Poncelet.

I don't think there exists a problem\u200d\u2014\u200cthe classical kind of pseudo reality problem which first and second-year students are given\u200d\u2014\u200cthat I haven't seen.[6]/nOne month later he enrolled in a differential equations course (\"mostly full of seniors\") as well. When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style \"unbelievably different\u00a0... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different\u00a0... That was a very important experience for me. So after that I took a lot of courses from Hille\" including, in his sophomore year, graduate-level real analysis. \"Starting with that course with Hille, I began to have some sense of what mathematics is about.\"[6]/nWhile at Yale he competed three times (1940, 1941 and 1942) in the recently founded William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, always placing among the top five entrants in the country (making him the second three-time Putnam Fellow).[10]/nAfter the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor during his senior year, Gleason applied for a commission in the US Navy,[11]\nand on graduation\njoined the team working to break Japanese naval codes.[6] \n(Others on this team included his future collaborator Robert E. Greenwood and Yale professor Marshall Hall Jr.)[11]\nHe also collaborated with British researchers attacking the German Enigma cipher;\nAlan Turing, who spent substantial time with Gleason while visiting Washington, called him \"the brilliant young Yale graduate mathematician\" in a report of his visit.[11]/nIn 1946, at the recommendation of Navy colleague Donald Howard Menzel, Gleason was appointed a Junior Fellow at Harvard.\nAn early goal of the Junior Fellows program was to allow young scholars showing extraordinary promise to sidestep the lengthy PhD process; four years later Harvard appointed Gleason an assistant professor of mathematics,[6]\nthough he was almost immediately recalled to Washington for cryptographic work related to the Korean War.[6]\nHe returned to Harvard in the fall of 1952, and soon after published the most important of his results on Hilbert's fifth problem (see below).\nHarvard awarded him tenure the following year.[6][12][A]/nIn January 1959 he married Jean Berko[6] \nwhom he had met at a party featuring the music of Tom Lehrer.[8]\nBerko, a psycholinguist, worked for many years at Boston University.[12]\nThey had three daughters./nIn 1969 Gleason took the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Established in 1727, this is the oldest scientific endowed professorship in the US.[4][13]\nHe retired from Harvard in 1992 but remained active in service to Harvard (as chair of the Society of Fellows, for example)[14]\nand to mathematics: in particular, promoting the Harvard Calculus Reform Project[15] and working with the Massachusetts Board of Education.[16]/nHe died on October 17, 2008 from complications following surgery.[4][5]/nGleason said he \"always enjoyed helping other people with math\"\u200d\u2014\u200ca colleague said he \"regarded teaching mathematics\u200d\u2014\u200clike doing mathematics\u200d\u2014\u200cas both important and also genuinely fun.\"\nAt fourteen, during his brief attendance at Berkeley High School, he found himself not only bored with first-semester geometry, but also helping other students with their homework\u200d\u2014\u200cincluding those taking the second half of the course, which he soon began auditing.[6][17]/nAt Harvard he \"regularly taught at every level\",[15] including administratively burdensome multisection courses. \nOne class presented Gleason with a framed print of Picasso's Mother and Child in recognition of his care for them.[18]/nIn 1964 he created \"the first of the 'bridge' courses now ubiquitous for math majors, only twenty years before its time.\"[15] Such a course is designed to teach new students, accustomed to rote learning of mathematics in secondary school, how to reason abstractly and construct mathematical proofs.[19] That effort led to publication of his Fundamentals of Abstract Analysis, of which one reviewer wrote:/nThis is a most unusual book\u00a0... Every working mathematician of course knows the difference between a lifeless chain of formalized propositions and the \"feeling\" one has (or tries to get) of a mathematical theory, and will probably agree that helping the student to reach that \"inside\" view is the ultimate goal of mathematical education; but he will usually give up any attempt at successfully doing this except through oral teaching. The originality of the author is that he has tried to attain that goal in a textbook, and in the reviewer's opinion, he has succeeded remarkably well in this all but impossible task. Most readers will probably be delighted (as the reviewer has been) to find, page after page, painstaking discussions and explanations of standard mathematical and logical procedures, always written in the most felicitous style, which spares no effort to achieve the utmost clarity without falling into the vulgarity which so often mars such attempts.[17]/nBut Gleason's \"talent for exposition\" did not always imply that the reader would be enlightened without effort of his own. Even in a wartime memo on the urgently important decryption of the German Enigma cipher, Gleason and his colleagues wrote:/nThe reader may wonder why so much is left to the reader. A book on swimming strokes may be nice to read, but one must practice the strokes while actually in the water before one can claim to be a swimmer. So if the reader desires to actually possess the knowledge for recovering wiring from a depth, let the reader get his paper and pencils, using perhaps four colors to avoid confusion in the connecting links, and go to work.[17]/nHis notes and exercises on probability and statistics, drawn up for his lectures to code-breaking colleagues during the war (see below) remained in use in National Security Agency training for several decades; they were published openly in 1985.[17]/nIn a 1964 Science article, Gleason wrote of an apparent paradox arising in attempts to explain mathematics to nonmathematicians:/nIt is notoriously difficult to convey the proper impression of the frontiers of mathematics to nonspecialists. Ultimately the difficulty stems from the fact that mathematics is an easier subject than the other sciences. Consequently, many of the important primary problems of the subject\u200d\u2014\u200cthat is, problems which can be understood by an intelligent outsider\u200d\u2014\u200chave either been solved or carried to a point where an indirect approach is clearly required. The great bulk of pure mathematical research is concerned with secondary, tertiary, or higher-order problem, the very statement of which can hardly be understood until one has mastered a great deal of technical mathematics.[20]/nGleason was the first chairman of the advisory committee of the School Mathematics Study Group, which helped define the New Math of the 1960s\u200d\u2014\u200cambitious changes in American elementary and high school mathematics teaching emphasizing understanding of concepts over rote algorithms. Gleason was \"always interested in how people learn\"; as part of the New Math effort he spent most mornings over several months with second-graders. Some years later he gave a talk in which he described his goal as having been:/nto find out how much they could figure out for themselves, given appropriate activities and the right guidance. At the end of his talk, someone asked Andy whether he had ever worried that teaching math to little kids wasn't how faculty at research institutions should be spending their time. [His] quick and decisive response: \"No, I didn't think about that at all. I had a ball!\"[17]/nIn 1986 he helped found the Calculus Consortium, which has published a successful and influential series of \"calculus reform\" textbooks for college and high school, on precalculus, calculus, and other areas. His \"credo for this program as for all of his teaching was that the ideas should be based in equal parts of geometry for visualization of the concepts, computation for grounding in the real world, and algebraic manipulation for power.\"[12] However, the program faced heavy criticism from the mathematics community for its omission of topics such as the mean value theorem,[21] and for its perceived lack of mathematical rigor.[22][23][24]/nDuring World War II Gleason was part of OP-20-G, the U.S. Navy's signals intelligence and cryptanalysis group.[11]\nOne task of this group, in collaboration with British cryptographers at Bletchley Park such as Alan Turing, was to penetrate German Enigma machine communications networks. The British had great success with two of these networks, but the third, used for German-Japanese naval coordination, remained unbroken because of a faulty assumption that it employed a simplified version of Enigma. After OP-20-G's Marshall Hall observed that certain metadata in Berlin-to-Tokyo transmissions used letter sets disjoint from those used in Tokyo-to-Berlin metadata, Gleason hypothesized that the corresponding unencrypted letters sets were A-M (in one direction) and N-Z (in the other), then devised novel statistical tests by which he confirmed this hypothesis. The result was routine decryption of this third network by 1944. (This work also involved deeper math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adics related to permutation groups and the graph isomorphism problem.)[11]/nOP-20-G then turned to the Japanese navy's \"Coral\" cipher. A key tool for the attack on Coral was the \"Gleason crutch\", a form of Chernoff bound on tail distributions of sums of independent random variables. Gleason's classified work on this bound predated Chernoff's work by a decade.[11]/nToward the end of the war he concentrated on documenting the work of OP-20-G and developing systems for training new cryptographers.[11]/nIn 1950 Gleason returned to active duty for the Korean War, serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the Nebraska Avenue Complex (which much later became the home of the DHS Cyber Security Division). His cryptographic work from this period remains classified, but it is known that he recruited mathematicians and taught them cryptanalysis.[11]\nHe served on the advisory boards for the National Security Agency and the Institute for Defense Analyses, and he continued to recruit, and to advise the military on cryptanalysis, almost to the end of his life.[11]/nGleason made fundamental contributions to widely varied areas of mathematics, including the theory of Lie groups,[1] quantum mechanics,[18]\nand combinatorics.[25]\nAccording to Freeman Dyson's famous classification of mathematicians as being either birds or frogs,[26]\nGleason was a frog: he worked as a problem solver rather than a visionary formulating grand theories.[7]/nIn 1900 David Hilbert posed 23 problems he felt would be central to next century of mathematics research. Hilbert's fifth problem concerns the characterization of Lie groups by their actions on topological spaces: to what extent does their topology provide information sufficient to determine their geometry?/nThe \"restricted\" version of Hilbert's fifth problem (solved by Gleason) asks, more specifically, whether every locally Euclidean topological group is a Lie group. That is, if a group G has the structure of a topological manifold, can that structure be strengthened to a real analytic structure, so that within any neighborhood of an element of G, the group law is defined by a convergent power series, and so that overlapping neighborhoods have compatible power series definitions? Prior to Gleason's work, special cases of the problem had been solved by L. E. J. Brouwer, John von Neumann, Lev Pontryagin, and Garrett Birkhoff, among others.[1][27]/nGleason's interest in the fifth problem began in the late 1940s, sparked by a course he took from George Mackey.[6]\nIn 1949 he published a paper introducing the \"no small subgroups\" property of Lie groups (the existence of a neighborhood of the identity within which no nontrivial subgroup exists) that would eventually be crucial to its solution.[1]\nHis 1952 paper on the subject, together with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group.[1][27] Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property.[1][27] As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere.[6] On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.[6][B]/nThe \"unrestricted\" version of Hilbert's fifth problem, closer to Hilbert's original formulation, considers both a locally Euclidean group G and another manifold M on which G has a continuous action. Hilbert asked whether, in this case, M and the action of G could be given a real analytic structure. It was quickly realized that the answer was negative, after which attention centered on the restricted problem.[1][27] However, with some additional smoothness assumptions on G and M,  it might yet be possible to prove the existence of a real analytic structure on the group action.[1][27] The Hilbert\u2013Smith conjecture, still unsolved, encapsulates the remaining difficulties of this case.[28]/nThe Born rule states that an observable property of a quantum system is defined by a Hermitian operator on a separable Hilbert space, that the only observable values of the property are the eigenvalues of the operator, and that the probability of the system being observed in a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the complex number obtained by projecting the state vector (a point in the Hilbert space) onto the corresponding eigenvector. \nGeorge Mackey had asked whether Born's rule is a necessary consequence of a particular set of axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.[18]/nGleason's theorem implies the nonexistence of certain types of hidden variable theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem could be used to remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.[18]/nThe Ramsey number R(k,l) is the smallest number r such that every graph with at least r vertices contains either a k-vertex clique or an l-vertex independent set. Ramsey numbers require enormous effort to compute; when max(k,l)\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 only finitely many of them are known precisely, and an exact computation of R(6,6) is believed to be out of reach.[29] In 1953, the calculation of R(3,3) was given as a question in the Putnam Competition; in 1955, motivated by this problem,[30] Gleason and his co-author Robert E. Greenwood made significant progress in the computation of Ramsey numbers with their proof that R(3,4)\u00a0=\u00a09, R(3,5)\u00a0=\u00a014, and R(4,4)\u00a0=\u00a018. Since then, only five more of these values have been found.[31] In the same 1955 paper, Greenwood and Gleason also computed the multicolor Ramsey number R(3,3,3): the smallest number r such that, if a complete graph on r vertices has its edges colored with three colors, then it necessarily contains a monochromatic triangle. As they showed, R(3,3,3)\u00a0=\u00a017; this remains the only nontrivial multicolor Ramsey number whose exact value is known.[31] As part of their proof, they used an algebraic construction to show that a 16-vertex complete graph can be decomposed into three disjoint copies of a triangle-free 5-regular graph with 16 vertices and 40 edges[25][32]\n(sometimes called the Greenwood\u2013Gleason graph).[33]/nRonald Graham writes that the paper by Greenwood and Gleason \"is now recognized as a classic in the development of Ramsey theory\".[30] In the late 1960s, Gleason became the doctoral advisor of Joel Spencer, who also became known for his contributions to Ramsey theory.[25][34]/nGleason published few contributions to coding theory, but they were influential ones,[25] and included \"many of the seminal ideas and early results\" in algebraic coding theory.[35] During the 1950s and 1960s, he attended monthly meetings on coding theory with Vera Pless and others at the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory.[36] Pless, who had previously worked in abstract algebra but became one of the world's leading experts in coding theory during this time, writes that \"these monthly meetings were what I \nlived for.\" She frequently posed her mathematical problems to Gleason and was often rewarded with a quick and insightful response.[25]/nThe Gleason\u2013Prange theorem is named after Gleason's work with AFCRL researcher Eugene Prange; it was originally published in a 1964 AFCRL research report by H. F. Mattson Jr. and E. F. Assmus Jr.\nIt concerns the quadratic residue code of order n, extended by adding a single parity check bit. This \"remarkable theorem\"[37] shows that this code is highly symmetric, having the projective linear group PSL2(n) as a subgroup of its symmetries.[25][37]/nGleason is the namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that generate the weight enumerators of linear codes.[25][38] These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2\u00a0+\u00a0y2 and x8\u00a0+\u00a014x2y2\u00a0+\u00a0y8.[25] Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving a relationship between the weight enumerators of codes and their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.[25]/nIn this area, he also did pioneering work in experimental mathematics, performing computer experiments in 1960. This work studied the average distance to a codeword, for a code related to the Berlekamp switching game.[12][39]/nGleason founded the theory of Dirichlet algebras,[40]\nand made other math\u00ade\u00admat\u00adi\u00adcal contributions including work on\nfinite geometry[41] and on\nthe enumerative combinatorics of permutations.[7]\n(In 1959 he wrote that his research \"sidelines\" included \"an intense interest in combinatorial problems.\")[3]\nAs well, he was not above publishing research in more elementary mathematics, such as the derivation of the set of polygons that can be constructed with compass, straightedge, and an angle trisector.[7]/nIn 1952 Gleason was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science's Newcomb Cleveland Prize[42]\nfor his work on Hilbert's fifth problem.[3]\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[6][12]\nand belonged to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France.[3]/nIn 1981 and 1982 he was president of the American Mathematical Society,[6]\nand at various times held numerous other posts in professional and scholarly organizations,\nincluding chairmanship of the Harvard Department of Mathematics.[43]\nIn 1986 he chaired the organizing committee for the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley, California, and was president of the Congress.[16]/nIn 1996 the Harvard Society of Fellows held a special symposium honoring Gleason on his retirement after seven years as its chairman;[14]\nthat same year, the Mathematics Association of America awarded him the Yueh-Gin Gung and Dr. Charles Y.

He was taught by the French Jesuit theologian, mathematician, physicist and controversialist Honor\u00e9 Fabri and became part of a circle formed by Fabri which included Giovanni Domenico Cassini, Claude Fran\u00e7ois Milliet Dechales, Christiaan Huygens and his brother Constantijn, Gottfried Leibniz, Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Marin Mersenne.[4] He became a member of French Academy of Sciences in 1678,  upon the death of Jacques Buot, and subsequently became active as an astronomer, calculating tables of the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets and designing contrivances for aiming aerial telescopes.[5] From 1679\u20131682 he made several observations and measurements of the French coastline,[6] and in 1683 aided in mapping France by extending the Paris meridian to the north.[7] In 1683 La Hire assumed the chair of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal.

He held the Savilian Chair of Geometry at the University of Oxford from  1827 to 1860. Powell was a prominent liberal theologian who put forward advanced ideas about evolution./nBaden Powell II was born at Stamford Hill, Hackney in London.[2] His father, Baden Powell I (1767-1841), of Langton and Speldhurst in Kent, was a wine merchant,[2] who served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1831, and as Master of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1822.[3] The mother of Baden Powell II was Hester Powell (1776-1848), his father's paternal first cousin,[2][4] a daughter of James Powell (1737-1824) of Clapton, Hackney, Middlesex, Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters in 1818.[5]/nThe Powell family can be traced back to the early 16th century, where they were yeomen farmers at Mildenhall in Suffolk.[5] Baden Powell II's great-grandfather, David Powell (1725-1810) of Homerton, Middlesex,[5] a second son, migrated to the City of London aged 17 in 1712, subsequently going into business as a merchant at Old Broad Street and buying the manor of Wattisfield in Suffolk.[6][4]  In 1740 a branch of the family bought the Whitefriars Glass works.[7]/nThe name Baden originated in Susanna Baden (1663-1737), the maternal grandmother of David Powell (1725-1810) of Homerton, Middlesex,[5] and one of the ten children of Andrew Baden (1637-1716), a Mercer who served as Mayor of Salisbury in 1682.[8]/nPowell was admitted as an undergraduate at Oriel College, Oxford in 1814,[9] and graduated with a first-class honours degree in mathematics in 1817.[2]/nPowell was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in 1821, having served as curate of Midhurst, Sussex.[2] His first living was as Vicar of Plumstead, Kent, of which the advowson was owned by his family.[2] He immediately began his scientific work there, starting with experiments on radiant heat.[2]/nPowell married three times, and had fourteen children in total. His widow changed the last name of the surviving children of his third marriage to \"Baden-Powell\".[10]/nPowell's first marriage on 21 July 1821 to Eliza Rivaz (died 13 March 1836) was childless./nHis second marriage on 27 September 1837 to Charlotte Pope (died 14 October 1844) produced one son and three daughters:/nHis third marriage on 10 March 1846 (at St Luke's Church, Chelsea) to Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824\u201313 October 1914), a daughter of Admiral Smyth, produced seven sons and three daughters:/nShortly after Powell's death in 1860, his wife renamed the remaining children of his third marriage 'Baden-Powell'; the name was eventually legally changed by royal licence on 30 April 1902.[12] Baden Henry Powell is often also referred to as Baden Henry Baden-Powell,[13] and was using this name by the 1891 census./nPowell was an outspoken advocate of the constant uniformity of the laws of the material world. His views were liberal, and he was sympathetic to evolutionary theory long before Charles Darwin had revealed his ideas. He argued that science should not be placed next to scripture or the two approaches would conflict, and in his own version of Francis Bacon's dictum, contended that the book of God's works was separate from the book of God's word, claiming that moral and physical phenomena were completely independent.[14]/nHis faith in the uniformity of nature (except man's mind) was set out in a theological argument; if God is a lawgiver, then a \"miracle\" would break the lawful edicts that had been issued at Creation. Therefore, a belief in miracles would be entirely atheistic.[15] Powell's most significant works defended, in succession, the uniformitarian geology set out by Charles Lyell and the evolutionary ideas in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation published anonymously by Robert Chambers which applied uniform laws to the history of life in contrast to more respectable ideas such as catastrophism involving a series of divine creations.[14] \"He insisted that no tortured interpretation of Genesis would ever suffice; we had to let go of the Days of Creation and base Christianity on the moral laws of the New Testament.\"[16]/nThe boldness of Powell and other theologians in dealing with science led Joseph Dalton Hooker to comment in a letter to Asa Gray dated 29 March 1857: \"These parsons are so in the habit of dealing with the abstractions of doctrines as if there was no difficulty about them whatever, so confident, from the practice of having the talk all to themselves for an hour at least every week with no one to gainsay a syllable they utter, be it ever so loose or bad, that they gallop over the course when their field is Botany or Geology as if we were in the pews and they in the pulpit. Witness the self-confident style of Whewell and Baden Powell, Sedgwick and Buckland.\" William Whewell, Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland opposed evolutionary ideas.[17]/nWhen the idea of natural selection was mooted by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in their 1858 papers to the Linnaean Society, both Powell and his brother-in-law[18] William Henry Flower thought that natural selection made creation rational.[19]/nThe 'Philosophy of Creation' has been treated in a masterly manner by the Rev. Baden Powell, in his 'Essays on the Unity of Worlds,' 1855. Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that the introduction of new species is \"a regular, not a casual phenomenon,\" or, as Sir John Herschel expresses it, \"a natural in contra-distinction to a miraculous process.\"[20]/nHe was one of seven liberal theologians who produced a manifesto titled Essays and Reviews around February 1860, which amongst other things joined in the debate over On the Origin of Species. These Anglicans included Oxford professors, country clergymen, the headmaster of Rugby school and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Charles Darwin. Essays sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the Origin sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.[15]/nReferring to \"Mr Darwin's masterly volume\" and restating his argument that belief in miracles is atheistic, Baden Powell wrote that the book \"must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.\":/nJust a similar scepticism has been evinced by nearly all the first physiologists of the day, who have joined in rejecting the development theories of Lamarck and the Vestiges; and while they have strenuously maintained successive creations, have denied strenuously maintained successive creations, have denied and denounced the alleged production of organic life by Messrs. Crosse and Weekes, and stoutly maintained the impossibility of spontaneious generation, on the alleged ground of contradiction to experience. Yet it is now acknowledged under the high sanction of the name of Owen (British Association Address 1858), that 'creation' is only another name for our ignorance of the mode of production; and it has been the unanswered and unanswerable argument of another reasoner that new species must have originated either out of their inorganic elements, or out of previously organized forms; either development or spontaneous generation must be true: while a work has now appeared by a naturalist of the most acknowledged authority, Mr. Darwin's masterly volume on The Origin of Species by the law of 'natural selection' \u2013 which now substantiates on undeniable grounds the very principle so long denounced by the first naturalist \u2013 the origination of new species by natural causes: a work which must soon bring about an entire revolution of opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature.[21]/nHe would have been on the platform at the British Association for the Advancement of Science 1860 Oxford evolution debate that was a highlight of the reaction to Darwin's theory. Huxley's antagonist Wilberforce was also the foremost critic of Essays and Reviews. Powell died of a heart attack a fortnight before the meeting.[15] He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London./nLewis Carroll attended the lectures on pure geometry by Baden Powell.[23]/nIn 1970, 170 volumes from Powell's library were presented to the Bodleian Libraries by his grandson, D. F. W. Baden Powell.[24] See Rare Books Named Collections for more information on the contents of this collection./n* Corsi, Pietro (1988).

He grew up on a farm in northern Missouri. He attended a one-room schoolhouse and to get to high school, he had to ride a horse. Skaggs was the oldest of three children and his father planned for Skaggs to become a farmer. Instead, Skaggs had other interests and found amazement with tinkering, and enjoyed designing and building contraptions and made plans for a science career. He attended the University of Missouri and completed a B.S. in chemistry with a minor in mathematics in 1933 and M.S. in physics in 1934.[1] He moved to Chicago in 1935, entered the University of Chicago and was accepted into the graduate program in nuclear physics. In 1939, Skaggs was awarded a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. At the University of Chicago, Skaggs had a post-doctoral fellowship in nuclear physics and secured part-time work at the Tumor Clinic at Michael Reese Hospital in radiation oncology. From 1941 \u2013 1943, the war effort took him to Washington, D.C. where he served at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Skaggs worked with physicist Nicholas Smith to design an airplane proximity detection system that utilized radio waves to locate and detonate anti-aircraft shells.[1]/nIn 1943, he was sent to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, working under Robert Oppenheimer to develop the atomic bomb. At Los Alamos, Skaggs was charged with the task of adapting the anti-aircraft detection system into a failsafe \"fuse\" for the first bomb that would be used against Japan.[1]/nFrom a distance of 20 miles, Skaggs witnessed the first test at Alamogordo, New Mexico. Skaggs immediately understood that the current plans left an unacceptable amount of time for the bombardiers to safely escape from the drop zone. He developed a system with two back-up systems that allowed additional time to for the plane and crew to make a secure exit from the skies over Japan.[1]/nWhen World War II ended Skaggs returned home to Chicago and went back to work on the medical applications of radiation. He resumed his work at Michael Reese Hospital and went on assignment to the physics department at the University of Illinois to team with Donald Kerst for a physics research project. This began what was to become a classic case of collaborative work between two individuals. The goal was to utilize a Betatron to extract an electron beam for medical use. The betatron was invented by Kerst for physics experiments.[2][3]/nAs serendipity often plays a role in medical and scientific developments, sometimes accompanied by a dose of irony, chance presented a member of the team, who was a promising physics graduate student. The student was diagnosed with a brain tumor, glioblastoma multiformae and no current treatment options available for the tumor. The first clinical use of the high energy Betatron radiation for medical therapy proved beneficial to effectively reduce the mass of the tumor, yet not sufficient to eliminate the tumor and provide a cure.[4]/nIn 1948, Skaggs accepted a faculty appointment as assistant professor of radiology at the University of Chicago. In 1949, he took the promotion to associate professor with the responsibility for the development of radiation therapy equipment and facilities at Argonne Cancer Research Hospital (ACRH). The Atomic Energy Commission program, titled \"Atoms for Peace\" funded the facilities at ACRH. In 1953, the ACRH was among the initial list of hospitals dedicated to radiation therapy for cancer treatment.[5][6]/nAt ACRH, the next project for the Skaggs and Lanzl team was the design of a cobalt treatment unit, that was built for the most part, in the machine shops of ACRH and the University of Illinois.[4]/nThe duo of Skaggs and Lanzl began in the 1950s another project. This time the goal was to develop and establish a graduate program in medical physics, perhaps the first in the United States. In the 1960s, a doctorate program was launched that would award a Ph.D. degree in medical physics.[5]/nIn 1956, Skaggs, received a promotion to full professor. He designed and built an analog computer to calculate the radiation dose to tissue to be utilized in treatment plans for radiation therapy. The \u2018computer\u2019 was finally running by 1963 and the components occupied a small room.[7]/nIn the 1970s, Franca T. Kuchnir and Skaggs developed a method to produce neutrons for radiation therapy, maybe the first fast-neutron therapy facility in the United States.[8][9]", "64112036": "Carrie Diaz Eaton is an associate professor of digital and computational studies at Bates College, a co-founder of QUBES (Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis), and project director for Math Mamas.

Jones is best known for his authorship of The Present State of Virginia, and a short view of Maryland and North Carolina (London, 1724). For several years he taught mathematics at The College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Jones Hall is named for him./nHe appears to have been born in Herefordshire, England, just east of Wales, in the parish of Little Dewchurch. Alumni records at Oxford University list his matriculation to Jesus College in March 1708, age 17, placing his birth around 1691. He received the B.A. in 1712, according to these records, and the M.A. in 1716.[1] In a deposition given at age 49 (1740), he said \"That he learnt Arithmetick at School, studied Geometry, Geography and Astronomy in the University of Oxford;\" that he there took the degrees of B.A. and M.A.; that \"Doctor Robinson, then Bishop of London ... advised [him] to perfect himself, as well as Time would allow, in the Mathematicks, for that his Lordship intended to send him over to the Colledge of William and Mary in Virginia, as Professor of the Mathematicks. That, thereupon, [he] applied himself to the Study of Algebra (which he had not applied himself to before) under the Instruction of Mr. Hudson of Christ-Church, and was admitted Professor of Mathematicks in the Colledge of William and Mary aforesaid, in the Year 1717, and continued studying and teaching the Mathematicks there till 1721.\"[2]/nBesides the College of William and Mary, Jones can be connected in some leadership capacity with Bruton Parish Church in Williamsburg, Jamestown Church, and St. Stephen's Church of King and Queen's County. He served at least two terms, also, as Chaplain of the House of Burgesses in the Colonial Capital of Williamsburg. Allied with Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood in a dispute over ecclesiastical authority granted to James Blair, Head of the College, he fell out with Blair and, apparently, returned to England for some time after 1721. Upon his return to Virginia around 1724, Blair appointed him to lead the highly contentious congregation of St. Stephen's. He resigned that post about 1725, after a dispute over the placement of the church pulpit.[3] He then migrated north, to Maryland./nJones led the William and Mary Parish Church in Charles County, Maryland for the next five or six years, after which, in 1731, he moved farther north to St. Stephen's Church, North Sassafras Parish, Cecil County, Maryland. Apart from his clerical duties at St. Stephen's, Jones also headed a committee of Maryland mathematicians in the dispute between Maryland and Pennsylvania over the circular northern border of Delaware. The above-mentioned deposition can be found in legal documents related to that dispute.[4] Jones held the rectorship at St. Stephen's until just before his death on 8 September 1760, around age 70. His burial site is the cemetery there. He is buried next to his nephew, William Barroll, who succeeded him as rector. Nearly a century after his death the Rev. Ethan Allen, D.D. would write: \"Mr. Jones was a man of very considerable learning and he gained strong friendships wherever he went. His piety was earnest and his morals unexceptionable. He had a clear, vigorous mind and wrote in a style once lucid and chaste. His published works do credit to his memory.\"[5]/nHugh Jones's most well known work is based on his first several years of residence in America, and remains a primary resource for Virginia's colonial history. The book was occasioned, he wrote, by his finding that \"few people in England (even many concerned in public affairs of this kind) have correct Notions of the true State of the Plantations [Colonies], and having been eagerly applied to frequently by Persons of the greatest Figure, Experience and Judgment in political and national Concerns, for Information concerning all the Circumstances of Virginia, [he] was requested to digest methodically and publish what [he] knew and thought of these Matters.\" About the slavery he encountered on the plantations he observed that the slaves' work \"is not very laborious, their greatest Hardship consisting in that they and their Posterity are not at their own Liberty or Disposal, but are the Property of their Owners; and when they are free, they know not how to provide so well for themselves generally; neither did they live so plentifully nor (many of them) so easily in their own Country, where they are made Slaves to one another, or taken Captive by their Enemies.\" Included in the work also is this erroneous prediction: \"There can be no Room for real Apprehension of Danger of a Revolt of the Plantations in future Ages. Or if any of them should attempt it, they might very easily be reduced by the others; for all of them will never unite with one another.\"/nIn 1724, while he was in England, Jones also published an English grammar, Accidence to the English Tongue, chiefly for the use of such boys and men, as have never learnt Latin perfectly, and for the benefit of the female sex; also for the Welch, Scotch, Irish and foreigners.  In the assessment of one scholar, \"A complete reading of the little grammar will prove the author's gift for simplicity and directness....It reflects a pleasantly unostentatious mind, of marked seriousness....\"[6] Though sometimes called \"The First Colonial Grammar in English\",[7] or mistakenly credited as the first grammar written by and American in America,[8] Jones was an Englishman, the book was written in England between 1721 and 1724, and it was published in \"London: printed for John Clarke, 1724.\"[9] It is not clear if Jones used it when he returned to America, as he was fully occupied with clerical duties, or that anyone else taught from it: only two paper copies of this short book remain, one in the British Library and one at Columbia University.[10]/nThe Gentleman's Magazine[11] (London) of July 1745, pp.\u00a0377\u201379, contains \"An Essay on the British computation of time, coin, weights and measures,\" outlining a calendar reform called the Georgian Calendar, after King George II of Great Britain. The essay is signed \"Hirossa Ap-Iccim,\" whose residence is given as Maryland. It proposes a calendar year of 364 weekdays, divided into thirteen 28\u00a0day months. The same calendar plan is expounded in a pamphlet authored by one \"H.J.,\" which appeared in London in 1753: Pancronometer, or Universal Georgian Calendar. Bundled with it was a treatise on \"The Reasons, Rules and Uses of Octave Computation, or Natural Arithmetic.\" In the Pancronometer, H.J.'s authorship of the 1745 essay is acknowledged. It is theorised there that the Earth would originally have orbited the Sun in exactly 364\u00a0days, on a perfect circle, but slipped into a slightly longer, elliptical orbit as a result of the great flood.[12]/nJones's most original contribution to calendar reform is the proposal to remove one or two days from the cycle of the week, thereby establishing a perennial calendar, beginning every year on the same weekday. The same idea had been thought of ~1650\u00a0years earlier c.\u00a0100\u00a0BCE and incorporated into the calendar used by the Qumran community,[13] but was lost c.\u00a068\u00a0CE when the Romans eradicated Qumran. The idea is suggested again in 1834, by Abbot Marco Mastrofini. It is also employed in Auguste Comte's Positivist Calendar (1849), which, except for month names and holidays, is virtually the same as the Georgian calendar. In the mid twentieth century, reformers promoting the International Fixed Calendar and The World Calendar employed the same technique, often referring to the 365th and 366th\u00a0days as \"blank days.\"/nThe \"Essay\" mentioned above contains also the recommendation that divisions of coins, weights and measures be based on 8 instead of 10. \"Whereas reason and convenience indicate to us a uniform standard for all quantities; which I shall call the Georgian standard; and that is only to divide every integer in each species into eight equal parts, and every part again into 8 real or imaginary particles, as far as is necessary.

Best known for introducing Brouncker's formula, he also worked as a civil servant, serving as a commissioner in the Royal Navy. Brouncker was a friend and colleague of Samuel Pepys, and features prominently in the Pepys' diary./nBrouncker was born c.\u20091620 in Castlelyons, County Cork, the elder son of William Brouncker (1585\u20131649), 1st Viscount Brouncker and Winifred, daughter of Sir William Leigh of Newnham. His family came originally from Melksham in Wiltshire. His grandfather Sir Henry Brouncker (died 1607) had been Lord President of Munster 1603\u20131607, and settled his family in Ireland. His father was created a viscount in the Peerage of Ireland in 1645 for his services to the Crown. Although the first viscount had fought for the Crown in the Anglo-Scots war of 1639, malicious gossip said that he paid the then enormous sum of \u00a31200 for the title and was almost ruined as a result. He died only a few months afterwards./nWilliam obtained a DM at the University of Oxford in 1647. Until 1660 he played no part in public life: being a staunch Royalist, he felt it best to live quietly and devote himself to his mathematical studies. He was one of the founders and the first president of the Royal Society. In 1662, he became chancellor to Queen Catherine, then head of the Saint Catherine's Hospital. He was appointed one of the commissioners of the Royal Navy in 1664, and his career thereafter can be traced in the Diary of Samuel Pepys; despite their frequent disagreements, Samuel Pepys on the whole respected Brouncker more than most of his other colleagues, writing in 1668 that \"in truth he is the best of them\"./nAlthough his attendance at the Royal Society had become infrequent, and he had quarrelled with some of his fellow members, he was nonetheless greatly displeased to be deprived of the presidency in 1677. He was commissioner for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of England from 1679.[1]/nBrouncker never married, but lived for many years with the actress Abigail Williams (much to Pepys' disgust) and left most of his property to her. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Clere (died 1622), first and last of the Clere Baronets, and the estranged wife of John Williams, otherwise Cromwell, second son of Sir Oliver Cromwell, and first cousin to the renowned Oliver Cromwell. She and John had a son and a daughter. The fire of 1673 which destroyed the Royal Navy Office started in her private closet: this is unlikely to have improved her relations with Samuel Pepys, whose private apartments were also destroyed in the blaze./nOn Brouncker's death in 1684, his title passed to his brother Henry, one of the most detested men of the era. William left him almost nothing in his will \"for reasons I think not fit to mention\"./nHis mathematical work concerned in particular the calculations of the lengths of the parabola and cycloid, and the quadrature of the hyperbola,[2] which requires approximation of the natural logarithm function by infinite series.[3] He was the first European to solve what is now known as Pell's equation.

Mathews, and Theo van Lint also concur with 610\u2013685,[19][4][3] while Greenwood suggests c. 600\u2013670.[10] Vardanyan places his death in the early 690s.[20]/nAnania is the only classical Armenian scholar to have written an autobiography.[5] It is a brief text, characterized as \"somewhat self-congratulatory\"[6] and \"more a statement of academic pedigree\" than autobiography.[21] It was probably written as the preface to one of his scholarly works, possibly the K\u2019nnikon.[4] He was the son of Yovhannes and was born in the village of Anania/Aneank\u2019 (\u0531\u0576\u0565\u0561\u0576\u0584) or in the town of Shirakavan (Yerazgavors),[22] in the canton of Shirak, in the central Armenian province of Ayrarat.[23] Aneank' may be connected to the later city of Ani, the Bagratid Armenian capital.[24]/nAnania probably came from a noble family.[4] Since his name is sometimes spelled as Shirakuni (\u0547\u056b\u0580\u0561\u056f\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b), Hewsen argued that he may have belonged to the house of the Kamsarakan or Arsharuni princes of Shirak and Arsharunik\u2019, respectively.[5] Greenwood suggests that it is more likely that Anania came from the lesser nobility in Shirak, who served the house of Kamsarakan.[25] Broutian describes his father as a \"minor Armenian nobleman.\"[26] Vardanyan believes he either came from the Kamsarakan family or that they were his patrons.[27]/nAnania is traditionally thought to have been buried in the village of Anavank\u2019; however, the tradition probably originated from the name of the village.[3]/nAnania received his early education at the local Armenian schools, possibly at Dprevank\u2019 monastery,[28] where he studied sacred texts and earlier Armenian authors.[5][29] Due to the lack of teachers and books in Armenia, he decided to travel to the Byzantine Empire to study mathematics.[10][29] After first traveling to Theodosiopolis, then to the Byzantine-controlled province of Fourth Armenia (probably Martyropolis),[1] where he studied under the mathematician Christosatur for six months.[1] He then left to find a better teacher and learned about Tychicus,[b] who was based at the monastery (or martyrium) of Saint Eugenios in Trebizond.[5][10] Redgate placed this in the 620s.[1] Greenwood has speculated that Tychicus, not mentioned elsewhere, may actually be Stephanus of Alexandria.[30]/nAnania devoted a significant part of his autobiography to Tychicus (born c. 560), with whom he spent eight years in the 620s or 630s.[31] Tychicus had studied the Armenian language and its literature while serving in the Byzantine army in Armenia.[6][32] Wounded by the Persians, he retired from the military and later studied in Alexandria, Rome, and Constantinople.[6][32] Tychicus later returned to his native Trebizond, where he established a school c. 615.[32] Tychicus taught many students from Constantinople (including from the imperial court) and was renowned among Byzantine kings.[33][10] He provided Anania special attention and taught him what Anania called a \"perfect knowledge of mathematics\".[18] In Tychicus's vast library, Anania found \"everything, exoteric and esoteric\",[19] including sacred and secular Greek authors, including works on the sciences, medicine, chronology, and history.[34] Russell believed his library may have included Pythagorean and alchemical books.[19] Anania considered Tychicus to have been \"predestined by God for the introduction of science into Armenia.\"[32]/nAnania himself established a school in Armenia upon his return.[18] That school, the first in Armenia to teach quadrivium, is presumed to have been located in his native Shirak.[3][32] He was disappointed with the laziness of his students and their departure after learning the basics.[32] Anania complained about Armenians' lack of interest in mathematics,[6] writing that they \"love neither learning, nor knowledge.\"[35] Nicholas Adontz considered it an exaggeration, \"if not an absolute slander, to deny the Armenian innate love of investigation.\"[36] The 12th-century chronicler Samuel of Ani listed five of Shirakatsi's students,[3] who are otherwise unknown.[37] Anania financed his research in several fields with the money he earned teaching.[32]/nAnania had a close relationship with the Church.[38] Several scholars consider him a church ideologist akin to Cosmas Indicopleustes,[38] whom he actually criticized.[39] Hacikyan et al. describe Anania as a \"devout Christian and well versed in the Bible\" who \"made some attempts to reconcile science and Scripture.\"[40] In his later years, Anania may have been a monk in the Armenian Church.[5] This is based on his religious discourses and attempts to date the feasts of the church.[41] John A. C. Greppin doubts that Anania was ever in any religious order.[42]/nHewsen noted that some of Anania's \"more revolutionary ideas\" were suppressed by the Armenian Church after his death.[43] Greppin noted that Anania, a largely secular author, had fallen into a \"bad clerical odor.\"[42] Soviet historians represented him as a founder of irreligious and anti-clerical thought in Armenia, who pioneered double-truth theory.[44] Vazgen Chaloyan called him a \"progressive representative of the feudal period of Armenian science.\"[45] Gevorg Khrlopian went as far as to argue that Anania was an enemy of the Armenian Church and fought against its obscurantism.[38] Hewsen opposed this view, suggesting that, instead, he was an \"independent thinker of sorts.\"[5]/nAnania is considered by modern scholars to be a representative of the Hellenizing School since many of his works were based on classical Greek sources.[46][47] He was the first Armenian scholar to have \"imported a set of scientific notions, and examples of their applications, from the Greek-speaking schools\" into Armenia.[48] He was well versed in Greek literature,[49] and the influence of Greek syntax is evident in his works.[50] Anania was also knowledgeable about native Armenian and Iranian cultural traditions;[10] several of his works provide important information on late Sassanian Iran.[10]/nJames R. Russell describes him an alchemist and a Pythagorean who \"does not usually rely on mythology to explain natural phenomena.[51] Anania accepted the importance of experience, observation, rational practice and theory, and was influenced by the ideas of the 5th-century Neoplatonist philosopher Davit Anhaght (the Invincible), and Greek philosophers Thales of Miletus, Hippocrates, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno of Citium, Epicurus, Ptolemy, Pappus of Alexandria, and Cosmas Indicopleustes.[52] Aristotle's On the Heavens had a significant influence on Anania's thought.[35] According to Gevorg Khrlopian, Anania was heavily influenced by Yeghishe's An Interpretation of Creation, the anonymous Interpretation of the Categories of Aristotle, and the works of Davit Anhaght,[53] who had established Neoplatonism in Armenian thought.[52] Anania was also the first Armenian scholar to quote Philo of Alexandria.[29]/nAnania was the last known lay scholar in Christian Armenia until Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni in the 11th century.[5][6] He advocated rationalism in studying nature and attacked superstitious beliefs and astrology as the \"babblings of the foolish.\"[54][55] He adopted the classical theory of four elements, which considered all matter to be composed of four elements: fire, air, water, and earth. He believed that while God directly created these elements, He did not interfere with the \"natural course of the development of things.\" He asserted that the creation, existence, and decay of natural bodies and phenomena occurred through the union of these elements\u2014without the interference of God.[56] Both living and non-living matter came into existence from a synthesis of the four elements.[56]/nAnania accepted that the Earth is round, describing it as \"like an egg with a spherical yolk (the globe) surrounded by a layer of white (the atmosphere) and covered with a hard shell (the sky).\"[38] He accurately explained solar and lunar eclipses, the phases of the Moon, and the structure of the Milky Way,[54] describing the latter as a \"mass of dense but faintly luminous stars.\"[38] Anania also correctly attributed tides to the influence of the Moon.[43][55] He described the topmost sphere as the aether (arp\u2019i), the source of light and heat (through the Sun).[57]/nAnania was a polymath and natural philosopher.[58] About 40 works in various disciplines have been attributed to Anania, but only half are extant. They include studies and translations in mathematics, astronomy, cosmology, geography, chronology, and meteorology.[3] Many of his works are believed to have been part of the K\u2019nnikon (\u0554\u0576\u0576\u056b\u056f\u0578\u0576, from \"canon\", Greek: Kanonikon), completed circa 666,[3][59] and used as the standard science textbook in medieval Armenia.[4][60] According to Greenwood, the K\u2019nnikon was a \"fluid compilation, whose contents fluctuated over time, reflecting the interests and resources of different teachers and practitioners.\"[61]/nModern scholars have praised Anania's writing as concise, simple, and to the point, retaining the reader's attention and citing examples to illustrate his point.[54][52]/nAnania was primarily devoted to mathematics,[4] which he considered the \"mother of all knowledge.\"[3][5] His mathematical books were used as textbooks in Armenia.[6]/nOf Anania's several mathematical works, the most important is the book of arithmetic (Hamaroghut\u2019iun, \u0540\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0572\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576; or T\u2019vabanut\u2019iun, \u0539\u0582\u0561\u0562\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576),[62] a comprehensive collection of tables on the four basic operations.[54] It is the earliest extant known work of its kind.[3][8] The operations reach up to a total of 80 million, which is the highest number.[8] A possible theoretical part is believed lost.[54]/nProblems and Solutions (alternatively translated as On Questions and Answers), a collection of 24 arithmetical problems and their solutions, is based on the application of fractions;[54][9] it is the earliest such work in Armenian. Many of its problems allude to real-world situations: six connect to the princely house of Shirak, the Kamsarakans,[8] and at least three to Iran.[10] Greenwood calls the problems \"a rich source for seventh-century history whose value has not been sufficiently recognized.\"[63]/nThe third work, probably an appendix of the book of arithmetic, is titled Xrax\u010d\u0323anakank\u2019 (\u053d\u0580\u0561\u056d\u0573\u0561\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576\u0584), literally \"things for festive occasions\". It has been translated into English as Mathematical Pastimes,[62] Fun with Arithmetic or Problems for Amusement. It also contains 24 problems \"intended for mathematical entertainment in social gatherings.\"[54] According to Mathews this may be the oldest extant text of its kind.[9]/nFor his mathematical works, Anania developed a unique numerical notation based on 12 letters of the Armenian alphabet. For the units, he used the first nine letters of the Armenian script (\u0531, \u0532, \u0533, \u0534, \u0535, \u0536, \u0537, \u0538, \u0539), similar to the standard traditional Armenian numerical system. The letters used for 10, 100, and 1000 were also identical to the traditional Armenian system (\u053a, \u0543, \u054c), but all other numbers up to 10,000 were written using these 12 letters. For instance, 50 would be written \u0535\u053a (5\u00d710) and not \u053e as in the standard system. Thus, the notation is multiplicative-additive as opposed to the ciphered-additive standard system and requires knowing 12 letters, instead of 36, to write numbers less than 10,000. Numbers greater than that could be written using multiplicative combinations of just 2 or 3 signs, but using all 36 letters.[64]/nStephen Chrisomalis believes this system was created by Anania since it only occurs in his works and is not found in Greek, Syriac, Hebrew, or any other alphabetic numeral system.[65] Allen Shaw has argued it was just a variant of the Armenian numerals designed specifically for the representation of large numbers.[66] No other writer used it.[65]/nOne of Anania's most significant works is the Cosmology (\u054f\u056b\u0565\u0566\u0565\u0580\u0561\u0563\u056b\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576, Tiezeragitut\u2019iun).[67] Abrahamian's version is composed of ten chapters, with an introduction titled \"In the Fulfillment of a Promise\", implying a patron.[68] It covers the sun, the moon, celestial spheres, constellations, the Milky Way, and meteorological changes.[69]/nWorks used for the parts of the Cosmology include the Bible (mostly the Pentateuch and Psalms) and works by the Church Fathers. Anania cites the work of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory the Illuminator, and Amphiolocus (perhaps, of Iconium).[70] Some chapters of the work, such as \"On Clouds\" (also called \"On the Sky\" or \"Concerning the Skies\"), are largely based on Basil's Hexameron.[71] Anania also repeats the classical Greek notions in the fields of astronomy, physics or meteorology.[72] Pambakian wrote about the significance of the Cosmology:/nAnother of Anania's astronomical works, Tables of the Motions of the Moon (\u053d\u0578\u0580\u0561\u0576\u0584 \u0568\u0576\u0569\u0561\u0581\u056b\u0584 \u056c\u0578\u0582\u057d\u0578\u0575, Xorank\u2019 \u00ebnt\u2019ac\u2019ik\u2019 lusoy),[62] is based on the works of Meton of Athens and his own observations.[74]/nIn 667 Anania was invited by Catholicos Anastas I of Akori (r. 661/2\u2013667) to the Armenian Church's central seat at Dvin to establish a fixed calendar of the movable and immovable feasts of the Armenian Church.[6][75] The result was a perpetual calendar based on a 532-year cycle (\u0547\u053c\u0532 \u0562\u0578\u056c\u0578\u0580\u0561\u056f),[4] combining the solar cycle and the lunar cycle since they coincide every 532 years. It was first proposed by Victorius of Aquitaine in 457 and adopted by the Church of Alexandria.[38] Anania's calendar was never implemented by the Armenian Church;[4][6] Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi believes that Anastas's death prevented a church council from ratifying it.[76]/nThe Ashkharhatsuyts[6] (Classical Armenian: \u0531\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0580\u0570\u0561\u0581\u0578\u0575\u0581, A\u0161xarhac\u2019oyc\u2019, lit. \"showing the world\") is an anonymously published world map, believed to have been written sometime between 610 and 636.[77] According to Elizabeth Redgate, it was written \"probably shortly before AD 636\".[78] Its authorship has been disputed in the modern period; formerly believed to have been the work of Movses Khorenatsi, most scholars now attribute it to Anania.[79] Hewsen calls it \"one of the most valuable works to come down to us from Armenian antiquity.\"[80]/nThe Armenian Geography\u2014as it is alternatively known\u2014has been especially important for research into the history and geography of Greater Armenia, the Caucasus (Georgia and Caucasian Albania) and the Sasanian Empire,[10] which are all described in detail.[40][80] The territories are described before the Arab invasions and conquests.[17] The information on Armenia is not found elsewhere in historical sources,[9] as it is the only known Armenian geographical work prior to the 13th century.[7]/nThe Ashkharhatsuyts has survived in long and short recensions.[80] According to the scholarly consensus, the long recension was the original.[81] For the description of Europe, North Africa and Asia (all the known world from Spain to China),[9] it largely uses Greek sources, namely the now lost geography of Pappus of Alexandria (4th century), which in turn, is based on the Geography of Ptolemy (2nd century).[4][10][80] According to Hewsen, it is the \"last work based on ancient geographical knowledge written before the Renaissance.\"[38]/nIt was one of the earliest secular Armenian works to be published (in 1668 by Voskan Yerevantsi).[82] It has been translated into four languages: English, Latin (both 1736), French (1819), and Russian (1877).[83] In 1877, Kerovbe Patkanian first attributed it to Anania as the most probable author.[84]/nAnother geographical work of Anania, The Itinerary (\u0544\u0572\u0578\u0576\u0561\u0579\u0561\u0583\u0584, Mghonach\u2019ap\u2019k\u2019), may have been a part of the Ashkharhatsuyts. It presents six routes from Dvin, Armenia's capital at that time, to the major settlements in different directions, with distances in miles (\u0574\u0572\u0578\u0576, mghon), referring to the Arabic mile of 1,917.6 metres (6,291\u00a0ft), according to Hakob Manandian.[85]/nAnania's major chronological work, the Chronicle, listed important events in order of their occurrence.[6] Written between 686 and 690, it is composed of two parts: a universal chronicle, utilizing the lost works of Annianus of Alexandria and the lost Roman imperial sequence from Eusebius's Chronographia, and an ecclesiastical history from a miaphysite perspective, which records the six ecumenical councils.[86]/nAnother chronological work, known as the Calendar (Tomar), included texts and tables about the calendars of 15 peoples: Armenians, Hebrews, Arabs, Macedonians, Romans, Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Ethiopians, Athenians, Bythanians, Cappadocians, Georgians, Caucasian Albanians, and Persians.[87][88] The calendars of the Armenians, Romans, Hebrews, Syrians, Greeks, and Egyptians contain texts, while those of other peoples only have the names of months and their length.[89]/nAnania wrote several books on weights and measures. He extensively used the work of Epiphanius of Salamis to present the system of weights used by the Greeks, Jews, and Syrians, and his own knowledge as well as other sources for those of the Armenians and Persians.[90][9]/nAnania wrote several works on precious stones,[41] music, and the known languages of the world.[9]/nAnania's discourses on Christmas/Epiphany and Easter are discussions on the dates of the two feasts. In the first, he uses a lost work he ascribes to Polycarp of Smyrna and insists that the Armenian custom of celebrating Christmas and the Epiphany on the same date is truer to the holidays' intent than celebrating them separately as is common elsewhere in the Christian world.[41][62]/nAnania also wrote on herbal medicine, though none of his medical writings have survived. He is traditionally credited with the discovery of the miraculous flower called hamasp\u2019iw\u1e59 or hamasp\u2019iur (\u0570\u0561\u0574\u0561\u057d\u0583\u056b\u0582\u057c).[19] One 16th century manuscript mentions that he dealt with its therapeutic properties. It has been identified by modern scholars as Silene latifolia (white campion). He is credited with discovering the plant in Dzoghakert (near modern Ta\u015fburun, I\u011fd\u0131r, Turkey)[91] and using it medically.[92][93][94]/nAccording to a later legend, he taught alchemy to the king of Venice.[19]/nAnania laid the foundations of the exact sciences in Armenia and greatly influenced many Armenian scholars who came after him.[40][c] Hovhannes Imastaser (Hovhannes Sarkavag) and other medieval scholars extensively cited and incorporated Anania's works.[52] In a 1037 letter, Grigor Magistros, a scholar from the Pahlavuni noble family, asked Catholicos Petros Getadardz for Anania's manuscripts of his K\u2019nnikon, which were locked up at the catholicosate for centuries.[99][100] Grigor used these as a textbook at his school at the Sanahin Monastery.[101] Anania may had also influenced Byzantine Armenian scholars, such as the 9th century philosopher Leo[102] and the 14th century mathematician and grammarian Nicholas Artabasdos Rhabdas.[103]/nIn the printed age, passing references to Anania were made as early as 1742 by Paghtasar Dpir, but it was not until the latter half of the 19th century that Anania and his work became a subject of scholarly study.[104] In 1877 Armenian linguist and philologist Kerovbe Patkanian published a collection of Anania's works in the original classical Armenian at St Petersburg University.[105] Titled Sundry Studies (\u0544\u0576\u0561\u0581\u0578\u0580\u0564\u0584 \u0562\u0561\u0576\u056b\u0581, Mnats\u2019ordk\u2019 banits\u2019),[106] it is the first-ever print publication of his works.[40] Galust Ter-Mkrtchian published a number of Anania's works in 1896.[105] Joseph Orbeli, an Armenian member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, published a Russian translation of Anania's Problems and Solutions in 1918.[105]/nSystematic study and publication of his works began in the Soviet period.[105] Ashot G. Abrahamian, who began his research at the Matenadaran in the 1930s, first published one of Anania's arithmetical texts in 1939,[105] followed by a complete compilation of Anania's work in 1944.[107]/nAbrahamian's work was not received with universal acclaim. One critic objected to his 1944 compilation for attributing disputed works to Anania.[108] Abrahamian and Garegin Petrosian published an updated edition in 1979.[109] Some criticism persisted: Varag Arakelian noted a number of errors in translations from classical Armenian and concluded that a new translation of Anania's works was needed.[110] Another Soviet scholar, Suren T. Eremian, studied the Geography. He insisted on Anania's authorship and published his research in 1963.[111]/nThe first translation of Anania's work into a European language was done by the British Orientalist Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare, who translated into English Anania's On Christmas, in 1896, and On Easter and Anania's autobiography, in 1897.[112][105] Lemerle noted that Conybeare translated Anania's autobiography from a Russian translation, and it contains numerous serious errors.[113] Renewed interest in Anania's work emerged in the West in the 1960s. A French translation of his autobiography appeared in 1964 by Ha\u00efg Berb\u00e9rian.[114] Robert H. Hewsen authored an introductory article on Anania's life and scholarship in 1968.[115]/nGreenwood argues that studying Anania and his works \"resonated with twentieth-century political beliefs and offered a suitable subject for academic research in ways that works on medieval theology or Biblical exegesis did not. Anania came to be projected as a national hero from the distant Armenian past, linking and affirming past and present identities.\"[116]/nAnania is considered by modern scholars as the \"father of the exact sciences in Armenia.\"[117] Modern historians consider him as the greatest scientist of medieval Armenia[118] and, possibly, all Armenian history, up to the 20th century astrophysicist Viktor Ambartsumian.[119][120] He is widely regarded as the founder of the natural sciences in the country.[44] He was the first classical Armenian scholar to study mathematics and several scientific subjects, such as cosmography and chronology.[121][113] Nicholas Adontz argued that Anania \"occupied the same position in Armenian education as Leo [the Mathematician] did in Byzantine education. He was the first to sow the seeds of science among the Armenians.\"[122] Hacikyan et al. wrote in The Heritage of Armenian Literature:/nIn 1952 Yervand Kochar created a gypsum sculpture of Anania.[123] Shirakatsi was one of six medieval scholars whose statue was erected in front of the Matenadaran, the museum-institute of Armenian manuscripts in Yerevan, in the 1960s.[124] Sculpted by Grigor Badalyan in basalt, it was erected in 1963.[125] Another statue was erected in the front yard of Yerevan State University./nA crater on the Moon was named after Shirakatsi in 1979.[126]/nThe Anania Shirakatsy Lyceum, an International Baccalaureate school in Yerevan, was established in 1990.[127][128]/nIn 1993 the Medal of Anania Shirakatsi, a state award, was established, given for \"significant activities, inventions, and discoveries in the spheres of economy, engineering, architecture, science, and technology.\"[129] In 2005 the Central Bank of Armenia issued a commemorative coin, while HayPost issued a stamp dedicated to him.[130][131]", "14009810": "Burchard de Volder (26 July 1643 \u2013 21 March 1709) was a Dutch physicist./nHe was born in a Mennonite family in Amsterdam.

He later made important contributions to timekeeping, as well as to other fields in applied mathematics, such as economics and statistics. Fluent in several languages, he also wrote and published several popular science books and a science fiction novel./nSimon Newcomb was born in the town of Wallace, Nova Scotia. His parents were John Burton Newcomb and his wife Emily Prince. His father was an itinerant school teacher, and frequently moved in order to teach in different parts of Canada, particularly in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Through his mother, Simon Newcomb was a distant cousin of William Henry Steeves, a Canadian Father of Confederation. Their immigrant ancestor in that line was Heinrich Stief, who immigrated from Germany and settled in New Brunswick about 1760.[1]/nNewcomb seems to have had little conventional schooling and was taught by his father. He also had a short apprenticeship in 1851 to Dr. Foshay, a charlatan herbalist in New Brunswick. But his father gave him an excellent foundation for the youth's future studies. Newcomb was apprenticed to Dr. Foshay at the age of 16. Their agreement was that Newcomb would serve a five-year apprenticeship, during which time Foshay would train him in using herbs to treat illnesses. After two years Newcomb had become increasingly unhappy and disillusioned, as he realized that Foshay had an unscientific approach and was a charlatan. He left Foshay and broke their agreement. He walked the 120 miles (190\u00a0km) to the port of Calais, Maine. There he met a ship's captain who agreed to take him to Salem, Massachusetts, where his father had moved for a teaching job.[2] In about 1854, Newcomb joined his father in Salem, and the two journeyed together to Maryland./nNewcomb taught for two years in Maryland, from 1854 to 1856; for the first year in a country school in Massey's Cross Roads, Kent County, then for a year nearby in Sudlersville in Queen Anne's County. Both were located in the largely rural area of the Eastern Shore. In his spare time Newcomb studied a variety of subjects, such as political economy and religion, but his deepest studies were made in mathematics and astronomy./nIn particular he read Isaac Newton's Principia (1687) at this time. In 1856 Newcomb took a position as a private tutor close to Washington, DC. He often traveled to the city to study mathematics in its libraries. He borrowed a copy of Nathaniel Bowditch's translation of Pierre-Simon Laplace's Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste from the library of the Smithsonian Institution, but found the mathematics beyond him.[3]/nNewcomb independently studied mathematics and physics. For a time he supported himself by teaching before becoming a human computer (a functionary in charge of calculations) at the Nautical Almanac Office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1857. At around the same time, he enrolled at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, graduating with a BSc in 1858.[3]/nNewcomb studied mathematics under Benjamin Peirce, who also often invited the poor scholar to his home.[4] Newcomb's biographer Brent said in his 1993 book that the young man developed a dislike of Peirce's son, Charles Sanders Peirce and was accused of the \"successful destruction\" of C. S. Peirce's career.[5] In particular, Daniel Coit Gilman, president of Johns Hopkins University, was said to have been on the point of awarding tenure to C. S. Peirce, before Newcomb intervened behind the scenes to dissuade him.[6] Brent says that about 20 years later, Newcomb similarly influenced the Carnegie Institution Trustees to deny a Carnegie grant to C. S. Peirce. This prevented Peirce from publishing his life's work. The grant was supported by Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt, William James, and others, who wrote to support it.[7] Newcomb's motivation has been speculated to have been that, despite he being \"no doubt quite bright\", \"like Salieri in Peter Shaffer\u2019s Amadeus he also had just enough talent to recognize he was not a genius and just enough pettiness to resent someone who was\". Additionally \"an intensely devout and literal-minded Christian of rigid moral standards\", he was appalled by what he considered Peirce's personal shortcomings, making intolerable to Newcomb the fact that he had been reliant on the patronage of the father of a man he considered contemptible.[8]/nIn the prelude to the American Civil War, many US Navy staff with Southern backgrounds left the service. In 1861, Newcomb took advantage of a vacancy and was hired as professor of mathematics and astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory, in Washington D.C. Newcomb set to work on the measurement of the position of the planets as an aid to navigation, becoming increasingly interested in theories of planetary motion.[3]/nBy the time Newcomb visited Paris, France, in 1870, he was aware that the table of lunar positions calculated by Peter Andreas Hansen was in error. While in Paris, he realized that, in addition to the data from 1750 to 1838 that Hansen had used, there was earlier data documented as far back as 1672. But he had little time for analysis as he witnessed the defeat of French emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War and the coup that ended the Second French Empire. Newcomb managed to escape from the city during the ensuing rioting; it led to the formation of the Paris Commune and engulfed even the Paris Observatory. Newcomb used the \"new\" data to revise Hansen's tables.[3]/nIn 1875 he was offered the post of director of the Harvard College Observatory but he declined, having by now settled that his interests lay in mathematics rather than observation.[3]/nIn 1877 he became director of the Nautical Almanac Office where, ably assisted by George William Hill, he embarked on a program of recalculation of all the major astronomical constants. From 1884 he also fulfilled a demanding role as professor of mathematics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore./nWith A. M. W. Downing, Newcomb conceived a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject of astronomical constants. By the time he attended a standardization conference in Paris, France, in May 1896, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb's calculations: Newcomb's Tables of the Sun. As late as 1950, another conference confirmed Newcomb's constants as the international standard.[3]/nDuring the American Civil War, Newcomb married Mary Caroline Hassler on August 4, 1863. The couple had three daughters, and a son who died in infancy.[9] Mary Caroline Hassler's parents were US Navy Surgeon Dr. Charles Augustus Hassler and his wife. Her paternal grandfather was Ferdinand Hassler, the first Superintendent of the Coast Survey.[10]/nNewcomb died in Washington, D.C., on July 11, 1909, of bladder cancer. He was buried with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery with President William Howard Taft in attendance.[3]/nNewcomb's daughter Anita Newcomb McGee (1864-1940) became a medical doctor and founded the Army Nurse Corps. She received the Spanish War Service Medal for her services during the Spanish\u2013American War. For her later work in Japan, she was awarded the Japanese Imperial Order of the Precious Crown, the Japanese Red Cross decoration, and two Russo-Japanese War medals from the Japanese government. She was buried next to her father with full military honors.[11]/nNewcomb's daughter Anna Josepha studied at the Art Students' League in New York.[12] She was active in the suffrage movement. In 1912, she organized the first Cornwall meeting in support of voting rights for women.[12]  Josepha Newcomb married Edward Baldwin Whitney, who was the son of Professor William Dwight Whitney and his wife, and the grandson of US Senator and Connecticut Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin. He served as Assistant US Attorney General. Their grandson Hassler Whitney became a mathematician and professor.[13]/nIn 1878, Newcomb had started planning for a new and precise measurement of the speed of light. He believed it was needed to account for the exact values of many astronomical constants. He had already started developing a refinement of the method of L\u00e9on Foucault when he received a letter from Albert Abraham Michelson, a young naval officer and physicist who was also planning such a measurement. Thus began a long collaboration and friendship. In 1880, Michelson assisted at Newcomb's initial measurement with instruments located at Fort Myer and the United States Naval Observatory, then situated near the Potomac River. Michelson had left to start his own project by the time Newcomb arranged a second set of measurements between the observatory and the Washington Monument. Though Michelson published his first measurement in 1880, Newcomb's measurement was substantially different. In 1883, Michelson revised his measurement to a value closer to Newcomb's.[3][failed verification]/nIn 1881, Newcomb discovered the statistical principle now known as Benford's law. He observed that the earlier pages of logarithm books, used at that time to carry out logarithmic calculations, were far more worn than the later pages. This led him to formulate the principle that, in any list of numbers taken from an arbitrary set of data, more numbers will tend to begin with \"1\" than with any other digit.[14]/nIn 1891, within months of Seth Carlo Chandler's discovery of the 14-month variation of latitude, now referred to as the Chandler wobble, Newcomb explained the apparent conflict between the observed motion and predicted period of the wobble. The theory was based on a perfectly rigid body, but Earth is slightly elastic. Newcomb used the variation of latitude observations to estimate the elasticity of Earth, finding it to be slightly more rigid than steel.[15]/nNewcomb was an autodidact and polymath. He wrote on economics and his Principles of Political Economy (1885) was described by John Maynard Keynes as \"one of those original works which a fresh scientific mind, not perverted by having read too much of the orthodox stuff, is able to produce from time to time in a half-formed subject like economics.\" Newcomb was credited by Irving Fisher with the first-known enunciation of the equation of exchange between money and goods used in the quantity theory of money.[16] He spoke French, German, Italian and Swedish; was an active mountaineer; and read widely. He also wrote a number of popular science books and a science fiction novel, His Wisdom the Defender (1900).[3] Newcomb was the first person to observe the geophysical phenomenon Airglow, in 1901 [17]/nIn 1888 Simon Newcomb wrote: \"We are probably nearing the limit of all we can know about astronomy.\"\nIn 1900, his Elements of Astronomy was published by the American Book Company./nBy 1903, however, his view had changed. In an article in Science, he wrote:/n\"What lies before us is an illimitable field, the existence of which was scarcely suspected ten years ago, the exploration of which may well absorb the activities of our physical laboratories, and of the great mass of our astronomical observers and investigators for as many generations as were required to bring electrical science to its present state.\"[18]/nNewcomb is famously quoted as having believed it impossible to build a \"flying machine.\" He begins an article titled \"Is the Airship Possible?\" with the remark, \"That depends, first of all, on whether we are to make the requisite scientific discoveries.\" He ends with the remark \"the construction of an aerial vehicle\u00a0... which could carry even a single man from place-to-place at pleasure requires the discovery of some new metal or some new force.\"[19]/nIn the October 22, 1903, issue of The Independent, Newcomb made the well-known remark that \"May not our mechanicians\u00a0... be ultimately forced to admit that aerial flight is one of the great class of problems with which man can never cope, and give up all attempts to grapple with it?\",[20][21] He suggested that even if a man flew, he could not stop. \"Once he slackens his speed, down he begins to fall. Once he stops, he falls as a dead mass.\" Newcomb had no concept of an airfoil. His \"aeroplane\" was an inclined \"thin flat board\". He therefore concluded that it could never carry the weight of a man./nNewcomb was particularly critical of the work of Samuel Pierpont Langley, who claimed that he could build a flying machine powered by a steam engine, but whose initial efforts at flight were public failures.[22] In 1903, however, Newcomb was also saying,/n\"Quite likely the 20th century is destined to see the natural forces which will enable us to fly from continent to continent with a speed far exceeding that of a bird. But when we inquire whether aerial flight is possible in the present state of our knowledge; whether, with such materials as we possess, a combination of steel, cloth and wire can be made which, moved by the power of electricity or steam, shall form a successful flying machine, the outlook may be altogether different.\"[23]/nNewcomb was not aware of the Wright Brothers' efforts, whose work was done in relative obscurity (Santos-Dumont flew his 14-bis in Paris only in 1906) and apparently unaware of the internal combustion engine's better power-to-weight ratio. When Newcomb heard about the Wrights' flight in 1908, he was quick to accept it.[24]/nNewcomb favored the development of rotating wing (helicopters) and airships that would float in the air (blimps). Within a few decades, zeppelins regularly transported passengers between Europe and the United States, and the Graf Zeppelin circumnavigated the Earth.[25]/nNewcomb was the first president of the American Society for Psychical Research.[26] Although skeptical of extrasensory perception and alleged paranormal phenomena, he believed the subject was worthy of investigation. By 1889 his investigations were negative and his skepticism increased. Biographer Albert E. Moyer has noted that Newcomb \"convinced and hoped to convince others that, on methodological grounds, psychical research was a scientific dead end.\"[27]/nA number of astronomical, physical, and mathematical papers written between 1882 and 1912 are mentioned in \"Astronomical Papers Prepared For The Use Of The American Ephemeris And Nautical Almanac\".

He is a permanent member of Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques in France and a professor of mathematics at New York University./nGromov has won several prizes, including the Abel Prize in 2009 \"for his revolutionary contributions to geometry\"./nMikhail Gromov was born on 23 December 1943 in Boksitogorsk, Soviet Union. His father Leonid Gromov was Russian-Slavic and his mother Lea was of Jewish heritage. Both were pathologists.[1] His mother was the cousin of World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik, as well as of the mathematician Isaak Moiseevich Rabinovich.[2] Gromov was born during World War II, and his mother, who worked as a medical doctor in the Soviet Army, had to leave the front line in order to give birth to him.[3] When Gromov was nine years old,[4] his mother gave him the book The Enjoyment of Mathematics by Hans Rademacher and Otto Toeplitz, a book that piqued his curiosity and had a great influence on him.[3]/nGromov studied mathematics at Leningrad State University where he obtained a master's degree in 1965, a doctorate in 1969 and defended his postdoctoral thesis in 1973. His thesis advisor was Vladimir Rokhlin.[5]/nGromov married in 1967. In 1970, he was invited to give a presentation at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice, France. However, he was not allowed to leave the USSR. Still, his lecture was published in the conference proceedings.[6]/nDisagreeing with the Soviet system, he had been thinking of emigrating since the age of 14. In the early 1970s he ceased publication, hoping that this would help his application to move to Israel.[4][7] He changed his last name to that of his mother.[4] He received a coded letter saying that, if he could get out of the Soviet Union, he could go to Stony Brook, where a position had been arranged for him. When the request was granted in 1974, he moved directly to New York and worked at Stony Brook.[6]/nIn 1981 he left Stony Brook University to join the faculty of University of Paris VI and in 1982 he became a permanent professor at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques where he remains today. At the same time, he has held professorships at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1991 to 1996, and at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in New York since 1996.[8] He adopted French citizenship in 1992.[9]/nGromov's style of geometry often features a \"coarse\" or \"soft\" viewpoint, analyzing asymptotic or large-scale properties.[G00] He is also interested in mathematical biology,[10] the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.[6]/nMotivated by Nash and Kuiper's isometric embedding theorems and the results on immersions by Morris Hirsch and Stephen Smale,[10] Gromov introduced the h-principle in various formulations. Modeled upon the special case of the Hirsch\u2013Smale theory, he introduced and developed the general theory of microflexible sheaves, proving that they satisfy an h-principle on open manifolds.[G69] As a consequence (among other results) he was able to establish the existence of positively curved and negatively curved Riemannian metrics on any open manifold whatsoever. His result is in counterpoint to the well-known topological restrictions (such as the Cheeger\u2013Gromoll soul theorem or Cartan\u2013Hadamard theorem) on geodesically complete Riemannian manifolds of positive or negative curvature. After this initial work, he developed further h-principles partly in collaboration with Yakov Eliashberg, including work building upon Nash and Kuiper's theorem and the Nash\u2013Moser implicit function theorem. There are many applications of his results, including topological conditions for the existence of exact Lagrangian immersions and similar objects in symplectic and contact geometry.[11][12] His well-known book Partial Differential Relations collects most of his work on these problems.[G86] Later, he applied his methods to complex geometry, proving certain instances of the Oka principle on deformation of continuous maps to holomorphic maps.[G89] His work initiated a renewed study of the Oka\u2013Grauert theory, which had been introduced in the 1950s.[13][14]/nGromov and Vitali Milman gave a formulation of the concentration of measure phenomena.[GM83] They defined a \"L\u00e9vy family\" as a sequence of normalized metric measure spaces in which any asymptotically nonvanishing sequence of sets can be metrically thickened to include almost every point. This closely mimics the phenomena of the law of large numbers, and in fact the law of large numbers can be put into the framework of L\u00e9vy families. Gromov and Milman developed the basic theory of L\u00e9vy families and identified a number of examples, most importantly coming from sequences of Riemannian manifolds in which the lower bound of the Ricci curvature or the first eigenvalue of the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator diverge to infinity. They also highlighted a feature of L\u00e9vy families in which any sequence of continuous functions must be asymptotically almost constant. These considerations have been taken further by other authors, such as Michel Talagrand.[15]/nSince the seminal 1964 publication of James Eells and Joseph Sampson on harmonic maps, various rigidity phenomena had been deduced from the combination of an existence theorem for harmonic mappings together with a vanishing theorem asserting that (certain) harmonic mappings must be totally geodesic or holomorphic.[16][17][18] Gromov had the insight that the extension of this program to the setting of mappings into metric spaces would imply new results on discrete groups, following Margulis superrigidity. Richard Schoen carried out the analytical work to extend the harmonic map theory to the metric space setting; this was subsequently done more systematically by Nicholas Korevaar and Schoen, establishing extensions of most of the standard Sobolev space theory.[19] A sample application of Gromov and Schoen's methods is the fact that lattices in the isometry group of the quaternionic hyperbolic space are arithmetic.[GS92]/nIn 1978, Gromov introduced the notion of almost flat manifolds.[G78] The famous quarter-pinched sphere theorem in Riemannian geometry says that if a complete Riemannian manifold has sectional curvatures which are all sufficiently close to a given positive constant, then M must be finitely covered by a sphere. In contrast, it can be seen by scaling that every closed Riemannian manifold has Riemannian metrics whose sectional curvatures are arbitrarily close to zero. Gromov showed that if the scaling possibility is broken by only considering Riemannian manifolds of a fixed diameter, then a closed manifold admitting such a Riemannian metric, with sectional curvatures sufficiently close to zero, must be finitely covered by a nilmanifold. The proof works by replaying the proofs of the Bieberbach theorem and Margulis lemma. Gromov's proof was given a careful exposition by Peter Buser and Hermann Karcher.[20][21][22]/nIn 1979, Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau showed that the class of smooth manifolds which admit Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature is topologically rich. In particular, they showed that this class is closed under the operation of connected sum and of surgery in codimension at least three.[23] Their proof used elementary methods of partial differential equations, in particular to do with the Green's function. Gromov and Blaine Lawson gave another proof of Schoen and Yau's results, making use of elementary geometric constructions.[GL80b] They also showed how purely topological results such as Stephen Smale's h-cobordism theorem could then be applied to draw conclusions such as the fact that every closed and simply-connected smooth manifold of dimension 5, 6, or 7 has a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. They further introduced the new class of enlargeable manifolds, distinguished by a condition in homotopy theory.[GL80a] They showed that Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature cannot exist on such manifolds. A particular consequence is that the torus cannot support any Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature, which had been a major conjecture previously resolved by Schoen and Yau in low dimensions.[24]/nIn 1981, Gromov identified topological restrictions, based upon Betti numbers, on manifolds which admit Riemannian metrics of nonnegative sectional curvature.[G81a] The principle idea of his work was to combine Karsten Grove and Katsuhiro Shiohama's Morse theory for the Riemannian distance function, with control of the distance function obtained from the Toponogov comparison theorem, together with the Bishop\u2013Gromov inequality on volume of geodesic balls.[25] This resulted in topologically controlled covers of the manifold by geodesic balls, to which spectral sequence arguments could be applied to control the topology of the underlying manifold. The topology of lower bounds on sectional curvature is still not fully understood, and Gromov's work remains as a primary result. As an application of Hodge theory, Peter Li and Yau were able to apply their gradient estimates to find similar Betti number estimates which are weaker than Gromov's but allow the manifold to have convex boundary.[26]/nIn Jeff Cheeger's fundamental compactness theory for Riemannian manifolds, a key step in constructing coordinates on the limiting space is an injectivity radius estimate for closed manifolds.[27] Cheeger, Gromov, and Michael Taylor localized Cheeger's estimate, showing how to use Bishop\u2212Gromov volume comparison to control the injectivity radius in absolute terms by curvature bounds and volumes of geodesic balls.[CGT82] Their estimate has been used in a number of places where the construction of coordinates is an important problem.[28][29][30] A particularly well-known instance of this is to show that Grigori Perelman's \"noncollapsing theorem\" for Ricci flow, which controls volume, is sufficient to allow applications of Richard Hamilton's compactness theory.[31][32][33] Cheeger, Gromov, and Taylor applied their injectivity radius estimate to prove Gaussian control of the heat kernel, although these estimates were later improved by Li and Yau as an application of their gradient estimates.[26]/nGromov made foundational contributions to systolic geometry. Systolic geometry studies the relationship between size invariants (such as volume or diameter) of a manifold M and its topologically non-trivial submanifolds (such as non-contractible curves). In his 1983 paper \"Filling Riemannian manifolds\"[G83] Gromov proved that every essential manifold \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n with a Riemannian metric contains a closed non-contractible geodesic of length at most \n\n\n\nC\n(\nn\n)\nVol\n\u2061\n(\nM\n\n)\n\n1\n\n/\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C(n)\\operatorname {Vol} (M)^{1/n}}\n\n.[34]/nIn 1981, Gromov introduced the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric, which endows the set of all metric spaces with the structure of a metric space.[G81b] More generally, one can define the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces, relative to the choice of a point in each space. Although this does not give a metric on the space of all metric spaces, it is sufficient in order to define \"Gromov-Hausdorff convergence\" of a sequence of pointed metric spaces to a limit. Gromov formulated an important compactness theorem in this setting, giving a condition under which a sequence of pointed and \"proper\" metric spaces must have a subsequence which converges. This was later reformulated by Gromov and others into the more flexible notion of an ultralimit.[G93]/nGromov's compactness theorem had a deep impact on the field of geometric group theory. He applied it to understand the asymptotic geometry of the word metric of a group of polynomial growth, by taking the limit of well-chosen rescalings of the metric. By tracking the limits of isometries of the word metric, he was able to show that the limiting metric space has unexpected continuities, and in particular that its isometry group is a Lie group.[G81b] As a consequence he was able to settle the Milnor-Wolf conjecture as posed in the 1960s, which asserts that any such group is virtually nilpotent. Using ultralimits, similar asymptotic structures can be studied for more general metric spaces.[G93] Important developments on this topic were given by Bruce Kleiner, Bernhard Leeb, and Pierre Pansu, among others.[35][36]/nAnother consequence is Gromov's compactness theorem, stating that the set of compact Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature \u2265 c and diameter \u2264 D is relatively compact in the Gromov\u2013Hausdorff metric.[G81b] The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are Alexandrov spaces of curvature \u2265 c, a class of metric spaces studied in detail by Burago, Gromov and Perelman in 1992.[BGP92]/nAlong with Eliyahu Rips, Gromov introduced the notion of hyperbolic groups.[G87]/nGromov's theory of pseudoholomorphic curves is one of the foundations of the modern study of symplectic geometry.[G85] Although he was not the first to consider pseudo-holomorphic curves, he uncovered a \"bubbling\" phenomena paralleling Karen Uhlenbeck's earlier work on Yang-Mills connections, and Uhlenbeck and Jonathan Sack's work on harmonic maps.[37][38] In the time since Sacks, Uhlenbeck, and Gromov's work, such bubbling phenomena has been found in a number of other geometric contexts. The corresponding compactness theorem encoding the bubbling allowed Gromov to arrive at a number of analytically deep conclusions on existence of pseudo-holomorphic curves. A particularly famous result of Gromov's, arrived at as a consequence of the existence theory and the monotonicity formula for minimal surfaces, is the \"non-squeezing theorem,\" which provided a striking qualitative feature of symplectic geometry. Following ideas of Edward Witten, Gromov's work is also fundamental for Gromov-Witten theory, which is a widely studied topic reaching into string theory, algebraic geometry, and symplectic geometry.[39][40][41] From a different perspective, Gromov's work was also inspirational for much of Andreas Floer's work.[42]/nYakov Eliashberg and Gromov developed some of the basic theory for symplectic notions of convexity.[EG91] They introduce various specific notions of convexity, all of which are concerned with the existence of one-parameter families of diffeomorphisms which contract the symplectic form. They show that convexity is an appropriate context for an h-principle to hold for the problem of constructing certain symplectomorphisms. They also introduced analogous notions in contact geometry; the existence of convex contact structures was later studied by Emmanuel Giroux.[43]/nBooks/nMajor articles/nMedia related to Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov at Wikimedia Commons", "17902": "Leonhard Euler (/\u02c8\u0254\u026al\u0259r/ OY-l\u0259r,[b] German: [\u02c8le\u02d0\u0254nha\u0281t \u02c8\u0294\u0254\u028fl\u0250] \u24d8, Swiss Standard German: [\u02c8le\u02d0\u0254nhart \u02c8\u0254\u028fl\u0259r]; 15 April 1707\u00a0\u2013 18 September 1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, geographer, logician, and engineer who founded the studies of graph theory and topology and made pioneering and influential discoveries in many other branches of mathematics such as analytic number theory, complex analysis, and infinitesimal calculus. He introduced much of modern mathematical terminology and notation, including the notion of a mathematical function.[6] He is also known for his work in mechanics, fluid dynamics, optics, astronomy, and music theory.[7]/nEuler is held to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history and the greatest of the 18th century. Several great mathematicians who produced their work after Euler's death have recognised his importance in the field as shown by quotes attributed to many of them: Pierre-Simon Laplace expressed Euler's influence on mathematics by stating, \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\"[8][c] Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote: \"The study of Euler's works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics, and nothing else can replace it.\"[9][d] Euler is also widely considered to be the most prolific; his 866 publications as well as his correspondences are being collected in the Opera Omnia Leonhard Euler which, when completed, will consist of 81 quarto volumes.[11][12][13] He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia./nEuler is credited for popularizing the Greek letter \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n (lowercase pi) to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, as well as first using the notation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n for the value of a function, the letter \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n to express the imaginary unit \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n, the Greek letter \n\n\n\n\u03a3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Sigma }\n\n (capital sigma) to express summations, the Greek letter \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n (capital delta) for finite differences, and lowercase letters to represent the sides of a triangle while representing the angles as capital letters.[14]  He gave the current definition of the constant \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n, the base of the natural logarithm, now known as Euler's number.[15]/nEuler is also credited with being the first to develop graph theory (partly as a solution for the problem of the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg, which is also by many considered the first practical application of Topology). He also became famous for, among many other accomplishments, providing a solution to several unsolved problems in number theory and analysis, including the Basel problem, which had remained unsolved for 150 years. The Basel problem consists of finding the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the natural numbers. Euler found that this sum equals exactly \u03c02/6. Euler has also been credited for discovering that the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces minus the number of edges of a polyhedron equals 2, a number now commonly known as the Euler characteristic. In the field of physics, Euler reformulated Newton's laws of physics into new laws in his two-volume work Mechanica to better explain the motion of rigid bodies. He also made substantial contributions to the study of elastic deformations of solid objects./nLeonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in Basel to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite (n\u00e9e Brucker), whose ancestors include a number of well-known scholars in the classics.[16] He was the oldest of four children, having two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.[17][16] Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Euler family moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.[16]/nFrom a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.[16]/nIn 1720, at thirteen years of age, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel.[7] Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time.[16] The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli (who had taught Euler's father). Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:[18]/nIt was during this time that Euler, backed by Bernoulli, obtained his father's consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor.[19][20]/nIn 1723, Euler received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Isaac Newton.[16] Afterwards, he enrolled in the theological faculty of the University of Basel.[20]/nIn 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound with the title De Sono[21][22] with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the University of Basel.[23] In 1727, he entered the Paris Academy prize competition (offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 1720)[24] for the first time. The problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as \"the father of naval architecture\", won and Euler took second place.[25] Over the years, Euler entered this competition 15 times,[24] winning 12 of them.[25]/nJohann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, entered into service at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg in 1725, leaving Euler with the assurance they would recommend him to a post when one was available.[23] On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia.[26][27] When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler.[23] In November 1726, Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.[23]/nEuler arrived in Saint Petersburg in May 1727.[23][20] He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he worked in close collaboration.[28] Euler mastered Russian, settled into life in Saint Petersburg and took on an additional job as a medic in the Russian Navy.[29]/nThe academy at Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great, was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler.[25] The academy's benefactress, Catherine I, who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died before Euler's arrival to Saint Petersburg.[30] The Russian conservative nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old Peter II.[30] The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding for Euler and his colleagues and prevented the entrance of foreign and non-aristocratic students into the Gymnasium and universities.[30]/nConditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II in 1730 and the German-influenced Anna of Russia assumed power.[31] Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731.[31] He also left the Russian Navy, refusing a promotion to lieutenant.[31] Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.[32] In January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707\u20131773), a daughter of Georg Gsell.[33] Frederick II had made an attempt to recruit the services of Euler for his newly established Berlin Academy in 1740, but Euler initially preferred to stay in St Petersburg.[34] But after Emperor Anna died and Frederick II agreed to pay 1600 ecus (the same as Euler earned in Russia) he agreed to move to Berlin. In 1741, he requested permission to leave to Berlin, arguing he was in need of a milder climate for his eyesight.[34] The Russian academy gave its consent and would pay him 200 rubles per year as one of its active members.[34]/nConcerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg in June 1741 to take up a post at the Berlin Academy, which he had been offered by Frederick the Great of Prussia.[35] He lived for 25 years in Berlin, where he wrote several hundred articles.[20] In 1748 his text on functions called the Introductio in analysin infinitorum was published and in 1755 a text on differential calculus called the Institutiones calculi differentialis was published.[36][37] In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences[38] and of the French Academy of Sciences.[39] Notable students of Euler in Berlin included Stepan Rumovsky, later considered as the first Russian astronomer.[40][41] In 1748 he declined an offer from the University of Basel to succeed the recently deceased Johann Bernoulli.[20] In 1753 he bought a house in Charlottenburg, in which he lived with his family and widowed mother.[42][43]/nEuler became the tutor for Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. He wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess.[44] This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics and offered valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. It was translated into multiple languages, published across Europe and in the United States, and became more widely read than any of his mathematical works. The popularity of the Letters testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.[37]/nDespite Euler's immense contribution to the academy's prestige and having been put forward as a candidate for its presidency by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Frederick II named himself as its president.[43] The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs. He was, in many ways, the polar opposite of Voltaire, who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit.[37] Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities, stating:/nI wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in Sanssouci. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry![45]/nHowever, the disappointment was almost surely unwarranted from a technical perspective. Euler's calculations look likely to be correct, even if Euler's interactions with Frederick and those constructing his fountain may have been dysfunctional.[46]/nThroughout his stay in Berlin, Euler maintained a strong connection to the academy in St. Petersburg and also published 109 papers in Russia.[47] He also assisted students from the St. Petersburg academy and at times accommodated Russian students in his house in Berlin.[47] In 1760, with the Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was sacked by advancing Russian troops.[42] Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, with Empress Elizabeth of Russia later adding a further payment of 4000 rubles\u2014an exorbitant amount at the time.[48] Euler decided to leave Berlin in 1766 and return to Russia.[49]/nDuring his Berlin years (1741\u20131766), Euler was at the peak of his productivity. He wrote 380 works, 275 of which were published.[50] This included 125 memoirs in the Berlin Academy and over 100 memoirs sent to the St. Petersburg Academy, which had retained him as a member and paid him an annual stipend. Euler's Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum was published in two parts in 1748. In addition to his own research, Euler supervised the library, the observatory, the botanical garden, and the publication of calendars and maps from which the academy derived income.[51] He was even involved in the design of the water fountains at Sanssouci, the King's summer palace.[52]/nThe political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant\u2014a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. At the university he was assisted by his student Anders Johan Lexell.[53] While living in St. Petersburg, a fire in 1771 destroyed his home.[54]/nOn 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707\u20131773), daughter of Georg Gsell, a painter from the Academy Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg.[33] The young couple bought a house by the Neva River./nOf their thirteen children, only five survived childhood,[55] three sons and two daughters.[56] Their first son was Johann Albrecht Euler, whose godfather was Christian Goldbach.[56]/nThree years after his wife's death in 1773,[54] Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723\u20131794).[57] This marriage lasted until his death in 1783./nHis brother Johann Heinrich settled in St. Petersburg in 1735 and was employed as a painter at the academy.[34]/nEuler's eyesight worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly expiring from fever,[58] he became almost blind in his right eye. Euler blamed the cartography he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition,[59] but the cause of his blindness remains the subject of speculation.[60][61] Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as \"Cyclops\". Euler remarked on his loss of vision, stating \"Now I will have fewer distractions.\"[59] In 1766 a cataract in his left eye was discovered. Though couching of the cataract temporarily improved his vision, complications ultimately rendered him almost totally blind in  the left eye as well.[39] However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity in many areas of study increased;[62] and, in 1775, he produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week.[39]/nIn St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with Anders Johan Lexell when he collapsed and died from a brain hemorrhage.[60] Jacob von Staehlin\u00a0[de] wrote a short obituary for the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian mathematician Nicolas Fuss, one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy,[55] which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher Marquis de Condorcet, wrote:/nil cessa de calculer et de vivre\u2014 ... he ceased to calculate and to live.[63]/nEuler was buried next to Katharina at the Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery on Vasilievsky Island. In 1837, the Russian Academy of Sciences installed a new monument, replacing his overgrown grave plaque. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler's birth in 1957, his tomb was moved to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery.[64]/nEuler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, including geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as continuum physics, lunar theory, and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 quarto volumes.[39] Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics. Euler's work averages 800 pages a year from 1725 to 1783. He also wrote over 4500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts. It has been estimated that Leonard Euler was the author of a quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18th century.[14]/nEuler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a function[6] and was the first to write f(x) to denote the function f applied to the argument x. He also introduced the modern notation for the trigonometric functions, the letter e for the base of the natural logarithm (now also known as Euler's number), the Greek letter \u03a3 for summations and the letter i to denote the imaginary unit.[65] The use of the Greek letter \u03c0 to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with Welsh mathematician William Jones.[66]/nThe development of infinitesimal calculus was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the Bernoullis\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of mathematical rigour[67] (in particular his reliance on the principle of the generality of algebra), his ideas led to many great advances.\nEuler is well known in analysis for his frequent use and development of power series, the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms,[68] such as\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\nx\n\n\n=\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n0\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\nn\n!\n\n\n\n=\n\nlim\n\nn\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n1\n\n0\n!\n\n\n\n+\n\n\nx\n\n1\n!\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n\n2\n!\n\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n+\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n\nn\n!\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{x}=\\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }{x^{n} \\over n!}=\\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\left({\\frac {1}{0!}}+{\\frac {x}{1!}}+{\\frac {x^{2}}{2!}}+\\cdots +{\\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}\\right).}/nEuler's use of power series enabled him to solve the famous Basel problem in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n1\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nlim\n\nn\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n+\n\n\n1\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n=\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n2\n\n\n6\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{n=1}^{\\infty }{1 \\over n^{2}}=\\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\left({\\frac {1}{1^{2}}}+{\\frac {1}{2^{2}}}+{\\frac {1}{3^{2}}}+\\cdots +{\\frac {1}{n^{2}}}\\right)={\\frac {\\pi ^{2}}{6}}.}\n\n\nHe introduced the constant\n\n\n\n\n\u03b3\n=\n\nlim\n\nn\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n\n(\n\n1\n+\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\n+\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n+\n\u22ef\n+\n\n\n1\nn\n\n\n\u2212\nln\n\u2061\n(\nn\n)\n\n)\n\n\u2248\n0.5772\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma =\\lim _{n\\rightarrow \\infty }\\left(1+{\\frac {1}{2}}+{\\frac {1}{3}}+{\\frac {1}{4}}+\\cdots +{\\frac {1}{n}}-\\ln(n)\\right)\\approx 0.5772,}\n\n\nnow known as Euler's constant or the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant, and studied its relationship with the harmonic series, the gamma function, and values of the Riemann zeta function.[69]/nEuler introduced the use of the exponential function and logarithms in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and complex numbers, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms.[65] He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers and discovered its relation to the trigonometric functions. For any real number \u03c6 (taken to be radians), Euler's formula states that the complex exponential function satisfies\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\ni\n\u03c6\n\n\n=\ncos\n\u2061\n\u03c6\n+\ni\nsin\n\u2061\n\u03c6\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{i\\varphi }=\\cos \\varphi +i\\sin \\varphi }/nwhich was called \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by Richard P.

He invented the calculus of variations and formulated the Euler\u2013Lagrange equation for reducing optimization problems in this area to the solution of differential equations./nEuler pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions, and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the prime number theorem.[74]/nEuler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of Christian Goldbach,[75] his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy.[58] Much of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the work of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures, such as his conjecture that all numbers of the form \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n+\n1\n\n\n{\\textstyle 2^{2^{n}}+1}\n\n (Fermat numbers) are prime.[76]/nEuler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and prime numbers; this is known as the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function.[77]/nEuler invented the totient function \u03c6(n), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer n that are coprime to n. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as Euler's theorem.[78] He contributed significantly to the theory of perfect numbers, which had fascinated mathematicians since Euclid. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes (which he had earlier proved) was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the Euclid\u2013Euler theorem.[79] Euler also conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem within number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss, particularly Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.[80] By 1772 Euler had proved that 231\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 = 2,147,483,647 is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the largest known prime until 1867.[81]/nEuler also contributed major developments to the theory of partitions of an integer.[82]/nIn 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.[83] The city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.[83]/nEuler also discovered the formula \n\n\n\nV\n\u2212\nE\n+\nF\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V-E+F=2}\n\n relating the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a convex polyhedron,[84] and hence of a planar graph. The constant in this formula is now known as the Euler characteristic for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the genus of the object.[85] The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by Cauchy[86] and L'Huilier,[87] is at the origin of topology.[84]/nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the Bernoulli numbers, Fourier series, Euler numbers, the constants e and \u03c0, continued fractions, and integrals. He integrated Leibniz's differential calculus with Newton's Method of Fluxions, and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the numerical approximation of integrals, inventing what are now known as the Euler approximations. The most notable of these approximations are Euler's method[88] and the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula.[89][90][91]/nEuler helped develop the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation, which became a cornerstone of engineering.[92] Besides successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by multiple Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the Sun. His calculations contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables.[93]/nEuler made important contributions in optics.[94] He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of light,[95] which was the prevailing theory of the time. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.[96]/nIn fluid dynamics, Euler was the first to predict the phenomenon of cavitation, in 1754, long before its first observation in the late 19th century, and the Euler number used in fluid flow calculations comes from his related work on the efficiency of turbines.[97] In 1757 he published an important set of equations for inviscid flow in fluid dynamics, that are now known as the Euler equations.[98]/nEuler is well known in structural engineering for his formula giving Euler's critical load, the critical buckling load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness.[99]/nEuler is credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as Euler diagrams.[100]/nAn Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets. Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or \"zones\": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset, and disjointness). Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it./nEuler diagrams (and their refinement to Venn diagrams) were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s.[101] Since then, they have come into wide use as a way of visualizing combinations of characteristics.[102]/nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae (Attempt at a New Theory of Music), hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.[103] Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical,[104] for instance, his introduction of binary logarithms as a way of numerically describing the subdivision of octaves into fractional parts.[105] His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that remained with him throughout his life.[104]/nA first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of \"genres\", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the \"exponent\" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where \"m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible\"[106]), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C\u2013G\u2013C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C\u2013E\u2013C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C\u2013F\u2013B\u266d\u2013C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013B\u2013C); etc. Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the \"diatonico-chromatic\", \"used generally in all compositions\",[107] and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.[108] Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.[109]/nEuler devised a specific graph, the Speculum musicum,[110][111] to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg (see above). The device drew renewed interest as the Tonnetz in Neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).[112]/nEuler further used the principle of the \"exponent\" to propose a derivation of the gradus suavitatis (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors \u2013 one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e. 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only.[113] Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers, e.g. in the form\n\n\n\n\nd\ns\n=\n\n\u2211\n\ni\n\n\n(\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n\np\n\ni\n\n\n\u2212\n\nk\n\ni\n\n\n)\n+\n1\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ds=\\sum _{i}(k_{i}p_{i}-k_{i})+1,}\n\n\nwhere pi are prime numbers and ki their exponents.[114]/nEuler was a religious person throughout his life.[20] Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der G\u00f6ttlichen Offenbahrung gegen die Einw\u00fcrfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.[115][116]/nEuler opposed the concepts of Leibniz's monadism and the philosophy of Christian Wolff.[117] Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler also labelled Wolff's ideas as \"heathen and atheistic\".[118]/nThere is a famous legend[119] inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher Denis Diderot was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the existence of God: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this non-sequitur: \"Sir, \n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n+\n\nb\n\nn\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n=\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {a+b^{n}}{n}}=x}\n\n, hence God exists\u2014reply!\"\nDiderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court. Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is apocryphal, given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.[120]\nThe legend was apparently first told by Dieudonn\u00e9 Thi\u00e9bault with embellishment by Augustus De Morgan.[119]/nEuler was featured on both the sixth[121] and seventh[122] series of the Swiss 10-franc banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[123] The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honour.[124]/nEuler has an extensive bibliography. His books include:/nIt took until 1830 for the bulk of Euler's posthumous works to be individually published,[131] with an additional batch of 61 unpublished works discovered by Paul Heinrich von Fuss (Euler's great-grandson and Nicolas Fuss's son) and published as a collection in 1862.[131][132] A chronological catalog of Euler's works was compiled by Swedish mathematician Gustaf Enestr\u00f6m and published from 1910 to 1913.[133] The catalog, known as the Enestr\u00f6m index, numbers Euler's works from E1 to E866.[134] The Euler Archive was started at Dartmouth College[135] before moving to the Mathematical Association of America[136] and, most recently, to University of the Pacific in 2017.[137]/nIn 1907, the Swiss Academy of Sciences created the Euler Commission and charged it with the publication of Euler's complete works. After several delays in the 19th century,[131] the first volume of the Opera Omnia, was published in 1911.[138] However, the discovery of new manuscripts continued to increase the magnitude of this project. Fortunately, the publication of Euler's Opera Omnia has made steady progress, with over 70 volumes (averaging 426 pages each) published by 2006 and 80 volumes published by 2022.[139][12][14] These volumes are organized into four series. The first series compiles the works on analysis, algebra, and number theory; it consists of 29 volumes and numbers over 14,000 pages. The 31 volumes of Series II, amounting to 10,660 pages, contain the works on mechanics, astronomy, and engineering. Series III contains 12 volumes on physics. Series IV, which contains the massive amount of Euler's correspondences, unpublished manuscripts, and notes only began compilation in 1967. The series is projected to span 16 volumes, eight volumes of which have been released as of 2022[update].[12][138][14]", "57492975": "Hugo Duminil-Copin (born 26 August 1985) is a French mathematician specializing in probability theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2022./nThe son of a middle school sports teacher and a former female dancer who became a primary school teacher, Duminil-Copin grew up in the outer suburbs of Paris, where he played a lot of sports as a child, and initially considered attending a sports-oriented high school to pursue his interest in handball.[1] He decided to attend a school focused on mathematics and science,[1] and enrolled at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, then at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris) and the University Paris-Sud. He decided to focus on math instead of physics, because he found the rigour of mathematical proof more satisfying, but developed an interest in percolation theory, which is used in mathematical physics to address issues in statistical mechanics.[1] In 2008, he moved to the University of Geneva to write a PhD thesis under Stanislav Smirnov. Duminil-Copin and Smirnov used percolation theory and the vertices and edges connecting them in a lattice to model fluid flow and with it phase transitions. The pair investigated the number of self-avoiding walks that were possible in hexagonal lattices, connecting combinatorics to percolation theory. This was published in the Annals of Mathematics in 2012, the same year in which Duminil-Copil was awarded his PhD at the age of 27.[1]/nIn 2013, after his postdoctorate, Duminil-Copin was appointed assistant professor, then full professor in 2014 at the University of Geneva.[2] In 2016, he became permanent professor at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques.[3] Since 2019, he has been member of the Academia Europaea.[4]/nSince 2017, Duminil-Copin has been the principal investigator of the European Research Council \u2013 Starting Grant \u201cCritical behavior of lattice models (CriBLam)\u201d. He is a member of the Laboratory Alexander Grothendieck, a CNRS joint research unit with IHES.[2]/nDuminil-Copin's work focuses on the mathematical area of statistical physics. Duminil-Copin uses ideas from probability theory to study the critical behavior of various models on networks.[2] His work focuses on identifying the critical point at which phase transitions occur, what happens at the critical point, and the behaviour of the system just above and below the critical point.[1] He has been working on dependent percolation models whereby the state of an edge in one part of a lattice will affect the state of edges elsewhere, to shed light of Ising models, which are used to study phase transitions in ferromagnetic materials. In collaboration with Vincent Beffara in 2011, he was able to produce a formula for a determining the critical point for many two-dimensional dependent percolation models.[1] In 2019, along with Vincent Tassion and Aran Raoufi, he published research on the size of connected components in the lattice when the system is just below and above the critical point. They showed that below the critical point, the probability of having two vertices in the same connected component of the lattice would decay exponentially with separation distance, and that a similar result applies above the critical point, and that there is an infinite connected component above the critical point. Duminil-Copin and his associates proved this characteristic, which they called \"sharpness\", using mathematical analysis and computer science.[1] He has also shed more light on the nature of the phase transition at the critical point itself, and whether the transition will be continuous or discontinuous, under various circumstances, with a focus on Potts models.[1]/nDuminil-Copin is researching conformal invariance in dependent percolation models in two dimensions. He said that by proving the existence of these symmetries, a great deal of information about the models would be extracted.[1] In 2020, he and his collaborators proved that rotational invariance exists at the boundary between phases in many physical systems.[5][6]/nDuminil-Copin was awarded the 2017 New Horizons in Mathematics Prize for his work on Ising type models.[7]/nDuminil-Copin was awarded the Fields Medal in 2022 for \"solving longstanding problems in the probabilistic theory of phase transitions in statistical physics, especially in dimensions three and four\".[8][9] Wendelin Werner credited Duminil-Copin with generalising the field of percolation theory, saying that \"Everything is easier, streamlined. The results are stronger. \u2026 The whole understanding of these physical phenomena has been transformed.\"[1] Werner said that Duminil-Copin has solved \"Basically half of the main open questions\" in percolation theory.[1]/nDuminil-Copin's hobbies include sports, which he has stated helps him find inspiration when working.[1] He is married and has a daughter.[10]", "63030774": "Flora Munro Sadler (n\u00e9e McBain; 4 June 1912 - 25 December 2000) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer.

In 1202, he completed the Liber Abaci (Book of Abacus or The Book of Calculation),[19] which popularized Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals in Europe.[6]/nFibonacci was a guest of Emperor Frederick II, who enjoyed mathematics and science. A member of Frederick II's court, John of Palermo, posed several questions based on Arab mathematical works for Fibonacci to solve. In 1240, the Republic of Pisa honored Fibonacci (referred to as Leonardo Bigollo)[20] by granting him a salary in a decree that recognized him for the services that he had given to the city as an advisor on matters of accounting and instruction to citizens.[21][22]/nFibonacci is thought to have died between 1240[23] and 1250,[24] in Pisa./nIn the Liber Abaci (1202), Fibonacci introduced the so-called modus Indorum (method of the Indians), today known as the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system,[25][26] with ten digits including a zero and positional notation. The book showed the practical use and value of this by applying the numerals to commercial bookkeeping, converting weights and measures, calculation of interest, money-changing, and other applications. The book was well-received throughout educated Europe and had a profound impact on European thought. Replacing Roman numerals, its ancient Egyptian multiplication method, and using an abacus for calculations, was an advance in making business calculations easier and faster, which assisted the growth of banking and accounting in Europe.[27][28]/nThe original 1202 manuscript is not known to exist.[29] In a 1228 copy of the manuscript, the first section introduces the numeral system and compares it with others, such as Roman numerals, and methods to convert numbers to it. The second section explains uses in business, for example converting different currencies, and calculating profit and interest, which were important to the growing banking industry. The book also discusses irrational numbers and prime numbers.[29][27][28]/nLiber Abaci posed and solved a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. The solution, generation by generation, was a sequence of numbers later known as Fibonacci numbers. Although Fibonacci's Liber Abaci contains the earliest known description of the sequence outside of India, the sequence had been described by Indian mathematicians as early as the sixth century.[30][31][32][33]/nIn the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci omitted the \"0\" and first \"1\" included today and began the sequence with 1, 2, 3, ... . He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place, the value 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place, the value 377.[34][35] Fibonacci did not speak about the golden ratio as the limit of the ratio of consecutive numbers in this sequence./nIn the 19th century, a statue of Fibonacci was set in Pisa. Today it is located in the western gallery of the Camposanto, historical cemetery on the Piazza dei Miracoli.[1][36]/nThere are many mathematical concepts named after Fibonacci  because of a connection to the Fibonacci numbers.

However, he only postulated their existence as part of his spermist theory of conception and never claimed to have seen them.[4] The 1694 \"Essay on dioptrics\", in which this hypothesis appears[citation needed], was a highly lauded book, in fact tackling several misconceptions of the time. For example, Hartsoeker disavows the contemporary position (e.g. of Robert Hooke) that with refractor telescopes one soon would be able to see man-sized creatures on the moon, if any in fact existed.[2]/nAt the end of the century, Hartsoeker had become quite famous. In 1699 he was elected member of the French Academy of Sciences and in 1704 of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, in both cases as one of the first foreign members.  Czar Peter met him in Amsterdam and offered him the chair of mathematics in St Petersburg. Hartsoeker did not accept, but the czar did finance an observatory for him in Amsterdam. Later, in 1704, Hartsoeker accepted the offer of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine to become \"first mathematician and honorary professor of philosophy\" at the University of Heidelberg. The last years of his life were spent in Utrecht.[2]/nDigitized works by Nicolaas Hartsoeker from the Linda Hall Library", "771690": "Adolf Hurwitz (German: [\u02c8a\u02d0d\u0254lf \u02c8h\u028a\u0281v\u026ats]; 26 March 1859 \u2013 18 November 1919) was a German mathematician who worked on algebra, analysis, geometry and number theory./nHe was born in Hildesheim, then part of the Kingdom of Hanover, to a Jewish family and died in Z\u00fcrich, in Switzerland. His father Salomon Hurwitz, a merchant, was not wealthy.  Hurwitz's mother, Elise Wertheimer, died when he was three years old.[1] Family records indicate that he had siblings and cousins, but their names have yet to be confirmed except for an older brother, Julius, with whom he developed an arithmetical theory for complex continued fractions circa 1890.[2] Hurwitz entered the Realgymnasium Andreanum\u00a0[de] in Hildesheim in 1868. He was taught mathematics there by Hermann Schubert.[3] Schubert persuaded Hurwitz's father to allow him to attend university, and arranged for Hurwitz to study with Felix Klein at Munich.[3] Salomon Hurwitz could not afford to send his son to university, but his friend, Mr. Edwards, assisted financially./nHurwitz entered the University of Munich in 1877, aged 18. He spent one year there attending lectures by Klein, before spending the academic year 1877\u20131878 at the University of Berlin where he attended classes by Kummer, Weierstrass and Kronecker,[1] after which he returned to Munich./nIn October 1880, Felix Klein moved to the University of Leipzig. Hurwitz followed him there, and became a doctoral student under Klein's direction, finishing a dissertation on elliptic modular functions in 1881.  Following two years at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in 1884 he was invited to become an Extraordinary Professor at the Albertus Universit\u00e4t in K\u00f6nigsberg; there he encountered the young David Hilbert and Hermann Minkowski, on whom he had a major influence. Following the departure of Frobenius, Hurwitz took a chair at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum Z\u00fcrich (today the ETH Z\u00fcrich) in 1892 (having to turn down a position at G\u00f6ttingen shortly after [1]), and remained there for the rest of his life./nThroughout his time in Z\u00fcrich, Hurwitz was in continual ill health, which had been originally caused when he contracted typhoid whilst a student in Munich. He had severe migraines, and then in 1905, his kidneys became diseased and he had one removed./nHe was one of the early students of the Riemann surface theory, and used it to prove many of the foundational results on algebraic curves; for instance Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem. This work anticipates a number of later theories, such as the general theory of algebraic correspondences, Hecke operators, and Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. He also had deep interests in number theory. He studied the maximal order theory (as it now would be) for the quaternions, defining the Hurwitz quaternions that are now named for him. In the field of control systems and dynamical systems theory he derived the Routh\u2013Hurwitz stability criterion for determining whether a linear system is stable in 1895, independently of Edward John Routh who had derived it earlier by a different method.[4]\nIn Lie theory, Hurwitz proved the existence of the Haar measure on Lie groups (which Haar then extended to locally compact groups).[5]/nIn 1884, whilst at K\u00f6nigsberg, Hurwitz met and married Ida Samuel, the daughter of a professor in the faculty of medicine. They had three children.", "18031": "Leon Battista Alberti (Italian: [le\u02c8om bat\u02c8tista al\u02c8b\u025brti]; 14 February 1404 \u2013 25 April 1472) was an Italian Renaissance humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher, and cryptographer; he epitomised the nature of those identified now as polymaths. He is considered the founder of Western cryptography, a claim he shares with Johannes Trithemius.[1][2]/nHe is often considered primarily an architect. However,  as James Beck has observed,[3] \"to single out one of Leon Battista's 'fields' over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti's extensive explorations in the fine arts\". Although Alberti is known mostly as an artist, he was also a mathematician: he made significant contributions to this field.[4]  Among the  most famous buildings he designed are the churches of San Sebastiano (1460) and Sant'Andrea (1472), both in Mantua.[5]/nAlberti's life was told in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects./nLeon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa. His mother was Bianca Fieschi. His father, Benedetto Alberti, was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, but allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied law at Bologna.[6][7] He lived for a time in Florence, then in 1431 travelled to Rome, where he took holy orders and entered the service of the papal court.[8] During this time he studied the ancient ruins, which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.[8]/nLeon Battista Alberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong, and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a person's head.[9] He distinguished himself as a writer while still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play that was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature.[7] In 1435 he began his first major written work, Della pittura, which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early fifteenth century. In this work he analysed the nature of painting and explored the elements of perspective, composition, and colour.[8]/nIn 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d'Este of Ferrara, for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello's father.[7] In 1447 Alberti became architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved in several projects at the Vatican.[7]/nHis first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the fa\u00e7ade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel, the Tempio Malatestiano.[8] In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the fa\u00e7ade for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years.[10] In 1452, he completed  De re aedificatoria, a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of Vitruvius and influenced by the ancient roman buildings. The work was not published until 1485. It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, De statua, in which he examines sculpture.[8] Alberti's only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to Pisanello./nAlberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua, San Sebastiano, which was never completed and for which Alberti's intention can only be speculated upon, and the Basilica of Sant'Andrea. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti's death: the construction was completed after his death and is considered as his most significant work.[10]/nAs an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the contemporary ordinary craftsmen educated in workshops. He was a humanist who studied Aristotle and Plotinus. He was among the rapidly growing group of intellectuals and artists whom at that time were supported by the courts of nobility.  As a member of noble family and as part of the Roman curia, Alberti enjoyed special status. He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara, and spent time  with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro in Urbino. The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander, who generously funded artists. Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to him.[9]/nAmong Alberti's minor but pioneering studies, were an essay on cryptography, De componendis cifris, and the first Italian grammar. He collaborated with the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli in astronomy, a science close  to geography at that time. He also wrote a small Latin work on geography, Descriptio urbis Romae (The Panorama of the City of Rome). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed De iciarchia (On Ruling the Household), a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule./nAlberti took holy orders and  never married. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, about whom he wrote a panegyric (Canis).[9] Vasari describes Alberti as \"an admirable citizen, a man of culture... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.\"[11] Alberti died in Rome on 25 April 1472 at the age of 66./nAlberti considered mathematics as the foundation  of arts and sciences. \"To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting,\" Alberti began his treatise, Della Pittura (On Painting) dedicated to Brunelleschi, \"I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.\"[12]/nDella pittura (also known in Latin as De Pictura) relied on the study classical optics to approach the  perspective in artistic and architectural representations.  Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of optics was connected to the tradition of the Kitab al-manazir (The Optics; De aspectibus) of the Arab polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, d. c.\u20091041), which was transmitted by Franciscan optical workshops of the thirteenth-century Perspectivae traditions of scholars such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Witelo (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of Lorenzo Ghiberti, Commentario terzo).[13]/nIn both Della pittura and De statua, Alberti stressed that \"all steps of learning should be sought from nature\".[14] The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive \"through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature\".[14] However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, \"for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary\".[14] The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or to add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti \"the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,\" and subsequently \"this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony\". Alberti's thoughts on harmony were not new\u2014they could be traced back to Pythagoras\u2014but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse./nIn Rome, Alberti spent considerable time studying its ancient sites, ruins, and arts. His detailed observations, included in his De re aedificatoria (1452, On the Art of Building),[15] were inspired by the essay De architectura written by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (fl. 46\u201330 BC). Alberti's work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, from engineering to the aesthetics. De re aedificatoria, a large and expensive book, was not published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects.[16] However, the book was written \"not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts\", as Alberti put it.[15] Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by Cosimo Bartoli was published in 1550. Pope Nicholas V, to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars, and others./nAlberti wrote I Libri della famiglia\u2014which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money\u2014in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like Erasmus decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that \"the care of very young children is women's work, for nurses or the mother\", and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet.[14] With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that \"he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author's futile enterprise along it\".[14] Momus, written between 1443 and 1450, was a notable comedy about the Olympian deities. It has been considered as a roman \u00e0 clef\u2014Jupiter has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from Lucian, one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, Momus, the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other deities come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm./nAlberti did not concern himself with engineering, and very few of his major projects were built . As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman architecture, he studied column and lintel based architecture, from a visual rather than structural viewpoint. He correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who used the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Alberti reflected on the social effects of architecture, and was attentive to the urban landscape.[10] This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement. Alberti anticipated the principle of street hierarchy, with wide main streets connected to secondary streets, and buildings of equal height.[17]/nIn Rome he was employed by Pope Nicholas V for the restoration of the Roman aqueduct of Acqua Vergine, which debouched into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was later replaced by the Baroque Trevi Fountain./nSome researchers[18]  suggested that the Villa Medici in Fiesole might have been designed by Alberti, rather than by  Michelozzo. This hilltop residence commissioned by Giovanni de' Medici, Cosimo il Vecchio's second son, with its view over the city, is sometimes considered the first example of a Renaissance villa:  it reflects the writing by Alberti about country residential buildings as \"villa suburbana\". The building later inspired numerous other similar projects buildings from the end of the fifteenth century./nThe Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (1447, 1453\u201360)[19] is the rebuilding of a Gothic church. The fa\u00e7ade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.[10]/nThe design of the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo Rucellai (1446\u201351) was one of several commissioned by  the Rucellai family.[19] The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in classical style onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has Corinthian columns. The palace introduced set the use of classical building elements in civic buildings in Florence, and became very influential. The work was executed by Bernardo Rosselino.[10]/nAt Santa Maria Novella, Florence, between (1448\u201370)[19] the upper fa\u00e7ade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six Gothic niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches, such as San Miniato al Monte and the Baptistery of Florence. The design also incorporates an ocular window that was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire fa\u00e7ade in a manner that includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices, and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of church fa\u00e7ades in the later Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical Revival buildings.[10]/nAlberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, Pienza. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459.[19] It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius II, in whose employ Alberti served. Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat, but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position./nThe piazza is a trapezoid shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, Palazzo Piccolomini, is on the western side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti's Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by loggia on all three floors that overlook an enclosed Italian Renaissance garden with Giardino all'italiana era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the Val d'Orcia and Pope Pius's beloved Mount Amiata beyond. Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for a hundred horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall, and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning./nThe Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua was begun in 1471,[19] the year before Alberti's death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the triumphal arch motif, both for its fa\u00e7ade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow.[10] Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike Brunelleschi, he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.[10]/nGiorgio Vasari, who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in Michelangelo, emphasized Alberti's scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: \"He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.\"[11] In On Painting, Alberti uses the expression \"We Painters\", but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. \"In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty\", wrote Vasari.[11] \"The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.\" Jacob Burckhardt portrayed Alberti in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy as a truly universal genius. \"And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari's work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo's nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.\"[9]/nAlberti is said to appear in Mantegna's great frescoes in the Camera degli Sposi, as the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of Ludovico Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua.[20] In Alberti's self-portrait, a large plaquette, he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, Quid tum? (what then), taken from Virgil's Eclogues: \"So what, if Amyntas is dark? (quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?) Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.\"[21]/nAlberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:/n[1] Magda Saura, \"Building codes in the architectural treatise De re aedificatoria,\"/n[2] Third International Congress on Construction History, Cottbus, May 2009./n[3] hdl:2117/14252/nLA) Leon Battista Alberti, De re aedificatoria, Argentorati, excudebat M.

The well-known efficacy of Monte Carlo methods might have led one to think otherwise, but the result was negative. Stated precisely:/nMoreover, the result continues to hold if the output probability is any positive number, and the probability of an oracle machine inquiry yielding 1 is any computable real number.[1]/nShapiro obtained his Ph.D from Princeton University in 1955 under the advisership of Alonzo Church. In 1955, as a Princeton PhD student, Shapiro coined the phrase \"strong reducibility\" for a computability theory currently called the many-one reduction. His thesis was titled Degrees of Computability[2] and was published in 1958./nShapiro was a leading mathematician and computer scientist at the RAND Corporation think tank from 1959 until 1999. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Shapiro was the lead designer of one of the first computer-based mapping and cartography systems./nIn the 1970s Shapiro co-designed the MH Message Handling System.[3] MH was the first mail system to utilize Unix design principles by using shell commands to manipulate messages as individual files./nIn 1972, Norman Z. Shapiro was a creative lead in his essays on e-mail etiquette, introducing concepts that were rarely considered until over 15 years later. His work may be the first substantial writing about netiquette. The primary essay was \"Toward an Ethics and Etiquette for Electronic Mail\".[4]/nIn the 1970s through 1990s Shapiro developed many new and unique contributions to computer science, mathematics, and modeling. In the early 1980s, he was the software architect for large and complex game-structured simulation (the RAND Strategy Assessment System) at the RAND Corporation.  That represented regional or global crisis and war with agents optionally substituting for human teams in making high-level decisions. These decisions then directed actions represented in a large global combat model.  Different versions of the agents could be substituted (e.g., to reflect a change in government).  Agents could run the simulation within itself to test potential strategies with \"lookahead.\" The system was successfully implemented [5] and was used in the late 1980s before the end of the Cold War.  As part of the subsequent development, Shapiro  co-invented (with H. Edward Hall) a new programming language called Abel (later called RAND-ABEL). This was not the first A.I. style simulation language to look and read like English, but it was clearer and more readable by non-programmers than its predecessors. The main innovation of ABEL was the execution as code of tables that read to the human like any normal table one would find in a magazine article or essay. The ABEL compiler uses these \"English\" tables in multiple ways: as data values, as a decision tree, or as a complex conditional and value setting function. This was the first time natural language tables have been machine-executed in this manner./nShapiro wrote extensively on databases and privacy, the effects of automation on the court system, the future of automation, and on topics in mathematics, chemistry, and biology.

Bayes never published what would become his most famous accomplishment; his notes were edited and published posthumously by Richard Price.[4]/nThomas Bayes was the son of London Presbyterian minister Joshua Bayes,[5] and was possibly born in Hertfordshire.[6] He came from a prominent nonconformist family from Sheffield. In 1719, he enrolled at the University of Edinburgh to study logic and theology. On his return around 1722, he assisted his father at the latter's chapel in London before moving to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, around 1734. There he was minister of the Mount Sion Chapel, until 1752.[7]/nHe is known to have published two works in his lifetime, one theological and one mathematical:/nBayes was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1742. His nomination letter was signed by Philip Stanhope, Martin Folkes, James Burrow, Cromwell Mortimer, and John Eames. It is speculated that he was accepted by the society on the strength of the Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, as he is not known to have published any other mathematical work during his lifetime.[8]/nIn his later years he took a deep interest in probability. Historian Stephen Stigler thinks that Bayes became interested in the subject while reviewing a work written in 1755 by Thomas Simpson,[9] but George Alfred Barnard thinks he learned mathematics and probability from a book by Abraham de Moivre.[10] Others speculate he was motivated to rebut David Hume's argument against believing in miracles on the evidence of testimony in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.[11]  His work and findings on probability theory were passed in manuscript form to his friend Richard Price after his death./nBy 1755, he was ill, and by 1761, he had died in Tunbridge Wells. He was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground in Moorgate, London, where many nonconformists lie./nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh opened a \u00a345 million research centre connected to its informatics department named after its alumnus, Bayes.[12]/nIn April 2021, it was announced that Cass Business School, whose City of London campus is on Bunhill Row, was to be renamed after Bayes.[12]/nBayes's solution to a problem of inverse probability was presented in An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances, which was read to the Royal Society in 1763 after Bayes's death. Richard Price shepherded the work through this presentation and its publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London the following year.[13] This was an argument for using a uniform prior distribution for a binomial parameter and not merely a general postulate.[14] This essay gives the following theorem (stated here in present-day terminology)./nSuppose a quantity R is uniformly distributed between 0 and\u00a01. Suppose each of X1,\u00a0...,\u00a0Xn is equal to either 1 or 0 and the conditional probability that any of them is equal to\u00a01, given the value of R, is\u00a0R. Suppose they are conditionally independent given the value of\u00a0R. Then the conditional probability distribution of\u00a0R, given the values of X1,\u00a0...,\u00a0Xn, is/nThus, for example,/nThis is a special case of Bayes' theorem./nIn the first decades of the eighteenth century, many problems concerning the probability of certain events, given specified conditions, were solved. For example: given a specified number of white and black balls in an urn, what is the probability of drawing a black ball? Or the converse: given that one or more balls has been drawn, what can be said about the number of white and black balls in the urn? These are sometimes called \"inverse probability\" problems./nBayes's Essay contains his solution to a similar problem posed by Abraham de Moivre, author of The Doctrine of Chances (1718)./nIn addition, a paper by Bayes on asymptotic series was published posthumously./nBayesian probability is the name given to several related interpretations of probability as an amount of epistemic confidence \u2013 the strength of beliefs, hypotheses etc.  \u2013 rather than a frequency.  This allows the application of probability to all sorts of propositions rather than just ones that come with a reference class. \"Bayesian\" has been used in this sense since about 1950. Since its rebirth in the 1950s, advancements in computing technology have allowed scientists from many disciplines to pair traditional Bayesian statistics with random walk techniques.  The use of the Bayes theorem has been extended in science and in other fields.[15]/nBayes himself might not have embraced the broad interpretation now called Bayesian, which was in fact pioneered and popularised by Pierre-Simon Laplace;[16] it is difficult to assess Bayes's philosophical views on probability, since his essay does not go into questions of interpretation. There, Bayes defines probability of an event as \"the ratio between the value at which an expectation depending on the happening of the event ought to be computed, and the value of the thing expected upon its happening\" (Definition 5). In modern utility theory, the same definition would result by rearranging the definition of expected utility (the probability of an event times the payoff received in case of that event \u2013 including the special cases of buying risk for small amounts or buying security for big amounts) to solve for the probability. As Stigler points out,[9] this is a subjective definition, and does not require repeated events; however, it does require that the event in question be observable, for otherwise it could never be said to have \"happened\". Stigler argues that Bayes intended his results in a more limited way than modern Bayesians. Given Bayes's definition of probability, his result concerning the parameter of a binomial distribution makes sense only to the extent that one can bet on its observable consequences./nThe philosophy of Bayesian statistics is at the core of almost every modern estimation approach that includes conditioned probabilities, such as sequential estimation, probabilistic machine learning techniques, risk assessment, simultaneous localization and mapping, regularization or information theory. The rigorous axiomatic framework for probability theory as a whole, however, was developed 200 years later during the early and middle 20th century, starting with insightful results in ergodic theory by Plancherel in 1913.[citation needed]", "34227839": "Daniel Lazard (born December 10, 1941) is a French mathematician and computer scientist.

She was her parents' second child. Her father was a lawyer and her mother devoted her time to charitable work. She was a sensitive person and later on played an important part in the Anthroposophical life in the Netherlands./nElisabeth Vreede came into contact with Theosophy in her home growing up. She was interested early on in the starry sky, read the works of Camille Flammarion and learned French at the same time. She first went to school at the age of seven. She completed her years in primary and higher schools and afterwards took private studies for two years, so as to gain qualifications for university entrance./nAt the University of Leyden she studied mathematics, astronomy, philosophy (especially Hegel) and Sanskrit. She was also actively involved in student life, founding a boatclub, and was a council member of the students' union./nHer first meeting with Rudolf Steiner took place at the Theosophical Congress in London in 1903. Her parents were theosophists and she, too, was a member of the Theosophical Society. At the congress Rudolf Steiner straightaway made a great impression on her. A year later she heard Steiner's lecture on 'Mathematics and Occultism' given at the Congress of the Federation of European Sections of the Theosophical Society at Amsterdam in 1904.[1] The next European Congress was in 1906 when Steiner held a cycle of 18 lectures there./nAfter receiving her diploma in 1906, she gave instruction in mathematics at a higher girls school until 1910. From 1910, she lived in Berlin, working on her dissertation and occasionally working as a secretary for Rudolf Steiner. In April 1914 she moved to Dornach to help in the work for the first Goetheanum, where she would often be found carving the wood required for the building./nM. P. van Deventer[2] who would become Vreede's biographer first met her in the summer of 1915. She was living with her parents in a small house in Neu-Reinach. From an  elevated position there was a beautiful view over the building and over the chain of the Canton of Jura, with the Gempen.[3]/nDuring the War years 1916/17 Elisabeth Vreede broke off from her residence in Dornach to work in Berlin as a coworker of Elisabeth Rotten, caring for prisoners of war./nAfter the War, Rudolf Steiner developed his idea of the threefold social order. Vreede had an intense interest in this initiative and work and she was the first to bring this idea to England. Around 1918 she began to construct the library and archive at the Goetheanum, using her own means to purchase the expensive lecture transcripts as soon as they were typed from the stenogram. Occasionally friends contributed to her efforts to build an archive./nIn 1920 Vreede moved to Arlesheim where she had built a small house of her own. It was the second dwelling-house for which Rudolf Steiner himself had given the model in 1919.[4] There, in Arlesheim, Ita Wegman founded the first anthroposophical medical clinic in 1921./nIn December 1923 Vreede was appointed as leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum.[5] She belonged to the board of directors (Vorstand) of the General Anthroposophical Society from December 1923 to 1935. In 1924 she attended the Agriculture Course of Rudolf Steiner at Koberwitz which laid the foundations for the development of biodynamic agriculture.[6] Between September 1927 and August 1930, in her capacity as leader of the Mathematical-Astronomical Section,[7] she wrote a monthly letter, then available by subscription, about both modern astronomy and classical astrology in the light of spiritual science. The letters included explanations of the fundamentals of astronomy and discussions of astrology in the modern world, with reference to such topics as nutation, precession of the equinoxes, comets, solar eclipses and lunar eclipses and the meaning of the Christian holidays such as Easter and Whitsun.[8] The Letters in English translation were published in 2007 with the title Astronomy and Spiritual Science.[9]/nOn 9 and 11 July 1930 she held two lectures in Stuttgart with the title The Bodhisattva Question in the History of the Anthroposophical Society, published in English translation in 1993.[10]/nWhen the separation within the Anthroposophical Society took place in 1935 Vreede was expelled from the Vorstand and her Section passed into other hands. This resulted after internal discussions in the Anthroposophical Society. On her exclusion from the Vorstand along with Ita Wegman, Vreede was cut off from the observatory and archives that she herself helped assemble./nThe last years of her life became more lonely. She was cut off from her friends abroad by the War. The death of Ita Wegman at the beginning of March, 1943, was a great shock for her. At the internal commemoration in the clinic she spoke words at her eulogy. It was the first time she faced her former colleagues on the Vorstand./nOn the anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's death (30 March) she spoke to the circle of friends and co-workers in Ita Wegman's clinic at Arlesheim. They wanted to commemorate not just Rudolf Steiner but also the many who had been leading Anthroposophists but who to most were no longer known. She spoke in a devoted way of Edith Maryon, and with a fine characterization of her being about Alice Sauerwein.[11] She portrayed Count Keyserlingk[12] and Louis Werbeck.[13] Finally she told about Caroline von Heydebrand[14] and Eugen Kolisko./nAt the beginning of May she spoke once more on the 400th anniversary of the death of Copernicus. At the lecture it was noticed that only by exceptional exertion could she keep herself upright. A few days later, on 6 May, she had to take her bed.

Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration,[3][4] making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture./nLeonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance.[3] Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works\u00a0\u2013  including numerous unfinished works\u00a0\u2013  he created some of the most influential paintings in Western art.[3] His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa, is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo,[5] was sold at auction for US$450.3\u00a0million, setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction./nRevered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualized flying machines, a type of armored fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine,[6][7] and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.[8]/nLeonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (\"Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci\"),[9][10][c] was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence.[11][12][d] He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d'Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426\u20131504),[16] a Florentine legal notary,[11] and Caterina di Meo Lippi (c.\u20091434\u20131494), from the lower class.[17][18][e] It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti,[21] is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had.[22][a] Leonardo's parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina\u00a0\u2013  who later appears in Leonardo's notes as only \"Caterina\" or \"Catelina\"\u00a0\u2013  is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed L'Accattabriga, 'the quarrelsome one'.[17][21] Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori\u00a0\u2013   having been betrothed to her the previous year\u00a0\u2013   and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages.[21][23][f] From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy)[24] who were much younger than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old)[24] and with whom he had very little contact.[g]/nVery little is known about Leonardo's childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his biography in the frequently apocryphal Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1550) by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari.[27][28] Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci,[11] but it is possible that he spent the years before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone.[29][30] He is thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci,[3] but his father was probably in Florence most of the time.[11] Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in Florence by at least 1469 and had a successful career.[11] Despite his family history, Leonardo only received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading, and mathematics; possibly because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention there.[11]/nLater in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus.[31] While writing on the flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail; commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.[32]/nIn the mid-1460s, Leonardo's family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture.[33] Around the age of 14,[25] he became a garzone (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time.[33] This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio's master, the great sculptor Donatello.[h] Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years.[35] Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi.[36][37] Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills,[38] including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.[39][i]/nLeonardo was a contemporary of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino, who were all slightly older than he was.[40] He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio or at the Platonic Academy of the Medici.[36] Florence was ornamented by the works of artists such as Donatello's contemporaries Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective,[41] and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Leon Battista Alberti's treatise De pictura were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.[34][42]/nMuch of the painting in Verrocchio's workshop was done by his assistants. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ (c.\u20091472\u20131475), painting the young angel holding Jesus's robe with skill so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio purportedly put down his brush and never painted again[\u2021 1] (the latter claim probably being apocryphal).[14] The new technique of oil paint was applied to areas of the mostly tempera work, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream, and much of Jesus's figure, indicating Leonardo's hand.[43] Additionally, Leonardo may have been a model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.[14]/nVasari tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: a local peasant made himself a round buckler shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo, inspired by the story of Medusa, responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that his father bought a different shield to give to the peasant and sold Leonardo's to a Florentine art dealer for 100 ducats, who in turn sold it to the Duke of Milan.[\u2021 2]/nBy 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine,[j] but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him.[36][44] Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the Arno valley (see below).[37][45][k] According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to suggest making the Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa.[46]/nIn January 1478, Leonardo received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of Saint Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio,[47] an indication of his independence from Verrocchio's studio. An anonymous early biographer, known as Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and often worked in the garden of the Piazza San Marco, Florence, where a Neoplatonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers organized by the Medici met.[14][l] In March 1481, he received a commission from the monks of San Donato in Scopeto for The Adoration of the Magi.[48] Neither of these initial commissions were completed, being abandoned when Leonardo went to offer his services to Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza. Leonardo wrote Sforza a letter which described the diverse things that he could achieve in the fields of engineering and weapon design, and mentioned that he could paint.[37][49] He brought with him a silver string instrument\u00a0\u2013  either a lute or lyre\u00a0\u2013  in the form of a horse's head.[49]/nWith Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom Marsiglio Ficino, proponent of Neoplatonism; Cristoforo Landino, writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and John Argyropoulos, teacher of Greek and translator of Aristotle were the foremost. Also associated with the Platonic Academy of the Medici was Leonardo's contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher Pico della Mirandola.[40][42][50] In 1482, Leonardo was sent as an ambassador by Lorenzo de' Medici to Ludovico il Moro, who ruled Milan between 1479 and 1499.[40][14]/nLeonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.[51] In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary (on behalf of Sforza) to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna.[52] In 1490 he was called as a consultant, together with Francesco di Giorgio Martini, for the building site of the cathedral of Pavia[53][54] and was struck by the equestrian statue of Regisole, of which he left a sketch.[55] Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, such as preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions; a drawing of, and wooden model for, a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral;[56] and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico's predecessor Francesco Sforza. This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello's Gattamelata in Padua and Verrocchio's Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, and became known as the Gran Cavallo.[37] Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting,[37] but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the metal to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles\u00a0VIII of France.[37]/nContemporary correspondence records that Leonardo and his assistants were commissioned by the Duke of Milan to paint the Sala delle Asse in the Sforza Castle, c. 1498.[57] The project became a trompe-l'\u0153il decoration that made the great hall appear to be a pergola created by the interwoven limbs of sixteen mulberry trees,[58] whose canopy included an intricate labyrinth of leaves and knots on the ceiling.[59]/nWhen Ludovico Sforza was overthrown by France in 1500, Leonardo fled Milan for Venice, accompanied by his assistant Sala\u00ec and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli.[61] In Venice, Leonardo was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack.[36] On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist, a work that won such admiration that \"men [and] women, young and old\" flocked to see it \"as if they were going to a solemn festival.\"[\u2021 3][m]/nIn Cesena in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron.[61] Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola in order to win his patronage. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons./nLeonardo had left Borgia's service and returned to Florence by early 1503,[63] where he rejoined the Guild of Saint Luke on 18 October of that year. By this same month, Leonardo had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model for the Mona Lisa,[64][65] which he would continue working on until his twilight years. In January 1504, he was part of a committee formed to recommend where Michelangelo's statue of David should be placed.[66] He then spent two years in Florence designing and painting a mural of The Battle of Anghiari for the Signoria,[61] with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, The Battle of Cascina.[n]/nIn 1506, Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d'Amboise, the acting French governor of the city.[69] There, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count Francesco Melzi, the son of a Lombard aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student.[36] The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish The Battle of Anghiari, but he was given leave at the behest of Louis XII, who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits.[69] Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d'Amboise;[70] a wax model survives and, if genuine, is the only extant example of Leonardo's sculpture. Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests.[69] Many of Leonardo's most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan,[36] including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, and Marco d'Oggiono. In 1507, Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father, who had died in 1504./nBy 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.[71]/nIn 1512, Leonardo was working on plans for an equestrian monument for Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, but this was prevented by an invasion of a confederation of Swiss, Spanish and Venetian forces, which drove the French from Milan. Leonardo stayed in the city, spending several months in 1513 at the Medici's Vaprio d'Adda villa.[72]/nIn March 1513, Lorenzo de' Medici's son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September, where he was received by the pope's brother Giuliano.[72] From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active.[71] Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month, and according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver.[74] The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish.[74][o] Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death.[74] He practiced botany in the Gardens of Vatican City, and was commissioned to make plans for the pope's proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes.[75] He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords;[76] these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the pope's favor, but was unsuccessful.[74]/nIn October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan.[48] Leonardo was present at the 19 December meeting of Francis I and Leo X, which took place in Bologna.[36][77][78] In 1516, Leonardo entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Luc\u00e9, near the king's residence at the royal Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise. Being frequently visited by Francis, he drew plans for an immense castle town the king intended to erect at Romorantin, and made a mechanical lion, which during a pageant walked toward the king and\u00a0\u2013  upon being struck by a wand\u00a0\u2013  opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies.[79][\u2021 3][p] Leonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice Francesco Melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000\u00a0scudi.[71] At some point, Melzi drew a portrait of Leonardo; the only others known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo's studies (c.\u20091517)[81] and a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino depicting an elderly Leonardo with his right arm wrapped in clothing.[82][q] The latter, in addition to the record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d'Aragon,[r] confirms an account of Leonardo's right hand being paralytic when he was 65,[85] which may indicate why he left works such as the Mona Lisa unfinished.[83][86][87] He continued to work at some capacity until eventually becoming ill and bedridden for several months.[85]/nLeonardo died at Clos Luc\u00e9 on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke.[88][87][89] Francis I had become a close friend. Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that \"he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.\"[90] Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament.[\u2021 4] Vasari also records that the king held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact.[s][t] In accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo's casket.[50][u] Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo's paintings, tools, library and personal effects. Leonardo's other long-time pupil and companion, Sala\u00ec, and his servant Baptista de Vilanis, each received half of Leonardo's vineyards.[92] His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak. On 12 August 1519, Leonardo's remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise.[93]/nSome 20 years after Leonardo's death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini as saying: \"There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.\"[94]/nSala\u00ec, or Il Salaino (\"The Little Unclean One\", i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo's household in 1490 as an assistant. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him \"a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton,\" after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes.[95] Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years.[96] Sala\u00ec executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Sala\u00ec, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo \"taught him many things about painting,\"[\u2021 3] his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo's pupils, such as Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio./nAt the time of his death in 1524, Sala\u00ec owned a painting referred to as Joconda in a posthumous inventory of his belongings; it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.[97]/nDespite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life.[2]/nWithin Leonardo's lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his \"great physical beauty\" and \"infinite grace,\" as described by Vasari,[\u2021 5] as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his love for animals, likely including vegetarianism and according to Vasari, a habit of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.[99][\u2021 6]/nLeonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance, including mathematician Luca Pacioli,[100] with whom he collaborated on the book Divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella.[101] While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.[36]/nBeyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud in his Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood.[102] Leonardo's most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Sala\u00ec and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo's brothers of his death, described Leonardo's feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Walter Isaacson in his biography of Leonardo makes explicit his opinion that the relations with Salai were intimate and homosexual.[103]/nEarlier in Leonardo's life, court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de' Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal.[104] Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality[105] and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in Saint John the Baptist and Bacchus and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings.[106][98]/nDespite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a \"Divine\" painter.[107]/nAmong the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.[v]/nLeonardo first gained attention for his work on the Baptism of Christ, painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are Annunciations. One is small, 59 centimetres (23\u00a0in) long and 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) high. It is a \"predella\" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, 217\u00a0cm (85\u00a0in) long.[108] In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.[109]/nIn the smaller painting, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise.[34] This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation./nIn the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment./nOne of these paintings was Saint Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: \"I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die.\"[36] Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual.[w] Jerome, as a penitent, occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies.[110] Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted./nThe daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the Adoration of the Magi, a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about 250 x 250 centimetres. Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined classical architecture that forms part of the background. In 1482 Leonardo went to Milan at the behest of Lorenzo de' Medici in order to win favour with Ludovico il Moro, and the painting was abandoned.[14]/nThe third important work of this period is the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece.[111] Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water.[112] While the painting is quite large, about 200\u00d7120 centimetres, it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of San Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.[37][61]/nLeonardo's most remarkable portrait of this period is the Lady with an Ermine, presumed to be Cecilia Gallerani (c.\u20091483\u20131490), lover of Ludovico Sforza.[113][114] The painting is characterised by the pose of the figure with the head turned at a very different angle to the torso, unusual at a date when many portraits were still rigidly in profile. The ermine plainly carries symbolic meaning, relating either to the sitter, or to Ludovico who belonged to the prestigious Order of the Ermine.[113]/nLeonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said \"one of you will betray me\", and the consternation that this statement caused.[37]/nThe writer Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.[115] This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.[\u2021 7]/nThe painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterization,[\u2021 8] but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as \"completely ruined.\"[116] Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking.[117] Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various mediums./nToward the end of this period, in 1498 Leonardo's trompe-l'\u0153il decoration of the Sala delle Asse was painted for the Duke of Milan in the Castello Sforzesco./nIn 1505, Leonardo was commissioned to paint The Battle of Anghiari in the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Leonardo devised a dynamic composition depicting four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Michelangelo was assigned the opposite wall to depict the Battle of Cascina. Leonardo's painting deteriorated rapidly and is now known from a copy by Rubens.[118]/nAmong the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the Mona Lisa or La Gioconda, the laughing one. In the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called \"sfumato\", or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari wrote that the smile was \"so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original.\"[\u2021 9]/nOther characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera, and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable.[119] Vasari expressed that the painting's quality would make even \"the most confident master ... despair and lose heart.\"[\u2021 10] The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.[120]/nIn the painting Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as \"breathtakingly beautiful\"[121] and harkens back to the Saint Jerome with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, Saint Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice.[37] This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto,[122] and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese./nLeonardo was a prolific draughtsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.[123] His earliest dated drawing is a Landscape of the Arno Valley, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.[36][123][x]/nAmong his famous drawings are the Vitruvian Man, a study of the proportions of the human body; the Head of an Angel, for The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre; a botanical study of Star of Bethlehem; and a large drawing (160\u00d7100\u00a0cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist in the National Gallery, London.[123] This drawing employs the subtle sfumato technique of shading, in the manner of the Mona Lisa. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne in the Louvre.[124]/nOther drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as \"caricatures\" because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that Leonardo would look for interesting faces in public to use as models for some of his work.[\u2021 7] There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Sala\u00ec, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called \"Grecian profile\".[y] These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior.[123] Sala\u00ec is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo's ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de' Medici, in the Pazzi conspiracy.[123] In his notes, Leonardo recorded the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died./nLike the two contemporary architects Donato Bramante (who designed the Belvedere Courtyard) and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.[40][125]/nRenaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work.[37] These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.[37] Leonardo's notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.[37]/nThese notebooks\u00a0\u2013  originally loose papers of different types and sizes\u00a0\u2013  were largely entrusted to Leonardo's pupil and heir Francesco Melzi after the master's death.[126] These were to be published, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo's idiosyncratic writing.[127] Some of Leonardo's drawings were copied by an anonymous Milanese artist for a planned treatise on art c.\u20091570.[128] After Melzi's death in 1570, the collection passed to his son, the lawyer Orazio, who initially took little interest in the journals.[126] In 1587, a Melzi household tutor named Lelio Gavardi took 13 of the manuscripts to Pisa; there, the architect Giovanni Magenta reproached Gavardi for having taken the manuscripts illicitly and returned them to Orazio. Having many more such works in his possession, Orazio gifted the volumes to Magenta. News spread of these lost works of Leonardo's, and Orazio retrieved seven of the 13 manuscripts, which he then gave to Pompeo Leoni for publication in two volumes; one of these was the Codex Atlanticus. The other six works had been distributed to a few others.[129] After Orazio's death, his heirs sold the rest of Leonardo's possessions, and thus began their dispersal.[130]/nSome works have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the Louvre, the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which holds the 12-volume Codex Atlanticus, and the British Library in London, which has put a selection from the Codex Arundel (BL Arundel MS 263) online.[131] Works have also been at Holkham Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in the private hands of John Nicholas Brown\u00a0I and Robert Lehman.[126] The Codex Leicester is the only privately owned major scientific work of Leonardo; it is owned by Bill Gates and displayed once a year in different cities around the world./nMost of Leonardo's writings are in mirror-image cursive.[45][132] Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.[133][z] Leonardo used a variety of shorthand and symbols, and states in his notes that he intended to prepare them for publication.[132] In many cases a single topic is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet, together conveying information that would not be lost if the pages were published out of order.[136] Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.[37]/nLeonardo's approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote \"Il sole non si move.\" (\"The Sun does not move.\")[137]/nIn the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli's book Divina proportione, published in 1509.[37] While living in Milan, he studied light from the summit of Monte Rosa.[69] Scientific writings in his notebook on fossils have been considered as influential on early palaeontology.[138]/nThe content of his journals suggest that he was planning a series of treatises on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on anatomy is said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis d'Aragon's secretary in 1517.[139] Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by Melzi and eventually published as A Treatise on Painting in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724,[140] with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter Nicolas Poussin.[4] According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into 62 editions in fifty years, caused Leonardo to be seen as \"the precursor of French academic thought on art.\"[37]/nWhile Leonardo's experimentation followed scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a \"Renaissance Man\", his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.[141]/nLeonardo started his study in the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.[citation needed]/nAs a successful artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor Marcantonio della Torre, professor of Anatomy at the University of Pavia.[142] Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words toward a treatise on anatomy.[143] Only a small amount of the material on anatomy was published in Leonardo's Treatise on painting.[127] During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht D\u00fcrer, who made a number of drawings from them.[127]/nLeonardo's anatomical drawings include many studies of the human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics.[144] He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero.[123] The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.[143]/nLeonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.[37][123] Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number of studies of horses.[123]/nLeonardo's dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns.[145]/nDuring his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer. With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy, Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices. He drew their \"anatomy\" with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected \"exploded view\" technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages.[146] In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli also worked.[147][148] He continued to contemplate the canalization of Lombardy's plains while in Louis XII's company[69] and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I.[149] Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.[36][37]/nLeonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of flight for much of his life, producing many studies, including Codex on the Flight of Birds (c.\u20091505), as well as plans for several flying machines, such as a flapping ornithopter and a machine with a helical rotor.[37] In a 2003 documentary by British television station Channel Four, titled Leonardo's Dream Machines, various designs by Leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted and constructed.[150][151] Some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when tested. Similarly, a team of engineers built ten machines designed by Leonardo in the 2009 American television series Doing DaVinci, including a fighting vehicle and a self-propelled cart./nResearch performed by Marc van den Broek revealed older prototypes for more than 100 inventions that are ascribed to Leonardo. Similarities between Leonardo's illustrations and drawings from the Middle Ages and from Ancient Greece and Rome, the Chinese and Persian Empires, and Egypt suggest that a large portion of Leonardo's inventions had been conceived before his lifetime. Leonardo's innovation was to combine different functions from existing drafts and set them into scenes that illustrated their utility. By reconstituting technical inventions he created something new.[152]/nIn his notebooks, Leonardo first stated the 'laws' of sliding friction in 1493.[153] His inspiration for investigating friction came about in part from his study of perpetual motion, which he correctly concluded was not possible.[154] His results were never published and the friction laws were not rediscovered until 1699 by Guillaume Amontons, with whose name they are now usually associated.[\u2021 7] For this contribution, Leonardo was named as the first of the 23 \"Men of Tribology\" by Duncan Dowson.[155]/nAlthough he had no formal academic training,[156] many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the \"Universal Genius\" or \"Renaissance Man\", an individual of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination.\"[157] He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived.[158] According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and \"his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.\"[157] Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.[159]/nLeonardo's fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.[37]/nThe continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. Baldassare Castiglione, author of Il\u00a0Cortegiano (The Courtier), wrote in 1528: \"...Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled...\"[160] while the biographer known as \"Anonimo Gaddiano\" wrote, c.\u20091540: \"His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf...\"[161] Vasari, in his Lives of the Artists (1568), opens his chapter on Leonardo:[\u2021 11]/nIn the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease./nThe 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo's genius, causing Henry Fuseli to write in 1801: \"Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius...\"[162] This is echoed by A.E. Rio who wrote in 1861: \"He towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents.\"[163]/nBy the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo's notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: \"There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries.\"[164]/nArt historian Bernard Berenson wrote in 1896:/nLeonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness: Nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty. Whether it be the cross section of a skull, the structure of a weed, or a study of muscles, he, with his feeling for line and for light and shade, forever transmuted it into life-communicating values.[165]/nThe interest in Leonardo's genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found.[166] Liana Bortolon, writing in 1967, said:/nBecause of the multiplicity of interests that spurred him to pursue every field of knowledge...Leonardo can be considered, quite rightly, to have been the universal genius par excellence, and with all the disquieting overtones inherent in that term. Man is as uncomfortable today, faced with a genius, as he was in the 16th century. Five centuries have passed, yet we still view Leonardo with awe.[36]/nThe Elmer Belt Library of Vinciana is a special collection at the University of California, Los Angeles.[167]/nTwenty-first-century author Walter Isaacson based much of his biography of Leonardo[104] on thousands of notebook entries, studying the personal notes, sketches, budget notations, and musings of the man whom he considers the greatest of innovators. Isaacson was surprised to discover a \"fun, joyous\" side of Leonardo in addition to his limitless curiosity and creative genius.[168]/nOn the 500th anniversary of Leonardo's death, the Louvre in Paris arranged for the largest ever single exhibit of his work, called Leonardo, between November 2019 and February 2020. The exhibit includes over 100 paintings, drawings and notebooks. Eleven of the paintings that Leonardo completed in his lifetime were included. Five of these are owned by the Louvre, but the Mona Lisa was not included because it is in such great demand among general visitors to the Louvre; it remains on display in its gallery. Vitruvian Man, however, is on display following a legal battle with its owner, the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. Salvator Mundi[aa] was also not included because its Saudi owner did not agree to lease the work.[171][172]/nThe Mona Lisa, considered Leonardo's magnum opus, is often regarded as the most famous portrait ever made.[3][173] The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time,[157] and Leonardo's Vitruvian Man drawing is also considered a cultural icon.[174]/nMore than a decade of analysis of Leonardo's genetic genealogy, conducted by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, came to a conclusion in mid-2021. It was determined that the artist has 14 living male relatives. The work could also help determine the authenticity of remains thought to belong to Leonardo.[175]/nWhile Leonardo was certainly buried in the collegiate church of Saint Florentin at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise in 12 August 1519, the current location of his remains is unclear.[176][177] Much of Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise was damaged during the French Revolution, leading to the church's demolition in 1802.[176] Some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of Leonardo's remains subject to dispute; a gardener may have even buried some in the corner of the courtyard.[176]/nIn 1863, fine-arts inspector general Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye received an imperial commission to excavate the site and discovered a partially complete skeleton with a bronze ring on one finger, white hair, and stone fragments bearing the inscriptions \"EO\", \"AR\", \"DUS\", and \"VINC\"\u00a0\u2013  interpreted as forming \"Leonardus Vinci\".[93][176][178] The skull's eight teeth corresponds to someone with approximately the same age and a silver shield found near the bones depicts a beardless Francis I, corresponding to the king's appearance during Leonardo's time in France.[178]/nHoussaye postulated that the unusually large skull was an indicator of Leonardo's intelligence; author Charles Nicholl describes this as a \"dubious phrenological deduction\".[176] At the same time, Houssaye noted some issues with his observations, including that the feet were turned toward the high altar, a practice generally reserved for laymen, and that the skeleton of 1.73 metres (5.7\u00a0ft) seemed too short.[178][failed verification \u2013 see discussion] Art historian Mary Margaret Heaton wrote in 1874 that the height would be appropriate for Leonardo.[179] The skull was allegedly presented to Napoleon III before being returned to the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise, where they were re-interred in the chapel of Saint Hubert in 1874.[178][180] A plaque above the tomb states that its contents are only presumed to be those of Leonardo.[177]/nIt has since been theorized that the folding of the skeleton's right arm over the head may correspond to the paralysis of Leonardo's right hand.[82][88][178] In 2016, it was announced that DNA tests would be conducted to determine whether the attribution is correct.[180] The DNA of the remains will be compared to that of samples collected from Leonardo's work and his half-brother Domenico's descendants;[180] it may also be sequenced.[181]/nIn 2019, documents were published revealing that Houssaye had kept the ring and a lock of hair. In 1925, his great-grandson sold these to an American collector. Sixty years later, another American acquired them, leading to their being displayed at the Leonardo Museum in Vinci beginning on 2 May 2019, the 500th anniversary of the artist's death.[93][182]/nGeneral/nDates of works/nEarly/nModern/nBooks/nJournals and encyclopedia articles/nSee Kemp (2003) and Bambach (2019, pp.\u00a0442\u2013579) for extensive bibliographies/nGeneral/nWorks", "2410144": "Arnold Ephraim Ross (August 24, 1906 \u2013 September 25, 2002) was a mathematician and educator who founded the Ross Mathematics Program, a number theory summer program for gifted high school students. He was born in Chicago, but spent his youth in Odesa, Ukraine, where he studied with Samuil Shatunovsky. Ross returned to Chicago and enrolled in University of Chicago graduate coursework under E. H. Moore, despite his lack of formal academic training. He received his Ph.D. and married his wife, Bee, in 1931./nRoss taught at several institutions including St. Louis University before becoming chair of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946. He started a teacher training program in mathematics that evolved into the Ross Mathematics Program in 1957 with the addition of high school students. The program moved with him to Ohio State University when he became their department chair in 1963. Though forced to retire in 1976, Ross ran the summer program until 2000. He had worked with over 2,000 students during more than forty summers./nThe program is known as Ross's most significant work. Its attendees have since continued on to prominent research positions across the sciences. His program inspired several offshoots and was recognized by mathematicians as highly influential. Ross has received an honorary doctorate and several professional association awards for his instruction and service./nRoss was born Arnold Ephraim Chaimovich[1] on August 24, 1906, in Chicago to Ukrainian-Jewish immigrants.[2] He was an only child.[1] His mother supported the family as a physical therapist.[1] Ross returned to Odesa, Ukraine with his mother in 1909 for assistance from her extended family,[1] and stayed once World War I and the Russian Revolution broke out.[2] The two events led to widespread famine and economic woe in the region.[1] Ross learned Russian at the behest of his mother, and developed a love of the theater and language.[1] Ross's mother encouraged him to read, which he did often, and subscribed to a private library since Odesa had no public library.[1] He credited his favorite uncle, an X-ray diagnostician, with introducing him to mathematics.[1] The uncle had hired Samuil Shatunovsky to tutor his talented son, and Ross asked to join in.[1] As money meant little due to inflation, Shatunovsky was paid to tutor the two boys with a pound of French hard candy.[1] During this time, Ross was not taught with textbooks or lectured on geometric proofs.[1] His geometry teacher would ask the class to prove and justify ideas on the blackboard per trial and error.[1] Many universities were closed due to the famine, but Odesa University reopened and let a small group of adolescents attend, including Ross.[1]/nRoss left Odesa\u2014now part of Ukraine\u2014in 1922 with the intention of returning to Chicago and studying topology with E. H. Moore at the University of Chicago.[1] After negotiating his way home, he worked at a family friend's bookbinding shop and continued to learn English at the Lewis Institute.[1] He also changed his surname from Chaimovich to Ross in 1922.[3] Ross used his salary from a year at the shop to enroll for one term at the University of Chicago in Moore's course.[1] Moore gave Ross special attention, knowing his untraditional background, and arranged for Ross to attend the topology class as the sole undergraduate.[1]/nIn Moore's teaching style, he would propose a conjecture and task the students with proving it.[1] Students could respond with counter-conjectures that they would defend.[1] Ross found Moore's method exciting,[1] and his pedagogy influenced Ross's own.[2] Ross graduated with a B.S. degree[4] and continued his study as Leonard Eugene Dickson's research assistant.[2] Ross earned a M.S. degree[4] and finished his Ph.D. in number theory at the University of Chicago in 1931 with Dickson as his adviser.[2] Ross's dissertation was entitled \"On Representation of Integers by Indefinite Ternary Quadratic Forms\".[1]  He did not pay tuition after his first quarter, which he credits to Dickson.[1]/nRoss married Bertha (Bee) Halley Horecker, a singer-musician and daughter of Ross's Chicago neighbors, in 1931,[1] received a National Research Council Fellowship for 1932,[5] and worked as a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow[4] at California Institute of Technology with Eric Temple Bell until 1933.[2] Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College,[4] where he also taught physics.[1] Ross became an assistant professor at St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years.[2] In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics.[1] This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity.[1] During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy.[2] He befriended Hungarian mathematician G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended.[1] He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945[1] before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946.[2] He set out to change the school's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erd\u0151s, whom Ross made a full professor.[1]/nWhile at Notre Dame in 1947, Ross began a mathematics program that prioritized what he described as \"the act of personal discovery through observation and experimentation\" for high school and junior college teachers.[1] In 1957, the program expanded via the National Science Foundation's post-Sputnik funds for teacher retraining, and Ross let high school students attend.[1] This expansion became the Ross Mathematics Program,[1] a summer mathematics program for talented high school students.[2] The program lasts eight weeks and brings students with no prior knowledge to topics such as Gaussian integers and quadratic reciprocity.[2] Though the program teaches number theory, by its Gauss-inspired[6] motto, \"Think deeply of simple things,\" its primary goal is to offer precollege students an intellectual experience[2] as what he described as \"a vivid apprenticeship to a life of exploration.\"[1][7] The program is known for its intensity, and is considered America's \"most rigorous number theory program.\"[8] Ross was known to say, \"No one leaves the program unchanged.\"[9]/nThis emphasis on computation alone too often produces students who have never practiced thinking for themselves, who have never asked why things work the way they do, who are not prepared to lead the way to future scientific innovation.

Ray-Chaudhuri to teach there regularly.[1] Ross left Notre Dame to become chair of Ohio State University's mathematics department in 1963, and the program followed in the 1964 summer.[2]  The program briefly moved to the University of Chicago in the summers of 1975\u20131978 at mathematician Felix Browder's invitation.[2] The program is unadvertised and depends on personal contacts and word of mouth to propagate.[1][2][8] It is recognized by mathematicians as one of the best mathematics programs for high school students.[8]/nAdmission to the program is competitive, with an approximately 15% acceptance rate.

The subjects studied in Chile at the time were reading, writing, Christian doctrine, arithmetic (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication) and morality and etiquette. That was considered more than enough for ordinary citizens.[1]/nHis secondary education was better. At the time, secondary education in Chile was divided in two basic courses: humanities (intended for future lawyers) and mathematics (for future surveyors).[2] The former was a longer course but gave a more promising future.[3]/nPicarte studied in one of the most prestigious and old state schools in Chile, the General Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera National Institute from 1840. Some of his classmates would become illustrious figures, including Guillermo, Joaqu\u00edn and Alberto Blest Gana; V\u00edctor and Miguel Luis Amun\u00e1tegui; Diego Barros Arana, one of the fathers of Chilean historiography; Eusebio Lillo, poet and the composer of the national anthem, and Pedro Le\u00f3n Gallo Goyenechea, a prominent politician.[4]/nPicarte began his studies on the humanities course, but soon after finishing the Roman law module, he switched to maths. Fortunately for him, he had an excellent maths teacher in Andr\u00e9s Antonio Gorbea. For Professor Gorbea, maths was an essential part of education and should not be limited to the requirements of future surveyors. He based his teaching on the book \"A complete course of pure mathematics\"[5] by Louis Benjamin Francoeur, a professor of the French Academy of Sciences. Picarte had lectures on topics including analytic geometry, probability theory, algebra, series, differential calculus and integrals. He obtained a degree as surveyor in 1852./nIn 1854, Picarte became a mathematics professor at the military academy of the Chilean Army. In those days, mathematics was dependent on mathematical tables, which were as important for mathematicians as computers are today. There were just a few limited division and multiplication tables available in Chile at the time. Picarte extended those tables to include numbers up to 10,000, and in doing, greatly improved the accuracy and reach of the tables./nHe translated and improved the most commonly used logarithm tables in Chile, and invented a new way of calculating divisions by creating a table that allowed mathematicians to divide any number up to 10,000 with a simple sum. He also improved the Lalande algorithm tables which were widely used by engineers, architects, surveyors, merchants, or anyone needing to solve complex mathematical problems./nPicarte asked other Chilean mathematicians examine his work but did not receive an enthusiastic response. He tried to sell the copyrights for it at a very low price so that it could be published and distributed, but was unable to find a buyer. He then applied for support from the government but received the same response as from his peers: indifference and incredulity. This may have been because there were very few mathematicians in Chile at the time able to review or check his work. Lalande, who had produced the existing, widely distributed algorithm tables, was also a famous French astronomer and mathematician, so there was some resistance to replacing them with something new./nEssentially, Picarte's work did not align with the needs of president Manuel Montt\u2019s development project for the newly born nation. There were no government financial support for scientific or mathematical research, and Lalande's existing tables were sufficient for Pedro Jos\u00e9 Amadeo Pissis\u2019s work on topographical maps and for the astronomical studies carried out by Carlos Moesta, director of the newly created Santa Luc\u00eda Hill observatory./nConfident in the value of his invention despite the lack of recognition in Chile, Picarte decided to leave his homeland. He travelled to Peru in 1857, where he also failed to find a publisher. He stayed for two months taking on whatever casual work he could find, and begged his Chilean acquaintances for money to continue onwards, first to Panama, and then to Southampton, England. Once in England, sold his watch in order to complete the last leg of his journey to France./nIn Paris, with no more than his tables and the clothes on his back, he followed the advice of other mathematicians and spent 5 months reviewing and compiling his work in order to present it to the French Academy of Sciences. He finally presented his work on 15 February 1859 and received warm praise from the academics. The report of this session was signed by famous members of the academy, Mathieu, Bienaym\u00e9 and Charles Hermite.[6]\nPicarte's mathematical tables were welcomed in Europe. He stayed in France for some time and received some income from selling the copyright of his work. Soon, the government of Chile realized of the magnitude of his achievement and offered him official recognition and a cash prize via the consulate in France./nPicarte returned to Chile in 1862. In October of that year he joined the Faculty of Physics and Maths at the University of Chile, although he didn't teach classes until the beginning of 1890. Free of financial problems, he dedicated his life to his studies. He patented three inventions: A siphon pump, a steam siphon and a steam reciprocating pump.[7]/nWhen he returned to Chile, Picarte was preoccupied with the social problems that he saw around him. In France he had learned about the socialist ideas of Charles Fourier, cousin of famous mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Marie Charles Fourier. These ideas had a great impact on him, and he dedicated himself to helping to solve Chile's welfare issues./nObserving the conditions in his own country and comparing them to what was happening in Europe, Picarte developed an interesting theory that he incorporated to his university thesis, called: \"The importance of life insurance, and related projects which are likely to be established in Chile\" (Importancia de la Instituci\u00f3n de Seguros de la Vida, y proyectos sobre el particular que son susceptibles de establecerse en Chile)[8] In his thesis, Picarte expressed his views as follows: \"If this horrible state of things (misery) is a necessity in that sad European civilization, sustained only by poverty and selfishness; in America, continent of new republics, and especially in Chile, where the arteries of blundering speculation are not yet formed or solidified, it would be an eternal shame if we (society) can do something about it and don\u2019t.\"[9] In this report, Picarte criticizes the economic system and sets out the basis of the scientific approach to a future social program in Chile, after seeing how those organizations operate in Europe. \nThrough mathematics, he proposes that it is scientifically proven that these social institutions are possible (\"es un hecho matem\u00e1ticamente probado que son posibles\")./nIn the years that followed, Picarte dedicated himself to this project, though again, he received almost no support. But he was not just an intellectual: in 1863, he organized a union for tailors, and another for shoemakers. In 1864, he took his ideas to a larger scale with the \"Sociedad Trabajo para Todos\" (Society of Work for All), a production and mutual support organization with a people's savings bank, similar to a cooperative and organized according to his theories. His leaflets claimed that the organization would provide affordable and healthy food for everyone, eliminating intermediaries, and would reduce housing costs by sub-letting houses and rooms from other members of the organization at lower prices. The organization also promoted work, encouraging its members to produce and exchange goods within the organisation. \nPicarte expect the organization to produce some income, and with that, expand its benefits to other areas. In order to get capital for his plans, he waited in his office everyday from 12 to 3 to receive anyone who wanted to partner with him, but no-one supported or financed his project./nIn 1865 Picarte obtained a degree in law and became a lawyer. His degree thesis discussed similar social issues and highlighted the need to organize state finances in order to be a truly independent nation./n\"All that is needed is that want it, that we believe we are now capable of being such men; that we leave behind the sad concerns that have made us view what comes from that out-of-date Europe with a kind of respect.\".[10]/nAs a lawyer, Picarte offered his services for free to those who were unable to pay. He also wrote and published leaflets that explained the key rights enshrined in the Chilean Civil Code in simple words, putting them within reach of those with no knowledge of the law./nAround this time, Picarte moved to the southern Chilean town of San Carlos. Then, in 1866, he moved to Chill\u00e1n, where in 1869 he married Clorinda Pardo, the daughter of a Chilean army colonel. It is not known if the couple had any children. He made the news again in 1883 when he published \"Large logarithm tables to twelve decimal points\" (Grandes Tablas de Logaritmos a doce decimales) in Chile and France, financed by the Chilean government. He then travelled back to France, after which there is no further record of him.[11]", "1459902": "Ludwig Otto Blumenthal (20 July 1876 \u2013 12 November 1944) was a German mathematician and professor at RWTH Aachen University./nHe was born in Frankfurt, Hesse-Nassau.

The first two were brick structures home to the East and West Families, built in 1817 and 1821, respectively.[1] The third, construction of which began in 1824 and ended ten years later, was the dwelling of the Center Family.[1] Built of white limestone, the building is 55 by 60 feet with an ell of 34 by 85 feet.[1] Besides the three dwellings, Burnett designed the Pleasant Hill Shakers' Meeting House in 1820. A white clapboard structure, it is 60 by 44 feet.[1]/nDuring the early 1830s, Burnett directed the construction of the first public waterworks west of the Allegheny Mountains.[1] Part of the project included the erection of Pleasant Hill's water tower, which Burnett designed. Completed in 1831, the tower holds a cypress tank with a capacity of 4,400 gallons of water.[1]/nThe tower allowed every dwelling, shop, and barn in the Shaker village to have access to running water.[1] Burnett's expertise in engineering and designing waterworks was such that he was consulted by Shakers at the South Union Shaker Society when they were designing their own waterworks.[1]/nWhile Burnett's many designs and completed buildings awarded him renown both among Shakers and outside groups, his most famous project was that of the Pleasant Hill Trustees' House.[1] A large brick building, it was built from 1839\u20131840 and is best known for its twin spiral staircases, which have the appearance of standing unsupported.[1]/nIn addition to his design and construction work, Burnett also had the important job of trustee, which took him to markets across the Mississippi River area selling Shaker good including seeds, brooms, medicinal herbs, raw silk, and fruit preserves.[1] To provide better access to the Kentucky River from Pleasant Hill, he designed and oversaw the construction of a new road.[1] In his later years, he also designed and oversaw the construction of the Pleasant Hill West Family's wash house, the West Family Sisters' Shop, the East Family Brethren's Shop, and the Pleasant Hill U.S. Post Office.[1]/nIn 1872, because of his old age, Burnett was released from his trustee duties.[1] He died on 10 January 1879 at the age of 87.[1]", "48908035": "Elod Macskasy (Hungarian: Macsk\u00e1sy El\u0151d) (7 April 1919 \u2013 21 January 1990) was a Hungarian-Canadian chess master./nMacskasy was born in Arad, which at the time was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but was shortly afterwards ceded to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon.

Perhaps his best Hungarian result occurred in 1952, when he won a Master tournament ahead of \u00c1rp\u00e1d Vajda, Istv\u00e1n Bilek and K\u00e1roly Honfi.[2] Macskasy co-authored a book on the 1952 Hungarian championship.[4]/nFollowing the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he emigrated to Canada, where he secured a position as professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.[1]/nHe was a surprise winner of the 1958 Canadian Open Championship, at Winnipeg, ahead of Larry Evans, with 9/10.[5]  Macskasy won the British Columbia Championship for five straight years, from 1958 to 1962, and shared this title in 1967. He continued to play often in this event, generally scoring well, into the late 1980s.[6]/nIn 1961, he played an eight-game training match with Abe Yanofsky, Canada's top player, in Vancouver, losing +2 =1 -5; the match helped Yanofsky to prepare for the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal.[7][8]/nMacskasy competed several times in the Canadian Chess Championship, generally with good results.

A prolific and versatile innovator, his fields of interest in engineering were very extensive and included mechanics, aeronautics, and automatics. One of his greatest achievements was El Ajedrecista (The Chess Player) of 1912,[3] an electromagnetic device capable of playing a limited form of chess that demonstrated the capability of machines to be programmed to follow specified rules (heuristics) and marked the beginnings of research into the development of artificial intelligence.[4]/nTorres' first major project was the patent for a new cable car system in 1887 to transport people safely, an area that culminated in 1916 with the Whirlpool Aero Car located in Niagara Falls, that carries 35 standing passengers over a one-kilometre trip.[5] He published Sur les machines alg\u00e9briques (1895) and Machines \u00e0 calculer (1901), works that gave him a notorious reputation in France, carrying out the construction of several analog machines for the resolution of algebraic equations.[6]/nHe made significant aeronautical contributions in the early 20th century, from a mooring post with a superior pivoting platform to be able to moor a dirigible outdoors, to the Astra-Torres airship, a trilobed cross section structure that began to be manufactured from 1911 and was widely used by the Allied Powers during World War I. Torres was also a key figure in the development of radio control in 1901 with the Telekine, which he created modern wireless remote-control operation principles.[7]/nTorres' pioneering advances included the designs for a special-purpose electromechanical calculator in his 1914 paper Essays on Automatics, which has been qualified by British historian Brian Randell as \"a fascinating work which well repays reading even today\",[8] where he also proposed an early form of floating point values and automata with discernment capacity.[9] He successfully demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine by producing a typewriter-controlled calculating machine in 1920.[10]/nBetween 1900 and 1930, he conceived other original designs, especially in naval engineering, such as the Camp-Vessel (a dirigible-carrying boat), and the Binave (a multihull steel ship). In addition to his technical work, Torres also stood out in the field of letters, and was a noted speaker and supporter of Esperanto.[11]/n/nTorres was born on 28 December 1852, on the Feast of the Holy Innocents, in Santa Cruz de Igu\u00f1a, Cantabria, Spain. His father, Luis Torres Vild\u00f3sola y Urquijo, was a civil engineer in Bilbao, where he worked as a railway engineer. His mother was Valentina de Quevedo y Maza. The family resided for the most part in Bilbao, although they also spent long periods in his mother's family home in Cantabria's mountain region. During his childhood, he spent long periods of time separated from his parents due to work trips. Therefore, he was cared by a relatives of his father, the Barrenechea ladies, who declared him heir to their property, which facilitated his future independence.[12]/nHe studied high school in Bilbao and later went to Paris, to the College of the  Christian Brothers, to complete studies for two years (1868 and 1869),[13] where he met French culture, customs, and language and that in later years it would help him in his scientific-technical relationships with personalities, and scientific institutions. In 1870, his father was transferred, bringing his family to Madrid. The following year, Torres began his higher studies in the Official School of the Road Engineers' Corps\u00a0[es]. He temporarily suspended his studies in 1873 to volunteer for the defense of Bilbao, which had been surrounded by Carlist troops during the Third Carlist War. Once the siege of Bilbao was lifted in 1874, he returned to Madrid and completed his studies in 1876, graduating fourth in his class.[14]/nTorres began to work as a civil engineer for a few months on railway projects as his father did, but his curiosity and desire to know and learn led him to give up joining the Corps to dedicate himself in \"thinking about his things\".[15] As a young entrepreneur who had inherited a considerable family fortune, he immediately set out on a long trip through Europe in 1877, visiting Italy, France and Switzerland, to know the scientific and technical advances of the day, especially in the incipient area of electricity.[16][14] Returning to Spain, he settled in Santander, where he continued his self-supported research activities./nTorres' experimentation in the field of cableways and cable cars began very early during his residence in the town of his birth, Molledo. There, in 1887, he constructed the first cableway to span a depression of some 40 metres (130\u00a0ft). The cableway was about 200 metres (660\u00a0ft) across and pulled by a pair of cows, with one log seat. This experiment was the basis for his first patent application in Spain, \"Un sistema de camino funicular a\u00e9reo de alambres m\u00faltiples\" (\"A multi-wire suspended aerial system\"),[17] for a cable car with which he obtained a level of safety suitable for the transport of people, not only cargo. The patent was later extended to other countries: United States, Austria, Germany, France, United Kingdom, and Italy.[18] Torres' cable cars used an innovative multi-cable support system, in which one end of a cable is anchored to fixed counterweights and the other (through a system of pulleys) to mobile counterweights. With this system the axial force of the cables via is constant and equal to the weight of the counterweight, regardless of the load in the shuttle. What will vary with this load is the deflection of the via cables, which will increase by raising the counterweight. Thus, the safety coefficient of these cables is perfectly known, and is independent of the shuttle load. The resulting design is very strong and remains safe in case of a support cable failure. Later, he constructed a cableway over the R\u00edo Le\u00f3n in Valle de Igu\u00f1a\u00a0[es], Spain, that was faster and motorized, but still used solely for the transport of materials, not of people.[19][20][21]/nIn 1889 Torres presented his cableway in Switzerland,[22] a country very interested in that form of transport owing to its geography, and which was already starting to use cable cars for bulk transport in the Klimsenhorn-Pilatus Kulm line. However, he put his project on hold for a few years due to both rejection by Swiss engineers and comments and caricatures that appeared in the press of that country.[23] On 30 September 1907, Torres put into operation a pioneer cableway suitable for the public transportation of people in San Sebasti\u00e1n, the Mount Ulia aerial ropeway\u00a0[es]. The journey was 280 meters, with a drop of 28 meters, lasted for just over three minutes, and the gondola had the capacity to board up to 18 people on each trip. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao.[24][25][26]/nThe positive results of this type of cable car led him to develop his most famous cable car, the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada. The cableway of 550 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side. It travels at about 7.2 kilometres per hour (4.5\u00a0mph). The load per cable via is 9 tonnes (9.9 short tons), with a safety coefficient for the cables of 4.6.[27] It was constructed between 1914 and 1916. For its construction and assembly, the Niagara Spanish Aerocar Company Limited was set up from the Society of Engineering Studies and Works, both companies promoted by Torres, with a capital of $110,000 (roughly $3.2\u00a0million in 2022),[28] and a planned concession of 20 years. The construction was directed by Torres' son, Gonzalo Torres Polanco.[29] It completed its first successful tests on the 15th of February in 1916 and was officially inaugurated on the 8th of August, opening to the public the following day. The cableway, with small modifications, runs to this day with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.[30] A plaque, mounted on a boulder in front of Aero Car Gift Shop recalls this fact: International Historic Civil Engineering Site.

Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara.[31]/nSince the middle of the 19th century, several mechanical devices were known, from integrators, multipliers, to the Analytical engine of Charles Babbage. The work of Torres in this matter is framed within this tradition, which began in 1893 with the presentation of the \"Mem\u00f3ria sobre las m\u00e1quinas alg\u00e9bricas\" (\"Memory about algebraic machines\") at the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid.[32] This paper was commented in a report by Eduardo Saavedra in 1894 and published in the Revista de Obras P\u00fablicas\u00a0[es].[33] Torres developed a first model of the machine, and Saavedra recommended that the final project of the device be financed.[34] Torres' calculating machine was considered in its time as an extraordinary event in the course of Spanish scientific production. In 1895 he presented \"Machines alg\u00e9briques\", accompanied by his demonstration model, at the Bordeaux Congress of the Association pour l'Avancement des Sciences, and in Paris in the Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.[35] Later on, in 1900, he presented a more detailed work, \"Machines \u00e0 calculer\" (\"Calculating machines\") at the Paris Academy of Sciences. The commission, informed favorably by Marcel Deprez, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Paul Appell, asked the academy for its publication,[36][37] highlighting: \"... Mr. Torres has given a theoretical, general and complete solution to the problem of the construction of algebraic and transcendental relations by means of machines...\"[38]/nThese machines examined mathematical and physical analogies that underlay analogue calculation or continuous quantities, and how to establish mechanically the relationships between them, expressed in mathematical formulae. The study included complex variables and used the logarithmic scale. From a practical standpoint, it showed that mechanisms such as turning disks could be used endlessly with precision, so that changes in variables were limited in both directions.[39][40][41] On the practical side, Torres built a whole series of analogue calculating machines, all mechanical. These machines used certain elements known as arithmophores which consisted of a moving part and an index that made it possible to read the quantity according to the position shown thereon.[42] The aforesaid moving part was a graduated disk or a drum turning on an axis. The angular movements were proportional to the logarithms of the magnitudes to be represented. Between 1910 and 1920, using a number of such elements, Torres developed a machine that was able to compute the roots of arbitrary polynomials of order eight, including the complex ones, with a precision down to thousandths.

However, in order to calculate the sum of each term, it is necessary to accurately obtain log(u + v) from the calculated values log(u) and log(v) on a logarithmic scale. For this calculation, Torres invented a mechanism called \"endless spindle\" (\"fusee sans fin\"), a complex differential gear with a helical gear, which allowed the mechanical expression of the relation \n\n\n\ny\n=\nlog\n\u2061\n(\n\n10\n\nx\n\n\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y=\\log(10^{x}+1)}\n\n. Putting log(u) - log(v) = log(u/v) = V, and using u/v = 10 V, calculate log(u + v) using the following formula: \n\n\n\n\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nu\n+\nv\n)\n=\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nv\n(\nu\n\n/\n\nv\n+\n1\n)\n)\n=\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nv\n)\n+\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nu\n\n/\n\nv\n+\n1\n)\n=\nlog\n\u2061\n(\nv\n)\n+\nlog\n\u2061\n(\n\n10\n\nV\n\n\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log(u+v)=\\log(v(u/v+1))=\\log(v)+\\log(u/v+1)=\\log(v)+\\log(10^{V}+1)\\,}\n\n,[43] the same technique which is the basis of the modern electronic logarithmic number system./nIn addition to this machine, Torres devised other with a small computing using gears and linkages around 1900 to obtain the complex number solution of the quadratic equation X2 - pX + q = 0.[44] The machines are kept in the Torres Quevedo Museum at the  School of Civil Engineering of the Technical University of Madrid.[45]/nIn 1902, Torres started the project of a new type of dirigible that would solve the serious problem of suspending the gondola, applying for a patent in France for \u2018Perfectionnements aux aerostats dirigibles\u2019 (\"Improvements in dirigible aerostats\"),[46][47] complemented, with a \"Note sur le calcul d\u2019un ballon dirigeable a quille et suspentes interieures\" (\"Note on the calculus of a dirigible balloon with interior suspension and keel\") which was presented together to Madrid and Paris\u2019 Academies of Science.[48][49] Opposite to the usual cylindrical envelope, and with the objective of minimizing its stress and subsequent permeability, Torres conceived a trilobed envelope with three longitudinal cables (ropes) placed in the intersection of every two lobes. Inside the envelope, and on the basis of those three cables, a longitudinal frame of triangular cross section was to be completed, made up of non-rigid ropes, permeable fabric curtains, metal cables and longerons. Longitudinal cables and frame would \u2018rigidify\u2019 altogether through the excess of pressure level of the gas, so that, when inflated, it would act as an internal rigid structure. A system known as \"auto-rigid\".[50] By the end of that year the report at Paris's Academy of Science was included in the French journal L\u2019Aerophile, and a summary in English was published in the British The Aeronautical Journal.[51][52]/nIn 1904, Torres was appointed director of the Centre for Aeronautical Research in Madrid, \"for the technical and experimental study of the air navigation problem and the management of remote engine maneuvers\".[53]/nIn 1905, with the help of Alfredo Kindel\u00e1n, he directed the construction of the first Spanish dirigible in the Army Military Aerostatics Service, located in Guadalajara. Once the construction was successfully completed in 1908, the new airship, which received the name of Torres Quevedo, carried out several test flights. As a result, a collaboration began between Torres and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astra led by the French engineer \u00c9douard Surcouf, which managed to buy the patent with a cession of rights extended to all countries except Spain, in order to make possible the construction of the dirigible in its country. So, in 1911, the construction of dirigibles known as the Astra-Torres airships was begun and Torres would receive royalties of 3 francs for every m\u00b3 of each airship sold.[54]/nTo find a resolution to the slew of problems faced by airship engineers in docking dirigibles, Torres also drew up designs for a \u2018docking station\u2019 and made alterations to airship design. In 1910, Torres proposed the idea of attaching an airship's nose to a mooring mast and allowing the airship to weathervane with changes of wind direction. The use of a metal column erected on the ground, the top of which the bow or stem would be directly attached to (by a cable) would allow a dirigible to be moored at any time, in the open, regardless of wind speeds. Additionally, Torres' design called for the improvement and accessibility of temporary landing sites, where airships were to be moored for the purpose of disembarkation of passengers. The final patent was presented in February 1911 in Belgium, and later to France and the United Kingdom in 1912, under the title \"Improvements in Mooring Arrengements for Airships\".[55][56][57]/nIn Issy-les-Moulineaux (south-west of Paris) in February 1911, the trials of \u2018Astra-Torres no.1\u2019 were successful and had a capacity of 1600m\u00b3.  It was faster, more stable and more manoeuvrable than all the systems before it. It won the \u2018Deperdussin\u2019 prize and the French army incorporated it into their operations. In 1913, the handing over of the Astra-Torres XIV (the HMA.No 3 to the Royal Naval Air Service) meant international recognition for the system with this ship beating the world speed record for an airship registering 83.2\u00a0km/h during the reception trials, a speed which reached 124\u00a0km/h with the wind in its favour. Other Astra-Torres dirigibles followed, including the Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier (Astra-Torres XV) named after the aerostier Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier, which at 23,000 m3 was the same size of the German \u2018Zeppelins\u2019 and could reach speeds of around 100\u00a0km/h. The distinctive trilobed design was widely used during the First World War (1914\u20131918) by the Entente powers for diverse tasks, principally convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare.[58][59] This type of envelope was employed in the United Kingdom in the Coastal, C Star, and North Sea airships.[60]/nIn 1919, Torres designed, based on a proposal of the engineer Emilio Herrera Linares, a transatlantic dirigible, which was named Hispania,[61] aiming to claim the honor of the first transatlantic flight for Spain. Owing to financial problems, the project was delayed and it was the Britons John Alcock and Arthur Brown who crossed the Atlantic non-stop from Newfoundland to Ireland in a Vickers Vimy twin-engine plane, in sixteen hours and twelve minutes.[62][63]/nThe success of the trilobed blimps during the war even drew the attention of the Imperial Japanese Navy, who acquired the Nieuport\nAT-2 in 1922, with almost 263\u00a0ft long, maximum diameter 54\u00a0ft and with a hydrogen capacity of 363,950\u00a0ft 3.[64] After Torres' patent expired that year, many airships continued to be built with ideas inherited from this non-rigid design.[65]/nTorres was a pioneer in the field of remote control. He began to develop a new system around 1901 or 1902, as a way of testing his airships without risking human lives. For its device, he chose the name Telekino as a combination of two Greek words: tele which means \"at distance\" and kino which means \"movement\", resulting both together \"movement at distance\", which was what Torres wanted to obtain. Between 1902 and 1903, the invention titled \"Syst\u00e9me dit T\u00e9l\u00e9kine pour commander \u00e0 distance un mouvement m\u00e9canique\" (\"Means or method for directing mechanical movements at or from a distance\") applied for patents in France,[66] Spain,[67] and Great Britain.[68] On 3 August 1903, he presented the Telekino at the Paris Academy of Science, together with a detailed memory and a practical demonstration to its members,[69] For the construction of this initial prototype, Torres received help from Gabriel Koenigs, director of the Mechanics Laboratory of the Sorbonne, and Octave Rochefort, who collaborated by providing wireless telegraphy devices.[70]/nThe Telekino has three different parts: a wireless telegraph receiver, a multi-position rotary switch and two servomotors that can be used to drive a mechanical system. The signal transmitted by electromagnetic waves, is received by the antenna and is transformed into electric pulses by a coherer. Each pulse drives an electromagnet, which closes its secondary circuit causing the multi-position switch unit to go one step forward. This operation is repeated automatically as many times as the number of signal impulses. When the multi-position switch reaches its final position, the battery supplies current to the chosen servomotor terminal. Then, the servomotor is put in motion causing a known and previously defined action. Torres realized that in order to achieve a finite but not limited set of actions based on a binary system as the telegraph was, (with only two states, on and off), it was necessary to create a limited number of codewords through a sequence of binary states. The problem, at that time, was the impossibility of having a synchronisation mechanism able to detect the end of one character and the beginning of the next. In this situation, the only way to solve this difficulty was using an asynchronous synchronisation method based on the change in the telegraph signal state. The final proposal was as simple as using a code based on the number of pulses consecutively sent; so, the action, e.g. number 1, corresponded to one pulse, to two pulses corresponded the action number 2, to three pulses the action number 3 and so on.[71] Torres was able to select different positions for the steering engine and different velocities for the propelling engine independently. He was also able to act over other mechanisms such a light, for switching it or not, and a flag, for raising or dropping it, at the same time. Specifically, Torres was able to do up to 19 different actions with his prototypes.[72]/nFrom 1904 Torres chose to conduct initial Telekino testings, first in an electric three-wheeled land vehicle[73] in the Beti Jai fronton of Madrid, with an effective range of just 20 to 30 meters, which has been considered the first known example of a radio-controlled unmanned ground vehicle (UGV).[69] The Spanish engineer Jos\u00e9 Echegaray described the Telekino as the origin of Torres' automatics. For Echegaray, \"nobody moves\" the Telekino. \"It moves automatically\", it is an automaton of \"a certain intelligence, not conscious, but disciplined\". He defined it as \"a material apparatus, without intelligence, interpreting, as if it were intelligent, the instructions that are communicated to it.\"[74][75] In 1905, Torres tested a second model of the Telekino located in a boat in the pond of the Casa de Campo in Madrid, achieving distances of up to about 250 m. From the terrace of the Club Mar\u00edtimo del Abra, and with the assistance of the president of the Provincial Council and other authorities, an experiment was carried out with the Telekino remotely controlling the maneuvers of the electrically powered launch Vizcaya.[76] On 25 September 1906, in the presence of the king Alfonso XIII and before a great crowd, he successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding the launch Vizcaya from the shore with people on board, demonstrating a standoff range of 2\u00a0km.[77] The positive results of those experiences encouraged Torres to apply to the Spanish government for the financial aid required to use his Telekino to steer submarine torpedoes, a technological field which was just starting out. His application was denied, which caused him to abandon the development of the Telekino.[78]/nIn 1907, Torres introduced a formal language for the description of mechanical drawings, and thus for mechanical devices, in Vienna. He previously published \"Sobre un sistema de notaciones y s\u00edmbolos destinados a facilitar la descripci\u00f3n de las m\u00e1quinas\"  (\"System of notations and symbols intended to facilitate the description of the machines\") in the Revista de Obras P\u00fablicas.[79] According to the Austrian computer pioneer Heinz Zemanek, this was equivalent to a programming language for the numerical control of machine tools.[80] He defined a table of symbols, a collection of rules and, as usual in his works, applied them to an example. This symbolic language reveals Torres' main capacities, both his ability to detect a problem, in this case a social problem of origin and its technical consequences, as well as his capacity for creation \u2013 invention \u2013 to give a rational, properly technical response. As Torres said: \"Babbage and Franz Reuleaux \u2013 and I suppose others as well, although I don't have news of them \u2013 have tried, without any success, to put remedy to this inconvenience; but although these eminent authors have failed, should not be a sufficient reason to abandon such an important effort\".[81]/nAs a member of the steering  committee of the Board for Expansion of Studies and Scientific Research\u00a0[es] (Junta para Ampliaci\u00f3n de Estudios e Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas) established in 1907 to promote research and scientific education in Spain,[82] Torres played a leading and decisive role in the creation of three keys state agencies to understand the impulse that institution gave to experimentation, both in the field of education and in research, regardless of the discipline: the Laboratory of Automation (1907) \u2014 of which he was named director,[83] the construction of instruments \u2013  the Laboratories Association (1910) \u2013 the union of state laboratories and workshops \u2013 and the Institute of Science Materials (1911)  \u2013 the budget allocation. He not only built his own inventions, but also provided services and support to universities and researchers of the Board. The Laboratory of Automation produced the most varied instruments, such as the spectrographic equipment of \u00c1ngel del Campo\u00a0[es] and Miguel A. Catal\u00e1n, the interferometer of Manuel Mart\u00ednez Risco\u00a0[es], the stalagmometer of Juan Negr\u00edn, the microtome of Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal and the X-ray spectrometer of Blas Cabrera, among others.[84][85]/nIn early 1910, Torres began to construct a chess automaton he dubbed El Ajedrecista (The Chess Player). As opposed to The Turk and Ajeeb, El Ajedrecista had a true integrated automation and could automatically play a king and rook endgame against the king from any position, without any human intervention[86]/nThe pieces had a metallic mesh at their base, which closed an electric circuit that encoded their position in the board. When the black king was moved by hand, an algorithm calculated and performed the next best move for the white player.[87] The automaton does not deliver checkmate in the minimum number of moves, nor always within the 50 moves allotted by the fifty-move rule, because of the simple algorithm that calculates the moves. It did, however, checkmate the opponent every time.[88] \nIf an illegal move was made by the opposite player, the automaton would signal it by turning on a light. If the opposing player made three illegal moves, the automaton would stop playing. The device has been considered the first computer game in history.[89]/nIt created great excitement when it made its debut, at the University of Paris in 1914.[90] Its internal construction was published by H. Vigneron in the French magazine La Nature.[91][92] It was widely mentioned in a Scientific American supplement as \"Torres and His Remarkable Automatic Devices. He Would Substitute Machinery for the Human Mind\", on November 6, 1915.[93][94]/nAn example game where White checkmates the black King, following Torres' algorithm. Recorded in Portable Game Notation:/nA second version was constructed under the supervision of his son Gonzalo, and was presented in Paris in 1922. It was more elegant and technically perfected. The mechanical arms to move pieces were replaced for electromagnets located under the board.[95] It also included a sound effect, with a voice recording announcing checkmate when the computer won the game.[96]/nThe advanced machine was introduced to a greater audience at the 1951 Paris Cybernetic Congress and explained to Norbert Wiener.[97] El Ajedrecista also defeated Savielly Tartakower at the Congress, being the first Grandmaster to lose against a machine.[98] Heinz Zemanek played against this chess machine at the Brussels World Fair in 1958, described it as \"a historical witness of automaton artistry that was far ahead of its time\". According to Zemanek, Torres designed a very clever six-part algorithm for the end game, which was implemented using levers, gears, and relays.[99]/nIt has been commonly assumed (see Metropolis and Worlton 1980) that Charles Babbage\u2019s work on a mechanical digital program-controlled computer, which he started in 1835 and pursued off and on until his death in 1871, had been completely forgotten and was only belatedly recognized as a forerunner to the modern digital computer. Ludgate, Torres y Quevedo, and Bush give the lie to this belief, and all made fascinating contributions that deserve to be better known./nIn 1914, Torres published his most outstanding work, \"Ensayos sobre Autom\u00e1tica. Su definici\u00f3n. Extensi\u00f3n te\u00f3rica de sus aplicaciones\" (\"Essays on Automatics. Its Definition \u2013 Theoretical Extent of Its Applications\"), in which he took up the subject of what he called Automatics, \"another type of automaton of great interest: those that imitate, not the simple gestures, but the thoughtful actions of a man, and which can sometimes replace him\". Torres drew a distinction between the simpler sort of automaton, which has invariable mechanical relationships and the more complicated, interesting kind, whose relationships between operating parts alter \"suddenly when necessary circumstances arise\". Such an automaton must have sense organs, that is, \"thermometers, magnetic compasses, dynamometers, manometers\", and limbs, as Torres called them, mechanisms capable of executing the instructions that would come from the sense organs. The automaton postulated by Torres would be able to make decisions so long as \"the rules the automaton must follow are known precisely\".[101][102]/nThe paper provides the main link between Torres and Babbage. He gives a brief history of Babbage's efforts at constructing a mechanical Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. He described the Analytical Engine as exemplifying his theories as to the potential power of machines, and takes the problem of designing such an engine as a challenge to his skills as an inventor of electromechanical devices. The paper contains a complete design (albeit one that Torres regarded as theoretical rather than practical) for a machine capable of calculating completely automatically the value of the formula \n\n\n\n\na\n\nx\n\n\n(\ny\n\u2212\nz\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{x}(y-z)^{2}}\n\n, for a sequence of sets of values of the variables involved. It demonstrates cunning electromechanical gadgets for storing decimal digits, for performing arithmetic operations using built-in function tables, and for comparing the values of two quantities. The whole machine was to be controlled from a read-only program (complete with provisions for conditional branching), represented by a pattern of conducting areas mounted around the surface of a rotating cylinder.[100]/nThe paper also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic, which historian Randell says was described \"almost casually\",[100] apparently without recognizing the significance of the discovery. He did it the way following:/n\"Very large numbers are as embarrassing in mechanical calculations as in usual calculations (Babbage planned 50 wheels to represent each variable, and even then they would not be sufficient if one does not have recourse to the means that I will indicate later, or to another analogue). In these, they are usually avoided by representing each quantity by a small number of significant figures (six to eight at the most, except in exceptional cases) and by indicating by a comma or zeros, if necessary, the order of magnitude of the units represented by each digit./nSometimes also, so as not to have to write a lot of zeros, we write the quantities in the form n x 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ^{m}}\n\n./nWe could greatly simplify this writing by arbitrarily establishing these three simple rules:/nI. n will always have the same number of digits (six for example)./nII. The first digit of n will be of order of tenths, the second of hundredths, etc./nIII. One will write each quantity in the form: n; m./nThus, instead of 2435.27 and 0.00000341682, they will be respectively, 243527\u00a0; 4 and 341862\u00a0; \u22125./nI have not indicated a limit for the value of the exponent, but it is obvious that, in all the usual calculations, it will be less than one hundred, so that, in this system, one will write all the quantities which intervene in calculations with eight or ten digits only.\"[103][104] The format that Torres proposed shows the need for a fixed-sized significand as is presently used for floating-point data.[105]/nThe paper ends with a comparison of the advantages of electromechanical devices that were all that were available to Babbage. It establishes that Torres would have been quite capable of building a general-purpose electromechanical computer more than 20 years ahead of its time, had the practical need, motivation, and financing been present.[106]/nTorres went ahead to prove his theories with a series of working prototypes. He demonstrated twice, in 1914 and in 1920, that all of the cogwheel mechanisms of a calculating machine like that of Babbage could be implemented using electromechanical parts. His 1914 analytical machine used a small memory built with electromagnets, capable of evaluating p \u00d7 q \u2013 b.[100]/nIn 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, he presented  at a Paris conference the \"Arithmom\u00e8tre Electrom\u00e9chanique\" (\"Electromechanical Arithmometer\"), which consisted of an arithmetic unit connected to a (possibly remote) typewriter, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically[100] (e.g. \"532 \u00d7 257\" and \"= \" from the typewriter). This calculator was not programmable, but was able to print the numerical value of the answer.[107] From the user interface point of view, this machine can be regarded as the predecessor of current computers that use a keyboard as an input interface. In terms of usage, remote calculation by extension of electric wires is also assumed,[108] and it is considered to be a rudimentary system such as the current online system that uses communication lines. Torres had no thought of making such a machine commercially, viewing it instead as a means of demonstrating his ideas and techniques.[109] Furthermore, in a 1920 paper on electromechanical arithmometers,[110] he pointed out the need to represent continuous numbers as finite discrete values for processing and judgment in several automatic machines,[111] which corresponds to current digital processing./nIn addition to the aforementioned inventions, Torres patented, among others, the \"Coordinate Indicator\" (1901) for guiding people for cities by a mechanical system of signals, which he proposed for Madrid and Paris under the name of \"Guide Torres\",[112][113] the \"Dianemologo\" (1907), a machine to copy, without the need to resort to shorthand, any speech to as it is pronounced,[114] \"Deformable Fusiform Balloons\" (1914),[115]  and \"Railway Interlocks T.Q.\" (1918), an interlock of his own design to protect the movement of trains within a certain area.[116][117]/nOn 30 July 1913, he designed the \"Buque-Campamento\" (\"Camp-Vessel\"),[118] a dirigible balloon carrier with a mooring mast and a hold large enough to house up to two inflated units, and hydrogen cylinders. Torres had thought of the possibility of combining aeronautics with the navy in this way, offering his patent to Vickers Limited, although the latter did not show any interest in the project.[119] In 1916 Torres patented in Spain a new type of catamaran which was conceived as a steel multihull vessel, receiving the name of \"Binave\" (Twin Ship).[120] He applied for the patent in the United Kingdom with the title \"Improvements in Ships\" in 1917,[121] and it was built in Bilbao in 1918, where it carried out its first tests. He introduced important innovations in this design, such as two 30 HP Hispano-Suiza marine engines, or the ability to modify its configuration when sailing, positioning two rudders at the stern of each float, and placing the propellers aft too.[122][123]/nIn the last years of his life, Torres turned his attention to the field of educational disciplines, to investigate those elements or machines that could help educators in their task. From 1922 to 1930 he patented improvements on typewriters,[124] marginal pagination of manuals,[125] and, especially, the \"Puntero Proyectable\" (\"Projectable Pointer\"),[126] and the \"Proyector Did\u00e1ctico\" (\"Didactic Projector\").[127] The Projectable Pointer was based on the shadow produced by an opaque body that moves close to the projected plate, being this shadow used as a pointer. To do this, he designed an articulated system that allowed the speaker to move a point or points next to the projection plate, at will, which made it possible to mark the areas of interest on the transparency.[128] The Didactic Projector improved the way slides were placed on glass plates for projection.[129]/nIn 1910 Torres traveled to Argentina[130] with the Infanta Isabel to assist at the International Scientific Congress held in Buenos Aires, one of the events organized to mark the centenary of the independence of Argentina. He presented the project entitled \"Uni\u00f3n Internacional Hispano\u2013Americana de Bibliograf\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda Cient\u00edfica\", to clarify, enhance, unify, and enrich the Spanish technical language. The first task was the publication of a technological dictionary of the Spanish language in order to tackle the problems caused by the increasing use of scientific and technological neologisms, as well as the adaptation of words from other languages, confronted with the avalanche of foreign terms.[131] In 1930 appeared the Volume 1 of the Diccionario Tecnol\u00f3gico Hispanoamericano.[132][133]/nIn the early 1900s, Torres learned the international language Esperanto, and was an advocate of the language throughout his life. From 1922 to 1926, he participated in the work of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations,[134] proposing the following motion on the first day of the meeting: \"The Committee, convinced of the usefulness of an artificial auxiliary language to facilitate scientific relations between different peoples, establishes a subcommittee in charge of studying , with the help of experts, the various solutions that have been proposed\". Although almost half of the Committee members were in favor of Esperanto, the motion met with determined opposition from some other participants. In 1925 Torres participated as the official representative of the Spanish government in the \"Conference on the Use of Esperanto in Pure and Applied Sciences\" held in Paris, together with Vicente Inglada Ors\u00a0[es] and Emilio Herrera Linares. That same year, he joined to the Honorary Committee of the Spanish Association of Esperanto\u00a0[es] (HEA), founded by Julio Mangada.[135][136]/nFrom the work he carried out in these years, Torres entered the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences of Madrid in 1901, of which entity he was president between 1928 and 1934. In 1910 he became a corresponding member of the Argentine Scientific Society\u00a0[es]. In 1916 King Alfonso XIII of Spain bestowed the Echegaray Medal upon him;[137] and in 1918, he declined the offer of the position of Minister of Development. In 1920, he was admitted to the Royal Spanish Academy, to fill the seat vacated by the death of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s, declaring modestly in his speech: \"You were wrong in choosing me as I do not have that minimum culture required of an academic. I will always be a stranger in your wise and learned society. I come from very remote lands. I have not cultivated literature, nor art, nor philosophy, nor even science, at least in its higher degrees\u2026 My work is much more modest. I spend my busy life solving practical mechanics problems.

His patron was Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and Scot served as science adviser and court astrologer to him. Scot translated Averroes and was the greatest public intellectual of his day.[1]/nScot was born somewhere in the border regions of Scotland. He studied first at the cathedral school of Durham and then at Oxford and Paris, devoting himself to philosophy, mathematics, and astrology. It appears that he had also studied theology and become an ordained priest, as Pope Honorius III wrote to Stephen Langton on 16 January 1223/4, urging him to confer an English benefice on Scot, and nominated Scot as archbishop of Cashel in Ireland.[2] Scot declined this appointment, but he seems to have held benefices in Italy./nFrom Paris, Scot went to Bologna, and then after a stay at Palermo, to Toledo. There he learnt Arabic well enough to study the Arabic versions of Aristotle and the many commentaries of the Arabs upon these. In addition, he studied the original works of Avicenna and Averroes, and translated them into Latin.[2]/nScot was a typical example of the polyglot wandering scholar of the Middle Ages\u2014a churchman who knew Latin, Greek, Arabic and Hebrew. When he was about 50, Frederick II attracted him to his court in the Kingdom of Sicily. At the instigation of the emperor, Scot supervised (along with Hermannus Alemannus) a fresh translation of Aristotle and the Arabian commentaries from Arabic into Latin. Translations by Scot survive of the Historia animalium, De anima, and De caelo, along with the commentaries of Averroes upon them./nThe second version of Fibonacci's famous book on mathematics, Liber Abaci, was dedicated to Scot in 1227. It has been suggested that Scot played a part in Fibonacci's presentation of the Fibonacci sequence.[3] A recent study of a passage written by Michael Scot on multiple rainbows, a phenomenon understood only by modern physics and recent observations, suggests that Michael Scot may have had contact with the Tuareg people in the Sahara desert.[4]/nIn a letter of 1227, recorded by Scot in his Liber particularis, Emperor Frederick questioned him concerning the foundations of the earth, the geography and rulership of the heavens, what is beyond the last heaven, in which heaven God sits, and the precise locations of hell, purgatory and heavenly paradise. He also asked about the soul; and about volcanoes, rivers, and seas. According to the chronicler Fra Salimbene, Frederick attempted to catch Scot out in his calculations of the distance to heaven by scaling from the height of a church tower (by having it secretly lowered). Scot replied by saying that either the moon had gotten further away or the tower had gotten shorter.[nb 1]/nScot was a pioneer in the study of physiognomy.[5] His manuscripts dealt with astrology, alchemy and the occult sciences generally, and account for his popular reputation./nThese works include:/nThe Liber physiognomiae (which also exists in an Italian translation) and the Super auctorem spherae expressly state that the author undertook the works at the request of the Emperor Frederick II./n\"Every astrologer is worthy of praise and honour,\" Scot wrote, \"since by such a doctrine as astrology he probably knows many secrets of God, and things which few know.\"/nHe was offered in 1223 the role of being the Archbishop of Cashel in Ireland by Pope Honorius III;[2] then that of Canterbury in 1227 by Pope Gregory IX./nSome sources report that Emperor Frederick used scholars like Michael Scot as messengers to Arab rulers like Al-Kamil \nfor diplomatic and scholarly exchanges because of his knowledge of Arabic, and, that he even brought Michael Scot to the Holy Land during the Sixth Crusade in 1228-29.[8][9]/nThe date of Scot's death remains uncertain. The efforts of Walter Scott and others to identify him with the Sir Michael Scot of Balwearie, sent in 1290 on a special embassy to Norway, have not convinced historians; though the two may have had family connections./nA legend popular in the late 13th and early 14th centuries said that Scot foresaw that a small stone would strike him in the head and kill him, so he wore an iron skullcap to avoid his death. However, he removed the cap in church, only to be struck by a stone and die.[10]/nThe legendary Michael Scot used to feast his friends with dishes brought by spirits from the royal kitchens of France and Spain and other lands./nHe is said to have turned to stone a coven of witches, which have become the stone circle of Long Meg and Her Daughters in Cumbria./nScot's reputation as a magician had already become fixed in the age immediately following his own. He appears in Dante's Divine Comedy, the only Scot to do so,[11] in the fourth bolgia located in the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for sorcerers, astrologers, and false prophets who claimed they could see the future when they, in fact, could not.[12] He is described by Dante as being \"spare in the flank\" (ne' fianchi \u00e8 cosi poco).[13] While some argue that this is the \"sole extant description of his physical appearance\",[14] others contend that the description is more poetic. Richard Kay argues that because \"the shades in the Dantesque afterworld create surrogate aerial bodies for themselves that are a projection of [their] soul[s]\", this description is in reference to \"some internal character trait to which [Dante] wished to draw our attention.\"[15] Kay argues that Dante was referencing a physiognomic description taken from Scot's own Liber physiognomiae \u2013 namely, that thin and small ribs signify an individual \"who is weak, who does little labour, who is sagacious, [and] bad\" (the original Latin, found in chapter 88 of the Liber physiognomiae, reads: Cuius costae sunt subtiles et paruae [\u2026] significat hominem debilem, pauci laboris, sagacem [et] malum).[16]/nScot also had a particular reputation for his ability to predict the future.

Ekeland has written influential monographs and textbooks on nonlinear functional analysis, the calculus of variations, and mathematical economics, as well as popular books on mathematics, which have been published in French, English, and other languages. Ekeland is known as the author of Ekeland's variational principle and for his use of the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma in optimization theory.

He is also a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[5]/nEkeland has written several books on popular science, in which he has explained parts of dynamical\u00a0systems,  chaos\u00a0theory, and probability\u00a0theory.[1][7][8] These books were first written in French and then translated into English and other languages, where they received praise for their mathematical accuracy as well as their value as literature and as entertainment.[1]/nThrough these writings, Ekeland had an influence on  Jurassic Park, on both the novel and film. Ekeland's Mathematics and the unexpected and James Gleick's Chaos inspired the discussions of chaos\u00a0theory in the novel Jurassic\u00a0Park by Michael\u00a0Crichton.[3] When the novel was adapted for the film Jurassic Park by Steven\u00a0Spielberg, Ekeland and Gleick were consulted by the actor Jeff\u00a0Goldblum as he prepared to play the  mathematician specializing in chaos\u00a0theory.[6]/nEkeland has contributed to mathematical analysis, particularly to variational calculus and mathematical optimization./nIn mathematical analysis, Ekeland's variational principle, discovered by Ivar Ekeland,[9][10][11] is a theorem that asserts that there exists a nearly optimal solution to a class of optimization problems.[12]/nEkeland's variational principle can be used when the lower level set of a minimization problem is not compact, so that the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem can not be applied. Ekeland's principle relies on the completeness of the metric space.[13]/nEkeland's principle leads to a quick proof of the Caristi fixed point theorem.[13][14]/nEkeland was associated with the University of Paris when he proposed this theorem.[9]/nIvar Ekeland is an expert on variational analysis, which studies mathematical optimization of spaces of functions. His research on periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems and particularly to the theory of Kre\u012dn indices for linear systems (Floquet theory) was described in his monograph.[4]/nEkeland explained the success of methods of convex minimization on large problems that appeared to be non-convex.  In many optimization problems, the objective function\u00a0f are separable, that is, the sum of many summand-functions each with its own argument:/nFor example, problems of linear optimization are separable. For a separable problem, we consider an optimal solution/nwith the minimum value\u00a0f(xmin).  For a separable problem, we consider an optimal solution  (xmin,\u00a0f(xmin))\nto the \"convexified problem\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of  the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the limit of a sequence of points in the convexified problem/nThis analysis was published by Ivar Ekeland in\u00a01974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands, despite the non-convexity of the summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician Claude Lemar\u00e9chal was surprised by his success with convex minimization methods on problems that were known to be non-convex.[17][15][18] Ekeland's analysis explained the success of methods of convex\u00a0minimization on large and separable problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions.[15][18][19] The  Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions.[15][20][21][22]", "47662943": "John West (1756-1817) was a mathematician and priest from Scotland./nFourth child of Samuel West and Margaret Mein, his father died in 1766.

An early employee of the U.S. Army's Signal Intelligence Service, he held several leadership positions during World War II, transitioning to the new National Security Agency after the war, where he became a deputy director. After retiring in 1962, he taught mathematics at Arizona State University./nSinkov was the son of Jewish immigrants Morris (Mordechai Eliezer) and Ethel (n\u00e9e Etel Constantinowsky)[1] from Alexandria, Russia, which is now Oleksandriya, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine.[2] Sinkov was born in Philadelphia, but grew up in Brooklyn. After graduating from Boys High School he took his B.S. in mathematics from City College of New York. (By coincidence, one of his close friends at Boys High and CCNY was Solomon Kullback). Mr. Sinkov taught in New York City schools but was unhappy with the working conditions and anxious to use his mathematics knowledge in practical ways./nThe opportunity for a career change came in 1930. Sinkov and Kullback took the Civil Service examination and placed high. Both received mysterious letters from Washington asking about their knowledge of foreign languages. Sinkov knew French and Kullback, Spanish. This was acceptable to their prospective employer, and they were offered positions as junior cryptanalysts. Although neither was quite certain what a cryptanalyst did, they accepted./nThe small Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) organization (Sinkov and Kullback were the third and fourth employees there) had the primary mission of compiling codes and ciphers for use by the U.S. Army. Its secondary task was to attempt to solve selected foreign codes and ciphers\u2014this was not necessarily done for intelligence purposes but to keep the cryptanalysts abreast of new developments in the field./nWilliam Friedman put his new employees through a rigorous course of study of his own design in cryptology, bringing them to high levels of skill in making and breaking codes and ciphers. Friedman also encouraged other self-improvement endeavors: his employees trained summers at a camp at Ft. Meade to earn commissions in the military reserves. Both Sinkov and Kullback also went on to receive doctorates in mathematics. Sinkov received his PhD in mathematics in 1933 from The George Washington University. In 1936, Sinkov was assigned to the Panama Canal Zone, where he established the U.S. Army's first permanent intercept site outside the continental United States./nSIS grew slowly throughout the early 1930s. However, successes against Japanese diplomatic codes using machine systems after 1935 provided the U.S. government with critical information during a series of crises. This success had practical consequences for SIS, as well. For the first time, SIS began to garner respect from its military superiors. Once the military understood that this small organization could read sensitive messages from a potential adversary, the Signal Corps increased the SIS budget and authorized increased hiring of cryptanalysts./nIn 1940, even though the United States was not officially a combatant, the U.S. and Britain initiated exchanges of technical material. Included in this was a cautious sharing of cryptologic information: the British in stages revealed the extent of their considerable success against high-level German systems, the U.S. its equivalent success against Japanese. This led to an unprecedented level of cooperation in communication intelligence (COMINT) between the two countries during the war, resulting in more personnel, bigger budgets, and a wider range of activities for the organization./nIn January 1941, while Britain battled Nazi Germany but nearly a year before the United States entered the Second World War, Captain Sinkov was selected as a member of a delegation to the United Kingdom for initial sharing of information about the two countries' respective cryptologic programs. The delegation returned in April with mixed results to report. Sinkov and his colleagues had been shown Bletchley Park, the secret headquarters for British cryptology, and exchanged information on German and Japanese systems. It is still unclear how much the American delegation was told about British success against the German Enigma machine, but Sinkov later recalled that they were told about the Enigma problem only a short while before the delegation was to leave, and that details were sketchy. Nevertheless, the mission to the UK was a success overall and helped give US-UK cryptologic relations a strong practical foundation.[3][4]/nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese also attacked the Philippine Islands. General Douglas MacArthur had been ordered to leave the Philippines and re-establish U.S. Army headquarters in Australia, from whence counterattacks might be launched. MacArthur recognized the need for cryptologic support, thus, on 15 April 1942, he established the Central Bureau (CB), cobbling it together from refugee elements of American cryptologists evacuated from the Philippines, Australian cryptologists, and other Allied contingents. CB began in Melbourne, then moved to Brisbane./nIn July 1942, by now Major Sinkov arrived in Melbourne as commander of the American detachment at Central Bureau. The Director of CB on paper was General Spencer B. Akin, MacArthur's chief signal officer, but General Akin in practice seldom visited the organization. He had worked with Sinkov in Washington and in Panama, and confidently left CB operations under his control./nSinkov, who demonstrated strong organizational and leadership qualities in addition to his mathematics skills, brought this group of Americans and Australians\u2014representing also different military services from their countries\u2014into a cohesive unit. CB quickly became a trusted producer of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) for MacArthur and his senior commanders. This SIGINT enabled consistent success in the air war against the Japanese and allowed MacArthur to win some stunning victories in the ground campaign in New Guinea and the Philippines./nAfter the war, Sinkov rejoined SIS, now renamed the Army Security Agency, and, in 1949, when the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA)\u2014the first centralized cryptologic organization in the United States\u2014was formed, Sinkov became chief of the Communications Security program. He remained in this position as AFSA made the transition into the National Security Agency./nIn 1954, Sinkov became the second NSA official to attend the National War College (the first was Louis Tordella). Upon his return, he became deputy director for production, effectively swapping jobs with his old colleague Frank Rowlett. Sinkov retired from NSA in 1962./nIn 1966, he wrote Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Mathematical Approach, one of the first books on the subject, directed at high school students and available to the general public./nAbraham Sinkov lived in retirement in Arizona after two careers, 32 years in NSA (and its predecessors), followed by an appointment as a professor of mathematics at Arizona State University./nColonel Sinkov is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.", "70436714": "Claude Guillermet de B\u00e9rigard (15 August 1578, Moulins \u2013 23 April 1663, Padua), also known by the Latin form of his name Claudius Berigardus, was a French philosopher, physician and mathematician who became professor of philosophy at Pisa and Padua.[1] He was a vocal opponent of the theories of Galileo.

This result, now known as Strassen's invariance principle or as Strassen's law of the iterated logarithm, has been highly cited and led to a 1966 presentation at the International Congress of Mathematicians./nIn 1969, Strassen shifted his research efforts towards the analysis of algorithms with a paper on Gaussian elimination, introducing Strassen's algorithm, the first algorithm for performing matrix multiplication faster than the O(n3) time bound that would result from a naive algorithm.  In the same paper he also presented an asymptotically fast algorithm to perform matrix inversion, based on the fast matrix multiplication algorithm. This result was an important theoretical breakthrough, leading to much additional research on fast matrix multiplication, and despite later theoretical improvements it remains a practical method for multiplication of dense matrices of moderate to large sizes. In 1971 Strassen published another paper together with Arnold Sch\u00f6nhage on asymptotically fast integer multiplication based on the fast Fourier transform; see the Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm. Strassen is also known for his 1977 work with Robert M.

He completed his work on the application of quaternions to quantum field theory in 1950. After spending the period from 1950 to 1951 in postdoctoral research at Cambridge University, he worked as an assistant at Istanbul University, where he married Suha Pamir, also a physics assistant, in 1952, and in 1953 he acquired the title of associate professor./nDuring 1957\u20131961 he worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Columbia University.

He will always be remembered for his many seminal and deep contributions to theoretical physics as well as for his kindness, civility and scholarship. For those of us who knew him he epitomized a style of physics and an epoch in the history of physics./nFeza's scientific work is marked with remarkable originality and elegance as well as intellectual courage. He never hesitated to pick problems that were not fashionable. He worked at them in depth, planting seeds that in some cases developed into whole branches of our discipline. Outstanding examples would include his conception of the pion in terms of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, and his contributions to the introduction of exceptional gauge groups for grand unification. To the end of his life he was tackling the most difficult problems, planting new seeds in unknown soil./nIn the early part of his career, G\u00fcrsey studied the conformal group and conformally invariant quantum field theories, concepts whose role in physics are now central. This developed into his long and multifaceted interest in the unitary representations of non-compact groups and their applications to space-time. In the late fifties he did his work on Pauli-G\u00fcrsey transformations and later introduced the non-linear chiral Lagrangian, one of his most seminal contributions to theoretical physics. Chiral symmetry and non-linear realizations of symmetry groups have since become an integral part of theoretical physics. In the 1960s, Feza became well known for his work on the SU(6) symmetry that combines the unitary spin SU(3) of the eightfold way with non-relativistic spin degrees of freedom of quarks. Subsequent attempts to understand the origin of SU(6) symmetry led to the introduction of the color degrees of freedom of quarks. Feza's introduction in the mid-1970s of the grand unified theory based on the exceptional group E6 -which has continued to fascinate theoretical physicists ever since- was one facet of his long interest in the possible role of quaternions and octonions in physics. This interest also led to Feza's work on quaternion analyticity, which continued practically to the end of his life./nFeza was an exceptionally inspiring teacher. He trained many Ph.D students who now hold academic positions in numerous countries of the world. Throughout his life he retained a youthful spirit and was always enthusiastic about learning new things. He had a special rapport with the young people and enjoyed their company./nReminiscing only about Feza G\u00fcrsey the physicist would not do full justice to him. He was a very cultured man who distilled the essential and sublime elements of Western and Turkish cultures and synthesized them into a singularly unique whole in his personality and wisdom. One could have deep and penetrating discussions with him on the music of Franz Schubert and Dede Efendi, on the poetry of Yunus Emre and Goethe, on the novels of Thomas Mann and Marcel Proust, on the paintings of Van Gogh and Giotto, in short, on essentially any subject of depth and beauty./nThe G\u00fcrsey Memorial Conferences that are to be held biannually are hopefully a fitting way to pay tribute to his memory. We hope that these will be conferences that G\u00fcrsey himself would have enjoyed! His memory will always be with those of us who were his friends and colleagues./nThe Feza G\u00fcrsey Institute in Istanbul and Feza G\u00fcrsey Science Center in Ankara are named in his honor.

centrifuge brought by Abdul Qadeer Khan for analysis, which he later identified as incorrect and incomplete to the PAEC.:\u200a146\u2013146\u200a[3] During this time, he held discussion with Abdul Qadeer Khan on copper metallurgy which was nascent to his development of centrifuge at the Airport Development Works facility.:\u200a146\u200a[3] Meanwhile, Alam accepted and joined the faculty of mathematics at the Quaid-e-Azam University and met with Tasneem Shah, an Oxford University PhD graduate in mathematics, degelating Shah to join the centrifuge program.:\u200a56\u201357\u200a[11] Alam

She is known for her contributions to mathematical modeling of the shape of the Earth, and her work on the development of satellite geodesy models, that were later incorporated into the Global Positioning System (GPS).[2] West was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018. West was awarded the Webby Lifetime Achievement Award for the development of satellite geodesy models.[3][4]/nGladys Mae Brown was born in Sutherland, Virginia, in Dinwiddie County, a rural county south of Richmond.[2][5][6] Her family was an African-American farming family in a community of sharecroppers. She spent much of her childhood working on her family's small farm.[7][8] As well as working on the farm, her mother worked in a tobacco factory and her father worked for the railroad.[6][9] West saw education as her way to a different life.[10]/nAt West's high school, the top two students from each graduating class received full scholarships to Virginia State College (now formally University), a historically black public university.[7] West graduated as valedictorian in 1948, and received the scholarship.[6][10] At VSU,  West chose to study mathematics, a subject that was mostly studied at her college by men.[7] She also joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.[2] West graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics,[6] and then taught math and science for two years in Waverly, Virginia.[6] West returned to VSU to complete a Master of Mathematics degree, graduating in 1955.[10][6] Afterward, she began another teaching position in Martinsville, Virginia.[6]/nIn 1956, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, (now the Naval Surface Warfare Center). Here, she was the second black woman ever hired and one of only four black employees.[7][5][2] West was a computer programmer in the Dahlgren division, and a project manager for processing systems for satellite data analysis.[12] Concurrently, West earned a Master's degree in Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma.[6]/nIn the early 1960s, West participated in an award-winning study that proved the regularity of Pluto\u2019s motion relative to Neptune.[13] Subsequently, West began to analyze satellite altimeter data from NASA's Geodetic Earth Orbiting program, to create models of the Earth's shape. She became project manager for the Seasat radar altimetry project, the first satellite that could remotely sense oceans.[14][15] West's work cut her team's processing time in half, and she was recommended for a commendation.[16]/nFrom the mid-1970s through the 1980s, West programmed an IBM 7030 Stretch computer to deliver increasingly precise calculations for the shape of the Earth; an ellipsoid with additional undulations known as the geoid.[8] To generate an accurate geopotential model West needed to use complex algorithms to account for variations in the gravitational, tidal, and other forces that distort Earth's shape.[9] West's model ultimately became the basis for the Global Positioning System (GPS).[13]/nIn 1986, West published Data Processing System Specifications for the Geosat Satellite Radar Altimeter, a 51-page technical report from The Naval Surface Weapons Center (NSWC). This explained how to improve the accuracy of geoid heights and vertical deflection, important components of satellite geodesy.[2] This was achieved by processing data from the radio altimeter on the Geosat satellite, which went into orbit on March 12, 1984.[11]/nWest worked at Dahlgren for 42 years, and retired in 1998.[7] She later completed a PhD in Public Administration at Virginia Tech by distance-learning.[13][17]/nWest's vital contributions to GPS technology were recognised when a member of her sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha read a short biography West had submitted for an alumni function.[2]/nWest was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018, one of the highest honors bestowed by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC).[18][13] The AFSPC press release hailed her as one of \"the 'Hidden Figures' part of the team who did computing for the US military in the era before electronic systems\", a reference to the 2016 book by Margot Lee Shetterly, which was adapted into the film Hidden Figures.[19] Capt. Godfrey Weekes, commanding officer at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, described the role played by West in the development of Global Positioning System: \"She rose through the ranks, worked on the satellite geodesy, and contributed to the accuracy of GPS and the measurement of satellite data. As Gladys West started her career ... in 1956, she likely had no idea that her work would impact the world for decades to come.\"[20] West agreed, saying \"When you\u2019re working every day, you\u2019re not thinking, 'What impact is this going to have on the world?'

They were two of only four black employees at the time.[2] They were married in 1957.[7][5] They have three children (Carolyn, David and Michael), and seven grandchildren.[2] The West family went to Chapel on the Proving Ground every Sunday.[9] As of February 2018[update], West lives in King George County, Virginia.[2]/nBefore being hired, West initially turned down the job due to its location and the requirement to interview. West did not have a car and could not find Dahlgren on a map, and she believed that they would reject her after the interview because of her race, so she decided to wait to hear back from other applications.  However, Dahlgren contacted her again, offering her the job without the need to interview. The job offered twice the salary of her teaching position. Being hired solely on her qualifications, with a salary that would eventually help her support her family, was a rare find for a black woman at that time./nIn 1954, the Supreme Court had made a landmark decision on Brown vs. Board of Education, ruling that American state laws that established racial segregation in public schools were unconstitutional. However, Virginia was still segregated since the Supreme Court had not specified which states were required to reestablish in accordance to the new ruling. Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan were still at large, and the prospect of moving to a rural neighborhood in a southern state was daunting for an unmarried black woman./nThe Civil Rights movement was fully underway during her time at the base. Though she supported the movement, she could not participate in protests because she was a government employee. In Boomtown, where married people lived on base, she was part of a club of black women who discussed civil rights topics.[24]:\u200a91\u201392/nDuring her career, West encountered many hardships because of racism against African Americans.

He graduated in 1859 from Moscow University, where he majored in mathematics and physics./nBugaev then studied engineering and then wrote a master's thesis in 1863 on the convergence of infinite series.  This document was considered sufficiently impressive to win him a place studying under Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer in Berlin. He also spent some time in Paris studying under Joseph Liouville. He earned his doctoral degree in 1866./nAfter his doctoral degree, Bugaev returned to Moscow and taught there for the remainder of his career. Some of his most influential papers offered proofs of previously unproven assertions of Liouville, but his most original work centered around the development of formal analogies between arithmetic and analytic operations./nBugaev was an active member and president (1891-1903) of the Moscow Mathematical Society. He also wrote influential philosophical essays in which he trumpeted the virtues of mathematical analysis and decried the influence of geometry and probability.  Many[who?] feel he is largely responsible for the pronounced predilection towards \"hard analysis\" which is characteristic of so much of the best Russian mathematics. Through Bugaev's star student, Dmitri Egorov, many famous Russian mathematicians, such as Andrei Kolmogorov and Nikolai Luzin, directly \"descend\" from Bugaev\u2014and thus from the Prince of Mathematicians, Carl Friedrich Gauss./nBugaev was a talented chess player. He defeated William Steinitz in 1896 in a Simul./nBugaev was a memorable \"character\" whose life was touched by scandal.  He was not, it is said, much admired for his looks, but his wife was considered brilliant, beautiful, and rich, and the Bugaevs were socially prominent. Their mathematically, musically, and artistically talented son, Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev (14 October 1880 O.S.-8 January 1934), went on to adopt the pseudonym Andrei Bely, under which name he helped found the Symbolist movement. Professor Korobkin, the main character of Bely's innovative novel Moscow, was inspired by Nikolai Bugaev. In view of his father's prejudices, Boris Bugaev was fascinated by probability and particularly by the notion of entropy, which is mentioned in several of his novels and poems.", "3229591": "S\u00e1muel Mikoviny (Hungarian: Mikoviny S\u00e1muel, Slovak: Samuel Mikov\u00edni\u00a0? \u2013 23 March 1750) was a mathematician, engineer, cartographer, and professor. He was a leading representative of science and technology in the 18th century Kingdom of Hungary and Habsburg monarchy./nThe family lived scattered throughout the territory of present-day Slovakia, some members have moved also other areas of the contemporary Kingdom of Hungary. His father, a poor lower nobleman Samuel Micovini, originated from the most numerous branch from Brezn\u00f3b\u00e1nya (today Brezno, Slovakia).[1] He worked in several ethnic Slovak villages, firstly as a teacher in Uhorszka (today Uhorsk\u00e9, Slovakia), and Hradistya (today Hradi\u0161te, Slovakia), later he became an Evangelic priest in Turicska (today Tur\u00ed\u010dky, Slovakia). In 1663, he moved to \u00c1belfalva (today \u00c1belov\u00e1, Slovakia). His mother was Helena Ni\u010dkov\u00e1 (Nicsko, Niczko).[2]/nThe date and the place of birth of his son polymath S\u00e1muel is unknown.[a] Mikoviny was possibly born in Turicska or \u00c1belfalva, in 1686 or 1700.[1] In 1727, he married Anna Regina Gillig from Szentgy\u00f6rgy (today Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Jur, Slovakia). The couple had five children, but only three survived - sons K\u00e1roly Szaniszl\u00f3 (in Slovak: Karol Stanislav), a geodest; Tam\u00e1s Lajos (Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u013dudov\u00edt), an engineer; and a daughter Erzs\u00e9bet Krisztina (Al\u017ebeta Krist\u00edna).[2]/nIn the literature, Mikoviny is mentioned as a Slovak polymath (the first Slovak engineer)[3][4][5][6] and also as a Hungarian.[7][8]  The contemporary elites identified themselves as members of common Natio Hungarica regardless of their ethnic origin, whereas the contemporary term Hungarus is an umbrella term covering ethnic Hungarians (Magyars), Slovaks and other ethnic groups in the Kingdom of Hungary because the self-definition through a common homeland, class or religion was more common than through language. The Slovak origin of Mikoviny was noticed already by J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r and is supported by further research in present-day Slovakia. Besides another, the research in local archives confirmed that the father of S\u00e1muel Mikoviny wrote his records in Turicska in Slovak.[3] Mikoviny declared himself in more of his maps and works as \"nobilis Hungarus\".[9][10] Two letters written in Hungarian remained after him,[11][10] however - as per the contemporary customs - by his studies and works mostly he used the German and the Latin language.[10]/nHis name is written in contemporary sources and later literature in many forms - Mikoviny, Mikowiny, Mikovini, Mikov\u00e9nyi, Mickovini, Mikovinyi, Mikov\u00ednij, Mikowini,[10] Mikov\u00e9ny.[12] He used mostly the form Mikoviny[12] and wrote his name without any diacritics.[13]/nHe learnt engraving at Nuremberg, and studied mathematics at the nearby University of Altdorf and later in Jena. He probably took private lessons in astronomy and surveying in Vienna before he returned to Pressburg (Pozsony, present-day Bratislava)./nIn Nuremberg, Mikoviny showed that he was a good engraver and a gifted artist. His series of engravings, views of Altdorf and Nuremberg was published in a booklet of Altdorf[14] in 1723. The publication also included a map of the district. His work was significantly influenced by another renowned scholar of the 18th century living in the multi-ethnic Kingdom of Hungary, Matthias Bel. Earlier Mikoviny engraved a map of Dem\u00e4nov\u00e1 Ice Cave and several illustrations for Bel's book Hungariae antiquae et novae prodromus (Messenger of Old and New Hungary), published in 1723 in Nuremberg.  After studies, he returned home to the Kingdom of Hungary./nFrom 1725, he was county engineer in Pressburg.[14] He devoted most of his attention to improvement works, especially anti-flood works on the banks of the river Danube and V\u00e1h (V\u00e1g), work to secure their navigability, and regulation work near Tata. He also concerned himself with astronomy at an observatory which he had established at his home, probably the first at the territory of present-day Slovakia.[b][15][14] His astronomical observations served map-making./nIn 1731, Charles III delegated him to construct maps for Bel's great work, Notitia Hungariae Novae Historico-Geographica.[16] Mikoviny then made a significant contribution to the making of a new map of the Kingdom of Hungary. He relied on his own measurements and used a scientific method, based on four basic principles: astronomical, geometrical, magnetic, and hydrographic. Mikoviny created the first topographical maps of individual counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. He also contributed to the work with illustrations, especially views of towns and castles. Mikoviny used his own prime meridian for the Kingdom of Hungary, the meridianus Posoniensis, which passed through the northeast tower of Bratislava Castle (Hungarian: Pozsonyi V\u00e1r, German: Pressburger Schloss).[c]/nIn 1735, he became a main royal engineer of mining towns (now located in present-day Central Slovakia[d]) and was instructed to found a mining school in Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (Selmecb\u00e1nya) which later became the (Mining Academy).[16] Mikoviny became the director and the first professor. He lectured on mathematics, mechanics, hydraulics, and surveying methods and supervised practical work in land and mine surveying. From 1935, he was also a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.[16] He made a significant contribution to the development of mining in Lower Hungary (today in central Slovakia) helping it to achieve a place among the most technically developed industries in Europe at that time.[17] He was a leading expert on the construction of water reservoirs, mining machinery, foundries, and mills. His chief contribution is a construction of a sophisticated system of reservoirs (tajchy), which drained water from the flooded mines in Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (Selmecb\u00e1nya) and provided energy for its local industry. He closely collaborated with Maximilian and Joseph Charles Hell.[17]/nHe also worked as an engineer and builder of roads and bridges. During the Silesian Wars, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria employed him as a military engineer. He designed and built defensive and fortification works on the Moravian-Silesian frontier.[17] In 1748, he carried out regulation work in the area of Kom\u00e1rom (today Kom\u00e1rom and Kom\u00e1rno), and at the time devoted attention to archaeological research. He studied and described the remains of the Roman fortress of Brigetio in Sz\u0151ny, and made a plan of it. Various buildings were erected according to his plans. In 1749, he prepared plans for construction of a royal palace in Buda, and carried out preparation of the castle hill and construction of water treatment works for it.[18] In 1750, he carried out anti-flooding works on the river V\u00e1h (V\u00e1g). During the works, he became ill and died on 23 March 1750 at a now unknown place on the road from Tren\u010d\u00edn (Trencs\u00e9n) to Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (Selmecb\u00e1nya). He is buried at an unknown location.[16]/nMikoviny effectively resolved the energy supply for mining machines in the region of Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica (Selmecb\u00e1nya) for the 18th, but also for the most of the 19th and the early 20th century. The artificial lake system significantly improved and extended by him is today part of UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is still in use and supplies the town with drinking water.

He became known to the general public following his co-authoring a paper on what is popularly known as Bible code, the supposed coded messaging in the Hebrew text of the Torah.[1]/nIlya (Eliyahu) Rips grew up in Latvia (then part of the Soviet Union). His mother was Jewish and from Riga, the only of nine siblings that survived the war; the others were killed in Rumbula and other places. His father Aaron was a Jewish mathematician from Belarus; his wife, children, and all of his relatives were killed during the Holocaust.[2]/nRips was the first high school student from Latvia to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiad. In January 1969, he learnt from listening to Western radio broadcast \u2014 then illegal in the USSR \u2014 of the self-immolation of Czechoslovak student Jan Palach. On 13 April 1969, Rips, then a graduate student at the University of Latvia, attempted self-immolation in a protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After unwrapping a self-made slogan condemning the occupation of Czechoslovakia he lit a candle and set his gasoline-soaked clothes ablaze. A group of bystanders was able to quickly put the fire out, resulting only in burns to Rips' neck and hands. Though injured, he was first taken to the local KGB office and interrogated.  He was incarcerated by the Soviet government for two years. After his story spread among Western mathematical circles and a wave of petitions, Rips was freed in 1971. The following year, he was allowed to immigrate to Israel./nRips joined the Department of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in 1975 completed his Ph.D. in mathematics there. His topic was the dimensional subgroup problem. He was awarded the  Aharon Katzir Prize. In 1979, Rips received the Erd\u0151s Prize from the Israel Mathematical Society, and was a sectional speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994./nRips is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at Hebrew University. His research interests are geometric and combinatorial methods in infinite group theory. This includes small cancellation theory and its generalizations, (Gromov) hyperbolic group theory, Bass-Serre theory and the actions of groups on \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n-trees./nRips' work on group actions on \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n-trees is mostly unpublished. The Rips machine, in the hands of Rips and his student Zlil Sela, has proven to be effective in obtaining classification results such as a solution to the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups./nIn the late 1970s, Rips began looking with the help of a computer for codes in the Torah. In 1994, Rips, together with Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg, published in the journal Statistical Science an article, \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\", which claimed the discovery of encoded messages in the Hebrew text of the Book of Genesis.[3] This, in turn, was the inspiration for the 1997 book The Bible Code by journalist Michael Drosnin. While Rips originally claimed[citation needed] that he agreed with Drosnin's findings, in 1997 Rips described Drosnin's book as \"on very shaky ground\" and \"of no value.\"[4] Since Drosnin's book, Bible codes have been a subject of controversy, with the claims being criticized by Brendan McKay and others.[5] An early supporter of Rips' theories was Robert Aumann, Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics 2005, who headed a commission overseeing Rips' experiments attempting to prove the existence of a secret code from God in the Torah. Eventually, Aumann abandoned the idea and withdrew his support from Rips./nThe Bible Code treats the text of the Bible as a word search puzzle: for example, a word may be spelled diagonally moving in a north west direction, or perhaps left-to-right taking every second letter. The more patterns that are allowed, the more words that can be found. Elementary statistics can be used to estimate the probabilities of finding certain hidden messages. The statistician Jeffrey S. Rosenthal shows in his book Struck by Lightning: The Curious World of Probabilities[6][page\u00a0needed] that \"hidden messages\" are statistically expected and hence should not be seen as divine messages, much less as predictions of the future. Mathematician Brendan McKay illustrated this point by finding messages in the English text of Moby Dick that supposedly \"predicted\" famous assassinations of the past, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the assassination of Indira Gandhi.[7]/nThe 1997 \"Ig Nobel Prize for Literature\" was awarded to Eliyahu Rips, Doron Witztum, Yoav Rosenberg, and Michael Drosnin, for their work on Bible codes.", "935841": "Albert William Tucker (28 November 1905 \u2013 25 January 1995) was a Canadian mathematician who made important contributions in topology, game theory, and non-linear programming.[2]/nAlbert Tucker was born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, and earned his B.A. at the University of Toronto in 1928 and his M.A. at the same institution in 1929.[3] In 1932, he earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University under the supervision of Solomon Lefschetz, with a dissertation entitled An Abstract Approach to Manifolds.[4]  In 1932\u201333 he was a National Research Fellow at Cambridge, Harvard, and then University of Chicago./nTucker then returned to Princeton to join the faculty in 1933, where he stayed until 1974.

George B. Thomas Jr. acknowledged Tucker's contribution of many exercises to Thomas's classic textbook, Calculus and Analytic Geometry.[5]/nIn the early 1980s, Tucker recruited Princeton history professor Charles Coulston Gillispie to help him set up an oral history project to preserve stories about the Princeton mathematical community in the 1930s.

He was given the opportunity to complete his degree in 1970.[1]/nIn the 1970s, Senderov taught mathematics at the Second Mathematical School in Moscow. Toward the end of the decade, he joined the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an anticommunist organization headed by Russian emigres, and also the International Society for Human Rights.

One method was to hand-pick the most difficult problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad and to give these problems to Jewish applicants as part of the entrance examinations - a practice that was specifically prohibited by the Soviet Ministry of Education. Another method was to select problems that could be solved given the standard high school curriculum, but whose solution required far more time than allotted for the entrance exams.

He and Shoshichi Kobayashi independently conjectured the Kobayashi\u2013Hitchin correspondence.  Higgs bundles, which are also developed in the work of Carlos Simpson, are closely related to the Hitchin system, which has an interpretation as a moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve.[3]  This moduli space has emerged as a focal point for deep connections between algebraic geometry, differential geometry, hyperk\u00e4hler geometry, mathematical physics, and representation theory./nIn his article[4] on generalized Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, he introduced the notion of generalized complex manifolds, providing a single structure that incorporates, as examples, Poisson manifolds, symplectic manifolds and complex manifolds.

He was sent to the Jesuit Mount St. Mary's University previously known as Mount St. Mary's College, where he obtained his secondary education from 1852 to 1857. Returning to Argentina, he assisted urbanist Pedro Benoit plan the first road to Ensenada (a harbor town 56\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) south of Buenos Aires) and earned a degree as a surveyor from the Topography and Geodesics School of Buenos Aires, in 1862. Huergo was among the first class to enroll at the School of Engineering created by the Rector of the University of Buenos Aires, Juan Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez, in 1866, and four years later, his thesis on the value of roads earned him the school's first engineering degree.[1]/nHuergo designed flood control projects for the torrential Tercero River and other C\u00f3rdoba Province waterways. He also designed 120 railroad bridges during his early career, as well as the harbor of the city of San Fernando. Huergo co-founded the Argentine Scientific Society in 1872 and the Argentine Geographic Institute, in 1879.[2] He taught at the newly created School of Mathematics of the University of Buenos Aires from 1874, and was designated its dean in 1881./nHuergo's plans to build a house at the mouth of the Riachuelo River flowing along Buenos Aires' industrial southside earned him the appointment of Director of the Riachuelo Works Bureau in 1876. This powerful post enabled him to develop the Port of La Boca, the first modern port in Buenos Aires. The port's opening in 1880 coincided with a sudden economic boom in Argentina, and the Provincial Legislature awarded him a generous budget for improvements, including a breakwater and the dredging of the silty Riachuelo mouth to 6.5\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft).[3] His ambitious proposal for a massive, new port north of the one at La Boca received initial support in the Argentine Congress, though the backing of Argentina's main financier (Barings Bank) for a proposal put forth by local import-export mogul Eduardo Madero helped sway congre ssional support away from Huergo's proposal. Madero's project was approved by Congress in 1882.[4]/nHuergo appealed the decision on the grounds that it would be uneconomical to build and difficult to modify, once new, larger freighters began to arrive. Madero's project was signed into law by President Julio Roca in 1884, however, and in 1886, Huergo resigned his post at the Riachuelo Bureau.[1]/nHuergo continued to campaign against the costly Puerto Madero works in his capacity as Dean of the School of Exact Sciences at Buenos Aires, while also accepting new projects. Returning to C\u00f3rdoba Province, he designed San Roque Reservoir in 1888 as a means to prevent flooding along the Suquia and Cosqu\u00edn Rivers. He was appointed Minister of Public Works for the important Province of Buenos Aires and designed Puerto Belgrano, the Argentine Navy's first deep-water port. Huergo designed a canal from the city of C\u00f3rdoba to the Paran\u00e1 River, over 320\u00a0km (200\u00a0mi) to the east, and the Port of Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay.[1]/nThe accomplished engineer was named director of the oil field discovered at Comodoro Rivadavia, in 1907. The nation's first such discovery, the office served as a precursor to YPF, the state oil concern established in 1922. Another reflection of the booming Argentine economy of the time, maritime shipping, had increased dramatically since Huergo's proposal for the Port of Buenos Aires had been passed over in 1882. The tonnage of vessels arriving at the port jumped from 4 million to 20 million by 1907, and in September of that year, Congress approved the construction of a new port. The facility would be built north of Madero's nearly-obsolete docks, and the design would be Huergo's. Work started in 1911 on the massive, new port, which included six open inner harbors, separated by cargo piers and protected by two breakwaters.[5]/nLuis Huergo did not live to see the new port's completion, and he died in 1913, at age 76. His port design solved the very limitations he had anticipated for the former facility, and his many and early contributions to his country's infrastructure made him Argentina's \"first engineer.\"[1]", "48449472": "Victor Vadimovich Batyrev (\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0412\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0432, born 31 August 1961, Moscow)[1] is a Russian mathematician, specializing in algebraic and arithmetic geometry and its applications to mathematical physics.

He was drafted for military service in World War II, and fought as an artillerist in the Russian campaign, where he was badly wounded in January 1942. After his recovery, in October 1942, Heinrich Scholz[5] got him employment in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/Chi), where he was the youngest member at 24. He attended a cryptography training course by Erich H\u00fcttenhain, and was put into the recently founded Section IVa \"Security check of own Encoding Procedures\" under Karl Stein, who assigned him the security check of the Enigma machine.[6][7] At the end of the war as OKW/Chi disintegrated, Hasenjaeger managed to escape TICOM, the United States effort to roundup and seize captured German intelligence people and material.[6]/nFrom the end of 1945, he studied mathematics and especially mathematical logic with Heinrich Scholz at the Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t University in M\u00fcnster.  In 1950 received his doctorate Topological studies on the semantics and syntax of an extended predicate calculus and completed his habilitation in 1953.[3]/nIn M\u00fcnster, Hasenjaeger worked as an assistant to Scholz and later co-author, to write the textbook Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic in Springer's Grundlehren series (Yellow series of Springer-Verlag),  which he published in 1961 fully 6 years after Scholz's death.

In 1964/65, he spent a year at Princeton University at the Institute for Advanced Study[8] His doctoral students at Bonn included Ronald B. Jensen, his most famous pupil.[3]/nHasenjaeger became professor emeritus in 1984.[9]/nIn October 1942, after starting work at OKW/Chi, Hasenjaeger was trained in cryptology, given by the mathematician, Erich H\u00fcttenhain, who was widely considered the most important German cryptologist of his time.  Hasenjaeger was put into a newly formed department, whose principal responsibility was the defensive testing and security control of their own methods and devices.[6][10] Hasenjaeger was ordered, by the mathematician Karl Stein who was also conscripted at OKW/Chi, to examine the Enigma machine for cryptologic weaknesses, while Stein was to examine the Siemens and Halske T52 and the Lorenz SZ-42.[10] The Enigma machine that Hasenjaeger examined was a variation that worked with 3 rotors and had no plugboard. Germany sold this version to neutral countries to accrue foreign exchange. Hasenjaeger was presented with a 100 character encrypted message for analysis and found a weakness which enabled the identification of the correct wiring rotors and also the appropriate rotor positions, to decrypt the messages. Further success eluded him, however. He crucially failed to identify the most important weakness of the Enigma machine: the lack of fixed points (letters encrypting to themselves) due to the reflector. Hasenjaeger could take some comfort from the fact that even Alan Turing missed this weakness. Instead, the honour was attributed to Gordon Welchman, who used the knowledge to decrypt several hundred thousand Enigma messages during the war.[6][10] In fact fixed points were earlier used by Polish codebreaker, Henryk Zygalski, as the basis for his method of attack on Enigma cipher, referred to by the Poles as \"Zygalski sheets\" (Zygalski sheets) (p\u0142achty Zygalskiego) and by the British as the \"Netz method\"./nIt was while Hasenjaeger was working at Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t University in M\u00fcnster in the period between 1946 and 1953 that Hasenjaeger made a most amazing discovery - a proof of Kurt G\u00f6del's G\u00f6del's completeness theorem for full predicate logic with identity and function symbols.[3] G\u00f6del's proof of 1930 for predicate logic did not automatically establish a procedure for the general case. When he had solved the problem in late 1949, he was frustrated to find that a young American mathematician Leon Henkin, had also created a proof.[3]  Both construct from extension of a term model, which is then the model for the initial theory. Although the Henkin proof was considered by Hasenjaeger and his peers to be more flexible, Hasenjaeger' is considered simpler and more transparent.[3]/nHasenjaeger continued to refine his proof through to 1953 when he made a breakthrough. According to the mathematicians Alfred Tarski, Stephen Cole Kleene and Andrzej Mostowski, the Arithmetical hierarchy of formulas is the set of arithmetical propositions that are true in the standard model, but not arithmetically definable. So, what does the concept of truth for the term model mean, the results for the recursively axiomatized Peano arithmetic from the Hasenjaeger method? The result was the truth predicate is well arithmetically, it is even \n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta _{2}^{0}}\n\n.[3]  So far down in the arithmetic hierarchy, and that goes for any recursively axiomatized (countable, consistent) theories. Even if you are true in all the natural numbers \n\n\n\n\n\u03a0\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Pi _{1}^{0}}\n\n formulas to the axioms./nThis classic proof is a very early, original application of the arithmetic hierarchy theory to a general-logical problem. It appeared in 1953 in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.[11]/nIn 1963, Hasenjaeger built a Universal Turing machine out of old telephone relays. Although Hasenjaeger's work on UTMs was largely unknown and he never published any details of the machinery during his lifetime, his family decided to donate the machine to the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn, Germany, after his death.[12][13] In an academic paper presented at the International Conference of History and Philosophy of Computing in 2012.[12] Rainer Glaschick, Turlough Neary, Damien Woods, Niall Murphy had examined Hasenjaeger's UTM machine at the request of Hasenjaeger family and found that the UTM was remarkably small and efficiently universal. Hasenjaeger UTM contained 3-tapes, 4 states, 2 symbols and was an evolution of ideas from Edward F. Moore's first universal machine and Hao Wang's B-machine. Hasenjaeger went on to build a small efficient Wang B-machine simulator. This was again proven by the team assembled by Rainer Glaschick to be efficiently universal./nIt was only in the 1970s that Hasenjaeger learned that the Enigma Machine had been so comprehensively broken.[6] It impressed him that Alan Turing himself, considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, had worked on breaking the device. The fact that the Germans had so comprehensively underestimated the weaknesses of the device, in contrast to Turing and Welchman's work, was seen by Hasenjaeger today as entirely positive. Hasenjaeger stated:/nWould it not been so, then the war would have lasted probably longer and the first atomic bomb had not fallen on Japan, but on Germany.[6]", "51182": "Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert[1] (/d\u00e6l\u0259m\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r/ dal-\u0259m-BAIR;[2] French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303 batist l\u0259 \u0281\u0254\u0303 dal\u0251\u0303b\u025b\u02d0\u0281]; 16 November 1717 \u2013 29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was, together with Denis Diderot, a co-editor of the Encyclop\u00e9die.[3] D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him.[4][5][6] The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation, and the fundamental theorem of algebra is named after d'Alembert in French./nBorn in Paris, d'Alembert was the natural son of the writer Claudine Gu\u00e9rin de Tencin and the chevalier Louis-Camus Destouches, an artillery officer. Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth. Days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris\u00a0[fr] church. According to custom, he was named after the patron saint of the church. D'Alembert was placed in an orphanage for foundling children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a glazier, Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years.[7] She gave him little encouragement. When he told her of some discovery he had made or something he had written she generally replied,/nYou will never be anything but a philosopher\u2014and what is that but an ass who plagues himself all his life, that he may be talked about after he is dead.[8]/nDestouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his paternity officially recognised./nD'Alembert first attended a private school.

Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of 12 d'Alembert entered the Jansenist Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations (the institution was also known under the name \"Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin\"). Here he studied philosophy, law, and the arts, graduating as baccalaur\u00e9at en arts in 1735./nIn his later life, d'Alembert scorned the Cartesian principles he had been taught by the Jansenists: \"physical promotion, innate ideas and the vortices\". The Jansenists steered d'Alembert toward an ecclesiastical career, attempting to deter him from pursuits such as poetry and mathematics. Theology was, however, \"rather unsubstantial fodder\" for d'Alembert. He entered law school for two years, and was nominated avocat in 1738./nHe was also interested in medicine and mathematics. Jean enrolled first as Jean-Baptiste Daremberg and subsequently changed his name, perhaps for reasons of euphony, to d\u2019Alembert.[9]/nLater, in recognition of d'Alembert's achievements,  Frederick the Great of Prussia proposed the name \"d'Alembert\" for a suspected (but non-existent) moon of Venus, however d'Alembert refused the honor.[10]/nIn July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics, pointing out the errors he had detected in Analyse d\u00e9montr\u00e9e (published 1708 by Charles-Ren\u00e9 Reynaud) in a communication addressed to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. At the time L'analyse d\u00e9montr\u00e9e was a standard work, which d'Alembert himself had used to study the foundations of mathematics. D'Alembert was also a Latin scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a translation of Tacitus, for which he received wide praise including that of Denis Diderot./nIn 1740, he submitted his second scientific work from the field of fluid mechanics M\u00e9moire sur la r\u00e9fraction des corps solides, which was recognised by Clairaut. In this work d'Alembert theoretically explained refraction./nIn 1741, after several failed attempts, d'Alembert was elected into the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.  He was later elected to the Berlin Academy in 1746[11] and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1748.[12]/nIn 1743, he published his most famous work, Trait\u00e9 de dynamique, in which he developed his own laws of motion.[13]/nWhen the Encyclop\u00e9die was organised in the late 1740s, d'Alembert was engaged as co-editor (for mathematics and science) with Diderot, and served until a series of crises temporarily interrupted the publication in 1757. He authored over a thousand articles for it, including the famous Preliminary Discourse. D'Alembert \"abandoned the foundation of Materialism\"[14] when he \"doubted whether there exists outside us anything corresponding to what we suppose we see.\"[14] In this way, d'Alembert agreed with the Idealist Berkeley and anticipated the transcendental idealism of Kant.[citation needed]/nIn 1752, he wrote about what is now called D'Alembert's paradox: that the drag on a body immersed in an inviscid, incompressible fluid is zero./nIn 1754, d'Alembert was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772.[15]/nIn 1757, an article by d'Alembert in the seventh volume of the Encyclopedia suggested that the Geneva clergymen had moved from Calvinism to pure Socinianism, basing this on information provided by Voltaire. The Pastors of Geneva were indignant, and appointed a committee to answer these charges. Under pressure from Jacob Vernes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others, d'Alembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist, and that was all he meant, and he abstained from further work on the encyclopaedia following his response to the critique.[16]/nHe was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.[17]/nD'Alembert's first exposure to music theory was in 1749 when he was called upon to review a M\u00e9moire submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie by Jean-Philippe Rameau. This article, written in conjunction with Diderot, would later form the basis of Rameau's 1750 treatise D\u00e9monstration du principe de l'harmonie. D'Alembert wrote a glowing review praising the author's deductive character as an ideal scientific model. He saw in Rameau's music theories support for his own scientific ideas, a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure./nTwo years later, in 1752, d'Alembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameau's works in his El\u00e9ments de musique th\u00e9orique et pratique suivant les principes de M. Rameau.[18] Emphasizing Rameau's main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed, d'Alembert helped to popularise the work of the composer and advertise his own theories.[18] He claims to have \"clarified, developed, and simplified\" the principles of Rameau, arguing that the single idea of the corps sonore\u00a0[fr] was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music.[19] D'Alembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major musical mode, the minor mode, and the identity of octaves. Because he was not a musician, however, d'Alembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameau's thinking, changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music./nAlthough initially grateful, Rameau eventually turned on d'Alembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with J. J. Rousseau's Encyclop\u00e9die articles on music.[20] This led to a series of bitter exchanges between the men and contributed to the end of d'Alembert and Rameau's friendship. A long preliminary discourse d'Alembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his El\u00e9mens attempted to summarise the dispute and act as a final rebuttal./nD'Alembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated Discours pr\u00e9liminaire of Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die. D'Alembert claims that, compared to the other arts, music, \"which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses,\" has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the \"lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it.\"[21] He wanted musical expression to deal with all physical sensations rather than merely the passions alone. D'Alembert believed that modern (Baroque) music had only achieved perfection in his age, as there existed no classical Greek models to study and imitate. He claimed that \"time destroyed all models which the ancients may have left us in this genre.\"[22] He praises Rameau as \"that manly, courageous, and fruitful genius\" who picked up the slack left by Jean-Baptiste Lully in the French musical arts.[23]/nD'Alembert was a participant in several Parisian salons, particularly those of Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Rodet Geoffrin, of the marquise du Deffand and of Julie de Lespinasse. D'Alembert became infatuated with Julie de Lespinasse, and eventually took up residence with her./nHe suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a urinary bladder illness. As a known unbeliever,[24][25][26] D'Alembert was buried in a common unmarked grave./nIn France, the fundamental theorem of algebra is known as the d'Alembert/Gauss theorem, as an error in d'Alembert's proof was caught by Gauss./nHe also created his ratio test, a test to determine if a series converges./nThe D'Alembert operator, which first arose in D'Alembert's analysis of vibrating strings, plays an important role in modern theoretical physics./nWhile he made great strides in mathematics and physics, d'Alembert is also famously known for incorrectly arguing in Croix ou Pile that the probability of a coin landing heads increased for every time that it came up tails. In gambling, the strategy of decreasing one's bet the more one wins and increasing one's bet the more one loses is therefore called the D'Alembert system, a type of martingale./nIn South Australia, a small inshore island in south-western Spencer Gulf was named Ile d'Alembert by the French explorer, Nicolas Baudin during his expedition to New Holland. The island is better known by the alternative English name of Lipson Island. The island is a conservation park and seabird rookery./nDiderot portrayed d'Alembert in Le r\u00eave de D'Alembert (D'Alembert's Dream), written after the two men had become estranged. It depicts d'Alembert ill in bed, conducting a debate on materialist philosophy in his sleep./nD'Alembert's Principle, a 1996 novel by Andrew Crumey, takes its title from D'Alembert's principle in physics.

In 1821 he published Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for Seamen; these nautical mathematical tables, known as Inman's Nautical Tables, remained in use for many years.  In the third edition (1835) he introduced a new table of haversines (the term was his coinage[3][4]) to simplify the calculation of distances between two points on the surface of the earth using spherical trigonometry. (For details of the calculation, see Haversine formula.)/nAt his suggestion, in 1810 the Admiralty established a School of Naval Architecture; the Admiralty also appointed Inman its first principal. In 1812 he conducted experiments with Flinders which led to the invention of the Flinders Bar, used for marine compass correction.  At the same time as teaching in the school and publishing mathematical texts for the use of his pupils, he translated a French text on the architecture of shipbuilding, and continued his own studies, gaining his doctorate in Divinity in 1820. In recognition of his work in nautical astronomy he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society./nHe also directed the design and construction of no less than ten British warships, of which he was proud to state that none ever had the slightest mishap due to an error of design or form./nHe retired in 1839, but continued living in Portsmouth until his death twenty years later, on 7 February 1859, aged 83./nHis wife Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, vicar of All Saints' Church, Oakham, Rutland, was a direct descendant of Hannah Ayscough, the mother of Sir Isaac Newton.  James and Mary Inman had seven children.  Their eldest son was James Williams Inman (1809\u20131895), Cambridge BA 1833, MA 1836, headmaster of The King's School, Grantham.  Their youngest son Henry Inman (1816\u20131895), was founder and first commander of the South Australia Police.[5]/nIn Sir John Franklin's first North American expedition he named Inman Harbour \"after my friend the Professor at the Royal Naval College\".  During Franklin's second Arctic voyage in 1826 his surveyor named the Inman River, northwest of Coppermine River, Canada, after Inman.

He graduated from the Mathematics Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Novorossiysk University in 1907 with a first degree and was kept at the department of physics in preparation for an academic career. From 1908 to 1915, he worked as an assistant at the University for Women, also worked part-time observer of the magnetic-meteorological observatory, and then in the Department of Physics and Mathematics Department of Physics University of Novorossiysk on the assistant position again. In 1915 Kirillov was promoted to master's degree, and was elected assistant professor in the Department of Physics./nFrom 1921 he headed the department of experimental physics. In 1926 joined as Director of Institute of Physics at the Odessa University, which he held until his death. In 1939 on the proposal of the Soviet Academy of Sciences awarded him the degree of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences without defending a thesis.

During his time at the Institute of Physics Professor Kirilov has created the scientific school of photography and problems associated to the optical and photoelectric properties of crystals./nIn 1930 Kirillov discovered the negative photoelectric effect (a decrease of current when exposed to light), studied its spectrum and showed that it is associated with the formation of the latent image, thereby establishing the connection between photoelectric and photochemical processes. In the period from 1946 to 1953 Kirillov performed a series of studies of the absorption spectra of lightly colored by light thin layers of silver halide, finding in them the fine structure of the absorption bands of the photochemical coloration and the latent image. For the discovery and study of the fine structure of the absorption spectrum of photochemically colored silver halide awarded in 1952 the USSR State Prize./nProfessor Kirillov helped the arrival in the Soviet Union in 1935 of the famous German physicist Guido Beck, who laid the foundation of theoretical physics in Odessa./nKirillov died in Odessa, aged 81.", "3033116": "Victor Mikhailovich Glushkov (Russian: \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432; August 24, 1923 \u2013 January 30, 1982) was a Soviet mathematician,[1] the founding father of information technology in the Soviet Union and one of the founding fathers of Soviet cybernetics./nHe was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russian SFSR, in the family of a mining engineer.

In 1840 Heine returned to Berlin, where he studied mathematics under Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, while also attending classes of Jakob Steiner and Johann Franz Encke. In 1842 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Berlin for a thesis on differential equations submitted with Enno Dirksen and Martin Ohm as advisors. Heine dedicated the doctoral thesis to his professor Gustav Dirichlet. Next he went to the University of K\u00f6nigsberg to participate in the mathematical seminar of Carl Gustav Jacobi, while also following mathematical physics classes of Franz Ernst Neumann. In K\u00f6nigsberg Heine got in contact with fellow students Gustav Kirchhoff and Philipp Ludwig von Seidel.[2]/nIn 1844 Heine went for a teaching position at the University of Bonn, passing his habilitation and starting as a privatdozent.

In 1856 Heine moved as a full professor to the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life. From 1864 to 1865, he served as a rector of the university. In 1875, the University of G\u00f6ttingen offered Heine a mathematics chair but he decided to reject the offer and remain in Halle.

In 1903, he published in Palermo the first books of the editorial series named Biblioteca Teosofica (Theosophical Library) and later Biblioteca filosofica).\nIn the same year, he was initiated in the Memphis' rite, a Masonic spiritual path that is derived by the ancient Egyptians and in Italy is uniquely practised in Palermo.\nIn 1907, he was admitted to the regular Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge \"Lucifero\" in Florence, affiliated to the Grand Orient of Italy.[2] Subsequently, Reghini adhered for a short period to the Martinism of G\u00e9rard Encausse and started to report the errors of the lawyer and Grand Master Sacchi about his administration of the Italian Freemasonry, also confuting his publications./nIn 1907, Amedeo Rocco Armentano introduced Reghini to the knowledge of the Pythagoreanism.\nIn 1912, Reghini was in directorate of the Italian Freemasonry (in Italian: Supremo Consiglio Universale of the Rito filosofico italiano[3]) from which he resigned in 1940 with a strongly negative judgement about the national brotherhood.[4]/nIn 1921, he was initiated to the 33rd and highest degree of the Scottish Rite. Then he was elected as effective member of the\nSupremo Consiglio d'Italia of which he became the Great Commendor and the General Secretary. In 1925, Reghini signed the internal decree No 245 related to its termination.\n[5] On May 19, the Italian Parliament had approved the law of reform for the freedom of association, banning the masonic lodges out of the country./nReghini edited the journals Atan\u00f3r (1924) and Ignis (1925) devoted to initiate studies, covering topics such as Pythagoreanism, yoga, Hebrew Cabalism and the Freemasonry of Alessandro Cagliostro. A circle of esotericists formed around these journals and adopted the name Gruppo di Ur. The group's members included Julius Evola and the anthroposophists Giovanni Colazza and Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesar\u00f2. From 1927 to 1928 the group published the monthly journal UR.[6] Reghini fell out with Evola and the Ur group in 1928; a major reason was Reghini's support for Freemasonry, which was not in line with the direction the journal had taken. Reghini left the editorial board and UR was discontinued. It was briefly replaced in 1929 by a journal named Krur, without Reghini's involvement.[7]/nReghini was opposed to Christianity, which he associated with modernity and egalitarianism, and sought to establish a form of modern Paganism he called \"magia colta\", \"cultured magic\", which he drew from Hermeticism and Platonism.[7] A critic of democracy and an advocate for the ancient Roman aristocracy, Reghini welcomed the rise of Italian Fascism, which he associated with the ancient world. He wrote in Atan\u00f3r in 1924 that he had anticipated the emergence of such a regime in Italy 15 years prior.[6] From the second half of the 1920s, he wrote critically about clerical fascism and the increasing fascist hostility towards non-Catholic religious views. He adopted an ironic writing style associated with the anti-clericalism of the era before World War I and the Risorgimento.[1]/nReghini died in Budrio on 1 July 1946.[1]/nReghini was an important influence on Evola during the years 1924 to 1930. He introduced Evola to the major texts on alchemy, which became the basis for Evola's book The Hermetic Tradition (1931).[6] It was also through Reghini that Evola came in contact with Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, whose Traditionalism would have a profound impact on his thinking.[7] Reghini's journals and the works of the Ur group have influenced the development of Italic-Roman neopaganism and Roman polytheistic reconstructionism.[8]/nSelected translations with introductions and annotations:", "52676648": "Sir John Percival Vissing Madsen FAA (24 March 1879 \u2013 4 October 1969) was an Australian academic, physicist, engineer, mathematician and Army officer.\n[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]/nThis history of Madsen's[8] activities in Australian science & engineering covers the period 1900\u20131956 during which applications of electricity, X-ray analysis, standardised measurements for production, radio propagation, radar & radio astronomy, nuclear physics & digital computers made tremendous progress in part due to major advances in fundamental research & also the heightened activity due to two world wars. Central to these activities largely carried out at Sydney University, was the Electrical Engineering Department & the CSIRO National Standards Laboratory/ Radiophysics Laboratory (now The Madsen Building [9] in the University grounds./nMadsen's roles encompassed the positions of Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Professor & Emeritus Professor from 1909 up to 1956 when he finally retired as Chairman of the Radio Research Board which he founded in 1927. Until 1946 Madsen was the first and only Professor of Electrical Engineering in any Australian University./nMadsen (1879-1969)[10] graduated from Sydney University with first class honours & University Medals in both Science & Engineering in 1900 & then 1901 when he read physics & mathematics establishing the practice of taking the double degree of BSc & BE & he himself embarking on a lifelong career of applying physics to the foundations of engineering./nIn 1901 he was appointed Lecturer in physics & mathematics at the University of Adelaide under W H Bragg with whom he established a close association over many years & this soon led in 1902 to the opportunity to become the first Lecturer in Electrical Engineering at the University. In the latter part of 1902 during a period of leave of absence & at his own expense he proceeded on a tour through England & America to gain information on the most recent methods of instruction in Electrical Engineering adopted by the Universities & Higher technical Colleges & at the same time visiting as many as possible of the most important installations and manufacturing businesses. He found that the general type of course was much the same throughout consisting of groundwork in mathematics, physics & chemistry where courses were over three or four years with the specialisation in Electric Engineering taking place during the latter portion. A thesis dealing with some approved portion of work & written up during the vacations was also required from the student & on completion of the course the recognised practice for these men was to take up employment with a reputable manufacturing firm. Experience gained in this way was most essential as men are put through all the departments after which they stay in the one in which they intend to specialise dealing at that time with the further subdivision of Direct & Continuous current. The equipment for teaching in England was considered sufficient for teaching being of small size & less expensive whereas in America there was a tendency towards using large machines with large currents & high EMFs where the methods of handling are considerably different. In the case of smaller plant more responsibility can be taken by a student & this assists the student in gaining confidence in the handling of experiments. On completion of the degree the graduate was accepted by the IEE as sufficient qualification for their associateship & then it became most essential to obtain experience on the Continent, England or America before taking up a permanent position. From time to time openings in large manufacturing works in America, England & Germany became available for graduates./nCommencing in 1905 Sydney University was to appoint its first Lecturer in Electrical Engineering & JPVM[8] applied wishing to get married & be employed back at Sydney University. WHB wrote a very favourable testimonial & concluded that he would be very sorry if it assists JPVM's departure from Adelaide. The Chancellor of the University of Adelaide also expressed great regret at the possibility of JPVM leaving Adelaide & referred to his ability as an able & hard working man of unimpeachable character who had proved himself a successful teacher & Lecturer inspiring his students with his own enthusiasm. E. Kilman Scott from England however was given the appointment for four years & so in fact JPVM did remain in Adelaide for the next four years & in conjunction with his Electrical Engineering duties embarked on a period of fundamental research in physics with WHB./nWHB had greatly improved his skills in giving public lectures & science demonstrations during his time in Adelaide but at the relatively old age of 42 was inspired by Rutherford's work to give a Presidential address to the AAAS meeting to be held in Dunedin in 1904 which set out his research ideas on the ionization of gases. The discovery of X-rays by Rontgen in 1895, radium in 1898 by the Curies & the electron by J J Thomson in 1897 had created fertile ground for research work in physics which WHB then started to devise experiments & at the same time develop theoretical ideas to support his results. In 1905 JPVM joined with WHB in his experiments & then later publishing his own experiments up to 1909, & in particular a paper on the Scattering of Beta Rays of Radium published in England in the Phil Mag. One of the results of great significance from this experiment with thin foils of gold, aluminium, silver & paper was that for the thinnest of foils the beta particles passing through were only scattered once, the implication to Rutherford of this was that within the atom there was a lot of empty space. Rutherford in 1911 published a very famous paper on the Scattering of Alpha & Beta particles & the Structure of the Atom the Rutherford Model as a mini solar system or nuclear atom in which he mentions Madsen's results. JPVM also wrote to Nature on matters arising from his experiments which he considered to be of significance./nIn 1909 WHB and family departed Adelaide for England and Madsen returned to Sydney University with his family and in an effort to keep JPVM abreast of research mainly in England & Germany, WHB wrote lengthy letters from Leeds also making arrangements for a new large & very expensive supply of Radium from Braunschweig funded to JPVM by a wealthy tobacco merchant. W H Bragg & J P V Madsen Collaboration and Correspondence. It is not known what further experiment Madsen was working on in Sydney with his new supply of Radium however the results were not as expected & when finished he passed the Radium on to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for medical use. In 1912 W H B published a book \"Studies in Radioactivity\" in which he gives a full account of JPVM's Beta Scattering apparatus with an Ionization chamber & also his results for Aluminium & Gold foils. In late 1912 WHB also invented his X-ray ionization diffraction spectrometer which also involved the electronic measurement of scattered wave material having passed through crystals which contributed significantly to his receipt, with son Lawrence W L Bragg, of the 1915 Nobel Prize in physics./nIn May 1912 in a President's Address to the University of Sydney Engineering Society JPVM[8] set out his ideas on the effective manner in which Engineers should be trained. He believed teaching of engineering was more than just technical matters & to his mind included character, clearness of thought & expression, general knowledge, tastes, discipline & contact with men of vastly different interests. There should be a liberal arrangement of the syllabus by doing away with individual years & place only a minimum limit of four years on the course so that the student can take as long as he pleased with certain essential subjects leaving a certain number as options. He did not believe that the Matriculation test in languages & literature was essential for entrance to an Engineering course. The course of instruction needs to be geared to Australian needs with more emphasis on applications compared to finer points of design. A sound quantitative knowledge of portions of science which directly concern his professional work should be provided. The system of training is to consist of a clear exposition of the fundamental principles of science & then a study of the methods of application of these principles. As soon as the principles are understood in a general way then he must be then shown the practical application-there is a tendency to remember the applications & forget the principles. Such a defect can arise if students are given principles in one course & it is then left for him to deal with applications at a later stage. There is also a need for short graduate courses of 6-10 lectures. The need for an Australian physical Measurements Laboratory such as in Germany, London, Washington & Japan was raised at this time./nIn 1914 in his Presidential Address to the Electrical Association of NSW JPVM again raised the need for Australia to participate in international comparisons of physical measurements & pointed to the role in Germany where the Physicalische Reichsansalt had become a very important institution. In conclusion JPVM referred to the loss of service due to the death of George Westinghouse one of the pioneers of the electrical industry./nAt the outbreak of WW1 Madsen had been Captain of the Sydney University Rifle club & although he volunteered for active service was retained as the Chief Instructor & Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Engineer Officers Training School at Moore Park & then Roseville. The trainees at the School were all selected men with high engineering qualifications & courses of instruction were adapted to suit the requirements of these men. He was a tiger for physical fitness & maintained a mixture of hard discipline during work periods & at other times a smiling ease & warm friendliness./nBeyond 1914 \u2013 The University of Sydney and the Great War[11]/nIn 1920 Madsen[8] was appointed to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Sydney University and until 1946 remained the only professor of Electrical Engineering in an Australian University. In the Engineering Year Book of 1926 it was noted by students that it was the beginning of Third Year that they met Madsen and his subject of Electrical Engineering & his untiring energy is what really instilled in our minds the true idea of efficient work. His lectures are more effective than any others we get, due probably to his clear and concise idea of the usual pitfalls for young students of electricity & the saving grace of first principles as opposed to details. To him alone, we owe whatever slight conception we have of the importance of filthy lucre & \"corsts\" in engineering undertakings./nIn 1926 the Council for Scientific Research- CSIR- was formed by Stanley Bruce the Australian Prime Minister. That same year public submissions were called to consider which areas of research should be followed. Madsen made two submissions on the same day at the hearings in Melbourne, the first dealing with the establishment of an Australian Radio Research Board and then the establishment of a National Standards Laboratory. All the other submissions which were made were for primary industry programmes. The proposal to form the Australian RRB was adopted at this time to be funded by CSIR, the Department of Defence & the PMG & to work on similar lines to the British RRB under Robert Watson Watt. In 1926 many of the techniques of radio propagation were still unknown & the development of long distant communication & broadcasting were still empirical, however in Britain and the United States of America a more fundamental scientific approach was evolving with spectacular results. At this time in Australia problems limiting full use of the medium were assuming importance in Australia. As Chairman of the newly formed RRB JPVM travelled overseas to America where he attended an URSI-International Union of Radio Science conference in Washington & then to Britain & the continent obtaining relevant information on Radio Research & also Standards Laboratories even though that proposal was not to be taken up by CSIR until ten years later.  In London JPVM arranged a selection panel consisting of Rutherford, Appleton & Tizard to recommend three staff to be appointed for three year terms to come out to Sydney & Melbourne Universities to follow on from research programmes initiated in England on atmospherics & the ionosphere. Despite the economic stringencies of the Depression the work of the Board in both areas achieved worldwide recognition by 1935 & the valuable contributions made were provided freely./nIn 1935 Madsen delivered an address at the University of Queensland which gave a very thorough summary of the results of the RRB dealing with the Ionosphere & its Influence upon the propagation of radio waves & considered the effects explained by the Magneto-Ionic Theory. One of the first research workers of the RRB was J L Pawsey  who undertook a master's degree programme working with George Munro in Melbourne on atmospherics & after completing a\nPhD in Cambridge under J A Ratcliffe  & working with EMI in England returned to Australia at the start of the war to work in Radiophysics on radar & others such as D F Martyn were similarly drawn in to form the nucleus of this vital work. In 1930 Sydney University commenced a course on Electrical Communications whose participants contributed to a growing electronics industry in Sydney./nIn 1931 Madsen delivered a lecture to celebrate the life and work of Michael Faraday and the applications of his discovery of electro-magnetic induction./nIn 1937, in no small measure due to the concern of the expansion of Japan in East Asia and the Pacific Islands, a report of a Secondary Industries Testing Committee of which MAdsen was a member led to the setting up of a National Standards Laboratory within CSIR consisting of sections of Metrology, Physics and Electrotechnology. Sydney University agreed to the Laboratory being located in its grounds with MAdsen the Chairman of the overseeing Board. The information considered was found by MAdsen to be substantially the same as he had obtained ten years before including the facility used by Japan. Construction of the Laboratory did not commence until the latter part of 1939 & followed plans supplied by the National Physical Laboratory NPL Teddington. In 1928 in a paper to the Institution of Engineers JPVM referred to the practical difficulties of deriving from the absolute units of  centimetre, gramme & second units such as temperature, Candle-power & electrical units. At this time the wavelength of the red cadmium line was under investigation as a universal reference for length. The expensive auxiliary equipment needed to make comparisons was seen as being far more involved than just procuring standards or their copies. The use of slip gauges or block gauges was to become of great importance to NSL in 1939 when these gauges could not be obtained from England or America & had to be made by NSL.\nIn July 1937 Rutherford wrote to Madsen in part advising that: \"My friend Wimperis is, I believe, visiting New Zealand and Australia shortly in connection with the Air Ministry. I hope you will have an opportunity of meeting him. He is a thoroughly sound fellow and a good friend of mine. We have played many a game of golf together\". Harry Wimperis was closely involved with Henry Tizard in 1934 in initiating the British RDF (radar) effort as a means to defeat the expected bomber raids from Germany. Wimperis had been invited by the Australian Government to advise on setting up an Aeronautical industry in Australia as a defence measure & one result was that JPVM arranged for Sydney University to set up a chair in Aeronautical Engineering. In a private conversation with JPVM in Melbourne during this visit Wimperis tacitly acknowledged that Britain was working on a radio based method of detecting aircraft./nBecause of the possibility that Britain could be overrun by the Germans in the event of war, Britain decided in January 1939 to share its RDF secrets with Commonwealth Countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa). Once this information was conveyed to Australia Madsen as Chairman of the Radio Research Board drew up a Radiophysics plan for research & production arrangements for submission to the Australian Government./n[The Australian War Memorial   Histories of the Australian involvement with radar[12] & standards[13] in WW2 are dealt with comprehensively by David Mellor in the \"Role of Science and Industry\" series.[14]]/nIn August 1939 at a meeting in Canberra with Prime Minister R G Menzies, David Rivett, Madsen,[8] D F Martyn & senior Defence Staff, approval was given to build a Radiophysics Laboratory (RPL) in the Sydney University grounds as an extension of the NSL building then under construction so as to not draw attention to the nature of the secret  work to be undertaken. Madsen was appointed Chairman of the overseeing Radiophysics Advisory Board & was responsible for aligning the requirements of the services with the ideas & developments of the scientific staff. The RPL functioned as a Division of CSIR & its initial staff were appointed based on their previous RRB experience or experience in the fledgling radio industry firms of the previous decade and later as more scientists were needed they came directly from universities if they had high frequency experience./nInitially it was the Australian Army which showed greatest interest in radar for controlling shore or harbour defence guns whilst the air force was principally interested in airborne ASV radar. The valve requirements for these radars was the key & the VT90  valve producing 1.5 metre wavelength (200 mc/s) was used for pulse generation which provided great economy. The RPL development of aerial duplexing (i.e. the antennae acts both as transmitter & receiver) was based on the invention of a very fast & reliable transmit/receive switch by RPL staff.   In England in 1940 the invention of the resonant cavity magnetron by  Randall & Boot in the laboratory of Mark Oliphant, at wavelength of 10\u00a0cm revolutionised allied radar & was taken to America in August 1940 as part of the Tizard Mission. As an extension of 10\u00a0cm developments for Australia, JPVM arranged through R G Casey the new Australian ambassador in Washington for him to establish  a scientific liaison officer mainly to keep in contact with rapid developments at the Radiation Laboratory MIT & commercial firms involved such as Bell Labs. In return Australia was to assist US forces in radar matters when required which after commencement of hostilities with Japan became extremely urgent.[15]/nIn August 1941 F W G White had initiated an air warning programme in Radiophysics. The main developments in Australian radar after Pearl Harbour involved the lightweight principle which was used in the design of the LW/AW (Lightweight Air Warning) set & the GCI (Ground Control Intercept) sets essential for operations in New Guinea & beyond in the SWPA theatre. The sudden fall of [Singapore-radar|Singapore] on 15 February 1942 created an even greater sense of urgency in providing air warning for vital Australian centres. JPVM resigned as Chairman of the RAB in July 1942 as he felt someone with more production experience was required rather than his research background but he attended all Board meetings until the end of the war. When Karl Compton  of OSRD visited Australia in 1944 particular mention was made that the Australian Operations Research Group had been set up on JPVM's  instigation based on information obtained by him from Patrick Blackett whilst in England. Near the end of the war Australian LW/AW radars in the hands of Macarthur's forces were slated to be used in Operation Olympic which was the plan in development to invade the three valleys of southern Kyushu in Japan. Australian developed Doppler radar would have been very useful in these conditions./nOn 21 August 1945 shortly after the end of World War 2, Madsen was elected Chairman of the Australian National Research Council & a special subcommittee of five physicists including JPVM was formed to prepare recommendations to the Australian Government on the practical engineering applications that needed solution since the principle of liberation of atomic energy had now been discovered. Six recommendations were advised to Prime Minister J B Chifley on 3 December 1945 the first of which was that the Australian government should convey to the British Government the desire that Australia should play an appropriate part in plans which may be developed by the British government for further research in nuclear physics. A recommendation was made to secure control of uranium and thorium[16] deposits & promote active search for new deposits & also that accredited physicists be sent from Australia to England to obtain necessary information or invite a senior member of the British Scientific team to visit Australia & advise the Commonwealth Government. J B Chifley replied in a letter of 14 February 1946 advising that the Government had already received substantially similar recommendations from CSIR & that action had been taken on the first two recommendations & that in due course a satisfactory programme concerning development of nuclear energy for industrial purposes in Australia would be developed./nThe Royal Society organised a three-week Empire Scientific Conference to be held in June\u2013July 1946 with conferences in London, Oxford and Cambridge. Two further weeks were then arranged for more official government decision making. The delegates to the Royal Society Conference included UK (38), Canada (15), Australia (9), India (14), New Zealand (4), South Africa (7), West Indies (4), Southern Rhodesia (5) as well as Eire & East Africa. The 9 Australian delegates were led by David Rivett FRS of CSIR. & included JPVM[8] who did not deliver any papers but did propose that a Secretariat be formed which would prepare the ground for the first meeting of a Commonwealth Standards body. The Conference was opened by H M The King on Monday 17 June at 11.00 am at the Beveridge Hall of the Senate House, University of London. The UK delegates, mainly FRS, included E Appleton, P M S Blackett, J Chadwick, Lord Cherwell ,  J D Cockcroft, C Darwin,& Henry Tizard./nBefore the war ended Radiophysics in CSIR and the RRB were initiating programmes dealing with the upper atmosphere and operational RAAF radar stations were at times in their routines making recorded observations of atmospheric anomalies. J L Pawsey commenced work on radio astronomy and at the cessation of hostilities a vast supply of surplus radar equipment became available for use in this area./nIn 1946 Trevor Pearcey-Csiropedia who had emigrated from Britain in late 1945 and joined Radiophysics started on a design of a stored programme digital computer and its construction in 1947\u201348 was financed in part at least by the recommendation of Madsen. In August 1951 a Conference on Automatic Computing Machines was held at Sydney University chaired by the now Emeritus Professor Sir John Madsen at which Douglas Hartree from England delivered papers in conjunction with David Myers from Sydney University on Analogue Computing and Trevor Pearcey on CSIR Mk1.& this was one of the first in the world to be displayed this way. The 1951 Conference is regarded as the start of a separate computing profession in Australia & the papers Proceedings of the Conference  whilst mainly technical, form the basis of work for decades to follow. A summary of the main discussions indicate by Madsen that up to this point computing had been considered to be a sub discipline of mathematics./nIn recognition of the outstanding Australian radio work done in the previous 25 years the Xth General Assembly was held at Sydney University in August 1952. Madsen was Chairman of the Australian Organising Committee & was also elected President of the Xth Assembly./nIn 1956 there was great concern in the West that the Soviet Union had taken a significant lead in scientific training of its engineers following the  detonation of its hydrogen bomb soviet atomic bomb project & the soon to follow  Sputnik 1. To address the situation in Australia JPVM published a paper through Sydney University setting out recommendations for manpower requirements in the scientific era touching greatly on his own experience of the previous 50 years of promoting engineering with science. In the post war period to the end of the twentieth century there was a significant change in emerging technology policies moving from a mainly government sponsored \"supply\" side environment to a business orientated \"demand\" side market.\"", "18473": "Fra. Luca Bartolomeo de Pacioli (sometimes Paccioli or Paciolo; c. 1447 \u2013 19 June 1517)[3] was an Italian mathematician, Franciscan friar, collaborator with Leonardo da Vinci, and an early contributor to the field now known as accounting. He is referred to as the father of accounting and bookkeeping and he was the first person to publish a work on the double-entry system of book-keeping on the continent.[4][a] He was also called Luca di Borgo after his birthplace, Borgo Sansepolcro, Tuscany./nSeveral of his works were plagiarised from Piero della Francesca, in what has been called \"probably the first full-blown case of plagiarism in the history of mathematics\".[5]/nLuca Pacioli was born between 1446 and 1448 in the Tuscan town of Sansepolcro where he received an abbaco education. This was education in the vernacular (i.e., the local tongue) rather than Latin and focused on the knowledge required of merchants. His father was Bartolomeo Pacioli; however, Luca Pacioli was said to have lived with the Befolci family as a child in his birth town Sansepolcro.[7] He moved to Venice around 1464, where he continued his own education while working as a tutor to the three sons of a merchant. It was during this period that he wrote his first book, a treatise on arithmetic for the boys he was tutoring. Between 1472 and 1475, he became a Franciscan friar.[7] Thus, he could be referred to as Fra ('Friar') Luca./nIn 1475, he started teaching in Perugia as a private teacher before becoming first chair in mathematics in 1477. During this time, he wrote a comprehensive textbook in the vernacular for his students. He continued to work as a private tutor of mathematics and was instructed to stop teaching at this level in Sansepolcro in 1491. In 1494, his first book, Summa de arithmetica, geometria, Proportioni et proportionalita, was published in Venice. In 1497, he accepted an invitation from Duke Ludovico Sforza to work in Milan. There he met, taught mathematics to, collaborated, and lived with Leonardo da Vinci. In 1499, Pacioli and Leonardo were forced to flee Milan when Louis XII of France seized the city and drove out their patron. Their paths appear to have finally separated around 1506. Pacioli died at about the age of 70 on 19 June 1517, most likely in Sansepolcro, where it is thought that he had spent much of his final years.[7]/nPacioli published several works on mathematics, including:/nThe majority of the second volume of Summa de arithmetica, geometria. Proportioni et proportionalita was a slightly rewritten version of one of Piero della Francesca's works. The third volume of Pacioli's Divina proportione was an Italian translation of Piero della Francesca's Latin book De quinque corporibus regularibus. In neither case did Pacioli include an attribution to Piero. He was severely criticized for this and accused of plagiarism by sixteenth-century art historian and biographer Giorgio Vasari. R. Emmett Taylor (1889\u20131956) said that Pacioli may have had nothing to do with the translated volume Divina proportione, and that it may just have been appended to his work. However, no such defense can be presented concerning the inclusion of Piero della Francesca's material in Pacioli's Summa./nPacioli dramatically affected the practice of accounting by describing the double-entry accounting method used in parts of Italy. This revolutionized how businesses oversaw their operations, enabling improved efficiency and profitability. The Summa's section on accounting was used internationally as an accounting textbook up to the mid-16th century. The essentials of double-entry accounting have for the most part remained unchanged for over 500 years. \"Accounting practitioners in public accounting, industry, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as investors, lending institutions, business firms, and all other users for financial information are indebted to Luca Pacioli for his monumental role in the development of accounting.\"[13]/nThe ICAEW Library's rare book collection at Chartered Accountants' Hall holds the complete published works of Luca Pacioli. Sections of two of Pacioli's books, 'Summa de arithmetica' and 'Divina proportione' can be viewed online using Turning the Pages, an interactive tool developed by the British Library.[14]/nLuca Pacioli also wrote an unpublished treatise on chess, De ludo scachorum (On the Game of Chess). Long thought to have been lost, a surviving manuscript was rediscovered in 2006, in the 22,000-volume library of Count Guglielmo Coronini-Cronberg in Gorizia. A facsimile edition of the book was published in Pacioli's home town of Sansepolcro in 2008. Based on Leonardo da Vinci's long association with the author and his having illustrated Divina proportione, some scholars speculate that Leonardo either drew the chess problems that appear in the manuscript or at least designed the chess pieces used in the problems.[15][16][17][18]/nFootnotes/nCitations", "28952620": "Titus Babczy\u0144ski (1830 in Warsaw \u2013 1910) was a Polish mathematician and physicist.

His dissertation was Theory of Connections.[3] He then spent two years at the Institute for Advanced Study and two years at MIT. He joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 as an assistant professor, was awarded tenure the following year, and was promoted to full professor in 1966./nKobayashi served as chairman of the Berkeley Mathematics Department for a three-year term from 1978 to 1981 and for the 1992 Fall semester. He chose early retirement under the VERIP plan in 1994./nThe two-volume book Foundations of Differential Geometry, which he coauthored with Katsumi Nomizu, has been known for its wide influence. In 1970 he was an invited speaker for the section on geometry and topology at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice./nKobayashi's earliest work dealt with the geometry of connections on principal bundles. Many of these results, along with others, were later absorbed into Foundations of Differential Geometry./nAs a consequence of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi equations and the commutation formulas for covariant derivatives, James Simons discovered a formula for the Laplacian of the second fundamental form of a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold.[4] As a consequence, one can find a formula for the Laplacian of the norm-squared of the second fundamental form. This \"Simons formula\" simplifies significantly when the mean curvature of the submanifold is zero and when the Riemannian manifold has constant curvature. In this setting, Shiing-Shen Chern, Manfredo do Carmo, and Kobayashi studied the algebraic structure of the zeroth-order terms, showing that they are nonnegative provided that the norm of the second fundamental form is sufficiently small./nAs a consequence, the case in which the norm of the second fundamental form is constantly equal to the threshold value can be completely analyzed, the key being that all of the matrix inequalities used in controlling the zeroth-order terms become equalities. As such, in this setting, the second fundamental form is uniquely determined. As submanifolds of space forms are locally characterized by their first and second fundamental forms, this results in a complete characterization of minimal submanifolds of the round sphere whose second fundamental form is constant and equal to the threshold value. Chern, do Carmo, and Kobayashi's result was later improved by An-Min Li and Jimin Li, making use of the same methods.[5]/nOn a K\u00e4hler manifold, it is natural to consider the restriction of the sectional curvature to the two-dimensional planes which are holomorphic, i.e. which are invariant under the almost-complex structure. This is called the holomorphic sectional curvature. Samuel Goldberg and Kobayashi introduced an extension of this quantity, called the holomorphic bisectional curvature; its input is a pair of holomorphic two-dimensional planes. Goldberg and Kobayashi established the differential-geometric foundations of this object, carrying out many analogies with the sectional curvature. In particular they established, by the Bochner technique, that the second Betti number of a connected closed manifold must equal one if there is a K\u00e4hler metric whose holomorphic bisectional curvature is positive. Later, Kobayashi and Takushiro Ochiai proved some rigidity theorems for K\u00e4hler manifolds. In particular, if M is a closed K\u00e4hler manifold and there exists \u03b1 in H1, 1(M, \u2124) such that/nthen M must be biholomorphic to complex projective space. This, in combination with the Goldberg\u2013Kobayashi result, forms the final part of Yum-Tong Siu and Shing-Tung Yau's proof of the Frankel conjecture.[6] Kobayashi and Ochiai also characterized the situation of c1(M) = n\u03b1 as M being biholomorphic to a quadratic hypersurface of complex projective space./nKobayashi is also notable for having proved that a hermitian\u2013Einstein metric on a holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\u00e4hler manifold has deep algebro-geometric implications, as it implies semistability and decomposability as a direct sum of stable bundles.[7] This establishes one direction of the Kobayashi\u2013Hitchin correspondence. Karen Uhlenbeck and Yau proved the converse result, following well-known partial results by Simon Donaldson./nIn the 1960s, Kobayashi introduced what is now known as the Kobayashi metric. This associates  a pseudo-metric to any complex manifold, in a holomorphically invariant way.[8] This sets up the important notion of Kobayashi hyperbolicity, which is defined by the condition that the Kobayashi metric is a genuine metric (and not only a pseudo-metric). With these notions, Kobayashi was able to establish a higher-dimensional version of the Alhfors\u2013Schwarz lemma from complex analysis./nArticles/nBooks/nKobayashi was also the author of several textbooks which (as of 2022) have only been published in Japanese.[12]", "17483851": "Paolo Dagomari da Prato (1282\u20131374), known in Latin as Paulus Geometrus (Paolo il Geometra, \"Paul the Geometer\"), was a noted Florentine mathematician and astronomer, such a maestro dell'abbaco (master/teacher of the abacus) that he gained the epithet Paolo dell'Abbaco. Franco Sacchetti called him Paolo Arismetra e Astrologo (arithmetician and astronomer) and Giorgio Vasari Paulo Strolago or Paolo Astrologo (astronomer).

At Florence Paolo became the private tutor of Jacopo Alighieri and a friend of Giovanni Boccaccio, who praised him highly in his De genealogia deorum gentilium. The need for mathematics among the bankers and merchants of Florence led him to found a school of arithmetic (bottegha d'abacho) at Santa Trinita.[4] In 1363 he held the priorate of the quarter of S.

He is most famous for his work on equations (aequationibus) that fused geometry and arithmetic, which we today would recognise as algebra. His most important mathematical treatise was the Regoluzze, a manual of elementary arithmetic, written in 1340. Some of the \"little rules\" are:[5]/n1.

Due to the tumultuous political situation in Russia.  Paul continued his studies in Zurich, Switzerland.  He was accepted at the internationally renowned high school Concordia of Zurich at age 12.  He took courses at the technical department and graduated after three years completing the requirements by 1908.  Paul also played the violin and received lessons from P. Koller around this period.  He also became familiar with Albert Einstein.  Regrettably, Paul was too young to attend the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.[9]/nThe Concordia high school allowed Paul to attend the institution for an additional year offering special courses in the field of natural science.  One year later he attended another high school named Minerva from 1909 to 1910.  At the second institution, Paul observed courses in the fields of physics and mathematics.  By age 17, in March 1910 he took special entrance examinations to attend the University of Zurich.  Around this period Albert Einstein was teaching courses in Zurich.  Paul attended some courses taught by the scientist.  In his biography, Paul explains that the world-renowned scientist showed a keen interest in ancient Greek philosophy and mathematics and the young student had long conversations with him regarding the field.[9]/nPaul was accepted at the University of Zurich in 1910 and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1912.[10]  Some of his professors included Aurel Stodola and Gabriel Narutowicz.  He received a degree in civil engineering in 1917 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and one year later in 1918, he received a degree in physics and mathematics at the University of Zurich.  That same year Paul became an engineer at the hydroelectric installations of the L\u00f3ntschwerk II in Switzerland.  He was part of the construction of an electric dam that produced 77000\u00a0kW with a height of 370 meters.  During this period of his life, he specialized in hydroelectricity and electromagnetism.[11]/nBy 1919, Paul moved to Athens, Greece, and continued working as a hydroelectric engineer for the Greek government.  He studied the Edessa Waterfalls, Lake Vegoritida, and Agra Pella.  He continued in this position until 1921.  He worked in the private sector from 1921 until 1930.  He became the chief engineer of a company in Athens from 1921 to 1925.  Around this period he also wrote articles in the field of engineering under the pseudonym \"Santo Rini\".  One of his articles published in 1921 was La Th\u00e9orie du Rendement \u00c9conomique Maximum D'une Conduite Forc\u00e9e en M\u00e9tal et le Calcul Rationnel de Ses \u00c9l\u00e9ments (The Theory of the Maximum Economic Return of a Metal Pension Pipe and the Rational Calculation of its Elements).  He was the head of static analysis for designing structures at Ergoliptiki from 1925 to 1927.  Around this period Paul engineered a refined method for cement and finally from 1927 until 1930 he worked at Kronos Industries.  In this position, he researched the elastic deformations of solid structures and wrote several articles about the facility.  That same year Paul took a government position and was one of the directors of Hydraulics at the Ministry of Agriculture, and he remained in this position until 1946.[12]/nThe University of Athens gave him a degree in physics in 1933 and one year later he received a Ph.D. from the institution in the field of mathematics and physics.  Paul became a professor at the School of Physics which was part of the University of Athens.  Paul taught applied physics and experimental electromagnetic radiation from 1936\u20131946.  He continued his work in electromagnetism and began building radiolocation systems for the Hellenic Military and was transferred to the High Command of Anti-Aircraft Defense a position which he held from 1936 to 1940.  He built prototypes of electronic weapons.  His research focused on developing instruments that used radio waves to determine the distance angle and radial velocity of objects relative to a specific position.  The instrument was used to track aircraft.  In his biography, Paul claims that many of his prototypes were shared with different countries by the Greek government and that he was not credited for his inventions.  He returned to the Ministry of Agriculture focusing his research on water measurements from 1940 to 1946.[13]/nFrom 1947 to 1964, he became professor of experimental physics and Chair of the Experimental Physics Laboratory II at the National Technical University of Athens and also took a position at the Agricultural University of Athens as a professor and director of the physics laboratory.  During this period in 1946 Greece witnessed a phenomenon known as Ghost rockets.  Paul was assigned to investigate the unidentified flying objects, he was 53 years old.  By this point in his life, Paul was a distinguished professor and scientist who wrote hundreds of articles ranging from structural engineering, hydraulics, and electromagnetism.  He became professor emeritus at the National Technical University of Athens and the Agricultural University of Athens by 1964, he was 71 years old.  He continued writing until the end of his life and was a member of the New York Academy of Science, Acad\u00e8mie Des Sciences de Toulouse, Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, and the Royal Society of Arts.  He also won several awards throughout his life for his distinguished excellence in the field of science.  His academic writing can be separated by the subjects of his articles.  Early in his career, he wrote about civil engineering during the middle point of his career most of his works dealt with electromagnetic applications and finally towards the end of his life he theorized about the universe.  The scholar wrote over 350 articles and over 59 of his works were selected and discussed in his biography.  He died at 93 years old with distinction and was buried at the Third Cemetery of Athens.[14]/nDuring the spring on May 27, 1936, Paul was part of a project to build anti-aircraft equipment for the long-distance detection of airships for the Hellenic Military entitled ecatometrico radar (centimetric radar system).  A committee was assembled with a special request by the Hellenic military to the Department of Applied Physics of the University of Athens.  Paul proposed his experimental work.  The device was tested and approved by the committee and    \nPaul was named senior commander of anti-aircraft defense.  By 1939,  the equipment was functioning and able to observe aircraft up to 150 kilometers, the tests were conducted in Faliros.  The equipment attracted the attention of the English military who were desperate to defeat the Germans.  The Greek government shared the research the military conducted with its international allies during the desperate war times.  Regrettably, Paul's contribution went unnoticed by the international scientific community even though he was awarded Greece's highest honor around that period for his work in the field.  He was also posthumously credited for building the guidance system for Project Nike and the proximity fuse used in the Hiroshima atomic bomb.[15][16]/nIn 1967, Paul, publicly stated that the 1947 Greek government investigation into the European Ghost rockets of 1946 were not missiles.  Paul claimed the investigation was halted by senior U.S. military officials who knew them to be extraterrestrial in nature. Paul further explained to the Greek news that because there was no defense against the advanced technology of the aliens they feared widespread panic would result if the information was known to the public.

She is mainly known for her work on partial differential equations.[1]/nBorok was born on July 9, 1931, in Kharkiv in Ukraine (then USSR), into a Jewish family.[2] Her father, Michail Borok, was a chemist, scientist and an expert in material science. Her mother, Bella Sigal, was a well-known economist. Because of her mothers' high position at the ministry of Economics, Valentina Borok had a privileged early childhood. However, because of the political situation, her mother voluntarily resigned in 1937, and took a lower position, presumably because she knew she couldn't possibly have been spared the repressions of the late 1930s. This possibly helped the Borok family survive World War II./nValentina Borok had a talent for math even in her high school years. So in 1949, with the advice of her high school teachers Borok started to study Mathematics at Kyiv State University. There she met Yakov Zhitomirskii, who would be her husband until her death. During her stay at Kyiv State University, Borok, along with her future husband, started her research in the field of mathematics under the supervision of the mathematics department supervisor, Georgii Shilov. Her undergraduate thesis on distribution theory and the applications to the theory of systems of linear partial differential equations was found to be extraordinary and was published in a top Russian journal. This thesis was later selected in 1957 to be part of the first volumes of American Mathematical Society translations.\nIn 1954, Borok graduated from Kyiv State University and moved to Moscow State University in order to receive her graduate degree. In 1957, she received her PhD for her thesis On Systems of Linear Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients. The information about the system of Linear Partial Differential equations with constant coefficient was publicized in the annals of mathematics. She later published more papers from 1954 to 1959, which contained a range of inverse theorems that allowed partial differential equations to be characterized by certain properties of their solutions. \u201cIn the same period she obtained formula that made it possible to compute in simple algebraic terms the numerical parameters that determine classes of uniqueness and well-posed of the Cauchy problem for systems of linear partial differential equations with constant coefficients\". In 1960, she moved to Kharkiv State University, where she stayed until 1994. In 1970, Borok became a full professor and from 1983 to 1994, she was the Chair of the analysis department./nIn the early 1960s Borok worked on the stability for partial differential equations well-posed. Her other works at this time were on the parabolic systems degenerating at infinity and on the dependence of classes of uniqueness on the transformations of the spatial argument. most of her works during this period of time were mostly joint works with her husband Yakov Zhitomirskii./nAnd during the period of the late 1960s, Borok began her series of papers that laid the foundations for the theory of local and non-local boundary value problems in infinite layers for systems of partial differential equations. The results of her studies included the construction of maximal classes of uniqueness and well-posedness, Phragmen- Lindel\u00f6f type theorems, and the study of asymptotic properties and stability of solutions of boundary-value problems in infinite layers./nStarting in the early 1970s, Borok opened a school for the study of the general theory of Partial Differential Equations in Kharkiv State University. Many of her papers helped the development of the theory of local and non-local boundary value problems in infinite layers for systems of Partial differential equations.  One of her earliest works includes results on the uniqueness and well-posedness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem. Most of her works were concentrated in the area of Partial differential equations along with functional-differential equations. even to this day many of her works are being cited./nDuring her years of being a professor at Kharkiv State University, Borok was considered the teacher of rigorous analysis, which was a course in which many of the students got their first taste in research. Borok was known for her \"creative problems\" as well as her development of original lecture notes for many of the core and specialized courses in analysis and Partial differential Equations. She set the curriculum of the mathematics department in Kharkiv State University for more than 30 years, setting the tradition in the university./nIn 1994, Borok became severely ill but because there was no necessary medical attention available in Ukraine, she had to move to Haifa, Israel, where she died at the age of 72 in 2004. Both of her children, Michail Zhitomirskii and Svetlana Jitomirskaya, became research mathematicians./nBorok is known for her research and contribution on the partial differentiation equation. During her lifetime she published 80 papers in top Russian and Ukrainian journals as well as supervised 16 PhDs along with many master theses./nMany of her thesis development included the studies of the Cauchy problem for the linear partial differential equations, which was published in the Annals of Mathematics[3] explaining the theory behind the linear partial differential equation.\nIn other works she has proved the theorem on uniqueness and well-posedness theorems for the initial\nvalue problem as well as the Cauchy problem for system of linear partial differential equations./nIn her studies, translated from Russian, in the Cauchy problem for systems of linear partial differential equations that are functional with respect to parameter, Her summary states that she proves that for the study in Cauchy problem for\u2260 system of equations of the form \u0111u(x,y,z)/\u0111t = P(\u0111/\u0111x)u(x,t,\u0256y), x\u025bRn, t\u025b[0,T],y>0,\u0256>0, \u0256\u22601, u\u025bCn, Where P(S) is an N x N Matrix with polynomial elements.

An astronomer and astrologer, Zimmermann produced one of the first Equidistant Conic Projection star charts of the northern hemisphere in 1692. While at University, he also was a singing instructor.[1]/nHe took his first post as a Lutheran minister at Bietigheim (Baden) in 1671. In the early 1680s, he wrote treatises on two comets that caused widespread fears among the population; he charted their course astronomically and interpreted their meanings astrologically. Subsequently, he combined his astrological insights with the expectation of a millenarian realm of Christ on earth. Published under the pseudonym Ambrosius Sehmann von Caminiez (an anagram of his real name), his Muthmassliche Zeit-Bestimmung set out Zimmermann's belief that the dramatic upheavals ushering in Christ's kingdom on earth would occur in or around 1693.[1] As his superiors in the Lutheran church viewed millenarianism as a dangerous heresy, Zimmermann was removed from his ministry in 1685. Another charge raised against him was that he adhered to the theosopher Jakob B\u00f6hme, whose complete works had been published in 1682./nSince Zimmermann did not renounce his millenarian views, he and his family were exiled from W\u00fcrttemberg in February 1686. After spending time in Nuremberg, Frankfurt on Main, Amsterdam, and Heidelberg, the Zimmermanns settled in Hamburg, where Johann Jacob made a living as a writer and teacher. In this setting, he wrote his Scriptura Sacra Copernizans, which defended the astrological theories of Nicolaus Copernicus.[2] As a testimony to his importance as a scientific writer, the work was reprinted in Hamburg in 1706 and 1736.[3] While in Hamburg, Zimmermann also gradually attracted like-minded religious dissenters who were dissatisfied with the intolerance of the religious establishment.

The Shangyangzi jindan dayao does not mention a date of death for him, suggesting he was alive when it was written between 1331 and 1335.[1]/nSong Lian's biography agrees that Zhao was a Daoist hermit, claiming that he spent either 10 or 20 years writing a commentary on the Book of Changes (Yi jing) after obtaining a secret book on alchemy from an immortal Daoist master. However, this commentary has been lost.[1] The biography further claims that Zhao gave a manuscript of Ge xiang xin shu to his disciple, Zhu Hui, while on his deathbed on Jiming mountain in the Zhejiang Province. This manuscript was later published by Zhu's disciple, Zhang Jun.[1]  The Jiangxi tongzhi states he died after 1368. This is not widely accepted as this would make him 97 at the time of death.[1]/nZhao's most notable work is Ge xiang xin shu (\u9769\u8c61\u65b0\u4e66), in which he discussed geometry, astronomy, and optics. He is most well-known for his method of finding pi by drawing a square and increasing the number of sides until it resembles a circle using iterative methods, then finding the perimeter (circumference) of the shape (a circle, or close to it).[3][2] The book contains a section, \"Qian xiang zhou bi\" (\"On Circumference and Diameter of the Symbol of Heaven\"), where Zhao lists pairs of values of circumferences and diameters used to calculate pi in the past; he believed 355/113 to be the most accurate.[1] Liu Hui had already discovered a method for finding pi, and Zu Chongzhi had stated that pi was between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, but Zhao's method allowed for this to be proven.[3] Zhao's method involved finding the perimeter of a 16384-sided polygon. A 2048-sided polygon would have sufficiently proved pi is near 355/113, however it is believed he was trying to prove that it was within Zu Chongzhi\u2019s interval, thus the need for 16384 sides.[1] Zhao also claimed that the value of pi could never be exhaustively calculated.[1] While the work is influential, it does not note all of the values to enough decimal places to get some of the results, and has been known to underestimate values (but says that there is some remainder).[1]/nZhao also described the structure of the universe as a flat Earth inside spherical heavens.[3][2] He used the metaphor of a healthy and sick horse to describe the motions of the sun and moon. He labels the healthy horse as the sun and the unhealthy horse as the moon, and says that each starts at the same point and runs around a circle before noting how far the moon falls behind. This exercise found the moon to be slower than the sun.[4][5] Additionally, it used a circular track, concerning angular distances, as opposed to considering a straight track.[4][5] He also described an instrument used to calculate the angle between a star and the North Pole, and another used to find the differences in the right ascension of two celestial objects.[2]/nIn Ge xiang xin shu (\u9769\u8c61\u65b0\u4e66), Zhao described an optical experiment he undertook in a chapter titled \"Pinhole Image\".[6] In the experiment, he had two light sources - tables with candles on them - which he covered with a board with a hole in the center, and observed the light as it passed through the hole onto a screen above. In doing so, he found that a larger hole let more light through; more candles led to a brighter image; the shape of the image on the screen is independent of the shape and size of the pinhole; and that moving the screen further away led to a dimmer image.[6]/nZhao has another extant book, Xian Fo tongyuan, dedicated to becoming immortal using meditation through \"Inner Alchemy.\"[2][3] He also wrote at least two Daoist books, Xian Fo tong yuan [lun] ([A Discourse] on the Common Origins of [the Teachings of] Immortals and Buddhas) and Jin dan nan wen (Difficult Problems of Gold Cinnabar).[1]", "1329320": "Johann Tobias Mayer (5 May 1752 \u2013 30 November 1830) was a German physicist./nMayer, born in G\u00f6ttingen, was the first child of the astronomer Tobias Mayer and his wife Maria.

Eleusis was also successful, appearing in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games[3] and New Rules for Classic Games,[4] among others.  In 1963, Abbott himself released a publication, Abbott's New Card Games, which included instructions for all of his card games, in addition to Baroque chess.[5][6]  Abbott also invented logic mazes, the first of which appeared in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in the October\u00a01962 issue of Scientific American.[7][8][9] One of the more prominent of these is Theseus and the Minotaur, which was originally published in the book Mad Mazes.[10] His game Confusion was named \"Best New Abstract Strategy Game\" for 2012 by GAMES Magazine.[11]/nAbbott was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and attended St. Louis Country Day School. Abbott went to Yale for two years, then attended the University of Colorado for another two, but never graduated.[12] Soon after, Abbott moved to New York, where he and his games were discovered by Martin Gardner. In 1963, after Abbott's book, Abbott's New Card Games, received only moderate success, he \"got tired of being poor\"[13] and moved back to St. Louis. There, he became a computer programmer at the Washington University in St. Louis Computer Research Laboratory. In 1965, he moved back to New York, where he continued to work as  a computer programmer, mostly with the IBM 360 assembly language.[1]/nAbbott created all of his card games during the 1950s, starting with Babel in 1951,[2] and ending with Auction in 1956.[13] Soon after, he moved to New York City, where the rules for his game Eleusis were first published by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column.[13][14]  Motivated by the article, Abbott self-published the rules for four of his card games in the book Four New Card Games in 1962, which he sold by mail. In 1963, the book Abbott's New Card Games was published by Sol Stein of Stein and Day, containing the rules for all eight of his card games and the rules for his chess variant, Baroque chess.[5] In 1968, the publisher Funk & Wagnalls published a paperback edition of Abbott's New Card Games,[15] in which Abbott slightly modified the rules of Baroque chess, but these changes never became popular.[16] Around the same time that Abbott's New Card Games was published, Abbott sent his maze, Traffic Maze in Floyd's Knob, to Martin Gardner. This was the first logic maze to be published, appearing in Gardner's Mathematical Games column.[7][8][9]/nAfter that time, Abbott created various mazes, most of which appeared in the books SuperMazes and Mad Mazes.[17][18] In 2008, RBA Libros published a Spanish version of his book Abbott's New Card Games, under the title Diez juegos que no se parecen a nada, which translates to Ten games that do not resemble anything.[19] This version was not just a Spanish translation of the original, however; the most up-to-date rules for the various games were used; in addition, the rules for Eleusis Express and Confusion were included.[6]  In 2010, his Where are the Cows? maze was published by the Oxford University Press in Ian Stewart's book Cows in the Maze.[20] In 2011, his game Confusion was published by Stronghold Games.[21] The game was named \"Best New Abstract Strategy Game\" for 2012 by GAMES Magazine.[11]/nAbbott was the inventor of a style of maze called logic mazes.[22][7][9] A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as \"you cannot make left turns\") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called \"Multi-State mazes\".[7]  The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can put you in a different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where you can move from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.[23]/nThe first logic maze ever published, Traffic Maze in Floyd's Knob, appeared in the October\u00a01962 issue of Scientific American in the Mathematical Games column.[7][8][9]/nThe maze looks like a street grid, with arrows pointing down various roads at each intersection. When one comes to an intersection, only arrows leading from the road you are on to another road can be followed. One must continue in this fashion, following the arrows at the intersection, until the end is reached. When you come to an intersection from one direction, you have different options for which road to take than you would coming into the intersection from another direction; therefore, this can be defined as a \"multi-state\" or \"logic\" maze.[9]/nWhere are the Cows? was one of Abbott's most difficult mazes. It first appeared in his book SuperMazes. Abbott warns readers that it \"may be too difficult for anyone to solve.\"[24] Since then, it has also appeared as the titular maze in the book Cows in the Maze.[20]/nThe complexity in Where are the Cows? includes self-reference, changing rules, and flow charts. It is also worded so as to provoke confusion between an object (such as red text), a reference to an object (such as the word \"red\"), and even more subtle references (the word \"word\"). The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult to work out the next move, let alone the end. In this maze, you have to use two hands, each starting at a different place. The instructions in one box might have to do with the box that the other hand is in, boxes you have already left, or complex combinations of the two.[25]/nTheseus and the Minotaur is another of Abbott's better-known mazes. It first appeared in his book Mad Mazes. Like Where are the Cows? in SuperMazes, Abbott said that this \"is the hardest maze in the book; in fact, it is possible that no one will solve it.\"[10] Since then, several different versions of it have appeared, made by others, following the same theme, both on paper and in electronic forms.[26]/nAbbott has created several games, including card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games are not of particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games.[13] For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so it is as if you are playing four different games that are threaded together.[27]/nBaroque chess, or Ultima, was the only board game in the book Abbott's New Card Games. Abbott's reasoning for including this non-card game in a card game book was that chess pieces are as plentiful as playing cards, and in this book, he wanted to introduce new games that did not require special equipment. Abbott's friends, once he started teaching it to them, began to call the game \"Abbott's Ultima,\" which he did not like at all.[28] However, the publisher, Sol Stein, preferred the name \"Ultima,\" so that is the title that was used in the book.[16]/nEleusis is probably Abbott's most prominent game, due to its metaphors and its suitability for use as a teaching tool.[29] He invented it in 1956,[30] and it appeared in his self-published book Four New Card Games.[31] It was also published in the book Abbott's New Card Games a year later.[5] Martin Gardner wrote about it in his Mathematical Games column in the June\u00a01959 issue of Scientific American.[14] Basically, the gameplay consists of the dealer choosing a secret rule dictating how cards are to be played, and the players playing cards in an attempt to figure out the rule through inductive reasoning. In 1973, Abbott decided to improve Eleusis;[30] the result was considered to be far better than the original, with various improvements to the layouts and gameplay making it work quite a bit better. Martin Gardner wrote about this version in the October\u00a01977 issue of Scientific American.[29] Abbott also self-published a pamphlet in 1977 with the rules for the improved version, titled The New Eleusis.[32] It has appeared in several card game collections, such as Hoyle's Rules of Games[3] and New Rules for Classic Games,[4] among others./nAbbott initially created the game Confusion in the 1970s, and had it in finished form by 1980.[21] The game was published in Germany by Franjos in 1992; Abbott was not satisfied with this version, however, due to several flaws in it.[33] The rules were published in the Spanish translation of his book Abbott's New Card Games in 2008,[19] but the game did not get published in North America until 2011. This Stronghold Games version was named \"Best New Abstract Strategy Game\" for 2012 by GAMES Magazine.[11] The game is based on the idea of not knowing what your pieces are or what they do at the beginning of the game. His game Eleusis uses a similar idea, in that you do not know how cards are to be played at the beginning; George Brancaccio, someone Abbott worked with at the Bank of New York, commented on this, saying \"In your game Eleusis, you don't know what cards can be played. Why don't you make a board game where you don't know how pieces move?\"[33] This is what gave Abbott the idea, and he began work on it soon after.", "49957034": "Seppo Ilmari Linnainmaa (born 28 September 1945) is a Finnish mathematician and computer scientist known for creating the modern version of backpropagation./nHe was born in Pori.[1] In 1974 he obtained the first doctorate ever awarded in computer science at the University of Helsinki.[2] In 1976, he became Assistant Professor.

Thirty six years later, Samoilenko reminisced, \"In Kyiv, at the Institute of Mathematics, great scientists were my teachers... In many fields of science, they were 'trendsetters' on the scale of the Soviet Union. It is very important for a young scientist to belong to a serious scientific school. Probably, only in this case he has a chance to obtain results at the world level. The atmosphere of a good scientific school itself stimulates a young scientist to carry out his research work at the cutting edge of modern science. And if he suddenly opens a new direction in science, then his name immediately gains recognition\".[2]/nIn 1974\u20131987, Samoilenko headed the Chair of Integral and Differential Equations of the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University. These years were marked by especially high scientific activity of the chair. Based on results of the research in the theory of differential equations with delay performed at that time, the monograph[3] of Mitropolskiy, Samoilenko, and D. I. Martynyuk was published. At the same time, Samoilenko, together with his disciple M. O. Perestyuk, published the well-known monograph[4] devoted to the theory of impulsive differential equations. These monographs (especially their English translations[5][6][7]) are frequently cited in scientific literature./nSince 1987, Samoilenko has headed the Department of Ordinary Differential Equations at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (at present, the Department of Differential Equations and Theory of Oscillations at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), and since 1988 he has been the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The beginning of this fruitful creative period was marked by the fundamental monograph[8] devoted to the qualitative theory of invariant manifolds of dynamical systems. This monograph served as a foundation for the construction of the general perturbation theory of invariant tori of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus. The English version[9] of this monograph is also well known. Three years later, the monograph[10] of Samoilenko (in coauthorship with Mitropol'skii and V. L. Kulyk) was published. In this monograph, in particular, the method of Lyapunov functions was used for the investigation of dichotomies in linear differential systems of the general form. The results of many-year investigations of constructive methods in the theory of boundary-valued problems for ordinary differential equations carried out by Samoilenko together with M. Ronto are presented in monographs.[11][12][13][14] Constructive algorithms for finding solutions of boundary-value problems with different classes of multipoint boundary conditions were developed by Samoilenko, V. M. Laptyns'kyi, and K. Kenzhebaev; the obtained results are presented in monograph.[15] Complex classes of resonance boundary-value problems whose linear pan cannot be described by Fredholm operators of index zero were investigated by Samoilenko, together with O. A. Boichuk and V. F. Zhuravlev, in monographs.[16][17] The monograph[18] of Samoilenko and Yu. V. Teplins'kyi is devoted to the theory of countable systems of ordinary differential equations. The monographs [19][20] of Samoilenko and R. I. Petryshyn cover a broad class of qualitative problems in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus./nSamoilenko is the author of about 400 scientific works, including 30 monographs and 15 textbooks, most of which have been translated into foreign languages. His monographs made an important contribution to mathematical science and education. According to MathSciNet, the scientific papers of Samoilenko were cited 336 times by 208 authors./nThe scientific interests of Samoilenko covered a broad range of important problems in the qualitative theory of differential equations, nonlinear mechanics, and the theory of nonlinear oscillations. His deep results in the theory of multifrequency oscillations, perturbation theory of toroidal manifolds, asymptotic methods of nonlinear mechanics, theory of impulsive systems, theory of differential equations with delay, and theory of boundary-value problems were highly appreciated in Ukraine and abroad. Academician Samoilenko was the founder of a scientific school in the theory of multifrequency oscillations and theory of impulsive systems recognized by the international mathematical community. His successful many-year guidance of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences furthered the rapid development of mathematics in the Ukraine and the continuation of the best traditions of the world-known Bogolyubov \u2013 Krylov \u2013 Mitropolskiy Kyiv scientific school./nThe worldwide recognition of Samoilenko's mathematical results is illustrated by notions well known in the mathematical literature such as the Samoilenko numerical-analytic method and the Samoilenko \u2013 Green function (the kernel of an integral operator related to the problem of an invariant torus of a dynamical system)./nSamoilenko gave much attention to training scientists of the highest qualification. For many years, he had given lectures at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University and the \"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\" National Technical University and guided the scientific work of postgraduate and doctoral students. Despite the extremely busy schedule of his work as the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences for about 20 last years (since 2006, he was the Academician-Secretary of the Department of Mathematics at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), Samoilenko found time for organizational and public activities. In particular, Samoilenko was the President of the \"Foundation for Support of the Development of Mathematical Sciences\" All-Ukrainian charity organization. Many young talents from the \"small homeland\" of Samoilenko (Malynshchyna) are grateful to him for founding and heading the charity foundation for support of the development of gifted children and youth./nSamoilenko found and taught many nonordinary scientists. He created an international scientific school in differential equations. Among his disciples, there are 33 doctors and 82 candidates of physical and mathematical sciences, who are now researchers of prestigious scientific institutions, professors, heads of chairs, deans, and rectors (scientific researchers, pedagogs, and administrators of various levels). For example, Samoilenko's alma mater (the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University) has been headed for many years by his disciples (Professors M. O. Perestyuk and I. O. Parasyuk). Among other well-known scientists belonging to Samoilenko's mathematical school, one may mention Professor Kenzhebaev, the rector of the Zhubanov Aktobe University, one of the most reputable universities in Kazakhstan, and Academician M. Ilolov, the President of the Tajik Academy of Sciences./nSamoilenko was a member of the Ukrainian Mathematical Society, the American Mathematical Society, and the editorial boards of numerous Ukrainian and foreign mathematical journals, among which there are Differential Equations, Reports of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, In the world of mathematics, Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Memoirs on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics, and Miskolc Mathematical Notes.[21] He is an editor-in-chief of the Ukrainian Mathematical Journal,[22] Nonlinear Oscillations journal[23] and the Ukrainian Mathematical Bulletin./nSamoilenko was a full member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine[24] (since 1995) and the European Academy of Sciences[25] (since 2002).

Her family was descended from Russian nobility and though they were well-to-do before the Russian Revolution, they would later face difficulty because of their heritage. Because her father was a construction expert for the military, they moved frequently and she lived in Helsinki between 1905 and 1907, then in Saint Petersburg until 1909, and then moved to Riga, Latvia. Vsevolod took a position there at the Riga Polytechnic Institute, until the German invasion of 1915 forced the family to flee to Moscow, where they lived in the Losinoostrovsky District. Keldysh attended school, finishing her education in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, where the family had moved in 1918. She continued her education at the Moscow State University, graduating in 1925. While she was studying, she joined the research group of Nikolai Luzin in 1923, as did Pyotr Novikov, who she would later marry. Luzin published her first mathematical theory, which was an evaluation using continued fractions of the fourth Borel set in 1930.[1]/nKeldysh began teaching in 1930 at the Moscow Aviation Institute.[1] Around this time, she had her first son, Leonid Keldysh,[2] in 1931.[3] In 1934, she left the Aviation Institute and began teaching at the Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences specializing in set theories.[4] That same year, she married Novikov and published three papers: On the Homeomorphism of Canonical Elements of the 3rd Class; On Simple Functions of Class a; and On the Structure of B Measurable Functions of Class a. The following year, Stalin began his purges and Keldysh lost both an uncle and a nephew, and her parents were both arrested, though later released. In the next few years, she had two more sons Andrei Petrovich Novikov and Sergei Petrovich Novikov, who would both become noted mathematicians. She had continued her research on Borel sets and in 1941 defended her thesis, but before she received her degree the family fled the advancing German troops. Most of the faculty of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences were considered evacuees when they arrived in Kazan, but Keldysh and her three sons were treated as refugees. They found lodging in the gym of the Kazan University with several hundred other refugees, until Novikov arrived and the family was given a dorm room. Novikov was ill and required surgery, leaving Keldysh shuttling between her husband's hospital room and her children's dorm room.[1]/nIn late 1942, they were able to return to Moscow. Keldysh had two daughters, Nina and then Elena, during this time. She published a paper, On the structure of measurable sets B in 1944, and followed it in 1945 with Open mappings of A-sets, which marked a turning point in her work. She was also finally able, in 1945, to have her thesis published and from this point on, her work focused more on geometric topology. She continued publishing from the mid-1940s into the 1960s.[1] Keldysh's research was honored repeatedly in this period and she received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Order of Maternal Glory in the 2nd degree and in 1958 received the Prize of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.[4] In 1964, Keldysh was made a full professor[4] at Moscow State University and in 1966 she published the book Topological embeddings into Euclidean space to help her students understand her lectures.

He used his position as secretary to found a botanical garden there (now called Ogr\u00f3d Botaniczny w Oliwie).[1][3]/nFor his work in the natural sciences, Klein had been rewarded with membership of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London, the Academy of in St. Petersburg, the Deutsche Gesellschaft in Jena, and the Danzig Research Society.[2][3]/nOne of Klein's daughters, Dorothea Juliane Klein, married physicist Darniel Gralath, who would become mayor of Danzig. Gralath inherited Klein's library, which was praised by Swiss mathematician Jogann Bernoulli.[2]/nKlein died on 27 February 1759 in Danzig.[4]/nUsing his position as secretary of Danzig and with the help of other scholars, Klein set up a botanical garden in 1718, which was one of, if not the largest of its time.[5] The garden was expanded to include live animals, zoological, fossil and amber collections, the shell collection of the mayor of Amsterdam Nicolaus Witsen, as well as a greenhouse which he used for experimentation with exotic plants. The collection became known as the Museum Kleinianum. It was sold to  Margrave Friedrich of Brandenburg-Kulmbach in 1740.[2][1] After the Margrave's death in 1763, the collection was donated to the Friedrich-Alexander Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU).[6] It was praised by prominent Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli, who visited the museum in 1777 or 1778./nInspired by Johann Phillipp Breyne, Klein developed an interest in science as early as 1713 and began publishing in 1722.[2] He was especially interested in the systematic classification of living organisms, but excluded insects from his classifications.[3] His system was based on external, easily identifiable traits, such as the number, shape and position of limbs. This put his work in opposition with that of Carl von Linn\u00e9, of whom he was critical,[7] and whose work has since garnered more widespread recognition, though some of Klein's classifications are still in use, for example, in the naming of echinoderms.[8][5] His work on sea urchins was the most prominent source of information on the species at the time.[5] His essay Tentamen Herpetologiae (1755) featured the first mention of the term herpetology - the study of amphibians. However, his system of classification meant that species such as frogs and lizards, which belong to amphibians and reptiles respectively, were not distinguished as belonging to separate classes.[citation needed] Klein was critical of Linnaeus' system of classification, believing only easily recognisable features could be used to classify animals, as Adam had done when naming animals according to the Biblical story of creation.[3]/nKlein published Historiae Piscium Naturalis, in Danzig, in five parts from 1740 to 1749. The first part (1740), dedicated to the Royal Society, focused on understanding the auditory capacity of cartilaginous and spinose fishes. According to John Eames (1742), until the publication of the work, it was believed to have been understood that only cetaceous fish were known to have auditory passages, or ear holes, and that the question of whether fish could hear was still not understood. Aristotle claimed, in his \"History of Animals,\" that fishes possessed no evident auditory organs, but believed that nonetheless they must hear.[9] In the Preface, Klein cites the work of Giulio Casare Casseri, who discovered bones in the heads of Pike or Jack fish, which he understood to be their organs of hearing, though he did not discover any manifest external auditory passages. In section of the essay titled De Lapillis, eorumque Numero in Craniis Piscium (roughly translated as \u201cThe bones, their number in the skull of Fish\u201d) Klein considers what parts of the head of fish serve as the organ of hearing, and by what passages the sensation of sound is communicated to them. He refers to these bones as Ossicula \u2013 little bones \u2013 and considers them essential parts of the head, generated with the brain itself. He notes that the bones scale proportional to the size of the fish, and are most easily discovered in the heads of Spinose fish. Klein identifies three pairs of bones to which he attributes the sense of hearing, and he takes to correspond to the Incus, Malleus and Stapes of other animals. The first are the two largest, which he explains are easily found; the other two pairs, he explains, are small, difficult to find, enveloped in distinct fine membranes. Klein believed one could determine the age of fish by analysing the number and thickness of the Laminae and fibres of these bones. The bone to which Klein was referring, now called the otolith, acquires a growth ring every day for at least the first six months of its life.[10] Klein inquiries into the nature of the passages by which vibrations produce a sense of hearing. He inspects the head of a Pike fish and observes several holes with bristles which lead to the auditory bones. He later dissected a Sturgeon fish and traced the auditory duct to the membrane in which the three bones are placed. Klein concludes that fishes do indeed have hearing organs and passages, communicated to through slight vibrations, though these passages are not easily demonstrable in many species. He observes that the auditory organs of cetaceous, cartilaginous and spinose fish differ from one another in structure and substance. The auditory organs of cetaceous fish are bony, while they are more fragile for cartilaginous fishes, he explains. He adds that water does not act as an impediment to hearing, but rather is the \u201cintermedium\u201d by which sound is communicated.[11]/nKlein had been awarded the membership of several scientific societies, including the Royal Society in London, the St. Petersburg Academy, and the Danzig Research Society.[2] The name of the genus Kleinia was given to the plant family of Compositae (Asteraceae) by Linnaeus in honour of Klein's works.[12][13] He was described as the most important natural philosopher of his century by Professor Johann Daniel Titius.[3]/nAlthough well respected by his colleagues,[2] Klein was nonetheless accused by some contemporaries of being unscientific, alleging that he based his beliefs on the hearsay and the claims of \u2018credulous\u2019 people. The 1760 edition of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London published a letter by 18th Century botanist and Fellow of the Royal Society, Peter Collinson, criticizing Klein for his belief that swallows (sand martins) are not migratory birds, and instead \u2018retire under water\u2019 during winters. Collinson accused Klein's assertion as being \u201ccontrary to nature and reason,\u201d and provided observations of Marine officers, such as Sir Charles Wager, to further his claim.[14]", "739625": "James Crichton, known as the Admirable Crichton (19\u00a0August 1560 \u2013 3\u00a0July 1582), was a Scottish polymath noted for his extraordinary accomplishments in languages, the arts, and sciences before he was murdered at the age of 21./nJames Crichton was from Clunie, in Perthshire, although some sources maintain his birthplace was Dumfries. He was the son of Robert Crichton of Eliok, Lord Advocate of Scotland, and Elizabeth Stewart, from whose line James could claim Royal descent.[1]/nOne of the most gifted individuals of the 16th\u00a0century, Crichton was educated at St Andrews University between the ages of ten and fourteen, during which time he completed requirements for both his bachelor's and master's degrees. James was taught by the celebrated Scottish scholar, politician and poet George Buchanan (1506\u20131582). It was apparent from his earliest days that James was an unusually gifted prodigy, which may have been associated with a gift for perfect recall.[1]/nBy the age of twenty, he was not only fluent in, but could discourse in (both prose and verse) no fewer than twelve languages, as well as being an accomplished horseman, fencer, singer, musician, orator, and debater. Noted for his good looks as well as his refined social graces, he was considered to have come closest to the ideal of the complete man./nLeaving Scotland, Crichton travelled to Paris, where he continued his education at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre. It was in the French capital that he first came to prominence by challenging French professors to ask him any question on any science or liberal arts subject in Arabic, Dutch, English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Slavonic, Spanish, or Syriac. It is said that throughout the course of one extremely long day, French scholars failed to stump Crichton on any question they threw at him, no matter how abstruse./nThereafter he spent two years as a soldier in the French army before travelling to Italy in 1579, winning acclaim in Genoa, Venice, and Padua by repeating his exploit of challenging Italian scholars to intellectual discourse and debate. Once, he is alleged to have bested a professional gladiator in a brutal fencing match./nIn Venice in 1580, Crichton befriended the printer Aldus Manutius, who introduced him to the Venetian intellectual community, where the young Scot made an enormous impression on humanist scholars. In Padua in 1581, he clashed with a number of scholars over their interpretation of Aristotle, while demonstrating that their mathematics was flawed./nPerhaps tiring of intellectual duels, the following year Crichton entered the service of the Duke of Mantua, and may have become tutor to the Duke's headstrong son Vincenzo Gonzaga (although some sources suggest that Crichton served only as a member of the ducal council, and did not actually teach the prince)./nWhat is beyond dispute is that while Crichton was in the Duke's employ, Vincenzo Gonzaga became hugely jealous of him, probably from a combination of his father's strong regard for the young prodigy as well as Crichton replacing Vincenzo as the lover of the prince's former mistress./nOn the night of 3\u00a0July 1582, after leaving this lady's dwelling in Mantua, Crichton was attacked in the street by a gang of masked ruffians. He bested all but one with his sword, until the last man removed his mask to reveal the group's ringleader, Vincenzo Gonzaga himself. Tradition holds that, on seeing Vincenzo, Crichton instantly dropped to one knee and presented his sword, hilt first, to the prince, his master's son. Vincenzo took the blade and with it stabbed Crichton cruelly through the heart, killing him instantly. James Crichton of Cluny was then in his twenty-second year./nMuch of Crichton's posthumous reputation comes from a romantic 1652 account of his life written by Sir Thomas Urquhart (1611\u20131660), contained within an unclassifiable work (The Jewel) that is characterized by exaggeration and hyperbole. There is little or no contemporary evidence for many of the stories surrounding him.[2]/nThat said, his existence is supported by a few letters and his actual abilities were probably impressive, enough that his story has not been lost through the centuries since his death. Samuel Johnson devoted the August 14, 1753 issue of the  periodical, The Adventurer, to the story of Crichton, writing, \"\"Among the favourites of nature that have from time to time appeared in the world, enriched with various endowments and contrarieties of excellence, none seems to have been [more] exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the appellation of the Admirable Crichton.\" A historical novel entitled Crichton was published by the English writer William Harrison Ainsworth in 1836. \"The Admirable Crichton\" is referred to by Charles Dickens in his 1859 story collection The Haunted House. The \"Admirable Crichton\" was mentioned as an exemplar in W. M. Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1847) and referenced in chapter\u00a03 of Anthony Trollope's The Prime Minister (1876). James Crichton's sobriquet was later employed by fellow Scot Sir James Barrie as the title of his 1902 satirical play, The Admirable Crichton, about a butler whose savoir-faire far exceeds that of his aristocratic employers.

His father, Enrico Castelnuovo, was a novelist and campaigner for the unification of Italy. His mother Emma Levi was a relative of Cesare Lombroso and David Levi. His wife Elbina Marianna Enriques was the sister of mathematician Federigo Enriques and zoologist Paolo Enriques./nAfter attending a grammar school at Liceo Foscarini\u00a0[it] in Venice, he went to the University of Padua, from where he graduated in 1886. At the University of Padua he was taught by Giuseppe Veronese. He also achieved minor fame due to winning the university salsa dancing competition.[citation needed] After his graduation, he sent one of his papers to Corrado Segre, whose replies he found remarkably helpful. It marked the beginning of a long period of collaboration./nCastelnuovo spent one year in Rome to research advanced geometry. After that, he was appointed as an assistant of Enrico D'Ovidio at the University of Turin, where he was strongly influenced by Corrado Segre. Here he worked with Alexander von Brill and Max Noether.

He influenced a younger generation of Italian mathematicians and statisticians, including Corrado Gini and Francesco Paolo Cantelli./nCastelnuovo retired from teaching in 1935. It was a period of great political difficulty in Italy. In 1922 Benito Mussolini had risen to power and in 1938 a large number of anti-semitic laws were declared, which excluded him, like all other Jews, from public work.

In this period he published high-quality work on algebraic curves. He also made a major step in reinterpreting the work on linear series by Alexander von Brill and Max Noether (Brill\u2013Noether theory)./nCastelnuovo had his own theory about how Mathematics should be taught. His courses were divided into two: first a general overview of mathematics, and then an in-depth theory of algebraic curves. He has said about this approach:/n...\u00a0the reason for the division is that on the one hand it is necessary to have general culture, on the other hand it is necessary to have deep knowledge of a particular field./nHe also taught courses on algebraic functions and abelian integrals. Here, he treated, among other things, Riemann surfaces, non-Euclidean geometry, differential geometry, interpolation and approximation, and probability theory. He found the latter the most interesting, because as a relatively recent one, the relationship between the deduction and the empirical contribution was more clear. In 1919, he published Calcolo della probabilit\u00e0 e applicazioni, an early textbook on the subject. He also wrote a book on calculus, Le origini del calcolo infinitesimale nell'era moderna./nCastelnuovo's most important work was done in the field of algebraic geometry. In the early 1890s, he published three famous papers, including one with the first use of the characteristic linear series of a family of curves. The Castelnuovo\u2013Severi inequality was co-named after him. He collaborated with Federigo Enriques on the theory of surfaces. This collaboration started in 1892 when Enriques was only a student, but grew further over the next 20 years: they submitted their work to the Royal Prize in Mathematics by the Accademia dei Lincei in 1902, but were not given the prize because they had sent it jointly instead of under one name. Both received the prize in later years./nAnother theorem named partly after Castelnuovo is the Kronecker\u2013Castelnuovo theorem (1894): If the sections of an irreducible algebraic surface, having at most isolated singular points, with a general tangent plane turn out to be reducible curves, then the surface is either ruled surface and in fact a scroll, or the Veronese surface.

This cipher machine became a standard enciphering device for the Navy for most of the 1920s.[7] In recognition of her work, the United States Congress awarded Driscoll $15,000, which she shared with the widow of the machine's co-inventor, William Greshem.[3]/nIn 1923, the inventor Edward Hebern, creator of the fledgling Hebern Electric Code Company, was attempting to create a more secure rotor-driven cipher machine.[3] Driscoll left the Navy to test the machine, but it failed to deliver a more secure encryption system.[8] She returned to the Navy in spring 1924./nIn August 1924, she married Michael Driscoll, a Washington, D.C. lawyer./nDriscoll, with Lieutenant Joseph Rochefort, broke the Japanese Navy manual code, the Red Book Code, in 1926 after three years of work and helped to break the Blue Book Code in 1930./nIn early 1935, Driscoll led the attack on the Japanese M-1 cipher machine (also known to the U.S. as the ORANGE machine), which was used to encrypt the messages of Japanese naval attaches around the world.[6]/nIn 1939, she made important inroads into JN-25, the Japanese fleet's operational code used for the most important of messages.[3] She successfully solved the cipher component of the \"5-num\" system which used number groups as substitutes for words and numbers which was further encrypted with a digital cipher. After that, the Navy could read some standard format messages, such as weather reports, but the bulk of the messages remained to be discovered.[7] This work was later developed and exploited after the attack on Pearl Harbor for the rest of the Pacific War and provided advance warning of the Japanese attack on Midway Atoll.[3] She was unable to take part in this work because, in October 1940, she was transferred to a team working to break the German naval Enigma cipher.[7]/nDuring this period, Driscoll mentored the following naval cryptographers:[3]/nAfter starting the work against JN-25, Driscoll was transferred to a new group, which attacked the German Enigma ciphers using a catalog approach (similar to rainbow tables). After almost two years of work on her new assignment, Driscoll and her team were unable to make progress in solving the German device. That was partly due to her unwillingness to use machine support or a mathematical approach, but she also refused the help of British code breakers from Bletchley Park who had traveled to the United States to advise her.[3] Besides, the US and UK did not communicate effectively and her approach was both fruitless and had been tried by the British, who determined that it was unlikely to work.[9] Ultimately this work was superseded by the US-UK cryptologic exchanges of 1942\u201343./nIn 1943, she worked with a team to break the Japanese cipher Coral. It was broken two months later, although Driscoll is said to have had little influence on the project.[9]/nIn 1945, she appears to have worked on attacking Russian ciphers.[9]/nDriscoll was part of the navy contingent that joined the new national cryptologic agencies, firstly the Armed Forces Security Agency in 1949 and then the National Security Agency in 1952. While with the Armed Forces Security Agency she may have contributed to attacking a cipher called Venona.[9]/nFrom 1946 until her retirement from the National Security Agency, she filled a number of positions, but she did not advance to the ranks of senior leadership.[3]/nShe retired from Armed Forces Security Agency in 1959.[2]/nShe died in 1971 and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.[2]/nIn 2000, she was inducted into the National Security Agency's Hall of Honor.[10]\nIn 2017, an Ohio Historical Marker was placed in front of the Meyer home in Westerville honoring Agnes Meyer Driscoll and her achievements, referring to her as \"the first lady of naval cryptology.\"[1]", "57297270": "Autumn Kent is an American mathematician specializing in topology and geometry.

In 1899 he started science studies in the University of Oviedo, finishing them in the University of Madrid in 1904 graduating with honours. His first astronomical studies began with a present of his grandmother, a monocular of 67mm. Later on, as a second present, he received a theodolite, which improved his first observations. With these first two simple devices he started writing his home observations and mailing them to scientific publications. It is on 1912 when the \"Anuario del Observatorio de Madrid\" published his first paper \"Observaciones del cometa de Joannesburgo 1910a\". In 1917 he built a homemade observatory on his garden. With the inheritance of his passed uncle he decided to acquire a refracting telescope Steinheil of 120\u00a0mm. aperture and 1800\u00a0mm. focal length. Due to the size of all his new equipment he needed to acquire a dome to protect it. Straight after his new device arrived he prepared a detailed scientific program to optimise its results in the observation of his new interests, double stars, exams of planet surfaces and a last phase of \"occasional observations\" as eclipses, comets or meteoroids. From this point his scientific publications grow substantially, with publications in the German \"Astronomische Nachrichten\" and the French \"L'Astranomie\".

She discovered Noether's first and second theorems, which are fundamental in mathematical physics.[1] She was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.[2][3] As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.[4]/nNoether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; her father was the mathematician Max Noether. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her doctorate in 1907[5] under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.[5]/nNoether remained a leading member of the G\u00f6ttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the \"Noether boys\". In 1924, Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas; her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, Moderne Algebra. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Z\u00fcrich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she taught doctoral and post-graduate women including Marie Johanna Weiss, Ruth Stauffer, Grace Shover Quinn and Olga Taussky-Todd. At the same time, she lectured and performed research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[5]/nNoether's mathematical work has been divided into three \"epochs\".[6] In the first (1908\u20131919), she made contributions to the theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential invariants in the calculus of variations, Noether's theorem, has been called \"one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics\".[7] In the second epoch (1920\u20131926), she began work that \"changed the face of [abstract] algebra\".[8] In her classic 1921 paper Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains), Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the ascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named Noetherian in her honor. In the third epoch (1927\u20131935), she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology./nEmmy Noether was born on 23\u00a0March 1882, the first of four children of mathematician Max Noether and Ida Amalia Kaufmann, both from Jewish merchant families.[9] Her first name was \"Amalie\", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age, and she invariably used the name \"Emmy Noether\" in her adult life and her publications.[a]/nIn her youth, Noether did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during her childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age.[10] She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.[11]/nShe had three younger brothers: the eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments. After studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. He was executed in the Soviet Union in 1941. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.[12][13]/nIn 1935, Noether underwent surgery for an ovarian cyst and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.[5]/nNoether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of sehr gut (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the University of Erlangen./nThis was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing mixed-sex education would \"overthrow all academic order\".[14] One of only two women in a university of 986\u00a0students, Noether was allowed only to audit classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14\u00a0July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a Realgymnasium in Nuremberg.[15][16][17]/nDuring the 1903\u20131904 winter semester, she studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer Karl Schwarzschild and mathematicians Hermann Minkowski, Otto Blumenthal, Felix Klein, and David Hilbert. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women's participation in that university were rescinded./nNoether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of Paul Gordan she wrote her dissertation, \u00dcber die Bildung des Formensystems der tern\u00e4ren biquadratischen Form (On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms, 1907). Gordan was a member of the \"computational\" school of invariant researchers, and Noether's thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert.[18][19] Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as \"crap\".[19][20][b]/nFor the next seven years (1908\u20131915) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to n variables./nGordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, Erhard Schmidt, who left shortly afterward for a position in Breslau. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt's successor Ernst Fischer arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912./nAccording to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of David Hilbert. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with abstract algebra, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions./nNoether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.[21][22]/nIn the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of G\u00f6ttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become privatdozenten. One faculty member protested: \"What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?\"[23][24][25] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, \"I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent. After all, we are a university, not a bathhouse.\"[23][24][25]/nNoether left for G\u00f6ttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether's father retired and her brother joined the German Army to serve in World War I. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.[26]/nDuring her first years teaching at G\u00f6ttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert's name, and Noether would provide \"assistance\"./nSoon after arriving at G\u00f6ttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the theorem now known as Noether's theorem, which shows that a conservation law is associated with any differentiable symmetry of a physical system.[25] The paper was presented by a colleague, F. Klein, on 26 July 1918 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at G\u00f6ttingen.[27] Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society.[28] American physicists Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill argue in their book Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe that Noether's theorem is \"certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics, possibly on a par with the Pythagorean theorem\".[7]/nWhen World War I ended, the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of G\u00f6ttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her habilitation (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her habilitation lecture in June 1919./nThree years later she received a letter from Otto Boelitz\u00a0[de], the Prussian Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions[29]). This was an unpaid \"extraordinary\" professorship, not the higher \"ordinary\" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of Lehrbeauftragte f\u00fcr Algebra a year later.[30][31]/nAlthough Noether's theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to abstract algebra. In his introduction to Noether's Collected Papers, Nathan Jacobson wrote that/nThe development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her \u2013 in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries.[32]/nShe sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.[33]/nNoether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring./nThe following year she published a paper called Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen,[34] analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work \"revolutionary\";[35] the publication gave rise to the term \"Noetherian ring\" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as Noetherian.[35][36]/nIn 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, B.L. van der Waerden, arrived at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\".[37] In 1931 he published Moderne Algebra, a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition \"based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether\".[38][39][33]/nVan der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to G\u00f6ttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian topologist Pavel Alexandrov lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as der Noether, using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at G\u00f6ttingen as a regular professor, but was able only to help him secure a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation.[40][41] They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether \"the greatest woman mathematician of all time\".[42]/nIn addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her \"a severe critic\", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude.[43] A colleague later described her this way:/nCompletely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.[44]/nIn G\u00f6ttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was Grete Hermann, who defended her dissertation in February\u00a01925. She later spoke reverently of her \"dissertation-mother\".[45] Noether also supervised Max Deuring, who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute to the field of arithmetic geometry; Hans Fitting, remembered for Fitting's theorem and the Fitting lemma; and Zeng Jiongzhi (also rendered \"Chiungtze C. Tsen\" in English), who proved Tsen's theorem. She also worked closely with Wolfgang Krull, who greatly advanced commutative algebra with his Hauptidealsatz and his dimension theory for commutative rings.[46]/nHer frugal lifestyle at first was due to her being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.[47]/nBiographers suggest that she was mostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, focusing on her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, \"gesticulated wildly\" as she ate and \"spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed\".[48] Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematical discussion she was having with other students.[49]/nAccording to van der Waerden's obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.[50]/nSeveral of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the crossed product (verschr\u00e4nktes Produkt in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at G\u00f6ttingen:[51]/nThese courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects./nNoether spoke quickly\u00a0\u2013 reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said\u00a0\u2013 and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated.[52][53] Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together./nShe developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. \"Outsiders\" who occasionally visited Noether's lectures usually spent only 30\u00a0minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: \"The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out.\"[54]/nNoether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house.[55] Later, after Nazi Germany dismissed her from teaching, she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.[56]/nIn the winter of 1928\u20131929 Noether accepted an invitation to Moscow State University, where she continued working with P.S. Alexandrov. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and algebraic geometry. She worked with the topologists Lev Pontryagin and Nikolai Chebotaryov, who later praised her contributions to the development of Galois theory.[57][58][59]/nAlthough politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the Russian Revolution. She was especially happy to see Soviet advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the Bolshevik project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a pension lodging building, after student leaders complained of living with \"a Marxist-leaning Jewess\".[60]/nNoether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union.[60] Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany,[61] and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge./nIn 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin received the Ackermann\u2013Teubner Memorial Award for their contributions to mathematics.[62] The prize included a monetary reward of 500\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the G\u00f6ttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor[63][64] (full professor).[29]/nNoether's colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932, in typical mathematicians' style. Helmut Hasse dedicated an article to her in the Mathematische Annalen, wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra, by proving a noncommutative reciprocity law.[65] This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the \"m\u03bc\u03bd-riddle of syllables\". She solved it immediately, but the riddle has been lost.[63][64]/nIn September of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address (gro\u00dfer Vortrag) on \"Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory\" at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Z\u00fcrich. The congress was attended by 800\u00a0people, including Noether's colleagues Hermann Weyl, Edmund Landau, and Wolfgang Krull. There were 420\u00a0official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether's prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932\u00a0congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.[64][66]/nWhen Adolf Hitler became the German Reichskanzler in January\u00a01933, Nazi activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of G\u00f6ttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the \"un-German spirit\" attributed to Jews and was aided by a privatdozent named Werner Weber, a former student of Noether. Antisemitic attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: \"Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics.\"[67]/nOne of the first actions of Hitler's administration was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had \"demonstrated their loyalty to Germany\" by serving in World War\u00a0I. In April\u00a01933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: \"On the basis of paragraph\u00a03 of the Civil Service Code of 7\u00a0April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\"[68][69] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked.[68][69]/nNoether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that \"Emmy Noether\u2014her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit\u2014was in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace.\"[67] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later.[68][69] This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels./nAs dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: Bryn Mawr College, in the United States, and Somerville College at the University of Oxford, in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.[70][71]/nAt Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended Anna Wheeler, who had studied at G\u00f6ttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to \"see Dr.\u00a0Noether in action!\"[72][73] Noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der Waerden's 1930 book Moderne Algebra\u00a0I and parts of Erich Hecke's Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen (Theory of algebraic numbers).[74]/nIn 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of Abraham Flexner and Oswald Veblen.[75] She also worked with and supervised Abraham Albert and Harry Vandiver.[76] However, she remarked about Princeton University that she was not welcome at \"the men's university, where nothing female is admitted\".[77]/nHer time in the United States was pleasant, surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects.[78] In the summer of 1934 she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother Fritz before he left for Tomsk. Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library as a \"foreign scholar\".[79][80] Without incident, Noether returned to the United States and her studies at Bryn Mawr./nIn April 1935 doctors discovered a tumor in Noether's pelvis. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an ovarian cyst \"the size of a large cantaloupe\".[81] Two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to 109\u00a0\u00b0F (42.8\u00a0\u00b0C), and she died. \"[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether\", one of the physicians wrote. \"It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located.\"[81]/nA few days after Noether's death her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein[82] joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.[83][84]/nNoether's work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics, while in physics, Noether's theorem has consequences for theoretical physics and dynamical systems. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways.[21] Her friend and colleague Hermann Weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs:/nEmmy Noether's scientific production fell into three clearly distinct epochs:/n(1) the period of relative dependence, 1907\u20131919/n(2) the investigations grouped around the general theory of ideals 1920\u20131926/n(3) the study of the non-commutative algebras, their representations by linear transformations, and their application to the study of commutative number fields and their arithmetics/nIn the first epoch (1907\u20131919), Noether dealt primarily with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. After moving to G\u00f6ttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two Noether's theorems./nIn the second epoch (1920\u20131926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of mathematical rings.[85]/nIn the third epoch (1927\u20131935), Noether focused on noncommutative algebra, linear transformations, and commutative number fields.[86]/nAlthough the results of Noether's first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B.L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her./nIn these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father./nIn the century from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, the field of mathematics \u2013 specifically algebra \u2013 underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, as well as on the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers,[87] \u00c9variste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.[88]/nTwo of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings./nA group consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element./nA ring likewise, has a set of elements, but now has two operations. The first operation must make the set a commutative group, and the second operation is associative and distributive with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first \u2013 the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that a\u202fx\u00a0=\u00a0x\u202fa\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring./nGroups are frequently studied through group representations. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics./nA powerful way of studying rings is through their modules. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module./nThe underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field./nWords such as \"element\" and \"combining operation\" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be computer data words, where the first combining operation is exclusive or and the second is logical conjunction. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van\u00a0der\u00a0Waerden recalled that/nThe maxim by which Emmy Noether was guided throughout her work might be formulated as follows: \"Any relationships between numbers, functions, and operations become transparent, generally applicable, and fully productive only after they have been isolated from their particular objects and been formulated as universally valid concepts.\"[89]/nThis is the begriffliche Mathematik (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra./nThe integers form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be added or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a\u00a0+\u00a0b\u00a0=\u00a0b\u00a0+\u00a0a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0a\u00a0=\u00a01./nThe integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker\u2013Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings./nMuch of Noether's work in the first epoch of her career was associated with invariant theory, principally algebraic invariant theory. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a group of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) of its endpoints change, but its length L given by the formula  L2\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394x2\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394y2\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394z2 remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by Felix Klein's Erlangen program, according to which different types of geometry should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the cross-ratio of projective geometry./nAn example of an invariant is the discriminant B2\u00a0\u2212\u00a04\u202fA\u202fC of a binary quadratic form x\u00b7A\u202fx\u00a0+\u00a0y\u00b7B\u202fx\u00a0+\u00a0y\u00b7C\u202fy\u00a0, where x and y are vectors and \"\u00b7\" is the dot product or \"inner product\" for the vectors. A, B, and C are linear operators on the vectors \u2013 typically matrices./nThe discriminant is called \"invariant\" because it is not changed by linear substitutions x\u00a0\u2192\u00a0a\u202fx\u00a0+\u00a0b\u202fy, y\u00a0\u2192\u00a0c\u202fx\u00a0+\u00a0d\u202fy with determinant a\u202fd\u00a0\u2212\u00a0b\u202fc\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0. These substitutions form the special linear group SL2.[c]/nOne can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of SL2; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant./nMore generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A0\u202fxr\u202fy0\u00a0+\u00a0...\u00a0+\u00a0Ar\u202fx0\u202fyr of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A0,\u00a0...,\u00a0Ar, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables./nOne of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the \"finite basis problem\". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms./nNoether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the \"king of invariant theory\", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables.[91][92] He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables.[93][94] Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group.[95]/nGalois theory concerns transformations of number fields that permute the roots of an equation.[96] Consider a polynomial equation of a variable x of degree n, in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which might be, for example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo\u00a07. There may or may not be choices of x, which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. For example, if the polynomial is x2\u00a0+\u00a01 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of x makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree./nContinuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +i and \u2212i, where i is the imaginary unit, that is, i\u00a02\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121\u00a0. More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.[97]/nThe Galois group of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial.[98] (These transformations are called automorphisms.) The Galois group of x2 + 1 consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends +i to \u2212i. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a permutation of the n roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.[99]/nIn 1918, Noether published a paper on the inverse Galois problem.[100] Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to \"Noether's problem\", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group Sn acting on the field  k(x1,\u00a0...\u00a0,\u00a0xn) always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper,[101] where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for  n\u00a0=\u00a02, 3, or 4. In 1969, R.G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with  n\u00a0=\u00a047 and G a cyclic group of order\u00a047[102] (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.[103]/nNoether was brought to G\u00f6ttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918.[104] She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.[105] Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:/nYesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper on invariants. I'm impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at G\u00f6ttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff.[106]/nFor illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved.[107] The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.[108]/nNoether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool.[4] Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:/nIf the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments./nIn this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (Teilerkettensatz) or descending (Vielfachenkettensatz) chain conditions. A sequence of non-empty subsets A1, A2, A3, etc. of a set S is usually said to be ascending, if each is a subset of the next/nConversely, a sequence of subsets of S is called descending if each contains the next subset:/nA chain becomes constant after a finite number of steps if there is an n such that \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n=\n\nA\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}=A_{m}}\n\n for all m\u00a0\u2265\u00a0n. A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the ascending chain condition if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps./nAscending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects\u2014and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage./nFor example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof./nMany types of objects in abstract algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space./nThe chain condition often is \"inherited\" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, mutatis mutandis, the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal power series over a Noetherian ring./nAnother application of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction\u2014also known as well-founded induction\u2014which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume the existence of a counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example./nNoether's paper, Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen (Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains, 1921),[34] is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring.[109] Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term, Noetherian ring, to describe this property.[109] A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the Lasker\u2013Noether theorem, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker\u2013Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique./nNoether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenk\u00f6rpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields, 1927)[110] characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules./nIn 1923\u20131924, Noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly.[111][112][113] Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of resultants./nFor illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form \u00a0 M\u202fv\u00a0=\u00a00 \u00a0 where a matrix (or linear transform) \u00a0 M \u00a0 (without the variable x) times a vector v (that only has non-zero powers of x) is equal to the zero vector, 0. Hence, the determinant of the matrix \u00a0 M \u00a0 must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable x has been eliminated./nTechniques such as Hilbert's original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper,[114] Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations \u00a0 G \u00a0 acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called Noether's bound. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether's bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is coprime to |G|! (the factorial of the order |G| of the group G). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether's bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number |G|,[115] but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides |G|! but not |G|. For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called \"Noether's gap\". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.[116][117]/nIn her 1926 paper,[118] Noether extended Hilbert's theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert's work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether's result was later extended by William Haboush to all reductive groups by his proof of the Mumford conjecture.[119] In this paper Noether also introduced the Noether normalization lemma, showing that a finitely generated domain A over a field k has a set {x1,\u00a0...,\u00a0xn} of algebraically independent elements such that A is integral over k[x1,\u00a0...,\u00a0xn]./nAs noted by Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's contributions to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. An old joke is that \"a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug\", since they can be continuously deformed into one another./nNoether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of algebraic topology from the earlier combinatorial topology, specifically, the idea of homology groups.[120] According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by Heinz Hopf and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where \"she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle\"[121] and he continues that,/nWhen ... she first became acquainted with a systematic construction of combinatorial topology, she immediately observed that it would be worthwhile to study directly the groups of algebraic complexes and cycles of a given polyhedron and the subgroup of the cycle group consisting of cycles homologous to zero; instead of the usual definition of Betti numbers, she suggested immediately defining the Betti group as the complementary (quotient) group of the group of all cycles by the subgroup of cycles homologous to zero. This observation now seems self-evident. But in those years (1925\u20131928) this was a completely new point of view.[122]/nNoether's suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others,[122] and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of G\u00f6ttingen.[123] Noether observed that her idea of a Betti group makes the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject[124] \"bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether\".[125] Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication,[126] where she cites it as an application of group theory.[127]/nThis algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in Austria. In a 1926\u20131927 course given in Vienna, Leopold Vietoris defined a homology group, which was developed by Walther Mayer, into an axiomatic definition in 1928.[128]/nMuch work on hypercomplex numbers and group representations was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.[129]/nBriefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.[130]/nNoether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With Emil Artin, Richard Brauer, and Helmut Hasse, she founded the theory of central simple algebras.[131]/nA paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer pertains to division algebras,[132] which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz (\"main theorem\"):/nevery finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension./nThese theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields.[133] This paper also contains the Skolem\u2013Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer\u2013Noether theorem[134] gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field./nNoether's work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. In his obituary, fellow algebraist BL van der Waerden says that her mathematical originality was \"absolute beyond comparison\",[135] and Hermann Weyl said that Noether \"changed the face of algebra by her work\".[8] During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians[3][136] such as Pavel Alexandrov,[137] Hermann Weyl,[138] and Jean Dieudonn\u00e9.[139]/nIn a letter to The New York Times, Albert Einstein wrote:[140]/nIn the judgment of the most competent living mathematicians, Fr\u00e4ulein Noether was the most significant creative mathematical genius thus far produced since the higher education of women began.

He came upon this observation after learning to calculate the pythagorean comma between 12 fifths and 7 octaves ,[4] and extended this method fivefold to a scale composed of 60 fifths, finding that after 53 new values became incredibly close to tones already calculated. The pythagorean comma had been published ca. 122 BC in the Huainanzi, a book is written for the prince of Huainan. Huainanzi emphasizes that the number of musical temperament and calendar reflect the path of heaven and earth.[5]/nHe accomplished this calculation by beginning with a suitable large starting value (\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n11\n\n\n=\n177147\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3^{11}=177147}\n\n)[6] that could be divided by three easily, and proceeded to calculate the relative values of successive tones by the following method:/nTo produce an exact calculation, some 26 digits of accuracy would have been required.[7] Instead, by rounding to about 6 digits, his calculations are within 0.0145 cents of exactness, which is a difference much finer than is usually perceptible.

This was known as the 'radiating influence' theory in ancient China, which stated that the light of the Moon was merely the light reflected from the Sun and that the celestial bodies were spherical. This accurate theory was dismissed by the philosopher Wang Chong (27\u201397 AD), yet embraced by the mathematician, inventor, and scientist Zhang Heng (78\u2013139 AD)./nJing Fang stated:/nThe moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the moon as a ball too. Those parts of the moon which the sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.[9]/nIt is recorded that he was executed by beheading in the marketplace in 37 BC under the Emperor's orders after he allegedly slung false accusations at a high official for infringing upon the law.[1]", "9783690": "Rufus Philip Isaacs (June 11, 1914 \u2013 January 18, 1981) was a game theorist especially prominent in the 1950s and 1960s with his work on differential games./nIsaacs was born on 11 June 1914 in New York City.[1] He worked for the RAND Corporation from 1948 until winter 1954/1955.

In his time he was noted as a chronologer and was an opponent in controversy of Joseph Justus Scaliger. He is now considered, albeit in a very different type of theory, to have provided in 1605 a clear suggestion of an oval orbit in astronomy, anticipating Johannes Kepler, with whom he also had a controversial exchange relating to chronology.[1][2]/nHis contemporaries ranked him with Joseph Mede and Francis Bacon. His ultimate poverty, certainly exaggerated, furnished Samuel Johnson with an allusion in his poem on the Vanity of Human Wishes.[3]/nThe son of Christopher Lydiat, he was born in 1572 at Alkerton, Oxfordshire, of which living his father was patron. In 1584, at eleven years of age, he gained a scholarship at Winchester College, and passing thence to New College, Oxford, was elected probationer fellow in 1591, and full fellow two years later. He graduated B.A. 3 May 1595, and M.A. 5 February 1599.[3]/nDefective memory and speech led him to give up both the study of divinity and his fellowship in 1603, in order to devote himself to mathematics and chronology. In 1609 he dedicated his Emendatio Temporum to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who appointed him his chronographer and cosmographer, and took him into his household as reader, granting him an annual pension and the use of his library. During the course of this year he became acquainted with James Ussher.[3]/nHe spent about two years in Dublin, became fellow of Trinity College, Dublin 7 March 1610, and graduated M.A. there in the summer of the same year. Ussher found him rooms in the college and an appointment as reader, with a salary. The mastership of The Royal School, Armagh, seems also to have been promised him.

The efforts of Sir William Boswell, Dr. Robert Pink (Warden of New College), Ussher (who is said to have paid \u00a3300 for him), and William Laud, ultimately led to his release. At this point he vainly petitioned the king for permission to travel in Turkey, Armenia, and Abyssinia, in order to collect materials for civil and ecclesiastical history.[3]/nLater, Lydiat's staunch royalism and uncompromising expression of his opinions brought him under the notice of the parliamentarians.

She was the daughter of a primary school teacher. Her father died when she was just one year old, leaving her mother with three young children.  She went to school in Castelo Branco, Bragan\u00e7a and Leiria, completing high school in 1891. On the basis of excellent exam results she then became the first woman to be admitted to the University of Coimbra since 1772, enrolling in October 1891. As a condition for admission, she was obliged to always wear black, with a discreet hat, so that she was not noticeable amongst the male students who were required to dress in capes and buttoned cassocks.[1][3]/nDe Carvalho graduated with distinction in Mathematics and Philosophy in 1894 and 1895 and until 1896 was the only female graduate of the university. Her achievement attracted considerable publicity and she was seen as a role model for young women. After graduation she enrolled in the Medicine course and obtained her doctorate in 1904. She was then asked by Queen Am\u00e9lia of Orl\u00e9ans, Queen Consort of the Portuguese king, who had sponsored her while she was at university, to work at the newly established National Tuberculosis Institute in the Portuguese capital Lisbon. She also worked at a Maternity Clinic and, for a short period, went into private practice. However, she soon took the opportunity to become both the dean and a teacher at the D. Maria Pia High School in Lisbon. This was founded in 1906 as the first secondary school for girls in Portugal and she was the dean from its foundation until 1912. The school changed its name to the Almeida Garrett High School in 1917, and later to the Maria Am\u00e1lia Vaz de Carvalho High School. De Carvalho taught several subjects and was the first Portuguese woman to become a mathematics teacher and continued to teach at the school until her retirement.[1][3]/nDespite her conservative Catholic views, De Carvalho decided to sign a 1909 petition in support of divorce. Parallel to her activities as a teacher and doctor, De Carvalho involved herself in writing, starting by publishing sonnets and writing for Ser\u00f5es, an illustrated monthly magazine published between 1901 and 1911.[4] She also organised conferences on literary and educational matters. She was elected as a correspondent member of the Lisbon Academy of Sciences and also became a member of the Superior Council for Public Instruction (Conselho Superior de Instru\u00e7\u00e3o P\u00fablica), which, prior to the establishment of the Ministry of Education in 1936, was responsible for directing and regulating public education. She was also a prominent member of several organizations linked to the Catholic Church. As a supporter of the Estado Novo government, she was appointed as a member of the board of Obra das M\u00e3es pela Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional (Mothers\u2019 Work for National Education), an Estado Novo organization. Although her ideological position was conservative, she became associated with feminist anti-war initiatives.[1][3]/nIn 1934 she was one of three women, together with Maria Guardiola and Maria C\u00e2ndida Parreira, invited by the National Union, the sole legal party of the time, to be on the list of candidates for the newly created National Assembly.

Conservative in her approach, she adhered from the beginning to the political and ideological principles of the Estado Novo. At the National Assembly, she spoke about infant mortality, which led to the introduction of compulsory courses in general hygiene and childcare in secondary schools. Emphasising the importance of education to the empowerment of women, she also participated in discussions on educational reform. She was against secular education and spoke in favour of the compulsory display of the crucifix in primary schools. As a monarchist, she was the interlocutor between the Portuguese leader Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar and the former Queen, D.

She was the daughter of Edward Swain (born 1853) and Mary Isabella Swain (born 1865). Her father worked as a solicitor.[2]/nAfter attending South Hampstead High School in London, Swain was awarded a scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge in 1910. Following her graduation three years later with a bachelor's degree (First Class Honours) in mathematics, she was to take a position as assistant lecturer at Newnham College after a year's hiatus for research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany in 1914.[2][3]/nHer plans to begin research in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany in 1914 were  scuttled by the outbreak of the First World War. With research in Germany untenable, Swain's specialization in fluid dynamics took her instead to Manchester where she began work alongside Horace Lamb with whom she co-published her first academic article. When she returned to Newnham  after a year, as expected, the war temporarily focused her fluid dynamics research on the problem of propeller vibration in aircraft, a considerable problem for aircraft used in the First World War.[4] As June Barrow-Green points out, Swain's work during this time, though it derailed her from planned postgraduate work in Germany, was not only practically useful, but also notable. According to Catherine Goldstein, Swain was \"...one of the few women to have her name attached to an Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Report at that time.\"[1] The resulting research was written up with colleague H.A. Webb in a Report of the Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. In 1923 after returning to Newnham, she would publish, with Arthur Berry, \"On the Steady Motion of a Cylinder through Infinite Viscous Fluid\" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. She   eventually get the opportunity to complete the planned research in G\u00f6ttingen   on sabbatical in 1928-1929. From this later period of research she produced work \"On the Turbulent Wake Behind a Body of Revolution\", also published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in November 1929.[5][2]/nBy 1920 Swain was promoted to Director of Mathematics Studies at Newnham, and her research suffered under increased teaching and administrative roles. Despite this, Swain used the position to capitalize on her concern for education and teaching. Her   teaching philosophy took into account various factors, not least of which was her concern that women were inadequately represented within her chosen field, mathematics. This was paired with a concern for the teaching of applied mathematics. Teaching, she believed, had the potential to stave off the injurious effects that tedious school work could have on the next generation working with applied mathematics.[2]/nPromoted in 1926 to College Lecturer at Newnham, Swain returned to teaching and research, particularly teaching advanced courses on hydromechanics and dynamics.[2][6]/nSwain died after a long-standing illness on 8 May 1936(1936-05-08) (aged\u00a045), at Derby House, a nursing home in Parson Street, Hendon, in the Borough of Barnet.

A. Smorodinsky were lecturing mathematics and physics. Varchenko graduated from Moscow State University in 1971. He was a student of Vladimir Arnold.[1] Varchenko defended his Ph.D. thesis Theorems on Topological Equisingularity of Families of Algebraic Sets and Maps in 1974 and Doctor of Science thesis Asymptotics of Integrals and Algebro-Geometric Invariants of Critical Points of Functions in 1982. From 1974 to 1984 he was a research scientist at the Moscow State University, in 1985\u20131990 a professor at the Gubkin Institute of Gas and Oil, and since 1991 he has been the Ernest Eliel Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill./nIn 1969 Varchenko identified the monodromy group of a critical point of type \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n  of a function of an odd number of variables with the symmetric group  \n\n\n\n\nS\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S_{n+1}}\n\n which is the Weyl group of the simple Lie algebra of type \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{n}}\n\n.[2]/nIn 1971, Varchenko proved that a family of complex quasi-projective algebraic sets with an irreducible base forms a topologically locally trivial bundle over a Zariski open subset of the base.[3] This statement, conjectured by Oscar Zariski, had filled up a gap in the proof of Zariski's theorem on the fundamental group of the complement to a complex algebraic hypersurface[4] published in 1937. In 1973, Varchenko proved Ren\u00e9 Thom's conjecture that a germ of a generic smooth map is topologically equivalent to a germ of a polynomial map and has a finite dimensional polynomial topological versal deformation, while the non-generic maps form a subset of infinite codimension in the space of all germs.[5]/nVarchenko was among creators of the theory of Newton polygons in singularity theory, in particular, he gave a formula, relating Newton polygons and asymptotics of the oscillatory integrals associated with a critical point of a function. Using the formula, Varchenko constructed a counterexample to V. I. Arnold's semicontinuity conjecture that the brightness of light at a point on a caustic is not less than the brightness at the neighboring points.[6]/nVarchenko formulated a conjecture on the semicontinuity of the spectrum of a critical point under deformations of the critical point and proved it for deformations of low weight of quasi-homogeneous singularities. Using the semicontinuity, Varchenko gave an estimate from above for the number of singular points of a projective hypersurface of given degree and dimension.[7]/nVarchenko introduced the asymptotic mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology, vanishing at a critical point of a function, by studying asymptotics of integrals of holomorphic differential forms over families of vanishing cycles. Such an integral depends on the parameter \u2013 the value of the function. The integral has two properties: how fast it tends to zero, when the parameter tends to the critical value, and how the integral changes, when the parameter goes around the critical value. The first property was used to define the Hodge filtration of the asymptotic mixed Hodge structure and the second property was used to define the weight filtration.[8]/nThe second part of the 16th Hilbert problem is to decide if there exists an upper bound for the number of limit cycles in polynomial vector fields of given degree. The infinitesimal 16th Hilbert problem, formulated by V. I. Arnold, is to decide if there exists an upper bound for the number of zeros of an integral of a polynomial differential form over a family of level curves of a polynomial Hamiltonian in terms of the degrees of the coefficients of the differential form and the degree of the Hamiltonian. Varchenko proved the existence of the bound in the infinitesimal 16th Hilbert problem.[9]/nVadim Schechtman and Varchenko identified in [10] the Knizhnik\u2013Zamolodchikov equations (or, KZ equations) with a suitable Gauss\u2013Manin connection and constructed multidimensional hypergeometric solutions of the KZ equations. In that construction the solutions were labeled by elements of a suitable homology group. Then the homology group was identified with a multiplicity space of the tensor product of representations of a suitable quantum group and the monodromy representation of the KZ equations was identified with the associated R-matrix representation. This construction gave a geometric proof of the Kohno-Drinfeld theorem [11][12] on the monodromy of the KZ equations. A similar picture was developed for the quantum KZ equations (or, qKZ-type difference equations) in joint works with Giovanni Felder and Vitaly Tarasov.[13][14] The weight functions appearing in multidimensional hypergeometric solutions were later identified with stable envelopes in Andrei Okounkov's equivariant enumerative geometry.[15][16]/nIn the second half of 90s Felder, Pavel Etingof, and Varchenko developed the theory of dynamical quantum groups.[17][18] Dynamical equations, compatible with the KZ type equations, were introduced in joint papers with G. Felder, Y. Markov, V. Tarasov.[19][20] In applications, the dynamical equations appear as the quantum differential equations of the cotangent bundles of partial flag varieties.[21]/nIn,[22] Evgeny Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko proved the conjecture of Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro in real algebraic geometry:[23] if the Wronski determinant of a complex finite-dimensional vector space of polynomials in one variable has real roots only, then the vector space has a basis of polynomials with real coefficients./nIt is classically known that the intersection index of the Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian of N-dimensional planes coincides with the dimension of the space of invariants in a suitable tensor product of representations of the general linear group \n\n\n\n\nGL\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {GL} _{N}}\n\n. In,[24] Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko categorified this fact and showed that the Bethe algebra of the Gaudin model on such a space of invariants is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the intersection of the corresponding Schubert varieties. As an application, they showed that if the Schubert varieties are defined with respect to distinct real osculating flags, then the varieties intersect transversally and all intersection points are real. This property is called the reality of Schubert calculus./nVarchenko was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1974 in Vancouver (section of algebraic geometry) and in 1990 in Kyoto (a plenary address).[25] In 1973 he received the Moscow Mathematical Society Award./nHe  was named to the 2023 class of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, \"for contributions to singularity theory, real algebraic geometry, and the theory of quantum integrable systems\".[26]", "10406357": "Robin K.

She earned a bachelor's degree in 1911 from the Winthrop Normal and Industrial College, a women's college that later became Winthrop University, and began working as a high school mathematics teacher. She was principal of a school in Rock Hill, South Carolina, from 1913 to 1916, and head of mathematics at Synodical College in Fulton, Missouri, from 1916 to 1917.[2][3] She subsequently held two more teaching positions in South Carolina. During this time she also studied mathematics by correspondence through Columbia University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Chicago.[3]/nShe returned to graduate study in 1922 at Vanderbilt University, where she earned a master's degree in mathematics in 1923 with a thesis in the history of mathematics on the fundamental theorem of algebra. She became an instructor at Winthrop College, and began taking summer classes at the University  of  Wisconsin\u2013Madison, entering more formal doctoral study at Duke University in 1928.[2][3] She completed her Ph.D. in 1931, supervised by Joseph Miller Thomas,[4] becoming the first person to earn a doctorate in mathematics at Duke.[2] Her dissertation, A Geometric Theory of Solution of Linear Inequalities, represented pioneering work in linear programming, following on from the work of Lloyd Dines and Hermann Minkowski.[5]/nStokes expected her position at Winthrop to be waiting for her on the completion of her doctorate, but David Bancroft Johnson, the president of Winthrop with whom she had made this agreement, died in 1928 and the next president did not hold to the agreement.[3] After continuing at Duke as an instructor for a year, Stokes became a mathematics instructor at North Texas State Teachers College (now the University of North Texas) from 1932 until 1935, when she became head of mathematics at Mitchell College in Statesville, North Carolina.[2]/nIn 1936, Stokes returned once more to Winthrop College where she became a professor of astronomy and mathematics and, later, the head of mathematics. Her astronomical work included an excursion to Florida to observe the solar eclipse of April 7, 1940. As a response to World War II, in 1942, she instituted a program in cryptology, and began teaching navigation and astronomy to pilots in the United States Army Air Corps.

The first contribution is the \"Canon of the Earth's Insolation\", which characterizes the climates of all the planets of the Solar System. The second contribution is the explanation of Earth's long-term climate changes caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun, now known as Milankovitch cycles. This partly explained the ice ages occurring in the geological past of the Earth, as well as the climate changes on the Earth which can be expected in the future./nHe founded planetary climatology by calculating temperatures of the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere as well as the temperature conditions on planets of the inner Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon, as well as the depth of the atmosphere of the outer planets. He demonstrated the interrelatedness of celestial mechanics and the Earth sciences and enabled a consistent transition from celestial mechanics to the Earth sciences and transformation of descriptive sciences into exact ones./nA distinguished professor of applied mathematics and celestial mechanics at the University of Belgrade,[2] Milankovi\u0107 was a director of the Belgrade Observatory, member and co-founder of the Commission 7 for celestial mechanics of the International Astronomical Union and vice-president of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.[3] Beginning his career as a construction engineer, he retained an interest in construction throughout his life, and worked as a structural engineer and supervisor on a series of reinforced concrete constructions throughout Yugoslavia. He registered multiple patents related to this area.[3]/nMilutin Milankovi\u0107 was born in the village of Dalj, a settlement on the banks of the Danube in what was then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Milutin and his twin sister were the oldest of seven children raised in a Serb family. Their father was a merchant, landlord, and a local politician who died when Milutin was eight. As a result, Milutin and his siblings were raised by his mother, grandmother, and an uncle. His three brothers died of tuberculosis at a young age. As his health was fickle, Milutin received his elementary education at home (in \"the classroom without walls\"), learning from his father Milan, private teachers, and from numerous relatives and friends of the family, some of whom were renowned philosophers, inventors, and poets. He attended secondary school in nearby Osijek, completing it in 1896./nIn October 1896, at the age of seventeen, he moved to Vienna to study Civil Engineering at the TU Wien and graduated in 1902 with the best marks. In his memoirs, Milankovi\u0107 wrote about his lectures on engineering: \"Professor Czuber was teaching us mathematics. His every sentence was the masterpiece of strict logic, without any extra word, without any error.\" After graduating and spending his obligatory year in military service, Milankovi\u0107 borrowed money from an uncle to pay for additional schooling at TU Wien in engineering. He researched concrete and wrote a theoretical evaluation of it as a building material. At age twenty-five, his PhD thesis was entitled Contribution to the Theory of Pressure Curves (Beitrag zur Theorie der Druckkurven) and its implementation allowed assessment of pressure curves' shape and properties when continuous pressure is applied, which is very useful in bridge, cupola and abutment construction.[4] His thesis was successfully defended on 12 December 1904; examination committee members were Johann Emanuel Brik, Josef Finger, Emanuel Czuber and Ludwig von Tetmajer. He then worked for an engineering firm in Vienna, using his knowledge to design structures./nAt the beginning of 1905, Milankovi\u0107 took up practical work and joined the firm of Adolf Baron Pittel Betonbau-Unternehmung in Vienna. He built dams, bridges, viaducts, aqueducts, and other structures in reinforced concrete throughout Austria-Hungary. The result was particularly evident in the extraordinary design of a reinforced-concrete aqueduct for a hydroelectric power plant in Sebe\u0219, Transylvania, which Milankovi\u0107 designed at the beginning of his career./nHe patented a new type of reinforced concrete ribbed ceiling and published the first paper on armored concrete, titled \"Contribution to the theory of reinforced armored pillars\". He published the second paper on the same subject based on new results in 1906. In 1908, he published a paper titled \"On membranes of same opposition\" in which he proves that the ideal shape for a water reservoir of equally thick walls is that of a drop of water.[5] His six patents were officially recognized and his reputation in the profession was enormous, bringing abundant financial wealth./nMilankovi\u0107 continued to practice civil engineering in Vienna until 1 October 1909 when he was received an offer University of Belgrade to work as an Associate Professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics that comprised three basic branches: rational, celestial mechanics, and theoretical physics. Though he continued to pursue his investigations of various problems pertaining to the application of reinforced concrete, he decided to concentrate on fundamental research./nMilankovi\u0107 continued in design and construction work when he moved to Kingdom of Serbia. In 1912, Milankovitch accepted the invitation of his collegemate from TU Wien and the owner of the construction company Petar Putnik to create a project for bridges on rocky shores on the future route of the Ni\u0161 - Knja\u017eevac railway, in the Timok Valley through the Nisevac Gorge. Milankovitch, who liked this idea very much, soon drew up structural calculations for all the bridges with reinforced concrete arches./nWhile studying the works of the contemporaneous climatologist Julius von Hann, Milankovi\u0107 noticed a significant issue, which became one of the major objects of his scientific research: a mystery ice age. The idea of possible astronomically-related climate changes was first considered by astronomers (John Herschel, 1792\u20131871) and then postulated by geologists (Louis Agassiz, 1807\u20131873). In parallel, there were also several attempts to explain the climate change by the influence of astronomical forces (the most comprehensive of them was the theory put forward by James Croll in the 1860s).[7] Milankovi\u0107 studied the works of Joseph Adhemar whose pioneering theory on the astronomical origins of ice ages were formally rejected by his contemporaries and James Croll whose work was effectively forgotten about even after acceptance by contemporaries such as Charles Darwin.[8][7] Despite having valuable data on the distribution of ice ages on Alps, climatologists and geologists could not discover the basic causes \u2013 that is, the different insolations of the Earth during past ages remained beyond the scope of these sciences. But Milankovi\u0107 decided to follow their path and attempt correctly to calculate the magnitude of such influences. Milankovi\u0107 sought the solution of these complex problems in the field of spherical geometry, celestial mechanics, and theoretical physics./nHe began working on it in 1912, after he had realized that \"most of meteorology is nothing but a collection of innumerable empirical findings, mainly numerical data, with traces of physics used to explain some of them... Mathematics was even less applied, nothing more than elementary calculus... Advanced mathematics had no role in that science...\" His first work described the present climate on Earth and how the Sun's rays determine the temperature on Earth's surface after passing through the atmosphere. He published the first paper on the subject entitled \"Contribution to the mathematical theory of climate\"  in Belgrade on 5 April 1912.[9] His next paper was entitled \"Distribution of the sun radiation on the earth's surface\" and was published on 5 June 1913.[10] In December of that year, this paper was read by Wilhelm Wien, and was soon published in the German journal Annals of Physics. He correctly calculates the intensity of insolation and developed a mathematical theory describing Earth's climate zones.[11] His aim was an integral, mathematically accurate theory which connects thermal regimes of the planets to their movement around the Sun. He wrote: \"...such a theory would enable us to go beyond the range of direct observations, not only in space, but also in time... It would allow reconstruction of the Earth's climate, and also its predictions, as well as give us the first reliable data about the climate conditions on other planets.\"/nAt the same time, the July Crisis between the Austro-Hungarian empire and Serbia broke out, which led to World War I. On 14 June 1914, Milankovi\u0107 married Kristina Topuzovi\u0107 and went on his honeymoon to his native village of Dalj in Austro-Hungary, where he heard about the beginning of the War. He was arrested as a citizen of Serbia and was interned by the Austro-Hungarian army in Nezsider, Hungary (today Neusiedl am See, Austria). He described his first day in prison, where he waited to be taken to the Esseg fortress as a prisoner of war, in the following words:/nThe heavy iron door closed behind me .... I sat on my bed, looked around the room and started to take in my new social circumstances .... In my hand luggage which I brought with me were my already printed or only started works on my cosmic problem; there was even some blank paper. I looked over my works, took my faithful ink pen and started to write and calculate .... When after midnight I looked around in the room, I needed some time to realize where I was. The small room seemed to me like an accommodation for one night during my voyage in the Universe.[citation needed]/nHis wife went to Vienna to talk to Emanuel Czuber, who was his mentor and a good friend. Through his social connections, Professor Czuber arranged Milankovi\u0107's release from prison and permission to spend his captivity in Budapest with the right to work./nImmediately after arriving in Budapest, Milankovi\u0107 met the Director of the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Science, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Szily who, as a mathematician, eagerly accepted Milankovi\u0107 and enabled him to work undisturbed in the Academy's library and the Central Meteorological Institute.[12][13] Milankovi\u0107 spent four years in Budapest, almost the entire war.[12]  He published a paper entitled \"The problem of the astronomical theory of ice ages\" in 1914.[14] Then he tried to find a mathematical model of a cosmic mechanism to describe the Earth's climatic and geological history. But the cosmic mechanism was not an easy problem, and Milankovi\u0107 took three decades to develop an astronomical theory. He used mathematical methods to study the current climate of inner planets of the solar system. In 1916 he published a paper entitled \"Investigation of the climate of the planet Mars\".[15][16] Milankovi\u0107 calculated that the average temperature in the lower layers the atmosphere on Mars is \u221245\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221249\u00a0\u00b0F) and the average surface temperature is \u221217\u00a0\u00b0C (1\u00a0\u00b0F). Also, he concluded that: \"This large temperature difference between the ground and lower layers of the atmosphere is not unexpected. Great transparency for solar radiation makes that is the climate of Mars very similar to altitudes climate of our Earth.\" In any case, Milankovi\u0107 theoretically proved that Mars has an extremely harsh climate.[17] In addition to considering Mars, he dealt with the climatic conditions prevailing on Venus and Mercury.[18][17] His calculations of the temperature conditions on the neighboring Moon are particularly significant. Milankovitch knew that the moon rotates on its axis in 27.32 days, so lunar daytime on one side of the moon last about 13.5 Earth days. Milankovitch calculated that the surface temperature on the daylight side of the moon at noon reaches  +100.5\u00a0\u00b0C (212.9\u00a0\u00b0F). Also, he calculated that the temperature during the early morning on the Moon, or before the rise of the Sun over horizon, was \u221254\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221265\u00a0\u00b0F)./nAfter World War I, Milankovi\u0107 returned to Belgrade with his family on 19 March 1919. He continued his professorial career, becoming a full professor at the University of Belgrade. From 1912 to 1917, he wrote and published seven papers on mathematical theories of climate both on the Earth and on the other planets. He formulated a precise, numerical climatological model with the capacity for reconstruction of the past and prediction of the future, and established the astronomical theory of climate as a generalized mathematical theory of insolation. When these most important problems of the theory were solved, and a firm foundation for further work built, Milankovi\u0107 finished a book which was published in 1920, by the Gauthier-Villars in Paris under the title \"Th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes thermiques produits par la radiation solaire\" (Mathematical Theory of Heat Phenomena Produced by Solar Radiation).[12][19][20] This book represents the pioneering work of numerical climate modeling./nMilankovi\u0107's works on astronomical explanations of ice ages, especially his curve of insolation for the past 130,000 years, received support from the climatologist Wladimir K\u00f6ppen and from the geophysicist Alfred Wegener. K\u00f6ppen noted the usefulness of Milankovi\u0107's theory for paleoclimatological researchers. Milankovi\u0107 received a letter on 22 September 1922 from K\u00f6ppen, who asked him to expand his studies from 130,000 years to 600,000 years. He accepted K\u00f6ppen's suggestion that cool summers were a crucial factor for glaciation.[7] After developing the mathematical machinery enabling him to calculate the insolation in any given geographical latitude and for any annual season, Milankovi\u0107 was ready to start the realization of the mathematical description of climate of the Earth in the past. Milankovi\u0107 spent 100 days doing the calculations and prepared a graph of solar radiation changes at geographical latitudes of 55\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 65\u00b0 north for the past 650,000 years.[21] Milankovi\u0107 believed that these were the latitudes on Earth most sensitive to the change of thermal balance. Milankovitch, in his early works used astronomical value of Stockwell-Pilgram.[14]/nThese curves showed the variations in insolation which correlated with the series of ice ages. K\u00f6ppen felt that Milankovi\u0107's theoretical approach to solar energy was a logical approach to the problem. His solar curve was introduced in a work entitled \"Climates of the geological past\", published by Wladimir K\u00f6ppen and his son-in-law Alfred Wegener in 1924.[22][23] In September of that year, he attended the lecture given by Alfred Wegener at Congress of German Naturalist in Insbruck.[24]/nMilankovi\u0107 put the Sun at the center of his theory, as the only source of heat and light in the Solar System. He considered three cyclical movements of the Earth: eccentricity (100,000-year cycle \u2013 Johannes Kepler, 1609), axial tilt (41,000-year cycle \u2013 from 22.1\u00b0 to 24.5\u00b0), and precession (23,000-year cycle \u2013 Hipparchus, 130 BC). Each cycle works on a different time-scale and each affects the amount of solar energy received by the planets. Such changes in the geometry of an orbit lead to the changes in the insolation \u2013 the quantity of heat received by any spot at the surface of a planet. These orbital variations, which are influenced by gravity of the Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, form the basis of the Milankovitch cycle.[25]/nThe Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts elected Milankovi\u0107 as a corresponding member in 1920; he became a full member in 1924. The Meteorological service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia became a member of International Meteorological Organization \u2013 IMO (founded in Brussels in 1853 and in Vienna in 1873) as a predecessor of present World Meteorological Organization, WMO. Milankovi\u0107 served as a representative of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia there for many years./nBetween 1925 and 1928 Milankovi\u0107 wrote the popular-science book Through Distant Worlds and Times in the form of letters to an anonymous woman.[26] The work discusses the history of astronomy, climatology and science via a series of imaginary visits to various points in space and time by the author and his unnamed companion, encompassing the formation of the Earth, past civilizations, famous ancient and renaissance thinkers and their achievements, and the work of his contemporaries, K\u00f6ppen and Wegener. In the \"letters\", Milankovi\u0107 expanded on some of his own theories on astronomy and climatology, and described the complicated problems of celestial mechanics in a simplified manner./nK\u00f6ppen proposed to Milankovi\u0107 on 14 December 1926 to extend his calculations to a million years and to send his results to Barthel Eberl, a geologist studying the Danube basin, as Eberl's research had unearthed some pre-Ice Ages before over 650,000 years. Eberl published all this in Augsburg in 1930 together with Milankovi\u0107's curves./nIn 1927, Milankovi\u0107 asked his colleague and friend, Vojislav Mi\u0161kovi\u0107, to collaborate in the work and calculate astronomical values based on the Le Verrier process. Mi\u0161kovi\u0107 was a well-established astronomer from the Nice Observatory, who became the head of the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Belgrade and a professor of Theoretical and Practical Astronomy.[24] After almost three years, Mi\u0161kovi\u0107 and his staff completed the calculation of astronomical values based on the Le Verrier process and using the masses of the planets knows of that time.[27] Milankovi\u0107 used these values in his later works.[14] Subsequently, Milankovi\u0107 wrote the introductory portion of Mathematical science of climate and astronomical theory of the variations of the climate (Mathematische Klimalehre und Astronomische Theorie der Klimaschwankungen), published by K\u00f6ppen (Handbook of Climatology; Handbuch der Klimalogie Band 1) in 1930 in German and translated into Russian in 1939.[14] In 1934 Milankovi\u0107 published the book Celestial Mechanics.[28] This textbook used vector calculus systematically to solve problems of celestial mechanics. His original contribution to celestial mechanics is called Milankovi\u0107's system of vector elements of planetary orbits. He reduced six Lagrangean-Laplacian elliptical elements to two vectors determining the mechanics of planetary movements. The first specifies the planet's orbital plane, the sense of revolution of the planet, and the orbital ellipse parameter; the second specifies the axis of the orbit in its plane and the orbital eccentricity. By applying those vectors he significantly simplified the calculation and directly obtained all the formulas of the classical theory of secular perturbations. Milankovi\u0107, in a simple but original manner, first deduced Newton's law of gravitation from Kepler's laws. Then Milankovi\u0107 treated the two-body and the many-body problems of celestial mechanics./nHe applied vector calculus from quantum mechanics to celestial mechanics.[29]/nMeanwhile, in 1936 he attended the Third symposium of the  International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) in Vienna./nIn the period from 1935 to 1938 Milankovi\u0107 calculated that ice cover depended on changes in insolation. He succeeded in defining the mathematical relationship between summer insolation and the altitude of the snow line.[14] In this way he defined the increase of snow which would occur as a consequence of any given change in summer insolation. He published his results in the study \"New Results of the Astronomic Theory of Climate Changes\" in 1938.[14] Geologists received a graph for presenting bordering altitudes of ice covers any period of time during the last 600,000 years. Andr\u00e9 Berger and Jacques Laskar later developed this theory further./nConversations with Wegener, the author of continental drift theory, got Milankovi\u0107 interested in the interior of the Earth and the movement of the poles, so he told his friend that he would investigate polar wandering. In November 1929, Milankovi\u0107 received an invitation from Professor Beno Gutenberg of Darmstadt to collaborate on a ten volume handbook on geophysics and to publish his views on the problem of the secular variations of the Earth's rotational poles. Wegener presented extensive empirical evidence in his scientific work on the 'great events' during the Earth's past. However, one of the main findings that especially preoccupied Wegener and then Milankovitch was the discovery of big coal reserves on the Svalbard Islands, in the Arctic Ocean, which could not form at the present latitude of these islands. In the meantime, Wegener died (from hypothermia or heart failure) in November 1930 during his fourth expedition to Greenland. Milankovi\u0107 became convinced that the continents 'float' on a somewhat fluid subsurface and that the positions of the continents with respect to the axis of rotation affect the centrifugal force of the rotation and can throw the axis off balance and force it to move.[30] Wegener's tragedy additionally motivated Milankovich to persevere in solving the problem of polar wandering./nIn the period from 1930 to 1933, Milankovitch worked on the problem of numerical secular rotation pole movements. The Earth as a whole he considered as a fluid body, which in the case of short-duration forces behaves as a solid body, but under an influence behaves as an elastic body. Using vector analysis he made a mathematical model of the Earth to create a theory of secular motion of the terrestrial poles. He derived the equation of secular trajectory of a terrestrial pole and also the equation of pole motion along this trajectory. The equations further led to a determination of the 25 most characteristic points with pole trajectories for both hemispheres. This mathematical calculation led Milankovi\u0107 to 16 important points from the past that form parts of early explorations; 8 points triggered future explorations. He drew a map of the path of the poles over the past 300\u00a0million years and stated that changes happen in the interval of 5\u00a0million years (minimum) to 30\u00a0million years (maximum).[31] He found that the secular pole trajectory depends only on the configuration of the terrestrial outer shell and the instantaneous pole position on it, more precisely on geometry of the Earth mass. On this basis he could calculate the secular pole trajectory. Also, based on Milankovi\u0107's model, the continental blocks sink into their underlying \"fluidal\" base, and slide around, 'aiming to achieve' isostatic equilibrium. In his conclusion about this problem, he wrote: For an extraterrestrial observer, the displacement of the pole takes place in such a way that the ... Earth's axis maintains its orientation in space, but the Earth's crust is displaced on its substratum. Milankovitch published his paper on the subject entitled \"Numerical trajectory of secular changes of pole\u2019s rotation\" in Belgrade in 1932./nAt the same time, Milankovi\u0107 wrote four sections of Beno Gutenberg's \"Handbook of Geophysics\" (Handbuch der Geophysik)\u00a0\u2013 \"The Earth's Position and Movement in Space\", \"Rotational Movement of the Earth\", \"Secular shift of the Poles\", and \"Astronomic Means for Climate Study during the Earth's history\"\u00a0\u2013 published by Wegener's father-in-law K\u00f6ppen in 1933. The lecture on the apparent shift of poles was held at a congress of Balkan mathematicians in Athens in 1934. That same year, Milankovi\u0107 published an article dedicated to the work Alfred Wegener under titled \"Moving of the Earth's Poles \u2013 A Memory to Alfred Wegener\"./nMilankovitch's work on the trajectory of poles was well accepted only by K\u00f6ppen's associates, because most of the scientific community was skeptical about Wegener and Milankovic's new theories. Later, in the 1950s and 1960s, development of the new scientific discipline in geophysics known as palaeomagnetism led to the key evidence on the basis of studying the records of Earth's magnetic field in rocks over geological time. Paleomagnetic evidence, both reversals and polar wandering data, led the revival of the theories of continental drift and its transformation into plate tectonics in the 1960s and 1970s. Unlike Milankovic's linear trajectory of poles, palaeomagnetism reconstructed the path of the poles over geological history to show the nonlinear trajectory./nTo collect his scientific work on the theory of solar radiation that was scattered in many books and papers, Milankovi\u0107 began his life's work in 1939.[32][27] This tome was entitled \"Canon of Insolation of the Earth and Its Application to the Problem of the Ice Ages\", which covered his nearly three decades of research, including a large number of formulas, calculations and schemes, but also summarized universal laws through which it was possible to explain cyclical climate change \u2013 his namesake Milankovitch cycles.[33]/nMilankovi\u0107 spent two years arranging and writing the \"Canon\". The manuscript was submitted to print on 2 April 1941 \u2013 four days before the attack of Nazi Germany and its allies on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941, the printing house where his work was being printed was destroyed; however, almost all of the printed sheet paper remained undamaged in the printing warehouse. After the successful occupation of Serbia on 15 May 1941, two German officers and geology students came to Milankovi\u0107 in his house and brought greetings from Professor Wolfgang Soergel\u00a0[de] of Freiburg. Milankovi\u0107 gave them the only complete printed copy of the \"Canon\" to send to Soergel, to make certain that his work would be preserved. Milankovi\u0107 did not take part in the work of the university during the occupation, and after the war he was reinstated as professor./nThe \"Canon\" was issued in 1941[34] by the Royal Serbian Academy, 626 pages in quarto, and was printed in German as \"Kanon der Erdbestrahlung und seine Anwendung auf das Eiszeitenproblem\".[34] The titles of the six parts of the book are:/nDuring the German occupation of Serbia from 1941 to 1944, Milankovi\u0107 withdrew from public life and decided to write a \"history of his life and work\" going beyond scientific matters, including his personal life and the love of his father who died in his youth. His autobiography would be published after the war, entitled \"Recollection, Experiences and Vision\" in Belgrade in 1952.[35]/nAfter the war, in 1947, Milankovi\u0107's only son emigrated from the new communist Yugoslavia via Paris, London and Egypt to Australia. Milankovi\u0107 will never see his son again and the only way of correspondence between them will be through letters. Milankovi\u0107 was vice president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences (1948\u20131958). In 1948, the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union was held in Z\u00fcrich.[36] Milankovich are listed member of Commission 7 for Celastial Mechanics and V. Mishkovitch member of Commission 19 for Latitude Variation and Commission 20 for Minor Planets.[37] For a short period, he was the head of the Belgrade Observatory (1948 - 1951). In 1953, he was at the symposium of the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) held in Rome.[38] In the same year, he became a member of the Italian Institute of Paleontology. In November 1954, fifty years after receiving his original diploma, he received the Golden Doctor's diploma from the Technical University of Vienna. In 1955, he was also elected to the German Academy of Naturalists \"Leopoldina\" in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt./nIn 1955, Milankovitch retired from the position of professor of celestial mechanics at the University of Belgrade. In the same year, he publishes his last work, which is not from the natural sciences, but from his original profession of structural engineering. The paper was titled The Tower of Babel of modern technology. Milankovitch in this work calculated the highest building possible on our Earth. He was inspired by work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Tower of Babel (older version in Vienna). The building would have a base radius of 112.84\u00a0km and a height of 21646 m. Since the building penetrates the Earth 1.4\u00a0km, it would have a height of 20.25\u00a0km above the Earth's surface. At the very top, there would be a wide platform for a meteorological and astronomical station./nAt the same time, Milankovi\u0107 began publishing numerous books on the history of science, including Isaac Newton and Newton's Principia (1946), The founders of the natural science Pythagoras \u2013 Democritus \u2013 Aristotle \u2013 Archimedes (1947), History of astronomy \u2013 from its beginnings up to 1727 (1948), Through empire of science \u2013 images from the lives of great scientists (1950), Twenty-two centuries of Chemistry (1953), and Techniques in the ancient times (1955)./nIn September 1957, Milutin suffered a stroke and died in Belgrade in 1958.[39] He is buried in his family cemetery in Dalj.[citation needed]/nAfter Milankovi\u0107's death, most of the scientific community came to dispute his \"astronomical theory\" and no longer recognized the results of his research. But ten years after his death and fifty years from the first publication, Milankovi\u0107's theory was again taken under consideration. His book was translated into English under the title \"Canon of Insolation of the Ice-Age Problem\" in 1969 by the Israel Program for Scientific Translations, and was published by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C.[40]/nIn the beginning, recognition came slowly, but later, the theory was proven to be accurate. Project CLIMAP (Climate: Long Range Investigation, Mapping and Production) finally resolved the dispute and proved the theory of Milankovitch cycles.\nIn 1972, scientists compiled a time scale of climatic events in the past 700,000 years from deep-sea cores. They performed the analysis of the cores and four years later, came to the conclusion that in the past 500,000 years, climate has changed depending on the inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation and its precession.[41] In 1988, a new major project COHMAP (Cooperative Holocene Mapping\nProject) reconstructed the patterns of global climate change over the last 18,000 years, again demonstrating the key role of astronomical factors.[42] In 1989, the project SPECMAP (Spectral Mapping Project), showed that the climate changes are responses to changes in solar radiation of each of the three astronomical cycles.[43]/nIn 1999, it was shown that variations in the isotopic composition of oxygen in the sediments at the bottom of the ocean follow Milankovitch theory.[44][45] There are other recent studies that indicate the validity of the original Milankovitch theory.[46] Although orbital forcing of Earth's climate is well accepted, the details of how orbitally-induced changes in insolation affect climate are debated.[citation needed]/nMilankovi\u0107 authored two papers on relativity. He wrote his first paper \"On the theory of Michelson's experiment\" in 1924. He was doing research in this theory from 1912. His papers on this matter were on special relativity and both are on the Michelson experiment (now known as the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment) which produced strong evidence against aether theory. In the light of the Michelson experiment he discussed on the validity of the second postulate of special theory of relativity, that the speed of light is the same in every reference frame.[47]/nMilankovi\u0107 proposed a revised Julian calendar in 1923.[48][49][50] It made centennial years leap years if division by 900 left a remainder of 200 or 600, unlike the Gregorian rule which required that division by 400 left no remainder. (In both systems, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years.) In May 1923 a congress of some Eastern Orthodox churches adopted the calendar;[51][52] however, only the removal of 1\u201313 October 1923 and the revised leap year algorithm were adopted by a number of Eastern Orthodox churches. The dates of Easter and related holy days are still computed using the Julian calendar. At the time of Milankovi\u0107's proposal, it was suspected the period of rotation of Earth might not be constant, but it was not until the development of quartz and atomic clocks beginning in the 1930s that this could be proven and quantified.[53] The variation in the period of rotation of Earth is the chief cause of long-term inaccuracy in both the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars.[54]/nOn June 25, 1923 he was conferred the Saint Sava Order, 3rd degree. On 1925, he was awarded Tunisian Nichan Iftikhar Order, 3rd degree. On 1929, he was awarded, at the proposal of the Ministry of Finances the White Eagle Order, 5th degree. On 1935, he was awarded Greek decoration - Phoenix Battalion Commander's Cross. On December 20, 1938 he was awarded the Royal Order of the Yugoslav Crown 3rd degree. In 1965, the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union named an impact crater on the far side of the Moon as  Milankovic, which was later confirmed at the 14th IAU General Assembly in 1970. His name is also given to a crater on Mars at the 15th IAU General Assembly in 1973. Since 1993 the Milutin Milankovic Medal has been awarded by the European Geophysical Society (called the EGU since 2003) for contributions in the\narea of long-term climate and modeling.[55][56] A main belt asteroid discovered in 1936 has also been dubbed 1605 Milankovitch. At NASA, in their edition of \"On the Shoulders of Giants\", Milankovi\u0107 has been ranked among the top fifteen minds of all time in the field of earth sciences.[57]", "11618816": "Cypri\u00e1n Kar\u00e1sek Lvovick\u00fd (of Lvovice) (Czech: Cypri\u00e1n Kar\u00e1sek Lvovick\u00fd ze Lvovic, German: Cyprian von Leowitz, Latin: Cyprianus Leovitius) (8 July 1514? in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 \u2013 1574 in Lauingen) was a Bohemian astronomer, mathematician and astrologer./nMost of the information about Lvovick\u00fd's life comes from his memoirs.[1] Cyprian Kar\u00e1sek was born in 1514 (some sources claim 1524) into the  family of a long-time town councillor and later mayor of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 named Jan Kar\u00e1sek (Lvovick\u00fd after ennoblement).

He was the only child to the Galician family of well-educated and wealthy parents, his father Piotr Jan Grzegorczyk (1894\u20131968) was a Polish philologist and historian of Polish literature involved in literary criticism, bibliographic studies, and chronicles of the Polish cultural life. Andrzej's mother Zofia Jadwiga n\u00e9e Zdziarska was a Medical Doctor from a purely Polish landed gentry family./nRich historical family background was the most fundamental element in the shaping of Andrzej Grzegorczyk's intellectual formation and professional academic career. In particular, this heritage laid the foundations of his philosophical system which was a specific apologetics which mixed the Christian doctrine with certain elements of the Communist Ideology, the ecumenical approach towards both the Roman Catholic Church in Poland and the Russian Orthodox Church, the manifestly friendly attitude to the Eastern European countries and their national philosophers, and problems in the social assimilation in the Western European countries which served him at most for short time visits./nDuring the 1939\u20131944 Nazi\u2013Soviet occupation of Poland in the course of the World War II, Grzegorczyk was a voluntary member of the Home Army, the dominant Polish resistance movement formed in February 1942 by the Union of Armed Struggle and other Polish partisans with allegiance to the Polish Government-in-Exile as the armed wing of the Polish Underground State. As an insurgent of the Warsaw uprising under the pseudonym Bu\u0142ka, he provided a voluntary military service in the rank of Shooter in the 2nd Platoon of the Company Harcerska of the AK Battalion 'Gustaw' of the R\u00f3g Group of the Group P\u00f3\u0142noc of the Home Army. As a result of the explosion of the Nazi heavy remote-control demolition layer Borgward IV of the Panzer Abteilung (Funklenk) 302 on 13 August 1944 at the Jan Kili\u0144ski street in the Warsaw Old Town, which killed more than 300 Polish partisans and civilians, he was injured in the legs and placed in a field hospital. Several days later he rejoined the division, but by the health condition he did not participate in the further fights and was forced to leave Warsaw on 31 August 1944 as a civilian in the evacuation by the city canals from the Warsaw Old Town to the Warsaw \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie./nHe got primary education at a private School of the Roman Catholic Educational Society Future, the same as for other Warsaw Uprising's insurgent a Polish politician W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski who under the pseudonym Teofil served to the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Headquarters of the Home Army in the rank of Corporal and in 1940\u20131941 was imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Since 1938, Grzegorczyk had obtained the Polish secondary underground education at the 6th Tadeusz Reytan Lyceum in Warsaw to be matriculated in May 1940 on the day of France's capitulation. In order to be saved from being deported to Nazi Germany for a forced labour, he started another education at a chemical high school and then, when the Nazi authorities allowed vocational secondary education in the occupied Poland, at a 3-year chemical school localized on the area of the Warsaw University of Technology where in 1942\u20131944 he was taught by the professors of this university. At the same time, he completed a clandestine higher education at two then secret Polish universities \u2013 in physics at the University of Warsaw. At the stage of higher education, Grzegorczyk was especially attracted to logic by a broadcast lecture on stoic logic by a logician and mathematician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz./nPractical exercises in mathematical logic were provided by Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski's student Henryk Hi\u017c, who in the late 1930s was a member of the anti-Sanation Democratic Club, as an insurgent of the Warsaw Uprising in the rank of Second Lieutenant was imprisoned in a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp Oflag II D Gross-Born (Grossborn-Westfalenhof), after liberation by the 4th Infantry Division (Jan Kili\u0144ski) of the First Polish Army immigrated to the US, where in 1948 as Henry Thadeus Hiz got a doctoral degree at the Harvard University for a thesis An economical foundation for arithmetic supervised by a famous American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine and worked for the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Logic was also lectured by a Roman Catholic priest and Christian philosopher Jan Salamucha. Psychology was taught by a Catholic priest Piotr Julian Chojnacki, historian of philosophy. Fine arts were lectured by a Polish art historian Micha\u0142 Marian Walicki./nOne of Grzegorczyk's underground teachers was a philosopher of science and culture Bogdan Suchodolski, a prominent fugure both in science and politics. Grzegorczyk was able to complete his originally underground education only after the World War II finished. Already in 1945 at the Philosophical Faculty of the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, supervised by a renowned philosopher of physics Zygmunt Micha\u0142 Zawirski, Grzegorczyk finished the first higher study by a magister degree in philosophy with the thesis The Ontology of Properties, wherein with a help of Kotarbi\u0144ski's reism, also propagated by Henryk Hi\u017c, in the formal version by Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski, he successfully presented an interpretation of Le\u015bniewski's elementary ontology as a theory of higher logical types. Soon after graduation, he got a postgraduate scholarship targeted to the study logic and the foundations of mathematics at the University of Warsaw, and on 26 May 1950 by examinations in philosophy and chemistry he completed a doctoral degree in mathematics with the thesis On Topological Spaces in Topologies without Points supervised by a famous mathematician Andrzej Stanis\u0142aw Mostowski./nAll the aforementioned teachers, both underground and post-war, by their teaching style and general attitude very deeply impacted Grzegorczyk's youthful mind. In his later years, the influence was strictly reflected by his various life choices, individual mental features, overall academic career both inside and outside Poland, both style and methods of research and teaching work. What is much more fundamental for his creativity, this impact straightforwardly shaped his personal world view which paradoxically mixed the ideas being in a deep mutual opposition, and resulted in the creation of a borderline philosophical system based on discrimination against the features of a human mind which are either inborn or beyond a personal choice./nIn 1946\u20131948, he was an assistant to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, and, since at this time Tatarkiewicz was the editor-in-chief of the first Polish philosophical journal Przegl\u0105d Filozoficzny (Philosophical Review), he served also as the secretary of the editorial board. In 1948, he submitted a paper on the semantics of descriptive language to the 10th International Congress of Philosophy in Amsterdam, but, similarly to most Polish philosophers invited by the organizers or submitting papers, he did not get passport and could not participate in this event, although his abstract was included in the proceedings. This fact was the omen of a difficult political time, and at this time logic focused attention of many Polish philosophers, young Grzegorczyk selected the way of majority. Soon after completion of the doctoral degree, he was employed by the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS and after 3 years he completed qualification procedure to a docent position on the basis of a book Some Classes of Recursive Functions, what at this time was an equivalent of the habilitation procedure. From 1950 to 1968, he worked at a secondary employment for the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw, in 1957 he was awarded by the Stefan Banach Prize of the Polish Mathematical Society, in 1961 he was appointed an associate professor of mathematics. In 1963, along with Andrzej Mostowski and Czes\u0142aw Ryll-Nardzewski, he participated in the famous logical conference The Theory of Models at the University of California, Berkeley where he met Alfred Tarski and where his both individual research results and research results co-authored with Mostowski and Ryll-Nardzewski were the subjects of few lectures. When a famous Dutch logician Evert Willem Beth died in 1964, the University of Amsterdam offered him the position of the head of the chair after Beth, he came to Amsterdam for few months and returned to Warsaw because he could not find a mental place for himself in the Netherlands, at this time on the eve of the cultural revolution which made Amsterdam the 'magic centre' of Europe. Also in 1967 he lectured for four months at the University of Amsterdam and was appointed a member and an assessor to the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of science and Technology of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science, while in 1970 he lectured two months at the Sapienza University of Rome. In 1960, he contributed a philosophical essay to the festschrift volume to honor W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz on the occasion of his 70th birthday anniversary, whereas his father contributed Tatarkiewicz's bibliography to this volume. In the aftermath of the March 1968 Polish political crisis, as a result of a long-lasting confirmed direct involvement into the anti-governmental oppositional actions such like signing every open letter against restriction onto freedoms under communist regime, the inconvenient political circumstances motivated him to leave the University of Warsaw for the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS, where, in the 1960s, he was appointed the head of the Department of Foundations of Mathematics after Andrzej Mostowski left this position and remained the head of the Chair of Foundations of Mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1972, he was appointed a Full Professor, in 1973 he organized the pioneering semester in mathematical logic at the Stefan Banach International Mathematical Center of the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS, also known as the Banach Center and formed in January 1972 by the mutual agreement between the PAS and the Bulgarian, Czechoslovak, East German, Hungarian, Romanian, and Soviet national academies of sciences, which started the 1973\u20131992 cyclic three-to-four-month long lectures and allowed both the logicians and philosophers of the isolated Eastern Bloc to interact with their Western colleagues. In 1974, by mutual agreement he left the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS for the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the PAS to work at the Section of Logic then headed by a model theorist Ryszard W\u00f3jcicki who founded the series \"Trends in Logic\" and related conferences by the institute's oldest journal Studia Logica: An International Journal for Symbolic Logic, and to become the head of the Section of Ethics since 1982./nOn the other hand, he was well known as an active member the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, in 1964 as one of the first Poles he appeared in the French commune Taiz\u00e9, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, Burgundy to associate with an ecumenical Christian monastic group known as the Taiz\u00e9 Community, and this visit initiated the systematic contacts of the Polish Catholic intellectuals with this ecumenic group. He was a member of the Warsaw branch of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, particularly he was appointed a deputy president in 1972\u20131973 and a member of the government in 1973\u20131974 and 1976\u20131978, formed in 1956 after the Gomu\u0142ka Thaw to stimulate independent thought and inform Polish Catholics on the Catholic philosophy in the countries outside the Eastern Bloc. Starting the 1970s, he practiced independent ecumenical activities, in particular the dialogue with the Russian Orthodox Church in Poland for which he organized encounters between the Polish Catholic intellectuals the Russian Orthodox intellectuals at his own apartment, which in the late 1970s and the early 1980s was also the location for the lectures of the Flying University organized by the Society of Scientific Courses (TKN). His model of the Catholic-Orthodox ecumenism found a good realization in the collaboration with the Russian Orthodox priest Alexander V. Men of Moscow, an eminent chaplain of independent Russian intellectuals who was murdered in 1990. He was a dedicated supporter of Russia and Ukraine, he felt that the Soviet Union was his second home, he actively collaborated with many Soviet and Russian scholars and claimed that Russians and Poles have a similar expression of the world and many in common by the culture. Among the anti-communist oppositionists in the Polish academia, he was well known as both supporter and propagator of the philosophy of nonviolence, a fight without making use of any kind of violence, and as the spiritual masters he followed the teachings of the leader of Indian nationalism Mahatma Gandhi, the leader in the civil rights movement Martin Luther King Jr. who got the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, as well as both Henryk Hi\u017c and his mentor Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski, who in 1958\u20131968 was a deputy chairman to the All-Poland Committee of the Front of National Unity of the communist Poland under first Aleksander Zawadzki and then Edward Ochab./nCensorship in the Polish People's Republic strictly blocked public information on Grzegorczyk, and, similarly to other Polish mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Hartman of the University of Wroc\u0142aw who got the Stefan Banach Prize in 1953, already in 1977 his name was enlisted for the strengthened control of the censorship. Every attempt of popularization of his name in the mass media (daily press, radio, TV, socio-political magazines) was immediately signalized to the directors of the central office of the state censorship directly controlled by the authorities of the communist party which then governed Poland. The censorship rules made exception solely for the publications in the specialist press, academic journals, and university lecture notes. However, as compared to the aforementioned famous case of Hartman, he had never been involved into a real political activity, such like direct supporting of anti-governmental student protesters, membership in oppositionist organizations, membership in a political party. Hence, he almost completely smoothly came through the communist period of Polish statehood and avoided the various unpleasant circumstances produced by the state authorities and services against their ideological enemies in the Polish academia, which usually included regular persecutions and repressions by sudden often brutal hearings, firing from a university teacher's job, ban on public lectureship, forced political emigration, internment during the period 1981\u20131983 of the martial law in Poland. Similarly to Hartman, for his oppositionist activity he was \"exiled\" from his alma mater to the Institute of Mathematics of the PAS. However, he always placed his personal intellectual development on the top priority, and made professional advancements both inside and outside the communist fatherland, particularly in 1979 he was elected a member of the International Institute of Philosophy (IIP) in Paris, France with respect to which he did not hide the critical views./nAfter the pioneering Revolution of 1989 in Poland, he was celebrated as an intellectual authority of the post-communist Republic of Poland. He was appointed a corresponding member of the PAU in Krak\u00f3w after its finally successful restoration in 1989, and an active member of the Section of Philosophy of the Scientific Society of the KUL. In 1990, he took an early retirement and enhanced his organizational activity for the Polish philosophical academia as a director of research grant The Hundred Years of the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw School, within which there he organized a huge conference in Warsaw and Lvov on the occasion of Kazimierz Twardowski's centenary as the head of a chair at the former Jan Kazimierz University of Lw\u00f3w, and translation of his book to Ukrainian language. In 1995, he was elected the chairman of the editorial board of the restored weekly Przegl\u0105d Filozoficzny. In 1997, under the rationale \"for his outstanding merits to the Polish science\" President Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski awarded him by the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 1999\u20132003, he was both the first ever honorary member and the chairman of the Committee of Philosophical Sciences of the PAS, the Polish state body responsible for coordination and giving opinions on philosophical activities as well as analysis of philosophical publications and teaching programs in Poland. In 2011\u20132014, he was a member of the Committee of Ethics in Science of the PAS whose purpose is the diagnosis of ethical consciousness of Polish scientific community and recommendations for its improvements. In 2010, he was awarded by the honorary doctorate of the Blaise Pascal University, Clermont-Ferrand, France, whereas in 2013 he was awarded the honorary doctorate of the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w . Finally, under the rationale \"for his outstanding achievements in the scientific and didactic work, for his merits to the development of science and the activity for the democratic transformations in Poland\" in 2014 President Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski posthumously decorated him by the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta./nBoth inside and outside Poland he was most known for continuation of the Interwar period's intellectual traditions of the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school of logic, in particular with the substantial help of Grzegorczyk and other Andrzej Mostowski's student Helena Rasiowa, as well as independently Alfred Tarski's student Wanda Szmielew, Warsaw rejoined the chart of the worldly foundational studies. He shared the view of Tarski and Mostowski that logical investigations should respect deductive sciences, in particular, mathematics, and was skeptical in the matter of a value of investigations, developed by \u0141ukasiewicz's school, which looks for the shortest logical axioms or the simplest axiomatic bases of various logical systems. It is important to notice that a role of both Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa for earlier unpublished work in computable analysis by Stanis\u0142aw Mazur, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party who was a member of communist Poland's Parliament in 1947\u20131956 and the director of the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Warsaw in 1964\u20131969 awarded by the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize in 1949, and the Order of the Banner of Work in 1951 and 1954, who investigated nonlinear functional analysis and Banach algebras and who in 1936\u20131939 elaborated the concept of computable real numbers and functions along with Stefan Banach. It is well known that Mazur was unfortunate in extension of his pre-war work to general computable mathematical objects, and the results were successfully assembled and published only in 1963 just under edition of Grzegorczyk and Rasiowa, what had a comparatively small influence on development of computable analysis, but developed careers of both the editors at the University of Warsaw./nAmong his achievements in logic, one can find the issues of computability and decidability such like recursive functions, computable analysis, axiomatic arithmetic, and concatenation theory. On the other hand, he made research in the system of logics such like logical axioms, axiomatic geometry, non-classical logics, and interpretations of logic where, in particular, he defended psychologism since the beginning of his research. His two famous articles of 1958 and 1961 co-authored with Andrzej Mostowski and Czes\u0142aw Ryll-Nardzewski became the starting point for research in the axiomatic second-order arithmetic and the arithmetic with an infinite conclusion rule, in particular the 1958's paper introduces the second-order arithmetic formalized in the first-order logic wherein both numbers and number sets are taken into account. He contributed research of the fundamental importance for theoretical computer science and precursory for the computational complexity theory, in 1953 he described and investigated classes of recursive functions generated by superposition, restricted recursion and the restricted minimum operation from some prescribed basic functions which contain addition and multiplication, and satisfy the condition that every class in question includes more complicated primitive recursive functions, and he got the sub-recursive hierarchy which fills the class of primitive recursive functions and is named the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. This originally recursion-theoretic hierarchy takes into account a strictly increasing infinite sequence of classes of functions of which the sum is a class of primitive recursive functions considered earlier, the n+1-th level functions are generated by iteration of the n-th level functions the number of times indicated by one of the arguments and by the closure under primitive recursion scheme bounded from above by an already defined function./nIn 1964\u20131968, he researched relational and topological semantics for the intuitionistic logic, what in the context of the famous work due to J.C.C. McKinsey and Alfred Tarski was also a semantics for modal logic. Inspired by Paul Joseph Cohen's notion of forcing and Evert Willem Beth's semantics for intuitionistic logic, on the basis of the Heyting arithmetic and Ja\u015bkowski's formulation of the intuitionistic propositional calculus, he proposed the model theory for the intuitionistic logic of constant domains (CD) and found a modal formula which is valid in all partially ordered frames with descending chain condition but not in all topological spaces. Because the logic resulting from this semantics includes the intuitionistically unprovable Grzegorczyk's schema \n\n\n\n\u2200\nx\n(\nA\n\u2228\nB\n(\nx\n)\n)\n\u2192\nA\n\u2228\n\u2200\nx\nB\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\forall x(A\\lor B(x))\\rightarrow A\\lor \\forall xB(x)}\n\n, where x is not free in a sentence A, it is stronger than intuitionistic predicate logic. He proposed the semantics as a \"philosophically plausible formal interpretation of intuitionistic logic\" independently of the near-contemporary work by an American philosopher and logician Saul Aaron Kripke, observed that his semantics validates the schema and modified the forcing relation for disjunctions and existential formulas to give an exact interpretation for intuitionistic predicate logic. Sabine Koppelberg n\u00e9e G\u00f6rnemann first in her doctoral dissertation of 1969 proved completeness of a calculus related to Grzegorczyk's semantics by both Kripke's tableau method and an algebraic method which made use of a language with the logical symbols (\n\n\n\n\u2227\n,\n\u2228\n,\n\u00ac\n,\n\u2192\n,\n\u2203\n,\n\u2200\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\land ,\\lor ,\\neg ,\\rightarrow ,\\exists ,\\forall }\n\n), and then in 1971, with independent results by Dieter Klemke in 1970\u20131971 and Dov Gabbay in 1969, proved that addition of the scheme to intuitionistic predicate logic is sufficient to axiomatize Grzegorczyk's logic. Grzegorczyk's model theory has a fixed constant domain and represents a static ontology, whereas Kripke's model theory involves a quasi-ordered set of classical models, where the domains can expand along the quasi-ordering, and represents an expanding ontology with new objects created in a growth of knowledge. In other words, Grzegorczyk's semantics for the intuitionistic predicate logic is the class of predicate Kripke's models which have constant domain function. From the point of view of non-classical logics, with a help of the necessity operator \n\n\n\n\u25fb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box }\n\n sometimes denoted by \n\n\n\n\u25b3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\bigtriangleup }\n\n, he proposed to consider \n\n\n\n\u25fb\n(\n\u25fb\n(\nA\n\u21d2\n\u25fb\nA\n)\n\u21d2\nA\n)\n\u21d2\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Box (\\Box (A\\Rightarrow \\Box A)\\Rightarrow A)\\Rightarrow A}\n\n what was later called the Grzegorczyk formula/axiom, which, although that is not valid in the Lewis normal modal logic S4, when added as a new axiom schema to S4, which can be equipped into the Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra, gives the intuitionistic logic which can be translated into the S4 calculus by virtue of G\u00f6del's interpretation of an intuitionistic logic via provability operator. In particular, Krister Segerberg was the first who proposed for this emerging specific system of a modal logic the name Grzegorczyk's logic and the symbol S4Grz or S4.Grz, whereas George Boolos contributed the foundational investigation of Grzegorczyk's schema in the context of proof theory and arithmetic./nIn 2005, Grzegorczyk gave a new proof of the undecidability of the first-order functional calculus without making use of G\u00f6del's arithmetization, and, moreover, demonstrated undecidability of a simple concatenation theory, the operations of matching two texts understood as sequences of symbols into one text with the next text being a continuation of the first one. Grzegorczyk's undecidability of Alfred Tarski's concatenation theory is based on the philosophical motivation claiming that investigation of formal systems should be done with a help of operations on visually comprehensible objects, and the most natural element of this approach is the notion of text. On his research, Tarski's simple theory is undecidable although seems to be weaker than the weak arithmetic, whereas, instead of computability, he applies more epistemological notion of the effective recognizability of properties of a text and relationships between different texts. In 2011, Grzegorczyk introduced yet one more logical system, which today is known as the Grzegorczyk non-Fregean logic or the logic of descriptions (LD), to cover the basic features of descriptive equivalence of sentences, wherein he assumed that a human language is applied primarily to form descriptions of reality represented formally by logical connectives. According to this system, the logical language is equipped in at least four logical connectives negation (\u00ac), conjunction (\u2227), disjunction (\u2228), and equivalence (\u2261). Furthermore, he defined this propositional logic from scratch, argued that neither classical propositional logic nor any of its non-classical extensions can be applied as an adequate formal language of descriptions, whereas the paradoxes of implication and equivalence are due to classical logic's restricting itself to considering only one, admittedly the most important, parameter of the content of a claim, namely its truth value. He rejected all the classical logical tautologies except the law of contradiction and added two logical axioms: (LD1): \u2261 represents an equivalence relation and obeys the appropriate Extensionality property, that is equal descriptions can be substituted for each other, and (LD2): \u2261 joins some of the Boolean properties of descriptions, such like associativity, commutativity, and idempotency of \u2227 and \u2228, distributivity of \u2227 over \u2228, distributivity of \u2228 over \u2227, involution of \u00ac that additionally satisfies the De Morgan laws. His results in the concatenation theory and the propositional calculus with the descriptive equivalence connective provided an important addition to his signal achievements./nBy his investigations in psychologism, he converted the paradox of Eubulides into a positive theorem (formally proved): an ideal human tackling a linguistically properly stated problem is able to think on this consistently, sincerely and fully consciously. In opposition to Alfred Tarski and other anti-psychologist logicians who taught that the natural language leads to contradiction by its very nature, he rejected this conviction and proposed a formal system of the Universal Syntax which imitates the versatility of colloquial language. On his approach, the axiomatization of quotation-operator is the best device which allows to marry logic with metalogic and prove the adequacy theorem for the notion of truth. He dealt with the problem on invasion of logic by postmodernity, because the deconstruction of logical rules is not at stake, there would be no logic, while the foundation of logic could be rocked. Despite that in the mathematical genealogy he was and a son of Andrzej Mostowski and a grandson of Alfred Tarski, he manifestly undermined and rebutted the classical anti-psychologism of modern logic. His best known logico-mathematical book is An Outline of Mathematical Logic: Fundamental Results and Notions Explained with All Details published in Polish in 1961 and in English in 1969. His book Fonctions R\u00e9cursives became the standard handbook at the French universities. His other book Zarys arytmetyki teoretycznej (An Outline of Theoretical Arithmetic) became the basis for the Mizar system by the University of Bia\u0142ystok's team of a notable computer scientist Andrzej Trybulec. In Poland, Grzegorczyk was the first who popularized logical calculus by the book Logika popularna (Popular logic), also translated into Czech in 1957 and Russian in 1965, and the problems of decidability theory by the book Zagadnienia rozstrzygalno\u015bci (Decidability problems)./nHe studied computable real numbers, in particular provided few different definitions of these numbers and the ways to development of mathematical analysis based only on these numbers and computable functions determined on these numbers. He investigated computable functionals of higher types and proved undecidability of different weak theories such like elementary topological algebra, he considered axiomatic foundations of geometry by the means of solids instead of points, he showed that mereology is equivalent to the Boolean algebra, he approached intuitionistic logic with a help of semantics of intuitionistic propositional calculus built upon the notion of enforced recognition of sentences in the frames of cognitive procedures, what is similar to the Kripke semantics which was created parallelly, and he studied Kotarbi\u0144ski's reism. He proposed an interpretation of the Le\u015bniewski ontology as the Boolean algebra without zero, and demonstrated the undecidability of the theory of the Boolean algebras with the operation of closure. He investigated intuitionistic logic, just a modal interpretation of the Grzegorczyk semantics for intuitionism, which predetermined the Kripke semantics, leads to the aforementioned S4.Grz. He sought logic as a vivid area placed in the mainstream of the European philosophy, and, although that he belonged to rather hermetic Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw School of thought, in opposition to his intellectual masters and academic mentors he contributed the approach to logic by the means of psychology. For him, logic is a collection of principles which preserve the emphatic declarations of the majority of properly educated and free from either violation or corruption people, that is, he attributes logic to a perfect human mind formed as a result of ideal educational background, ideal upbringing process, and ideal propriety. On his idealist views, classical logic is a formal theory of existence lexicalized by the existential quantification, and all that is logical is nothing but a text. As a fervent follower of the classical Aristotelian attitude, he sought logic not only as the fundamental tool but also as the basic ontology wherein semantics dealing with human utterances is preceded by attributes of humankind such like rationality, life, and existence. In his methodological approach, logic lays the foundations of science and the overall European invention./nIn the field of philosophical logic he defended the ontological interpretation of the logical laws, on the basis of his personal belief on describing the world by these laws. In a straightforward opposition to the teachings by the fathers-founders of the twentieth-century European transcendentalism a German logician Gottlob Frege and an Austrian phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, thanks to which anti-psychologism also known as logical realism or logical objectivism dominated both the common understanding of logic and the formal reasoning in logic, he defended psychologism which he approached as a thesis about dependence of the relationship of meaning and determination on the human factor and its description attributed to a human behavior, what in itself was very far from continental philosophy and appropriate to an English Enlightenment philosopher John Locke and a British utilitarianist philosopher John Stuart Mill who was criticized by Husserl for the logical psychologism. According to Grzegorczyk's interpretation, any description is in a language of someone and done for someone, whereas logic is applied to describe the world strictly. As a result of such an approach, he produced the reinterpretation of the semantic antinomies which claims on limitations of applicability of concepts rather than self-contradiction of a language. Particularly, in the book Logic \u2013 a human affair, by the style appropriate to Tarski, he discussed with anti-psychologism and presented the formal construction of the Universal Syntax which led him to the hypothesis to say that a sentence A is true is equivalent to the statement of this sentence relativized to the domain wherein one applies the sentence A which trivializes the notion of truth, but he also stated that \"the proof of this trivialization is trivial\". On his approach, the liar paradox, which lays the foundations of this construction, transforms the antinomy into the hypothesis on both the human nature and human condition: 'there is a problem about which a human can not think in an accordant, sincere, and fully conscious way, that is having full awareness of the recognized and unrecognized sentences. Hence, in his fervent battle for psychologism, he linked formal logic to rather non-universal and subjective attributes of a human mind, and, moreover, claimed that anti-psychologist interpretation of meaning is inspired by the related idealist vision of the world as formed by ideally formed intellectuals. According to Grzegorczyk, independently on personal motivations for which one makes considerations, the criterion of the value of these considerations is logic, strictly speaking if a proof is logical, systematic, and self-conscious. Grzegorczyk approached logic as the morality of speech and thought, he sought in logic the foundations of moral discussions, and, therefore, made a straightforward cultivation of discrimination fully appropriate to the German idealists \u2013 he did not see a morality beyond a selected system and claimed the selected model of morality is the universal one. Despite that he conceived just logic by wide horizons, included the methodology of science into its foundations and claimed that logic is a basic component of the intellectual attitude which he identified with the European Rationalism, he limited both logic by rationalism and rationalism by logic. His model of rationalism is open to the realm of values, acquirable for a reliable knowledge, and advocates ethics in social relations, whereas logic appears therein as a pure attribute of a human mind \u2013 a rational European human. He fought for psychologism in logic, for him semantic relations are always relations for someone and are mediated by language. Consequently, paradoxes demonstrate the limits of concepts and systems rather than inconsistencies of a language./nFurthermore, he contributed a series of writings in philosophical anthropology and ethics in the methodological framework of philosophy which he named rationalism open for values, which was basically no more than a mixture of the Christian theology and the selected teachings of the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school, and for which he developed the selected ideas of the Marxist thought in the context of theology and philosophy. The best example of the latter context is his book Ma\u0142a propedeutyka filozofii naukowej (Short propedeutics of scientific philosophy) issued by the aforementioned pro-communist Catholic publisher Instytut Wydawniczy \"Pax\" on the eve of the fall of communism in Poland in December 1989, when the Marxist-Leninist references were removed from the July 1952 Constitution of the Polish People's Republic and the country was renamed to the Republic of Poland, the dissolution of the PZPR in late January 1990 by its last First Secretary Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact on 1 July 1991 in Prague. However, Grzegorczyk yet in his 1989's book fully and fervently developed the crucial ideas of the Marxist ideology, where in particular the name \"scientific philosophy\"' is not equal to philosophy of science understood as the standard philosophical discourse and is reserved to the unique significance of the ideological deformation of philosophy. The ideological misuses of the word \"scientific\" in the context of Marxism-Leninism are well-known: \"scientific world view\" is equal to the Marxist world view, \"scientific religion\" is equal to the Marxist-Leninist atheism, \"scientific art\" is equal to socialist realism also known as socrealism, while \"scientific philosophy\" is simply the synonym of both dialectical materialism and historical materialism \u2013 just making use of the term \"scientific\" was making the ideology. Indeed, similarly to ecumenism between different religions, this book, which met a devastative criticism by the Roman Catholic clerical scholars such like a Salesian metaphysicist Andrzej Maryniarczyk of the KUL, under the brightly banners of \"pure philosophy\" and \"uniform approach to philosophy which can be the basis of teaching\" proposed no more than an ideological uniformity of philosophy without a division onto the subjective branches such like Thomism, Existentialism or Platonism in order to get the alleged advantage of \"maximal objectivity\" of philosophy, where Grzegorczyk approaches philosophy as merely a convention based on the alleged values such like \"seriousness\" and \"sincerity\" claimed by him as the determinants of quality of philosophizing. He did not give the explicit definitions of these alleged merits, but provided some crucial hints on what is \"serious and sincere philosophy\": the most general thoughts and insights concerning the world and human life, systematic cognitive activity leading to construction of a philosophical world view, the philosophical views of brilliant writers and even scholars of other disciplines who in the margins of their specialty sometimes made interesting general considerations, amateur general reflection on any topic, professional statements which give very systematic and well exhaustive reflection, texts printed in special philosophical journals, and teachings of university professors. He introduced three categories of philosophers: amateur, traditionalists and professionals, where the only latter one can be performed in the \"scientific\" way, that is with a help of natural science and mathematics, but he did not make a difference between a speculation attributed to amateurs and a theoretical approach attributed to philosophy understood as an academic discipline, and, for this reason, made philosophy a part of the collectivist people's culture. The crucial element of his approach is the concept of reality divided onto observable reality formed by \"objects (things) of different properties, joined by relations, creating different sets\" by learning of which \"we attribute certain properties to them and combine them into sets\", and unobservable reality \"composed of some separate things (...) with certain properties\", where he attempted to apply his variant of dialectical materialism to justify an undefined materialistic spiritualism usually attributed to the Marxist-Leninist atheism. Comparatively, in his other book \u017bycie jako wyzwanie (Life as a challenge), published already in 1993 when the primary socio-economic-political transformations were just implemented in the restored Republic of Poland almost free of the fallen Soviet occupation, he presented an unambiguously liberalized ontological declaration 'the world (...) contains objects (...) having various properties, connected by various relations, and belonging to various sets'. From a general philosophical point of view, this book resorted to all the basic notions such like good and evil as the links of the first semantic chain, that is the central ontological notion of an object with the notion of a state of affairs, and his analysis went further precisely along the second ontological chain, that is towards the notions of case and act. In general, the whole book reflected its author's full both conformity with and loyalty towards the economic-political transition, started with the 1990 Polish presidential election which made the leader of the anti-communist opposition and the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa the first freely elected President of the Third Republic of Poland, although until 2007 Lustration in Poland the Polish state authorities did not require a political either purge or thaw or at least a humble self-criticism among the Polish academia, and, moreover, until 2005 the successors of the PZPR \u2013 the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP) in 1991 and the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) in 1999 \u2013 governed by Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski who won the 1995 presidential elections over Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa to be the 3rd President for 1995\u20132005 and to be instrumental in introduction of Poland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1999 and the European Union in 2004./nIn the matter of philosophical anthropology, on the basis of the ways of reasoning pivotal for the development of the European philosophy, he provided the systematic analysis of mutual relationships between the forms of thinking and cognition in the context of the beginnings of the European culture, gave precise description of the phenomenon of European rationalism, where rational means successful as well as efficient and well-founded, through joining this concept to the internal flow of intellectual life of the European civilization and to a specific literary topos, that is a place where this way of intellectual life is localized. Meanwhile, in the matter of ethics, he claimed that in a mind cleaned from egoism and disciplined by logic there should appear elements of a general human axiology whose presence in a human expression needs a deep ethical shock, experience of either own or others' strong testimony. Particularly, he sought it in the context of Christianity where cultivated saints are the sinners who came through the stage of a great internal conversion metanoi which principally demolished their earlier life's rules, and pointed out that this procedure was unsuccessfully attempted to be implemented on the area of a secular communist society. He specifically criticized mathematicians, thus including himself, by claiming that sometimes seeing on the might of mathematical brains focused on abstract problems it seemed that there is a satanic force which causes that the most able intellectually individuals are paid for the works meaningless for wellness of humans. By his ethics, he manifestly argued against his own life choices and looked for psychological either self-defense or justification, particularly he claimed that scientists are employed in an intellectual circus whenever they do not try to think on what really is worthy to do, and, for this reason, in the isolated intellectuals there should emerge a remorse and the will of more dedicated participation in realization of socially important tasks of either a country or the world, because quite well-paid mathematical games are a waste of energy which could be utilized for thinking on real actions having a good purpose. In the case of natural scientists, he claimed that they present a world view in a careless way, although by their scientific authority and reference to a concrete research they get a substantial expertise in general philosophic beliefs, but by propagation of unfriendly ways they propagate absence of precision because they avoid logical constructions of proofs in favour of a better visual impact. He sought logic as the method against epistemological particularism, for example, he claimed that a world view demands logical culture and analytic-philosophic insight, and the way against an intellectual trapping, for example, he had a radical and unpopular point of view that the only formal logic can be the security for language against the issues of a system of assessment by clear extracting, indicating and ordering. In his philosophy, a human condition is a free existence restricted by the various limitations. Accordingly, a human as an animal has the specific features, such like persistent enrichment of life quality, creation of an environment, sensitivity on values, spiritual sphere, investigating sainthood and transcendence, ability to creativity and creative thinking, and, moreover, usage of language and symbolic reasoning which gives a control over emotions. However, his psychologist approach collapses in absence of any of his determinants of a perfect human, what means that his philosophical system, including the psychologist logic, is case-dependent and applies to a selected group of humans by emergence on the basis of discrimination against intellectual features, often either inborn or independent on a personal choice./nHe was interested in an ethical standpoint and the method of conflict solving known as nonviolence, what means an action without a violence. In relation to this of his research interests, he co-organized stays in Poland for a French pacifist Jean Goss and an Austrian Christian theologian and anti-war activist Hilderad Gross-Mayr, who in 2009 got the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award established by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport in the U.S. state of Iowa to commemorate Pope John XXIII's the 1963 encyclical Pacem in terris (Peace on Earth) and in 1986 along with her husband got the Pope Paul VI Teacher of Peace Award by a Catholic peace organization Pax Christi USA. In particular, at the beginning of the Polish trade union federation Independent Self-governing Labour Union Solidarity, he organized the meeting of Jean Goss with the then movement leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who after being awarded by the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize to which the Goss couple were also nominated got also the 2001 Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award to recognize his leadership non-violent attitude. The Goss couple became famous as the apostles of nonviolence, particularly for preparation of the 1986 People Power Revolution ('Yellow Revolution') in Philippines, and lobbying for recognition of the conscientious objection by the Roman Catholic Church during the 1962\u20131965 Second Vatican Council opened by Pope John XXIII and closed by Pope Paul VI. In 1991, just after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Grzegorczyk was instrumental in organization of a symposium in Moscow dedicated to the nonviolence philosophy with participation of the Goss couple as well as a Canadian Catholic philosopher, theologian, and humanitarian Jean Vanier who was awarded by the 2013 Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award and the 2015 Templeton Prize and an American political scientist and writer on strategy of a nonviolent struggle Gene Sharp who in 1983 was the founding father of the Albert Einstein Institution to explore the methods of nonviolent resistance in conflicts and in 2009\u20132015 was four times nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite of some kind of liberalism present in his thought, he was a definitely radical thinker, in particular, he propagated a nonviolent dialogue with everyone including terrorists, he was particularly fervent in forcing towards both logic and dialogue with everyone, and he claimed that going towards defense in any conditions of own dignity and inventory is harmful because the Christian Doctrine of turning the other cheek is correct. He applied his ethics to a conflict resolution, put a particular emphasis onto to the methods of nonviolence professed by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., the laureate of the 1965 Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award, he was also one of the first public figures in Poland who focused attention on the ecological issues, and, before it was widely understood in Poland, he popularized the warnings due to the Club of Rome which have claimed that the resources of our planet are scarce and the idea of permanent growth is dangerous./nIn his philosophical marriage between religious involvement and both reism and a specific variant of naturalism, the particular position was occupied by the moral dimension of the religious study from the point of view of Christianity. In his pseudo-essays, pseudo-sermons, and pseudo-treatises collected in the book Moralitety awarded in 1987 by the prize Warszawska Premiera Literacka (Warsaw Literary Award), he emphasized the central elements of the Christian doctrine such like the radical command to give a selfless care testimony, especially with respect to an enemy. He attempted to place himself in the role of a Catholic priest who claims that a self-demolition is not important if personal intentions are not allowed to be reduced, whereas in the book Europa: odkrywanie sensu istnienia (Europe: discovering the sense of existence) he emphasized the role of a logical reasoning in the foundations of civilization achievements to give an axiological theory of history. He claimed therein that the evolutionary development of humankind is accompanied by a specific participation of divine forces into development of human cultures, especially he pointed out altruism and a voluntary service as the examples of such either biological theology or theological biology. Without taking into account directly the Roman Catholic Church's domination in Europe and its enormous impact onto the foundations of the European philosophy in the form of various intellectual restrictions, such like in the most known cases of the Italian scholar Galileo Gailei and philosopher Giordano Bruno, he claimed European scientific theories were always logically ordered and based on deduction, empiricism and phenomenology, and limited the sense of the world to nothing but seeing the world as similar to an understandable text \u2013 hence he claimed that the explored world is already a humanly ordered structure. For him, history of religion is just deepening of this sense, with Abraham placed as the initiator of a new epoch of monotheism and a biblical reasoning as a pictorial system, which both married with the ancient Greco-Roman intellectual traditionalism gives the most appropriate philosophical system./nOn his theory, Jesus Christ of Nazareth appeals for a well-defined individual testimony, and the issues of a daily life are nothing when compared to the extreme situations because Christianity for him is a realization of spiritual rather than vital values. He saw the teachings of Jesus as the acceptance of the European logic, he radically saw Jesus Christ as the provider of the European moral pattern because Jesus demanded and demonstrated coherent individual testimony. According to Grzegorczyk, in a wide sense logic lays the foundations of the European rationalism, with respect to which he identified himself as a cultivator, which says that any knowledge must emerge by logic and empiricism and must go only towards the essential points. By his personal religious standpoint shared with the passion to logic, he always fought against himself and was limited to no more than two possibilities: the way of ethics and its universality and allowing the inexpressible in order to kill the conflict between a reason and religion. Thus, by his point of view, a rational theology is useless in favour of an imprecisely defined spiritual religiousness merely based on ecumenic approach to Christianity, that is for Grzegorczyk the biblical traditionalism of Catholicism losses the intellectual value when compared to the moral testimony of its creator Jesus Christ \u2013 a reason married with an openness towards values. What is more interesting for Grzegorczyk's religious creativity, although his formal membership at the Roman Catholic Church he frequently expressed critical opinions on concrete policies of this religious organization, even on the pages of free-thinkers periodicals, and, similarly to a Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Slovyov, he manifestly ignored the East\u2013West Schism between the Roman Catholicism and Orthodox Christianity, for example he took the Eucharist sacrament at both the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. He was a fervent follower of Roman Catholics who felt an affinity to the Russian Orthodoxy, his religious reflection merged Christian morality to the European cultural tradition and by his views the same values lay the foundations of both Christianity and European rationalism. In his approach, history of Christianity, including its biblical roots, can be considered the history of how a sense and understanding of the world can be deepened by contemplating the sacred and transcendent./nHe convinced that Modernity with its technological development creates the new challenges for humans, whose realization demands both an appropriate ethical mode, such like dedication to other and conscious self-limitations, and the rationalist standpoint. What is intriguing, in practice he realized this of his ideas for a general public in the form of a monk-like modest appearance joined with straightforward and often manifestly ignorant and arrogant if no blatant speech, which by virtue of the dogmatic Christianity could be interpreted in terms of either demonic possession or act of blasphemy. For example, in his article Odpowiedzialno\u015b\u0107 filozof\u00f3w (Responsibility of philosophers) he claimed that a philosopher whose texts are at the service of state authorities, creates a vicious circle of unquestionable truths which have not much in common with reality and strengthen the authorities's monopoly on a political violence, similarly to the Roman Catholic Church's theorists who referred to the holy books instead of commenting on the facts, whereas this article was published in May 1981 on the pages of the Polish Catholic quarterly Wi\u0119\u017a with death of the Primate of Poland Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski as the main subject of the issue and on the eve of introduction of the martial law in Poland by the communist authorities to crush the political opposition. It was not the only one and episodic case when Grzegorczyk could not clearly and unambiguously decide on his intellectual position with respect to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and the political ideology of the communist state authorities. He openly presented himself in a straightforward opposition to a religious organization when it was convenient and useful to his professional activities and when it gave him a professional advance or other at least societal profit, whereas he became suddenly manifestly religious when he sought any gains to support his ideology by a religion. In particular, the latter feature was ostentatiously expressed by his idea of ecumenism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, especially when he sought the profits in the academic contacts with Russian and Ukrainian academic professionals who humbly supported promotion of his borderline philosophical ideas motivated by himself arranged hospitability and grants./nThe big gap in conformity with respect to both political and social association which he adopted from the Roman Catholic-oriented teachers of his war-time underground education supported by his father's attitude was completely filled with a big conformity towards his academic career based on the politicized part of the Polish academia independently on a political system of Poland, what he made with extraordinary intellectual autonomy and a coherent reasoning. Following his personal pseudo-clerical image and pseudo-homiletic written style formed on the dogmatic philosophical traditionalism appropriate to both the Fathers and Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church enriched by the arguments of neo-Thomism and Christian existentialism, he attempted to defend a manifestly old-fashioned model of academic work understood as a humble dedication to ideas and humanity rather than a professionalism. In particular, in his part of the 2005's survey Gdzie ta nasza filozofia? (Where is this Our Philosophy?) he sought new circumstances of philosophizing as generated by the current fashions and the collective factors such like massiveness of higher education and general commercialization of life, he compared the present-day both philosophers and generally all humanists to businessmen who first of all look for their personal professional success by the way of a relatively fast and an appropriately high return of the incurred hardships rather than a long and arduous effort which leads to a perfect product, and, moreover, he claimed that the sham achievements are fully able to give quite good living conditions to scientists and philosophers because social control over these products is already impossible as a result of development of an academic specialization beyond such control./nFor Grzegorczyk, the greatest intellectual challenge was an axiological approach to human history. Taking from the Marxist sociology, he approached cultural conflict by wealth of a privileged social class as contrasted to poverty of the rest of a society marginalized and excluded from a system focusing on rich, powerful, and clever individuals. He enriched the Marxian thought by emphasis onto the role of intellectual divisions in perpetuation of conflicts, and, similarly to the creators of the Aryan race theory based on the common proto-language, contributed the Utopian necessity of a common language for agreement and reconciliation in the global scale, as well as the Utopian idea of an identical insight of all people in understanding the wholeness of human affairs. Furthermore, he attempted to convince that the suitable theoretical apparatus is the only way for the worldly peace, that since needs of everyone can not be satisfied there is the necessity to endure limitations collectively and introduce global regulations on the basis of a persuasive argument, and that a synthesis of scientific knowledge is necessary to serve the fair and peaceful coexistence, a theory solidified in 1956 by a Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in the Marxist-Leninist-inspired Soviet foreign policy at the 20th Congress of the CPSU and applied by the Soviet Union and the Soviet-allied socialist states such like the communist Poland during the 1947\u20131991 Cold War, especially in the phases Cold War (1953\u20131962) and Cold War (1962\u20131979). Grzegorczyk doctrinally did not respect any form of pluralism and any kind of diversity among humankind, he sought the order in a large scale uniformity which is appropriate to the political ideologies which laid the foundations of the 20th century totalitarianism in Europe \u2013 both German Nazism and Soviet communism. For this reason, implicitly, he sought the European totalitarianism as the consequence of the European cultural heritage supported by his logic. On the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he appealed to the United Nations to take into account the principle that every person has the right to help any other person in a worse position than himself or herself in whatever country that person may reside, what in 1977 met the applause due to an American-Jewish leftist philosopher and left-wing activist Noam Chomsky who published a fragment of his correspondence with Grzegorczyk./nIn the aftermath of the famous 1972's report The Limits to Growth by the Club of Rome, he developed his general Utopian idea of all-human solidarity by propagation of self-limitations on consumption and combating wastefulness. In contrary to his 'general well-being' utopia, in the case of political ethics he mostly contributed to criticism of the Solidarity, the Eastern bloc's first independent trade union recognized by a communist regime and created in September 1980 at the Vladimir Lenin Shipyard in Gda\u0144sk under the leadership of Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, in the time when the communist Poland was strongly divided between its supporters and opponents, and when there was not a place for the \"middle option\" between the yes and the no for the anti-communist opposition. Despite that Grzegorczyk at this time was not an open supporter to the Polish government, it was understood as his direct conformity with the communist authorities in the name of his false concept of peace, and, consequently, the society of the Catholic intellectuals related to the magazine Tygodnik Powszechny (The Catholic Weekly) broke collaboration with him. Moreover, although he survived the 1939\u20131945 Nazi\u2013Soviet occupation of Poland and was injured as an insurgent of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, he manifestly demonstrated a glaring absence of sensitivity on the problem of the Holocaust, and also in this case his attitude entirely confirmed the crucial impact due to the war-time underground teachers of strictly nationalist-Catholic orientation. In 1993, he authored an article Dekalog rozumu (Ten commandments of reason) which proposed the moral rules 1. You will not clap, 2. You will not whistle, 3. Listen to the content, not the tone of expression, 4. Fight with an argument, not with a human, 5. Do not flatter other and yourself, 6. Distrust other and yourself, 7. Search for what is important, 8. Try to build something better, instead to look for scapegoats, 9. Do not generalize too hastily, 10. Do not use proverbs, they are usually a stupidity of nations, which imitated and caricatured the Ten Commandments by an Old-Testament Jewish leader Moses to ridicule the biblical foundations of Judeo-Christianity by comparing them to the academic work./nGrzegorczyk had a paradoxically formed mindset, a mind which was as modal as a modal logic. By the variety of his views, he criticized and was criticized by more radical exponents of various ideological positions \u2013 Catholics disliked his contacts with Atheists, Atheists accused him of clericalism, anti-communists disliked his attempts for searching the middle position, communists questioned his defense of freedom.[citation needed] He wanted to marry all with everyone, but his idea of unification was able to create only a borderline philosophical system whose followers create a dramatic minority even in the academic philosophy of Poland.[citation needed] The unpopularity of his system is contained in the open discrimination inherited with idealism, especially the German idealism such like of Friedrich Nietzsche which served as the philosophical basis for the Nazi Germany political ideology by Adolf Hitler.[citation needed] His logically trivialized philosophical views were inadequate for both communists and anti-communists, for both religious and irreligious individuals, for both philosophers and scientists, because he manifestly avoided a strict association with any concrete group and, in fact, participated in a one-person struggle for independence and freedom./nDespite that he was a well functioned academic personality among few major specialized groups \u2013 mathematicians, philosophers, Catholic intellectuals, people of art \u2013 and was active in the international society of socio-political activists, he solicitously worked on the public self-picture which presented him as independent on political, social, religious, and scientific relationships to get some popularity among students in the times when the Polish academia was directly dependent on the communist ideology and governed by the politicized scholars. Nevertheless, in his daily work, he tended to the goals which created the appraisal of an inexhaustible way towards extraordinary egoism and self-comfort with a help of conformity with any of the aforementioned systems, he simply used his social links and professional connections within these systems when it was necessary to him. For example, he manifestly declared in public to audiences and students that he had never tended to get any higher positions in academia, whereas actually he easily accepted all higher positions offered to him and abandoned a work only when he sought is as inconvenient with respect to his purposes, such like the cultural and political ones met in Amsterdam which were in a direct conflict with his religious and ideological views adequate to the reduced both intellectual and social expression in the communist Poland./nHe had never attempted to be a favourite academic teacher, he openly avoided any close cooperations with his students and deflected their attention by lack of will to co-authorship with a parallel will to interact with them for knowing more about them, he preferred a bold individual research work although he had multiple collaborations. He was hungry for knowledge on world and people, such like in the \"ecumenic dialogue\" with the Soviets and the various Polish communists, but was never able to fully follow any concrete system, had never joined any political party, and was focused merely on collecting information only for construction of a possible either critique or irony. Even those very few students who decided to prepare their doctoral dissertations under his supervising, never felt to contribute in the work of their mentor and to continue his intellectual traditionalism, because emergence of an academic school dedicated to development of his heritage in mathematics, logic, ethics, philosophy was impossible by his attitude. He was able to attract the attention of students extremely rarely, the facts say for themselves in the best way \u2013 over more than six decades of his academic work, he was able to produce no more than three doctoral students with 10\u201320 years of difference between the graduations, he supervised a computer scientist Stanis\u0142aw Walig\u00f3rski's thesis in mathematics Equations in closure algebras and their applications (1964), a Polish-Jewish philosopher and mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Krajewski's thesis in logic Nonstandard classes of satisfiability and their applications in investigating of some extensions of axiomatic theories (1975), and an aesthetician Bohdan Misiuna's thesis in ethics Philosophical analysis of disgust phenomena and its axiological consequences (1992)./nSince the time of his underground higher education, both he had supported and he was supported primarily by the politically involved academic teachers such like Bogdan Suchodolski and also Jan \u0141ukasiewicz. When Suchodolski organized interdisciplinary meetings for professors in the Palace of Congresses and Conferences of the PAS in Jab\u0142onna near Warsaw in presence of a meticulously chosen audience, in particular the students who had the preferred \"social origin\", then he served humbly as the pillar. In the time of the dominant socialist orthodoxy, he presented himself as the \"Jesus Christ\" of the Polish humanities \u2013 for students his philosophy was beyond the bias, intellectual enslavement and hardline correctness of the state ideology. For the communist Poland's state authorities he was officially a persona non grata secured by the politically useful historical family background, whereas for the academic youth he served as the 'socrealist Messiah' against the system teachings. He was a talented speaker towards the youth, in both philosophizing and personal action he avoided biased and emotional notions, particularism, cultivation of a scheme, routine, institution in favour of an individual, and impressive words. He impacted onto an authentic individual attitude by his analytical, synthetic and globalist reasoning, criticism on own activities, selflessness in cognitive actions, promotion of a selective truth, constant attention and control over research by the selective values based on the specific union of the Christian theology and liberalized Marxist thought./nOn the one hand, his style of giving opinions was particularly distinctive in both criticism and straightforwardness, often manifestly explicit and giving the impression of directly either conflicting with or fighting against the ideals which he supported theoretically, but, on the other hand, he expressed opinions only when it was fully convenient and safe for his professional and intellectual position and preserved his personal world view. His logically radicalized philosophical system was the specific mixture of the Christian theology and the Communist Ideology which directed his primary logical thought onto the intellectual margins to walk on the borderlines with a liberation theology and a religious communism, and to visit these extremist and anarchistic territories time by time for an intellectual explosion. In a clear opposition to pluralism of the world, he manifestly claimed existence of the selective values which are absolute and universal in the earthly scale. His theoretical pedagogy, more precisely philosophy of education, was based on the specific ideological mode of nonviolence philosophy, which was particularly attractive in the period of development of anti-communist opposition and political repressions in the communist Poland. He left an explicit context of the Communist Ideology in favour of his own ideology on both similarity of life and creativity, and action and rationalism which by an ecumenic approach married the Christian theology with selected concepts of Marxism with the background in logic. However, his philosophy was able to inspire educational theory and practice in Poland by freedom, tolerance, independent choice, individual rights, and the dictate of the related professional duties of an educator. On the other hand, also his ideology of democracy was attractive for some young intellectuals of the communist Poland, because it employed the concepts of a civil society and discussion community formed by a scattering between totalitarianism and anti-totalitarianism./nIn 1953, he married Renata Maria Grzegorczykowa who is an internationally renowned Polish philologist and expert in polonist linguistics. Grzegorczyk had a daughter and a son. His son Tomasz Grzegorczyk, who was born in 1954 and in 2003 authored the French-Polish translation of a classical academic book in pedagogical ethics Le choix d'\u00e9duquer: \u00e9thique et p\u00e9dagogie (1991) by a French theorist of education Philippe Meirieu./nGrzegorczyk's publicly known grandchildren are a Polish physician-internist Franciszek Grzegorczyk who has worked for a few hospitals in Warsaw, including the academic Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, an economist Jacek Przeciszewski who graduated at the Warsaw School of Economics and is an activist of the Warsaw branch of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, and a lawyer Jan Przeciszewski./nGrzegorczyk died of natural causes in Warsaw on 20 March 2014 at the age of 91.

In elasticity theory he worked with Wolfgang Zerna, who was in Newcastle in 1948/1949 as part of an academic exchange programme between the U.K. and Germany. (Subsequently, Zerna was a professor in Hannover.) With Rivlin, Green published some of the first works on the mechanics of materials with memory. From the mid-1960s he primarily deal with the thermodynamics of continua, the theory of elastic-plastic continua (with Naghdi) and various hydrodynamic problems (such as jets in ideal fluids).

This led her to conceptualize energy, and to derive its quantitative relationships to the mass and velocity of an object./nHer philosophical magnum opus, Institutions de Physique (Paris, 1740, first edition; Foundations of Physics), circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was republished and translated into several other languages within two years of its original publication./nShe participated in the famous vis viva debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were heavily represented in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, first published shortly after du Ch\u00e2telet's death./nNumerous biographies, books and plays have been written about her life and work in the two centuries since her death. In the early 21st century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest./nIn addition to producing famous translations of works by authors such as Bernard Mandeville and Isaac Newton, du Ch\u00e2telet wrote a number of significant philosophical essays, letters and books that were well known in her time./nBecause of her well-known collaboration and romantic involvement with Voltaire, which spanned much of her adult life, for generations du Ch\u00e2telet has been known as mistress and collaborator to her much better known intellectual companion. Despite her notable achievements and intelligence, her accomplishments have often been subsumed under his and, as a result, even today she is often mentioned only within the context of Voltaire's life and work during the period of the early French Enlightenment. In her own right, she was a strong and influential philsopher, with the ideals of her works spread from the ideals of individual empowerment to issues of the social contract./nRecently, however, professional philosophers and historians have transformed the reputation of du Ch\u00e2telet. Historical evidence indicates that her work had a very significant influence on the philosophical and scientific conversations of the 1730s and 1740s \u2013 in fact, she was famous and respected by the greatest thinkers of her time.[1] Francesco Algarotti styled the dialogue of Il Newtonianismo per le dame based on conversations he observed between Du Ch\u00e2telet and Voltaire in Cirey.[2]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet corresponded with renowned mathematicians such as Johann II Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler, early developers of calculus. She was also tutored by Bernoulli's prodigy students, Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis and Alexis Claude Clairaut. Frederick the Great of Prussia, who re-founded the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was her great admirer, and corresponded with both Voltaire and du Ch\u00e2telet regularly. He introduced du Ch\u00e2telet to Leibniz's philosophy by sending her the works of Christian Wolff, and du Ch\u00e2telet sent him a copy of her Institutions./nHer works were published and republished in Paris, London, and Amsterdam; they were translated into German and Italian; and, they were discussed in the most important scholarly journals of the era, including the Memoires des Tr\u00e9voux, the Journal des S\u00e7avans, the G\u00f6ttingische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen, and others. Perhaps most intriguingly, many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the Encyclop\u00e9die of Diderot and D'Alembert, and some of the articles in the Encyclop\u00e9die are a direct copy of her work (this is an active area of current academic research - the latest research can be found at Project Vox, a Duke University research initiative)./n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet was born on 17 December 1706 in Paris, the only girl amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: Ren\u00e9-Alexandre (b. 1698), Charles-Auguste (b. 1701), and Elisabeth-Th\u00e9odore (b. 1710). Her eldest brother, Ren\u00e9-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Th\u00e9odore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abbot and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young.[3] Du Ch\u00e2telet also had a half-sister, Michelle, who was born of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.[4]/nHer father was Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil, a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of du Ch\u00e2telet's birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King Louis XIV. He held a weekly salon on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited. Her mother was Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de Breteuil.[5]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.[6]/nAmong their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the perpetual secretary of the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. Du Ch\u00e2telet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old.[7] Du Ch\u00e2telet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women.[7] While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of \u00c9milie's intellectual curiosity,[7] there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of du Ch\u00e2telet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.[8]/nIn either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status. When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as fencing and riding, and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her.[7] As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek and German; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science./nDu Ch\u00e2telet also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.[7]/nOn 12 June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.[9][note 1] Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.[note 2] Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was arranged. As a wedding gift, her husband was made governor of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725. Du Ch\u00e2telet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four./n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet and the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont had three children: Fran\u00e7oise-Gabrielle-Pauline (30 June 1726 \u2013 1754, married in 1743 to Alfonso Carafa, Duca di Montenero), Louis Marie Florent (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).[10] Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.[11] On 4 September 1749 \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet gave birth to Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde du Ch\u00e2telet, daughter of Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert. She died as a toddler in Lun\u00e9ville on 6 May 1751.[12]/nAfter bearing three children, \u00c9milie, Marquise du Ch\u00e2telet, considered her marital responsibilities fulfilled and reached an agreement with her husband to live separate lives while still maintaining one household.[13] In 1733, aged 26, du Ch\u00e2telet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by Moreau de Maupertuis, a member of the Academy of Sciences; although mathematics was not his forte, he had received a solid education from Johann Bernoulli, who also taught Leonhard Euler. However by 1735 du Ch\u00e2telet had turned for her mathematical training to Alexis Clairaut, a mathematical prodigy known best for Clairaut's equation and Clairaut's theorem. Du Ch\u00e2telet resourcefully sought some of France's best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Caf\u00e9 Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she returned and entered after having men's clothing made for her.[14]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father's salons; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child.[6]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at Cirey in Haute-Marne, northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion. There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 Elements of the Philosophy of Newton. This was through a poem dedicated to her at the beginning of the text and in the preface, where Voltaire praised her study and contributions.[15] The book's chapters on optics show strong similarities with her own Essai sur l'optique. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the Journal des savants.[16]/nSharing a passion for science, Voltaire and du Ch\u00e2telet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in du Ch\u00e2telet's home in Lorraine.[17] In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since du Ch\u00e2telet disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published.[18] She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.[19]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet's relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by du Ch\u00e2telet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from \"one life to the next.\"[20]/nIn May 1748, du Ch\u00e2telet began an affair with the poet Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant.[21] In a letter to a friend, she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde. Du Ch\u00e2telet died on 10 September 1749 [22] at Ch\u00e2teau de Lun\u00e9ville,[23] from a pulmonary embolism. She was 42. Her daughter died 20 months later.[24]/nIn her writings, du Ch\u00e2telet criticized John Locke's philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: \"Locke's idea of the possibility of thinking matter is [\u2026] abstruse.\"[25] Her critique on Locke originated in her commentary on Bernard de Mandeville's The Fable of the Bees. She resolutely favored universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintained that this kind of law is innate. Du Ch\u00e2telet claimed the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Ch\u00e2telet rejected Locke's aversion to innate ideas and prior principles. She also reversed Locke's negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the Institutions. On the contrary, she affirmed her arguments in favor of the necessity of prior and universal principles. \"Two and two could then make as well 4 as 6 if\nprior principles did not exist.\"[clarification needed]/nPierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' and Julien Offray de La Mettrie's references to du Ch\u00e2telet's deliberations on motion, free will, thinking matter, numbers and the way to do metaphysics are a sign of the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, and argues against Maupertuis.[26]/nIn 1737 du Ch\u00e2telet published a paper Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu,[27] based upon her research into the science of fire. In it she speculated that there may be colors in other suns that are not found in the spectrum of sunlight on Earth./nHer book Institutions de Physique[28] (\"Lessons in Physics\") was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13-year-old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna in 1746. Du Ch\u00e2telet originally preferred anonymity in her role as the author, because she wished to conceal her sex. Ultimately, however, Institutions was convincing to salon-dwelling intellectuals in spite of the commonplace sexism./nInstitutions discussed, refuted, and synthesized many ideas of prominent mathematicians and physicists of the time. In particular, the text is famous for discussing ideas that originated with G.W. Leibniz and Christian Wolff, and for using the principle of sufficient reason often associated with their philosophical work. This main work is equally famous for providing a detailed discussion and evaluation of ideas that originated with Isaac Newton and his followers. That combination is more remarkable than it might seem now, since the ideas of Leibniz and Newton were regarded as fundamentally opposed to one another by most of the major philosophical figures of the 18th century.[29]/nIn chapter I, du Ch\u00e2telet included a description of her rules of reasoning, based largely on Descartes\u2019s principle of contradiction and Leibniz\u2019s principle of sufficient reason. In chapter II, she applied these rules of reasoning to metaphysics, discussing god, space, time, and matter. In chapters III through VI, du Ch\u00e2telet continued to discuss the role of god and his relationship to his creation. In chapter VII, she broke down the concept of matter into three parts: the macroscopic substance available to sensory perception, the atoms composing that macroscopic material, and an even smaller constituent unit similarly imperceptible to human senses. However, she carefully added that there was no way to know how many levels truly existed. The remainder of Institutions considered more metaphysics and classical mechanics. Du Ch\u00e2telet discussed the concepts of space and time in a manner more consistent with modern relativity than her contemporaries. She described both space and time in the abstract as representations of the relationships between coexistent bodies rather than physical substances. This included an acknowledgement that \"absolute\" place is an idealization and that \"relative\" place was the only real, measurable quantity. Du Ch\u00e2telet also presented a thorough explanation of Newton\u2019s laws of motion and their function on earth./nIn 1741 du Ch\u00e2telet published a book titled R\u00e9ponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan. D'Ortous de Mairan, secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for forces vives. Du Ch\u00e2telet presented a point-by-point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments, causing him to withdraw from the controversy.[30]/nImmanuel Kant's first publication in 1747, 'Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces' (Gedanken zur wahren Sch\u00e4tzung der lebendigen Kr\u00e4fte), focused on du Ch\u00e2telet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, Johann Augustus Eberhard, accused Kant of taking ideas from du Ch\u00e2telet.[31]/nAlthough in the early 18th century the concepts of force and momentum had been long understood, the idea of energy as being transferable between different systems was still in its infancy and would not be fully resolved until the 19th century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction' and momentum can not transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no potential momentum. Emmy Noether later proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, kinetic and potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time./nDu Ch\u00e2telet's contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. In doing so, she became the first to elucidate the concept of energy as such, and to quantify its relationship to mass and velocity based on her own empirical studies. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by Willem 's Gravesande in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity: She showed that the balls that hit the clay with twice the velocity penetrated four times as deep into the clay./nOne of her most important contributions to science was her elucidation of the concepts of energy and energy conservation. With the exception of Leibniz, earlier thinkers like Newton believed that \"energy\" was indistinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the time the balls spent falling, when in fact it is proportional to the height from which they were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is \n\n\n\nE\n=\n\n\n1\n2\n\n\nm\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle E={\\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nE\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E}\n\n is the kinetic energy of an object, \n\n\n\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m}\n\n its mass and \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n its speed. Energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat . . .)./nNewton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one of them. Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Ch\u00e2telet.[32][33]/nIn 1749, the year of du Ch\u00e2telet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (often referred to as simply the Principia), including her derivation of the notion of conservation of energy from its principles of mechanics.[34] Despite modern misconceptions, Newton's work on his Principia was not perfect. Du Ch\u00e2telet took on the task of not only translating his work from Latin to French, but adding important information to it as well. Her commentary was as essential to her contemporaries as her spreading of Newton's ideas. Du Ch\u00e2telet's commentary was very extensive, comprising almost two-thirds of volume II of her edition.[35]/nTo undertake a formidable project such as this, du Ch\u00e2telet prepared to translate the Principia by continuing her studies in analytic geometry, mastering calculus, and reading important works in experimental physics. It was her rigorous preparation that allowed her to add a lot more accurate information to her commentary, both from herself and other scientists she studied or worked with. She was one of only 20 or so people in the 1700s who could understand such advanced math and apply the knowledge to other works. This helped du Ch\u00e2telet greatly, not only with her work on the Principia but also in her other important works like the Institutions de Physique.[36]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet made very important corrections in her translation that helped support Newton's theories about the universe. Newton, based on the theory of fluids, suggested that gravitational attraction would cause the poles of the earth to flatten, thus causing the earth to bulge outwards at the equator. In Clairaut's Memoire, which confirmed Newton's hypothesis about the shape of the earth and gave more accurate approximations, Clairaut discovered a way to determine the shape of the other planets in the solar system. Du Ch\u00e2telet used Clairaut's proposal that the planets had different densities in her commentary to correct Newton's belief that the earth and the other planets were made of homogenous substances.[37]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet used the work of Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician and physicist, to further explain Newton's theory of the tides. This proof depended upon the three-body problem which even the best mathematicians in 18th century Europe were still confounded with. Using Clairaut's hypothesis about the differing of the planets' densities, Bernoulli theorized that the moon was 70 times denser than Newton had believed. Du Ch\u00e2telet used this discovery in her commentary of the Principia, further supporting Newton's theory about the law of gravitation.[37]/nPublished ten years after her death, today du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia is still the standard translation of the work into French [34] and remains the solitary complete rendition in French. Her translation was so important that it was the only one in any language used by Newtonian expert, I. Bernard Cohen, to write his own English version of Newton's Principia. Du Ch\u00e2telet not only used the works of other great scientists to revise Newton's work, but she added her own thoughts and ideas as a scientist in her own right. Her contributions in the French translation made Newton and his ideas look even better in the scientific community and around the world and recognition for this is owed to du Ch\u00e2telet. This enormous project, along with her Foundations of Physics, proved du Ch\u00e2telet's abilities as a great mathematician.[36] Her translation and commentary of the Principia contributed to the completion of the scientific revolution in France and to its acceptance in Europe.[34]/nIn Discours sur le bonheur, \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet argues that illusions are an instrument for happiness.[38] To be happy, \u201cone must have freed oneself of prejudice, one must be virtuous, healthy, have tastes and passions, and be susceptible to illusions...\u201d.[36] She mentions many things one needs for happiness but emphasizes the necessity of illusions as one should not dismiss all illusions. One should not abandon all illusions because they can bestow positivity and hope, which can ameliorate one's well-being. But Du Ch\u00e2telet also warns against trusting all illusions because many illusions are harmful to oneself.[38] These may cause negativity through a false reality, which can cause disappointment or even limit one\u2019s abilities. This lack of self-awareness from so many illusions may cause one to be self-deceived. She suggests a balance of trusting and rejecting illusions for happiness so as not to become self-deceived.[38]/nIn Foundation of Physics, \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet discusses avoiding error using two principles \u2013 the principle of contradiction and the principle of sufficient reason.[38] Du Ch\u00e2telet presumed that all knowledge is developed from more fundamental knowledge that relies on infallible knowledge. She states that this infallible fundamental knowledge is most reliable because it is self-explanatory and exists with a small number of conclusions. Her logic and principles are used for an arguably less-flawed understanding of physics, metaphysics, and morals.[38] The principle of contradiction essentially claims that the thing implying a contradiction is impossible. So, if one does not use the principles of contradiction, one will have errors including the failure to reject the contradiction causing element. To get from the possible or impossible to the actual or real, the principle of sufficient reason was revised by Du Ch\u00e2telet from Leibniz and integrated into science. The principle of sufficient reason suggests that every true thing has a reason for being so, and things without a reason do not exist. In essence, every effect has a cause, so the element in question must have a reasonable cause to be so.[38]/nIn application, \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet proposed that being happy and immoral are mutually exclusive. According to Du Ch\u00e2telet, this principle is embedded within the hearts of all individuals, and even wicked individuals have an undeniable consciousness of this contradiction that is grueling.[36] It suggests one cannot be living a happy life while living immorally. So, her suggested happiness requires illusions with a virtuous life. These illusions are naturally given like passions and tastes, and cannot be created. Du Ch\u00e2telet recommended we maintain the illusions we receive and work to not dismantle the trustworthy illusions because we cannot get them back.[36] In other words, true happiness is a blending of illusions and morality. If one merely attempts to be moral, one will not obtain the happiness one deeply seeks. If one just strives for the illusions, one will not get the happiness that is genuinely desired. One needs to endeavor in both illusions and happiness to get the sincerest happiness.[36]/nShe lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs\u2014some of it borrowed\u2014in one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.[7][39] To raise the money to pay back her debts, she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern derivatives, whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.[7]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book Voltaire and Madame du Ch\u00e2telet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach./nDu Ch\u00e2telet translated The Fable of the Bees in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will./nIn her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the Fable of the Bees, du Ch\u00e2telet argued strongly for women's education, particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French coll\u00e8ges. By denying women a good education, she argued, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.[40]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton's historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation./nA main-belt minor planet and a crater on Venus have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: Legacy of Light by Karen Zacar\u00edas; \u00c9milie: La Marquise Du Ch\u00e2telet Defends Her Life Tonight by Lauren Gunderson and Urania: the Life of \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet by Jyl Bonaguro.[41] The opera \u00c9milie by Kaija Saariaho is about the last moments of her life.[42]/nDu Ch\u00e2telet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (Femmes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres) introduced a possibly apocryphal story of her childhood.[43] According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden dividers as a doll; however, du Ch\u00e2telet undressed the dividers and intuiting their purpose, made a circle with them./nThe Institut \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, which was founded in France in 2006, supports \"the development and diffusion of research on women, sex, and gender\".[44]/nSince 2016, the French Society of Physics (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique) has awarded the \u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize to a physicist or team of researchers for excellence in Physics./nDuke University also presents an annual Du Ch\u00e2telet Prize in Philosophy of Physics \"for previously unpublished work in philosophy of physics by a graduate student or junior scholar\".[45]/nOn December 17, 2021, Google Doodle honored du Ch\u00e2telet.[46]/n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet was portrayed by the actress H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles in the docudrama Einstein's Big Idea.[22]/nScientific/nOther", "18434623": "Nan McKenzie Laird (born September 18, 1943) is the Harvey V.

He was nonetheless accepted for graduate studies at Princeton University, from where he received his PhD in mathematics in 1959 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"On embeddings of spheres.\"[3] He then became a Junior Fellow at Harvard University from 1961 to 1964. He is the Gerhard Gade University Professor and a Senior Fellow at Harvard. He is the brother of Joseph Mazur and the father of Alexander J. Mazur./nHis early work was in geometric topology. In an elementary fashion, he proved the generalized Schoenflies conjecture (his complete proof required an additional result by Marston Morse), around the same time as Morton Brown.  Both Brown and Mazur received the Veblen Prize for this achievement.  He also discovered the Mazur manifold and the Mazur swindle./nHis observations in the 1960s on analogies between primes and knots were taken up by others in the 1990s giving rise to the field of arithmetic topology./nComing under the influence of Alexander Grothendieck's approach to algebraic geometry, he moved into areas of diophantine geometry. Mazur's torsion theorem, which gives a complete list of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the rational numbers, is a deep and important result in the arithmetic of elliptic curves.  Mazur's first proof of this theorem depended upon a complete analysis of the rational points on certain modular curves.  This proof was carried in his seminal paper \"Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal\".\nThe ideas of this paper and Mazur's notion of Galois deformations, were among the key ingredients in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Mazur and Wiles had earlier worked together on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory./nIn an expository paper, Number Theory as Gadfly,[4] Mazur describes number theory as a field which/n\"produces, without effort, innumerable problems which have a sweet, innocent air about them, tempting flowers; and yet... number theory swarms with bugs, waiting to bite the tempted flower-lovers who, once bitten, are inspired to excesses of effort!\"/nHe expanded his thoughts in the 2003 book Imagining Numbers[5] and Circles Disturbed, a collection of essays on mathematics and narrative that he edited with writer Apostolos Doxiadis.[1]/nMazur was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[6] In 1982 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.[7] Mazur was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2001,[8] and in 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[9]/nMazur has received the Veblen Prize in geometry (1966), the Cole Prize in number theory (1982), the Chauvenet Prize for exposition (1994),[4] and the Steele Prize for seminal contribution to research (2000) from the American Mathematical Society.

He has mainly worked on regularity aspects of the Calculus of Variations, solving a few longstanding questions about the Hausdorff dimension of the singular sets of minimisers of vectorial integral functionals and the boundary singularities of solutions to nonlinear elliptic systems.[1] This connects to the work of authors as Almgren, De Giorgi, Morrey, Giusti, who proved theorems asserting regularity of solutions outside a singular set (i.e. a closed subset of null measure) both in geometric measure theory and for variational systems of partial differential equations. These are indeed called partial regularity results and one of the main issues is to establish whether the dimension of the singular set is strictly less than the ambient dimension. This question has found a positive answer for general integral functionals, thanks to the work of Kristensen and Mingione, who have also given explicit estimates for the dimension of the singular sets of minimisers.[2][3] Subsequently, Mingione has worked on nonlinear potential theory obtaining potential estimates for solutions to nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. Such estimates allow to give a unified approach to the regularity theory of quasilinear, degenerate equations[4][5][6] and relate to and upgrade previous work of Kilpel\u00e4inen, Mal\u00fd, Trudinger, Wang./nMingione was awarded the Bartolozzi prize in 2005, the Stampacchia medal in 2006 and the Caccioppoli prize in 2010.

He was taught privately by Hans Christian Saxtorph before studying theology at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1759.[1]/nBugge had at the same time under Christen Hees' (1712\u20131782) instruction studied mathematics, a subject he had shown a remarkable talent for. He worked as an assistant to Peder Kofoed (1728\u20131760) in connection with Kofoed's survey of Roskilde County under the auspices of the Royal Danish Academy of Science. He continued his studies of mathematics and physics and began working as an assistant for Christian Horrebow (1718\u20131776) at the Rundet\u00e5rn Observatory. In 1761, he was sent to Trondheim to observe the Transit of Venus. The results were published in the French scientific journal M\u00e9moires (1871). Following Kofoed's death, Bugge was hired as geographical surveyor by the Royal Danish Academy of Science. He surveyed approximately 20\u00a0km2 (7.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of Zealand annually and taught surveying at the same time. In 1765, he was appointed as trigonometrical observer and head of the Office of Surveying, where in that capacity, he carried out a triangulation of most of Zealand and \u00d8resund and determined the polar height of a number of trig points.[2]/nAs a practicing surveyor, he was responsible for the surveying of a number of estates and villages on Zealand. In 1768, Bugge was appointed Chief Surveyor. He was himself responsible for the education of surveyors and created guidelines for their work. Bugge became a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Science in 1775, further increasing his influence on its work with surveying of the country, and from 1780 until his death headed it alone. Bugge's work marked a breakthrough for the economic and geographic surveying of Denmark.[1]/nBugge was also charged with a wide range of other assignments. In 1774, he and professor C. C.

On his return to Denmark, the Rundet\u00e5rn Observatory was refurbished and equipped with new and improved instruments. The King contributed to the project with 7,000 rigsdaler. A description of the observatory and observations from the three first years can be found in Bugge's privately published Observationes astron. annis 1781\u201383 (1784).

He began recording his meteorological observations in Clementinum and in 1775 he began the longest continuous series of observations in the world.[3]/nHe studied at the grammar school in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. In 1763 he entered the Jesuit Order; however, he was not ordained and after the dissolution of the Order in 1773 he moved to the Charles-Ferdinand University, where he studied mathematics, physics and astronomy. He was a pupil of Joseph Stepling, the founder of the observatory at Clementinum, where he was adjunct professor from 1774, and also took care of the Mathematical museum. After Stepling's death, he joined the department in 1778 as an adjunct professor of mathematical and physical geography. He was appointed director of the observatory in 1781, dean of the faculty of philosophy in 1792, and served as rector of the university for a year from 1795. In 1784 he married Kate\u0159ina Marsanov\u00e1, with whom he later had four children. During his lifetime he corresponded, for example, with the director of the observatory in Berlin, Johann III Bernoulli, the publisher of the Berlin astronomical calendar, Johann Elert Bode, the director of the observatory in Vienna, M. Hell, the director of the observatory in Gotha, Fr. X. von Zach.[4]/nIn the 1880s, Strnad also contributed to the rescue of the Prague astronomical clock, which had been in critical condition since 1735 and the Prague magistrate intended to put it away. Strnad, however, understood its historical value and therefore sought its repair. After a long effort, he managed to convince the magistrate Fischer and then the entire magistrate, who released the amount of money needed for the reconstruction. Under Strnad's expert supervision, the repair was carried out for 793 gold coins between 1787 and 1791 by the clockmaker Simon Landsperger. As the magistrate realised the great service Strnad had done for the city, he was admitted together with his sons to the association of Prague burgesses and was exempted from all fees./nBy observing the height of the Sun as it passed through the meridian using a quadrant of 3.5 feet radius, which he made in 1776, he calculated the latitude of the Clementine Observatory. With the result \u03c6 = 50\u00b0 4\u2032 32\u2033 he supplemented Stepling's longitude of 32\u00b0 11\u2032 15\u2033 east of El Hierro, and thus the exact position of the observatory was determined. He based his calculations on 42 measurements.[5]/nAlready as a member of the Jesuit order, Strnad made measurements of meteorological data. From J. Stepling he gained further experience with regular meteorological observations. His diaries from the beginning of 1775 have been preserved; regular measurements (pressure, temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction) have been made in Clementinum ever since. Strnad also initiated the establishment of other meteorological stations in Bohemia (e.g. in Choce\u0148, Tel\u010d, \u017datec, Plan\u00e1 u Mari\u00e1nsk\u00fdch L\u00e1zn\u00ed, \u017ditenice, etc.). He dealt with meteor observations and measurements of the Earth's magnetic field./nStrnad was a member of the Regia Societas Scientiarum Bohemica (or Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences), which supported the establishment of an international network of meteorological stations in the northern hemisphere, and between 1781 and 1792 he participated in the activities of the society. In order to compare measurements with each other, he initiated regular measurements at 7 am, 2 pm and 9 pm - times that are still in use today. Strnad's high-quality materials, which he produced for the company, earned him three public commendations. In the Mannheim Yearbook he wrote: \"However, our observatory is situated on a very low site and surrounded by houses, mainly Jewish, on the north and east sides. Although they are all lower there, it is still certain that the smoke reciprocally, though more rarely, from so many hundreds of neighbouring chimneys causes a change in the temperature...\"[6] With this contribution he anticipated by half a century Luke Howard's observation of 1833 that the climate of the city is greatly affected by the heat caused, amongst others, by the burning of large quantities of fuel./nStrnad, as a Czech scientist and author, was one of the figures of the nascent Czech national revival and ranks with names such as Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd, Karel Rafael Ungar, or Jan Bohum\u00edr Dlaba\u010d. He also tried to bring science to a wider audience. Most of Strnad's writings are written in German, some in Latin and only a minimum in Czech but this did not contradict the fact that he was a Czech scientist. At the time of the birth of the Czech National Revival, Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd, its leading figure, also wrote in German about Czech, just as the Societas scientiarum Bohemica  published its works (Abhandlungen der bohmischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften) in this language. Strnad's scientific activity is inextricably linked to this private Scholarly Society, in whose Abhandlungen of 1775 he published his first article on meteorology - on weather observations in 1774.[7]/nHe was chairman of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences from 1787 to 1788. He became the curator of the society's collections and in 1791 he lectured on solar eclipses at its ceremonial meeting in the presence of Emperor Leopold II. Three years later, he was removed by its management from the administration of the network of meteorological observations which the society intended to organize. The cause seems to have been the fear of its conservative members of the strict ban on secret societies issued by the Viennese government in fear of the Enlightenment, the originators of the French Revolution of 1789. Even Strnad's forced written declaration that he was not a member of a secret society or association did not satisfy suspicions. More recent documents confirm that he was a Freemason (until 1848, Masonic lodges were public).[8] This revocation probably led to Strnad becoming involved shortly thereafter in the organization of meteorological volunteer stations within the Patriotic Economic Society.[7]/nAs the former secretary of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences, Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd, had been seriously ill for a long time, ten members met in Strnad's apartment in December 1795 and elected him as the former assistant secretary to this honorary office in place of Dobrovsk\u00fd, without asking the later leader of the Czech national revival for his consent. J. Dobrovsk\u00fd was deeply affected by this indiscretion, because he considered it a suspension and the result was the end of his friendship with Anton\u00edn Strnad. In a letter to Ferenc Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi from Prague on 24 November 1795, Strnad wrote that Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd was behaving foolishly and that his actions were compromising the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences, of which he was secretary. He claims theologically unsustainable things and demands the restoration of the Jesuit Order, etc. Dobrovsk\u00fd's strange behaviour is explained by the fact that in June 1795 he suffered a serious mental illness, which lasted for two months, and after a short stay in an insane asylum it returned to Dobrovsk\u00fd later.[7]/nStrnad tried to transform the private learned society into a public Royal Bohemian Society, thanks to which he was also in the delegation that submitted a petition for the establishment of a public learned society to Emperor Joseph II in September 1784. In 1793 he delivered his lecture On the Type of Solar Eclipses before Emperor Leopold II.[9] In 1799 Strnad fell ill with tuberculosis. After his health deteriorated, F\u00fcrst Ferdinand Kinsk\u00fd invited him to his castle in Sazen\u00e1 to recover. However, Anton\u00edn Strnad died there on 23 September 1799. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Clement in Chr\u017e\u00edn near Velvary.[7]/nIn his honour, a street in the Prague district Male\u0161ice was named Strnadova Street in 1931.[10]", "58641040": "Atsuko Miyaji (Japanese: \u5bae\u5730\u5145\u5b50, born 1965[1]) is a Japanese cryptographer and number theorist known for her research on elliptic-curve cryptography and software obfuscation.

He died at the age of 51 in 1982. He is the father of musician Mark Oliver Everett./nAlthough largely disregarded until near the end of Everett's lifetime, the MWI received more credibility with the discovery of quantum decoherence in the 1970s and has received increased attention in recent decades, becoming one of the mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics alongside Copenhagen, pilot wave theories, and consistent histories./nHugh Everett III was born in 1930 and raised in the Washington, D.C. area. His parents separated when he was young. Initially raised by his mother (Katherine Lucille Everett, n\u00e9e Kennedy), he was raised by his father (Hugh Everett, Jr.) and stepmother (Sarah Everett, n\u00e9e Thrift) from the age of seven.[5]/nAt age 12, Everett wrote a letter to Albert Einstein asking him whether that which maintained the universe was something random or unifying.[6] Einstein responded as follows:/nDear Hugh: There is no such thing like an irresistible force and immovable body. But there seems to be a very stubborn boy who has forced his way victoriously through strange difficulties created by himself for this purpose. Sincerely yours, A. Einstein[6]/nEverett won a half scholarship to St. John's College High School in Washington, D.C. From there, he moved to the nearby Catholic University of America to study chemical engineering as an undergraduate. There, he read about Dianetics in Astounding Science Fiction. Although he never exhibited interest in Scientology (which Dianetics became), he retained a distrust of conventional medicine throughout his life.[5]/nDuring World War II, Everett's father was fighting in Europe as a lieutenant colonel on the general staff. After the war, Everett's father was stationed in West Germany, and Everett joined him in 1949, taking a year off from his undergraduate studies. Father and son were both keen photographers and took hundreds of pictures of West Germany being rebuilt. Reflecting their technical interests, the pictures were \"almost devoid of people\".[5]/nEverett graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1953 with a degree in chemical engineering, although he had completed sufficient courses for a mathematics degree as well./nEverett received a National Science Foundation fellowship that allowed him to attend Princeton University for graduate studies. He started his studies at Princeton in the mathematics department, where he worked on the nascent field of game theory under Albert W. Tucker, but slowly drifted into physics. In 1953 he took his first physics courses, notably Introductory Quantum Mechanics with Robert Dicke.[5]/nIn 1954, Everett took Methods of Mathematical Physics with Eugene Wigner, although he remained active in mathematics and presented a paper on military game theory in December. He passed his general examinations in the spring of 1955, thereby gaining his master's degree, and then started work on his dissertation that would (much) later make him famous. He switched thesis advisor to John Archibald Wheeler sometime in 1955, wrote a couple of short papers on quantum theory, and completed his long paper \"Wave Mechanics Without Probability\" in April 1956.[7]/nIn his third year at Princeton, Everett moved into an apartment he shared with three friends he had made during his first year, Hale Trotter, Harvey Arnold[8] and Charles Misner. Arnold later described Everett as follows:/nHe was smart in a very broad way. I mean, to go from chemical engineering to mathematics to physics and spending most of the time buried in a science fiction book, I mean, this is talent.[5]/nDuring this time, Everett met Nancy Gore, who typed up his paper \"Wave Mechanics Without Probability\". He married her the next year.[9][10] The paper was later retitled \"The Theory of the Universal Wave Function\"./nWheeler traveled to Copenhagen in May 1956 with the goal of getting a favorable reception for at least part of Everett's work, but in vain.[11][12] In June 1956 Everett started defense work in the Pentagon's Weapons Systems Evaluation Group  (WSEG). Completing his PhD within a year of starting at WSEG was a job requirement, and in April 1957 he returned briefly to Princeton to defend his thesis. The oral examination took place on April 23. The principal examiners\u2014Wheeler, Bargmann, H. W. Wyld, and Dicke\u2014concluded: \"The candidate passed a very good examination. He dealt with a very difficult subject and defended his conclusions firmly, clearly, and logically. He shows marked mathematical ability, keenness in logic analyses, and a high ability to express himself well.\"[10] With this Everett completed his PhD in physics from Princeton, his doctoral dissertation titled \"On the foundations of quantum mechanics\".[13]/nA short article, which was a compromise between Everett and Wheeler about how to present the many-worlds concept and almost identical to the final version of his thesis, was published in Reviews of Modern Physics, accompanied by a favorable review by Wheeler.[14] Everett was not happy with the article's final form.[5]:\u200a160/nOn October 23\u201326, 1956, Everett attended a weapons orientation course managed by Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico, to learn about nuclear weapons, and became a fan of computer modeling while there. In 1957, he became director of the WSEG's Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. Much, but not all, of Everett's research at WSEG remains classified. He worked on various studies of the Minuteman missile project, which was then starting, as well as the influential study The Distribution and Effects of Fallout in Large Nuclear Weapon Campaigns.[15][16]/nDuring March and April 1959, Everett visited Copenhagen at Wheeler's request in order to meet with Niels Bohr, the \"father of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\". The visit was a complete disaster; Bohr \"rejected Everett\u2019s approach as a whole, defending the Copenhagen approach to measurement\". The conceptual gulf between their positions was too wide to allow any meeting of minds; L\u00e9on Rosenfeld, one of Bohr's devotees, called Everett \"undescribably stupid\" and said he \"could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics\". Everett later described this experience as \"hell...doomed from the beginning\".[17][a]/nWhile in Copenhagen, Everett started work on a new idea to use generalized Lagrange multipliers for mathematical optimization. His theorem, published in 1963, relates the Lagrangian bidual to the primal problem.[1]/nIn 1962 Everett accepted an invitation to present the relative-state formulation (as it was still called) at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics at Xavier University. In his exposition Everett presented his derivation of probability and also stated explicitly that observers in all branches of the wavefunction were equally \"real.\" He also agreed with an observation by Boris Podolsky that \"It looks like we would have a non-denumerable infinity of worlds\".[17]/nIn August 1964, Everett and several WSEG colleagues started Lambda Corp. to apply military modeling solutions to various civilian problems. During the early 1970s, defense budgets were curtailed and most money went to operational duties in the Vietnam War, resulting in Lambda eventually being absorbed by the General Research Corp./nIn 1973, Everett and Donald Reisler (a Lambda colleague and fellow physicist) left the firm to establish DBS Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. Although the firm conducted defense research (including work on United States Navy ship maintenance optimization and weapons applications), it primarily specialized in \"analyzing the socioeconomic effects of government affirmative action programs\" as a contractor under the auspices of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.[18] For a while, the company was partially supported by American Management Systems, a business consulting firm that drew upon algorithms Everett developed. He concurrently held a non-administrative vice presidency at AMS and was frequently consulted by the firm's founders./nEverett cultivated an early aptitude for computer programming at IDA and favored the TRS-80 at DBS, where he primarily worked for the rest of his life./nIn 1970 Bryce DeWitt wrote an article for Physics Today on Everett's relative-state theory, which he dubbed many-worlds, which prompted a number of letters from physicists.[b] These letters, and DeWitt's responses to the technical objections they raised, were also published. Meanwhile DeWitt, who had corresponded with Everett on the many-worlds / relative state interpretation when it was published in 1957, started editing an anthology on the many-worlds interpretation. In addition to the original articles by Everett and Wheeler, the anthology was dominated by Everett's 1956 paper \"The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction\", which had never been published before. The book was published late in 1973 and sold out completely. In 1976 an article on Everett's work appeared in the science fiction magazine Analog.[17]/nIn 1977, Everett was invited to give a talk at a conference Wheeler had organized at Wheeler's new location at the University of Texas at Austin. As with the Copenhagen visit, Everett vacationed from his defense work and traveled with his family. Everett met DeWitt there for the first and only time. His talk was quite well received and influenced a number of physicists in the audience,[17] including Wheeler's graduate student David Deutsch, who later promoted the many-worlds interpretation to a wider audience.[17] Everett, who \"never wavered in his belief in his many-worlds theory\",[19] enjoyed the presentation; it was the first time in years he had talked about his quantum work in public. But he did little to promote his theory, saying he \"had washed my hands of the whole affair in 1956\".[17]:\u200a24\u200a Wheeler started the process of returning Everett to a physics career by establishing a new research institute in California, but nothing came of that proposal. In 1980, Wheeler said he thought the theory \"creates too great a load of metaphysical baggage to carry along\".[20][17][21]/nAt age 51, Everett died suddenly of a heart attack at home[9] in his bed on the night of July 18\u201319, 1982. His obesity, frequent chain-smoking and alcohol drinking[9] almost certainly contributed to this, although he seemed healthy at the time. A committed atheist,[5] he had asked that his remains be disposed of in the trash. His wife first kept his ashes in an urn, but after a few years she complied with his wishes.[5] Of Everett's death, his son, Mark Oliver Everett, later said:/nI think about how angry I was that my dad didn't take better care of himself.  How he never went to a doctor, let himself become grossly overweight, smoked three packs a day, drank like a fish and never exercised.  But then I think about how his colleague mentioned that, days before dying, my dad had said he lived a good life and that he was satisfied.  I realize that there is a certain value in my father's way of life.  He ate, smoked and drank as he pleased, and one day he just suddenly and quickly died.  Given some of the other choices I'd witnessed, it turns out that enjoying yourself and then dying quickly is not such a hard way to go.[9]:\u200a235/nOf the companies Everett initiated, only Monowave Corporation still existed as of 2023[update], in Seattle.[22] It is managed by co-founder Elaine Tsiang, who received a PhD in physics under Bryce DeWitt at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before working for DBS as a programmer./nEverett's daughter, Elizabeth, died by suicide in 1996,[23] and his wife died of cancer in 1998. Everett's son, Mark Oliver Everett, is also known as \"E\" and is the main singer and songwriter for the band Eels. The Eels album Electro-Shock Blues, written during the late 1990s, was inspired by E's emotional response to these deaths./nMark Everett explored his father's work in the hour-long BBC television documentary Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives.[24][25][26][27] The program was edited and shown on the Public Broadcasting Service's Nova series in the USA in 2008.[28][29][30] In the program, Mark says he was unaware of his father's status as a brilliant and influential physicist until his death.", "56576702": "Claude Dellacherie (born 1943, Lauwin-Planque) is a French mathematician, specializing in probability theory./nDellacherie received in 1970 from the University of Strasbourg his doctorate under Paul-Andr\u00e9 Meyer with thesis Contribution \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des processus stochastiques.[1]/nIn 1971/72 and 1978/79 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study.[2] In 1978 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Helsinki.

He was the eponym of Luzitania, a loose group of young Moscow mathematicians of the first half of the 1920s. They adopted his set-theoretic orientation, and went on to apply it in other areas of mathematics./nHe started studying mathematics in 1901 at Moscow State University, where his advisor was Dmitri Egorov. He graduated in 1905./nLuzin underwent great personal turmoil in the years 1905 and 1906, when his materialistic worldview had collapsed and he found himself close to suicide. In 1906 he wrote to Pavel Florensky, a former fellow mathematics student who was now studying theology: You found me a mere child at the University, knowing nothing. I don't know how it happened, but I cannot be satisfied any more with analytic functions and Taylor series ... it happened about a year ago. ... To see the misery of people, to see the torment of life, to wend my way home from a mathematical meeting ... where, shivering in the cold, some women stand waiting in vain for dinner purchased with horror - this is an unbearable sight. It is unbearable, having seen this, to calmly study (in fact to enjoy) science. After that I could not study only mathematics, and I wanted to transfer to the medical school. The correspondence between the two men continued for many years and Luzin was greatly influenced by Florensky's religious treatise The Pillar and Foundation of Truth (1908).[1]/nFrom 1910 to 1914 Luzin studied at G\u00f6ttingen, where he was influenced by Edmund Landau. He then returned to Moscow and received his Ph.D. degree in 1915. During the Russian Civil War (1918\u20131920) Luzin left Moscow for the Polytechnical Institute Ivanovo-Voznesensk (now called Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology). He returned to Moscow in 1920./nIn the 1920s Luzin organized a famous research seminar at Moscow State University. His doctoral students included some of the most famous Soviet mathematicians: Pavel Alexandrov, Nina Bari, Aleksandr Khinchin, Andrey Kolmogorov, Aleksandr Kronrod, Mikhail Lavrentyev, Alexey Lyapunov, Lazar Lyusternik, Pyotr Novikov, Lev Schnirelmann and Pavel Urysohn./nOn 5 January 1927 Luzin was elected as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union and became a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union first at the Department of Philosophy and then at the Department of Pure Mathematics (12 January 1929). In 1929 he was elected as a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Krak\u00f3w./nLuzin's first significant result was a construction of an almost everywhere divergent trigonometric series with monotonic convergence to zero coefficients (1912). This example disproved the Pierre Fatou conjecture and was unexpected to most mathematicians at that time./nAt approximately the same time, he proved what is now called Lusin's theorem in real analysis./nHis Ph.D. thesis titled Integral and trigonometric series (1915) had a large impact on the subsequent development of the metric theory of functions. A set of problems formulated in this thesis for a long time attracted attention from mathematicians. For example, the first problem in the list, on the convergence of the Fourier series for a square-integrable function, came to be called Luzin's conjecture and was solved by Lennart Carleson[2] in 1966 (Carleson's theorem)./nIn the theory of boundary properties of analytic functions he proved an important result on the invariance of sets of boundary points under conformal mappings (1919)./nLuzin was one of the founders of descriptive set theory.[3] Together with his student Mikhail Suslin, he developed the theory of analytic sets./nHe also made contributions to complex analysis, the theory of differential equations, and numerical methods.[4]/nIn a letter to M. Ya. Vygodsky dating from 1932, Luzin expresses sympathy with Vygodsky's infinitesimal approach to developing calculus. He mocks accusations of bourgeois decadence against Vygodsky's textbook, and relates his own youthful experience with what he felt were unnecessary formal complications of the traditional development of analysis. Typical is his youthful reaction to his teachers' insistence that the derivative is a limit: \"They won't fool me: it's simply the ratio of infinitesimals, nothing else.\" A recent study notes that Luzin's letter contained remarkable anticipations of modern calculus with infinitesimals.[5]/nOn 21 November 1930, the declaration of the \"initiative group\" of the Moscow Mathematical Society which consisted of Luzin's former students Lazar Lyusternik and Lev Schnirelmann along with Alexander Gelfond and Lev Pontryagin claimed that \u201cthere appeared active counter-revolutionaries among mathematicians\u201d.[6] Some of these mathematicians were pointed out, including the advisor of Luzin, Dmitri Egorov. In September 1930, Egorov was arrested on the basis of his religious beliefs. He then left the position of director of the Moscow Mathematical Society and was replaced by Ernst Kolman. As a result, Luzin left the Moscow Mathematical Society and Moscow State University. Egorov died on 10 September 1931, after a hunger strike initiated in prison. In 1931, Kolman brought the first complaint against Luzin./nIn 1936 the Great Purge began. Millions of people were arrested or executed, including leading members of the intelligentsia. In July\u2013August of that year, Luzin was criticized in Pravda in a series of anonymous articles whose authorship later was attributed to Kolman.[7] It was alleged that Luzin published \u201cwould-be scientific papers\u201d, \u201cfelt no shame in declaring the discoveries of his students to be his own achievements\u201d, and stood close to the ideology of the \u201cblack hundreds\u201d, orthodoxy, and monarchy \u201cfascist-type modernized but slightly.\u201d[8] One of the complaints was that he published his major results in foreign journals./nThe article triggered a special hearing on Luzin's case by the Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, where the allegations were reviewed and formalized. At the hearing, Alexandrov, Lyusternik, Khinchin, Kolmogorov and some other students of Luzin accused him of plagiarism from Pyotr Novikov and Mikhail Suslin and various forms of misconduct, which included denying promotions to Kolmogorov and Khinchin. According to some researchers, Alexandrov and Kolmogorov had been involved in a homosexual relationship in the 1930s, a fact the police used to pressure them into testifying against their former teacher.[9] Sergei Sobolev, Gleb Krzhizhanovsky and Otto Schmidt incriminated Luzin with charges of disloyalty to Soviet power. The methods of political insinuations and slander had been used against the old Muscovite professorship already several years before the article in Pravda./nThe hearings were completed in five sessions between July 7, 1936 and July 15, 1936, and people testifying, as well as the nature of accusations, changed from one session to another. In the initial session, the accusations were separated into accusations of scientific misconduct, which included plagiarism; accusations of professional misconduct, which mostly involved accusations of nepotism in promotions and reviews; and political accusations, which were the most serious. The initial review on July 7, which most prominently featured Alexandrov and Kolmogorov, concluded in a warning to Luzin regarding plagiarism while stressing the overall importance of his work, cleared him politically, yet recommended to relieve him of administrative duties./nHowever, this outcome did not seem to satisfy the instigators of the case, so that from the second hearing on, the nature of accusations shifted: now the primary focus was the fact that Luzin published his papers extensively in France rather than in Soviet journals, and his pre-Soviet sympathies were brought to the forefront./nThe special hearing of the Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union endorsed all accusations of Luzin as an \"enemy under the mask of a Soviet citizen.\"[8] Although the Commission convicted Luzin, he was neither expelled from the Academy nor arrested, but his department in the Steklov Institute was closed and he lost all his official positions. There has been some speculation about why his punishment was so much milder than that of most other people condemned at that time, but the reason for this does not seem to be known for certain. Historian of mathematics Adolph P. Yushkevich speculated that at the time, Stalin was more concerned with the forthcoming Moscow trials of Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and others, whereas the eventual fate of Luzin was of a little interest to him.[10]/nThe 1936 decision of the Academy of Sciences was not canceled after Stalin's death.[8][11] The decision was finally reversed on January 17, 2012.[12][13]/nIn 1976, Martian crater Luzin was named in his honor.[14]/n\u041b\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043d, \u041d. \u041d.

He also taught at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, from 1892 to 1910.[2]/nSpeaking of his days as a student at UCD in the mid 1880s, McWeeney remembers listening to the Professor of Mathematics there, John Casey, who had a mixed class of students.\n\"Although the book-work which he communicated would not have been adequate for the training of a higher mathematician, yet his explanations, so far as they went, were marked by extreme lucidity.\"[3]/nIt is an interesting fact that on McWeeney\u2019s going first to the Catholic University he had been sent by M'Grath to attend some lectures by Robert Graham, a well-known and successful Tutor of Trinity College, who had joined Fr~Delany's staff. He was author of well-known handbooks of Algebra and of Factors, and was known to be a marvelous expert in preparing for examinations, being familiar with the sort of tricky questions that were often set.

He had a key role in publishing two books Tintinnalogia (1668 with Richard Duckworth) and Campanalogia (1677 \u2013 written solely by him) which are the first two publications on the subject. He is also regarded as being a pioneer in the branch of mathematics known as Group theory./nFabian Stedman was born in Yarkhill, Herefordshire, the third son to Reverend Francis Stedman.[1] His father Francis Stedman was born in Aston Munslow, Shropshire in 1598, who took Holy Orders at Yarkhill in 1625. Francis had seven children by two wives. The eldest was Francis Junior who followed his father and became Rector of the parish of Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire in 1660. Fabian Stedman was born in 1640 and baptised at Yarkhill Church on 7 December of that year. At the age of 15 he went to London to learn the trade of master printing, apprenticed to Daniel Pakeman. However it was while in London that he became the well-known bellringer. It was said that he was appointed parish clerk to St Bene't's Church in Cambridge in 1670, and to have instructed the ringers,[2] but no clear evidence for these activities have been found.[3]/nWhile in London, Fabian became a member of the Scholars of Cheapside, a society of ringing that practised at St Mary-le-Bow; the famous great bell of Bow from the nursery rhyme. He acted as their treasurer in 1662. It seems the society disbanded and he then applied to be a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths. The College Youths accepted him in 1664 at the age of 23. He advanced through the society, and in 1667 became steward, and in 1682 he became the Master./nOf his later life, little is known other than it seems it did not involve ringing. He changed jobs and became auditor to Customs and Excise for the Crown. He wrote his will on 17 October 1713 and died later that year. He was buried at the parish church of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London on 16 November. The exact date of his death is not known./nFabian Stedman was the publisher of the first book on change ringing called Tintinnalogia, written by Richard Duckworth, most likely rector of St Martin's, Carfax, Oxford, and later Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire./nThe book was published in 1667 and is regarded as the biggest boost to the spread of change ringing in the 17th century. [4] It seemed to have been very popular as a second print run followed just a year later. The book dealt first with \"single changes\", where only one pair of bells changed at each new row, and then with \"cross changes\", where more than one pair of bells changed at a time. The first cross changes described are \"Doubles and Singles on four bells\", meaning one pair and then two pairs of bells changed alternately in each row throughout the method. This is what is known now as Plain Bob Minimus. [5]/nHe then described nine different cross peals on five bells, including Grandsire which is still widely rung today. There was not much written about changes on six bells, but there is a variation on \"Trebles and Doubles\" (where alternately two pairs, then three pairs of bells change), which is the modern Plain Bob Minor. The name Grandsire Bob was used for a particular 720 changes of Plain Bob Minor. This was devised around 1650, probably by Robert Roan, who became master of the College Youths in 1652. There is evidence in the book that changes on seven bells were being rung at that time. [6]/nAfter the publication of Tintinnalogia change ringing developed and spread more rapidly. Within a few years Stedman saw the need for an up to date book, and Campanalogia was written solely by him in 1677. Single change \"peals\" he called \"plain changes\". In describing cross-peals he introduced a shorthand notation, which meant the changes were not written out in full, but the rows occurring at the lead-ends (when the treble leads) were given instead.  [7]/nThe major advance was in the publication of many new methods. Stedman devised 53 of his own methods on five, six, seven and eight bells. Among the five-bell methods was \"Stedman's Principle\", which is widely rung today.  [8] The publishing of ringing methods stimulated their use and development further, and in 1684 the College Youths rang three 720s, a total of 2,160 changes without standing their bells, at St Mary Overy. [9]/nOn the first page of Tintinnalogia are the words \"by a lover of that art\" F. Stedman. Whilst he was a very important player in the development of early change ringing, Stedman is best remembered today for his ringing \"principle\" (so-called because all the bells follow the same principle of changing) that is as commonly rung as much today as it was in the 17th century. Stedman Doubles to Cinques (5 to 11 bells) is rung in many parish churches in the islands of Britain and Ireland, and other countries which practise the English style of method ringing./nAccording to the best available knowledge in 2017, 6,929 peals of Grandsire Caters (on 10 bells) were rung in the 300 years after 11 January 1711. Grandsire Caters was the leading 10-bell method in each decade from 1711 to 1890, but Stedman Caters has proved more popular recently and on 9 July 2010 its cumulative peal total from 1711 pulled ahead of the running Grandsire total. [10]/nFull-circle Bells in English churches, though very carefully tuned in the diatonic (major) scale, are not used for melodies or tunes: they are rung in \"changes\". To take a very simple example, if a church has five bells in the key of C they will be numbered 1-2-3-4-5, 1, called the treble and having the highest note, (in this case G) and 5, the tenor, having the lowest \u2013 the keynote, C. If rung in order downwards they are said to be ringing \"rounds.\" If the order changes according to a predetermined pattern, they are ringing the \"changes\" \u2013 hence this type of church bell ringing is usually known as change-ringing./nBecause a bell's swing takes a determinate time which cannot be much altered by the ringer, changes can be produced only by a bell exchanging places with one next to it in the order. For instance, starting from rounds (12345) no. 3 can step down towards the front and move into 2nd place by exchanging with 2 to give 13245 or up to fourth place by exchanging with 4 to give 12435./nUntil Stedman's time changes were produced by exchanging only one pair of bells at a time in this manner. The aim (remembering that in the early days there were never more than five bells in one tower) was to start from rounds, produce every possible change (an \"extent\") once and once only, finishing again with rounds. This is quite possible changing only one pair at a time or, \"plain changes\", but is a slow process and can be boring for those ringers whose bells do not change position for long periods./nStedman's achievement was to develop methods \u2013 then known as \"cross-changes\" \u2013 which could relatively quickly produce an \"extent\" by changing more than one pair of bells at a time. For instance, starting with rounds on five bells (12345) one might move to 21354 then to 23145 and so on. The aim of producing an extent without repeating a change apart from rounds at the start and finish could now be realised more artistically and with more interest for the ringers. \nOne of the very earliest methods, known as \"Doubles and Singles\" in Tintinnalogia, accompanies this article. The diagram shows the course of the lightest bell (1) and one other bell (in this case 2). All bells other than the 1 follow the same course as the 2 but start in different places. The \"plain Course\" of Grandsire Doubles, still commonly rung today, is also shown./nAs more bells were added to towers, Stedman's methods were adapted to higher numbers. Since the number of possible changes varies with the factorial ( n! ) of the number of bells, it became impractical to ring extents on numbers above 7 (the extent on 10 bells would take around three months). Any performance of 5,000 (approximately 7!) changes or more became recognised as a peal, but still with the traditional restrictions that no change may be repeated and that a bell may exchange only with one adjacent in the row. Nowadays many hundreds of methods are practised; all, in some degree, owe a debt to Stedman's pioneering work which has value as well in mathematics (group theory) as well as bell-ringing.", "576245": "Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432), sometimes romanized Paul Alexandroff (7 May 1896 \u2013 16 November 1982), was a Soviet mathematician. He wrote roughly three hundred papers, making important contributions to set theory and topology. In topology, the Alexandroff compactification and the Alexandrov topology are named after him./nAlexandrov attended Moscow State University where he was a student of Dmitri Egorov and Nikolai Luzin. Together with Pavel Urysohn, he visited the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1923 and 1924. After getting his Ph.D. in 1927, he continued to work at Moscow State University and also joined the Steklov Institute of Mathematics./nHe was made a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1953./nLuzin challenged Alexandrov to determine if the continuum hypothesis is true. This still unsolved problem was too much for Alexandrov and he had a creative crisis at the end of 1917. The failure was a heavy blow for Alexandrov: \"It became clear to me that the work on the continuum problem ended in a serious disaster. I also felt that I could no longer move on to mathematics and, so to speak, to the next tasks, and that some decisive turning point must come in my life.\"/nAlexander went to Chernihiv, where he participated in the organization of the drama theater. \"I met L.

Together with P. S. Urysohn, Alexandrov showed the full meaning of this concept; in particular, he proved the first general metrization theorem and the famous compactification theorem of any locally compact Hausdorff space by adding a single point.[11]/nFrom 1923 P. S. Alexandrov began to study combinatorial topology, and he managed to combine this branch of topology with general topology and significantly advance the resulting theory, which became the basis for modern algebraic topology. It was he who introduced one of the basic concepts of algebraic topology \u2014 the concept of an exact sequence.[12] Alexandrov also introduced the notion of a nerve of a covering, which led him (independently of E. Cech) to the discovery of Alexandrov-Cech Cohomology.[13]/nIn 1924, Alexandrov proved that in every open cover of a separable metric space, a locally finite open cover can be inscribed (this very concept, one of the key concepts in general topology, was first introduced by Alexandrov [12]). in fact, this proved the paracompact nature of separable metric spaces (although the term \"paracompact space\" was introduced by Jean Dieudonne in 1944, and in 1948 Arthur Harold Stone showed that the requirement of separability can be abandoned)./nHe significantly advanced the theory of dimension (in particular, he became the founder of the homological theory of dimension \u2014 its basic concepts were defined by Alexandrov in 1932 [14] ). He developed methods of combinatorial research of general topological spaces, proved a number of basic laws of topological duality. In 1927, he generalized Alexander's theorem to the case of an arbitrary closed set.[10]/nAlexandrov and P. S. Urysohn were the founders of the Moscow topological school, which received international recognition.[12] a number of concepts and theorems of topology bear Alexandrov's name: the Alexandrov compactification, the Alexandrov-Hausdorff theorem on the cardinality of a-sets, the Alexandrov topology, and the Alexandrov \u2014 Cech homology and cohomology./nHis books played an important role in the development of science and mathematics education in Russia: Introduction to the General Theory of Sets and Functions, Combinatorial Topology, Lectures on Analytical Geometry, Dimension Theory (together with B. A. Pasynkov) and Introduction to Homological Dimension Theory./nThe textbook Topologie I, written together with Heinz Hopf in German (Alexandroff P., Hopf H. (1935) Topologie Band 1 \u2014 Berlin) became the classic course of topology of its time./nIn 1936, Alexandrov was an active participant in the political offensive against his former mentor Luzin that is known as the Luzin affair./nDespite the fact that P. S. Alexandrov was a student of N. N. Luzin and one of the members of Lusitania, during the persecution of Luzin (the Luzin Affair), Alexandrov was one of the most active persecutors of the scientist. Relations between Luzin and Alexandrov remained very strained until the end of Luzin's life, and Alexandrov became an academician only after Luzin's death./nAmong the students of P. S. Alexandrov, the most famous are Lev Pontryagin, Andrey Tychonoff and Aleksandr Kurosh.[15] The older generation of his students includes L. A. Tumarkin, V. V. Nemytsky, A. N. Cherkasov, N. B.

He was a friend of William Rowan Hamilton, and is credited both with inspiring Hamilton to discover the quaternions in October 1843 and then discovering their generalization the octonions himself (he called them octaves) later that same year.[1] He was the brother of both the mathematician and bishop Charles Graves[2] and the writer and clergyman Robert Perceval Graves./nBorn in Dublin 4 December 1806, he was son of John Crosbie Graves, barrister, grandnephew of Richard Graves, D.D., and cousin of Robert James Graves, M.D. He was sent to school in England, in the parish of Westbury-on-Trym, then a village outside Bristol, under the Rev. Samuel Feild (Field in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography), later vicar of Hatherleigh.[3][4] Feild has been described as a \"prominent second generation evangelical Anglican\";[5] he was one of two curates in the parish, under Richard Carrow, the parish priest, as perpetual curate.[6]/nGraves was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Dublin, where he distinguished himself in both science and classics, and was a class-fellow and friend of William Rowan Hamilton, graduating B.A. in 1827. He then moved to Oxford, where he became an incorporated member of Oriel College, 11 November 1830. Graves proceeded M.A. at Oxford in 1831, and at Dublin in 1832.[7][8]/nHaving in 1830 entered the King's Inns, Dublin, Graves was called to the English bar in 1831, as a member of the Inner Temple.[8] For a short time he went the Western circuit. In 1839 he was appointed professor of jurisprudence in London University College in a delayed succession to John Austin. Not long after, he was elected an examiner in laws in the University of London.[7]/nGraves was one of the committee of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In 1839 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he subsequently sat on its council. He was also a member of the Philological Society and of the Royal Society of Literature.  In 1846 Graves was appointed an assistant poor-law commissioner, and in the next year, under the new Poor Law Act, one of the poor-law inspectors of England and Wales.[7]/nin 1846 Graves married Amelia Tooke, a daughter of William Tooke,[9] and died without issue on 29 March 1870 at Cheltenham.[7]/nIn his twentieth year (1826) Graves engaged in researches on the exponential function and the complex logarithm; they were printed in the Philosophical Transactions for 1829 under the title An Attempt to Rectify the Inaccuracy of some Logarithmic Formul\u00e6. Alexandre-Joseph-Hidulphe Vincent claimed to have arrived in 1825 at similar results, which, however, were not published by him till 1832. The conclusions announced by Graves were not at first accepted by George Peacock, who referred to them in his Report on Algebra, nor by Sir John Herschel. Graves communicated to the British Association in 1834 (Report for that year) on his discovery.[7][10]/nIn the same report is a supporting paper by Hamilton, On Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples, as tending to illustrate generally the Doctrine of Imaginary Quantities, and as confirming the Results of Mr. Graves respecting the existence of Two independent Integers in the complete expression of an Imaginary Logarithm. It was an anticipation, as far as publication was concerned, of an extended memoir, which had been read by Hamilton before the Royal Irish Academy on 24 November 1833, On Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples, and subsequently published in the seventeenth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy. To this memoir were prefixed A Preliminary and Elementary Essay on Algebra as the Science of Pure Time, and some General Introductory Remarks. In the concluding paragraphs of each of these three papers Hamilton acknowledges that it was \"in reflecting on the important symbolical results of Mr. Graves respecting imaginary logarithms, and in attempting to explain to himself the theoretical meaning of those remarkable symbolisms\", that he was conducted to \"the theory of conjugate functions, which, leading on to a theory of triplets and sets of moments, steps, and numbers\" were foundational for his own work, culminating in the discovery of quaternions.[7]/nFor many years Graves and Hamilton maintained a correspondence on the interpretation of imaginaries. In 1843 Hamilton discovered the quaternions, and it was to Graves that he made on 17 October his first written communication of the discovery. In his preface to the Lectures on Quaternions and in a prefatory letter to a communication to the Philosophical Magazine for December 1844 are acknowledgments of his indebtedness to Graves for stimulus and suggestion. Immediately after the discovery of quaternions, before the end of 1843, Graves successfully extended to eight squares Euler's four-square identity, and went on to conceive a theory of \"octaves\" (now called octonions) analogous to Hamilton's theory of quaternions, introducing four imaginaries additional to Hamilton's i, j and k, and conforming to \"the law of the modulus\".[7] Octonions are a contemporary if abstruse area of contemporary research of the Standard Model of particle physics.[11]/nGraves devised also a pure-triplet system founded on the roots of positive unity, simultaneously with his brother Charles Graves, the bishop of Limerick. He afterwards stimulated Hamilton to the study of polyhedra, and was told of the discovery of the icosian calculus.[7]/nGraves contributed also to the Philosophical Magazine for April 1836 a paper On the lately proposed Logarithms of Unity in reply to Professor De Morgan, and in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine for the same year a \"postscript\" entitled Explanation of a Remarkable Paradox in the Calculus of Functions, noticed by Mr. Babbage.

His father Alexander Craig immigrated from Scotland, and worked as an engineer in the mining industry./nThomas Craig first studied civil engineering at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, where a teacher William J. Bruce was a mentor to him. Thomas took his C.E. degree in 1875. He taught high school in Newton, New Jersey while continuing to study mathematics. He entered into correspondence with Benjamin Peirce and Peter Guthrie Tait.[1]/nThomas Craig was one of the prime movers of Johns Hopkins University when it was launched by Daniel Coit Gilman in 1876. Craig and George Bruce Halsted were the first Hopkins Fellows in mathematics. James Joseph Sylvester had been invited to lead a graduate program in mathematics but would only be doing that. Craig was needed to teach differential calculus and integral calculus. The first year there were only fifteen students studying mathematics, but by 1883 there were 35./nIn 1878 Craig took his Ph.D. degree with a dissertation The Representation of One Surface Upon Another, and Some Points in the theory of the Curvature of Surfaces. He became an instructor at Johns Hopkins that year, but also took up work at the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Helena enjoyed the patronage of John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale, who married her second cousin, a daughter of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont./nEducated at Trinity College Dublin, he was elected a Scholar in classics in 1832, and in 1834 graduated BA as Senior Moderator in mathematics, getting his MA in 1838.[1] He played cricket for Trinity, and later in his life did much boating and fly-fishing. He was a founder member of the Dublin University Choral Society, with its first meeting held in his rooms in Trinity.[2][3][4] It was intended that he should join the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot under his uncle, Major-General James William Graves (1774\u20131845), and in preparation he had become an expert swordsman and rider./nCharles Graves was appointed a fellow of Trinity College in 1836, and in 1843 became Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics, a position he held until 1862, when he became a senior fellow.[5]  In 1841, he published the book Two Geometrical Memoirs on the General Properties of Cones of the Second Degree and on the Spherical Conics, a translation of Aper\u00e7u historique sur l'origine et le d\u00e9veloppement des m\u00e9thodes en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1837) by Michel Chasles, but including many new results of his own.

He was a colleague of Sir William Rowan Hamilton and on the latter's death Graves gave a presidential panegyric containing a valuable account both of Hamilton's scientific labours and of his literary attainments./nGraves was very interested in Irish antiquarian subjects. He discovered the key to the ancient Irish Ogham script which appeared as inscriptions on Cromlechs and other stone monuments. He also prompted the government to publish the old Irish Brehon Laws, Early Irish Law. His suggestion was adopted and he was appointed as secretary of the Brehon Law Commission set up to accomplish this.[11] Appointing Eugene O'Curry and John O'Donovan as translators, the Commission created facsimile copies of the original document using the process of anastatic lithography which had been show-cased by Samuel Cowell at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The commission produced twenty facsimile copies which they produced in-house under a license to use the patent which cost them \u00a310 a year for three years. These enabled copies of the original documents to be circulated to major libraries and some copies were cut up to help produce a glossary for those involved in the translation. As secretary of the Commission, Graves provided reports to parliament as to how the commission implemented this innovative technique.[12]/nHis official residence was \"The Palace\" at Limerick, but from the 1850s he took the lease of \"Parknasilla House\", County Kerry, as a summer residence. In 1892 he bought out the lease of the house and a further 114 acres (0.46\u00a0km2) of land that included a few islands.

He was created primarily as a device by which Doyle could kill Holmes and end the hero's stories. Professor Moriarty first appears in the short story \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\", first published in The Strand Magazine in December 1893.  He also plays a role in the final Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear, but without a direct appearance.  Holmes mentions Moriarty in five other stories: \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\", \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", and \"His Last Bow\"./nMoriarty is a criminal mastermind who uses his intelligence and resources to provide criminals with crime strategies and sometimes protection from the law, all in exchange for a fee or a cut of profit. Holmes likens Moriarty to a spider at the centre of a web and calls him the \"Napoleon of crime\", a phrase Doyle lifted from a Scotland Yard inspector referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. Despite appearing only twice in Doyle's original stories, later adaptations and pastiches have often given Moriarty greater prominence and treated him as Sherlock Holmes' archenemy./nProfessor Moriarty's first appearance occurred in the 1893 short story \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\" (set in 1891).[2] The story features consulting detective Sherlock Holmes revealing to his friend and biographer Doctor Watson that for years now he has suspected many seemingly isolated crimes to actually all be the machinations of a single, vast, and subtle criminal organisation. After investigation, he has uncovered Professor Moriarty as a mastermind who provides strategy and protection to criminals in exchange for obedience and a share in their profits. Moriarty realizes Holmes is aware of his operation and confronts him in person, threatening death if further interference is done./nHolmes describes Moriarty's physical appearance to Watson, saying the professor is extremely tall and thin, clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking. He has a forehead that \"domes out in a white curve\", deeply sunken eyes, and shoulders that are \"rounded from much study\". His face protrudes forward and is always slowly oscillating from side to side \"in a curiously reptilian fashion\".[3] Holmes mentions that during their meeting, Moriarty remarked in surprise, \"You have less frontal development than I should have expected,\" indicating the criminal believes in phrenology.[2]/nHolmes ignores the threat and delivers appropriate evidence to the police so Moriarty and those who operate his network will face justice in a few days. Knowing the mastermind and his trusted lieutenants intend to kill him before they hide or are arrested, Holmes flees to Switzerland, and Watson joins him. The mastermind follows, his pursuit ending when he confronts Holmes at the top of the Reichenbach Falls. Watson does not witness the confrontation but arrives later to find signs of hand-to-hand combat occurring at the cliff edge near the waterfall, indicating the battle ended with both men falling to their deaths. Watson also finds a goodbye note left behind by Holmes that Moriarty allowed him to write before their battle./nMoriarty plays a direct role in only one other Holmes story, The Valley of Fear (1914), set before \"The Final Problem\" but written afterwards. In The Valley of Fear, Holmes attempts to prevent Moriarty's men from committing a murder. A policeman who interviewed Moriarty tells Holmes that the professor has a painting by Jean-Baptiste Greuze hanging on his office wall. Learning this, Holmes mentions the great value of another painting by the same artist, pointing out such works could not have been purchased on a university professor's salary. The work referred to is La jeune fille \u00e0 l'agneau;[4] which some commentators[5] have described as a pun by Doyle on a famous Thomas Gainsborough painting, the Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire,[6] which was taken from the Thomas Agnew and Sons art gallery. The gallery believed Adam Worth (the criminal who helped inspire Doyle to create Moriarty) was responsible, but was unable to prove the claim.[5]/nHolmes mentions Moriarty reminiscently in five other stories: \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" (the immediate sequel to \"The Final Problem\"), \"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\", \"The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\", \"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\", and \"His Last Bow\" (the final adventure in Holmes's canon timeline, taking place years after he has officially retired)./nDoctor Watson, even when narrating, never meets Moriarty (only getting distant glimpses of him in \"The Final Problem\") and relies upon Holmes to relate accounts of the detective's feud with the criminal. Doyle is inconsistent on Watson's familiarity with Moriarty. In \"The Final Problem\", Watson tells Holmes he has never heard of Moriarty, while in \"The Valley of Fear\", set earlier on, Watson already knows of him as \"the famous scientific criminal.\"/nIn \"The Empty House\", Holmes says Moriarty commissioned a powerful air gun from a blind German mechanic surnamed von Herder, a weapon later used by the professor's employee/acolyte Colonel Moran. It closely resembles a cane, allows easy concealment, is capable of firing revolver bullets at long range, and makes very little noise when fired, making it ideal for criminal sniping. Moriarty also has a marked preference for organising lethal \"accidents\" to befall his targets. His attempts to kill Holmes include falling masonry and a speeding horse-drawn vehicle. He is also responsible for stage-managing the death of Birdy Edwards, making it appear the man was lost overboard while sailing to South Africa.[7]/nMoriarty is highly ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that \"if you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you\".[8] Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing any sleep over it. It is stated in \"The Final Problem\" that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but only orchestrates the events or provides the plans that will lead to a successful crime. What makes Moriarty so dangerous is his extremely cunning intellect:/nHe is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. [...] But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. [...] He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city.../nHolmes echoes and expounds this sentiment in The Valley of Fear, stating:/nThe greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every devilry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations\u2014that's the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. [...] Foulmouthed doctor and slandered professor\u2014such would be your respective roles! That's genius, Watson./nMoriarty respects Holmes's intelligence, stating: \"It has been an intellectual treat for me to see the manner in which you [Holmes] have grappled with this case.\" Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted, resulting in his being placed \"in positive danger of losing my liberty\". While personally pursuing Holmes at a train station, he furiously elbows aside passengers, heedless of whether this draws attention to himself./nDoyle's original motive in creating Moriarty was evidently his intention to kill Holmes off.[9] \"The Final Problem\" was intended to be exactly what its title says; Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous that any further task would be trivial in comparison (as Holmes says in the story itself). Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back. While Doyle conceded to revealing that Holmes did not die during \"The Final Problem\" (as Watson mistakenly concludes), he chose not to undo Moriarty's death in a similar fashion. For this reason, the later novel The Valley of Fear features Moriarty as an active villain but is specified to take place before the events of \"The Final Problem\".[10]/nAs established in Doyle's canon, Moriarty first gains recognition at the age of 21 for writing \"a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem\", which leads to his being awarded the Mathematical Chair at one of England's smaller universities. Moriarty later authors a much respected work titled The Dynamics of an Asteroid. After he becomes the subject of unspecified \"dark rumours\" in the university town, he is compelled to resign his teaching post and leave the area.[11] He moves to London, where he establishes himself as an \"army coach\", a private tutor to officers preparing for exams.[3] He becomes a consulting criminal mastermind for various London gangs and criminals (it is uncertain if he was already doing this before leaving his teaching post). When multiple plans of his are hampered or undone by Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty targets the consulting detective.[2]/nMultiple pastiches and other works outside of Doyle's stories purport to provide additional information about Moriarty's background. John F. Bowers, a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Leeds, wrote a tongue-in-cheek article in 1989 in which he assesses Moriarty's contributions to mathematics and gives a detailed description of Moriarty's background, including a statement that Moriarty was born in Ireland (an idea based on the fact that the surname is Irish in origin).[12][13] The 2005 pastiche novel Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography also reports that Moriarty was born in Ireland, and states that he was employed as a professor by Durham University.[14] According to the 2020 audio drama Sherlock Holmes: The Voice of Treason, written by George Mann and Cavan Scott, Moriarty was a professor at Stonyhurst College (where Arthur Conan Doyle was educated and knew two students with the surname Moriarty).[15]/nThe stories give contradictory indications about Moriarty's family. In his first appearance in \"The Final Problem\" (1893), the villain is referred to only as \"Professor Moriarty\". Watson mentions no forename but does refer to the name of another family member when he writes of \"the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother\". In \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" (1903), Holmes refers to Moriarty as \"Professor James Moriarty\". This is the only time Moriarty is given a first name, and oddly, it is the same as that of his purported brother.[3] In the 1914 novel The Valley of Fear (written after the preceding two stories, but set earlier), Holmes says of Professor Moriarty: \"He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England.\"[16] In Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts, an 1899 stage play, of which Doyle was a co-author, the villain is named Professor Robert Moriarty.[17]/nWriter Vincent Starrett suggested that Moriarty could have one brother (who is both a colonel and station master) or two brothers (one a colonel and the other a station master); he added that he considered the presence of two siblings more likely, and suggested that all three brothers were named James.[1] Writer Leslie S.\u00a0Klinger suggested that Professor Moriarty has an older brother named Colonel James Moriarty in addition to an unnamed younger brother. According to Klinger, writer Ian McQueen proposed that Moriarty does not actually have any brothers,[18] while Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw suggested, like Starrett, that there are three Moriarty brothers, all named James.[19] The premise that Professor James Moriarty has two brothers also named James was used in the radio series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the manga and anime series Moriarty the Patriot and the Kim Newman novel Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles./n\"Moriarty\" is an ancient Irish name[20] as is Moran, the surname of Moriarty's henchman, Sebastian Moran.[21][22] Doyle himself was of Irish Catholic descent, educated at Stonyhurst College, although he abandoned his family's religious tradition, neither marrying nor raising his children in the Catholic faith, nor cleaving to any politics that his ethnic background might presuppose. Doyle is known to have used his experiences at Stonyhurst as inspiration for details of the Holmes series; among his contemporaries at the school were two boys surnamed Moriarty.[23]/nln addition to the master criminal Adam Worth, there has been much speculation among astronomers and Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that Doyle based his fictional character Moriarty on the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb.[24] Newcomb was revered as a multitalented genius, with a special mastery of mathematics, and he had become internationally famous in the years before Doyle began writing his stories. More to the point, Newcomb had earned a reputation for spite and malice, apparently seeking to destroy the careers and reputations of rival scientists.[25]/nMoriarty may have been inspired in part by two real-world mathematicians. If the characterisations of Moriarty's academic papers are reversed, they describe real mathematical events. Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote a famous paper on the dynamics of an asteroid[26] in his early 20s, and was appointed to a chair partly on the strength of this result. Srinivasa Ramanujan wrote about generalisations of the binomial theorem,[27] and earned a reputation as a genius by writing articles that confounded the best extant mathematicians.[28] Gauss's story was well known in Doyle's time, and Ramanujan's story unfolded at Cambridge from early 1913 to mid 1914;[29] The Valley of Fear, which contains the comment about maths so abstruse that no one could criticise it, was published in September 1914. Irish mathematician Des MacHale has suggested George Boole may have been a model for Moriarty.[30][31]/nJane Stanford, in That Irishman, suggests that Doyle borrowed some of the traits and background of the Fenian John O'Connor Power for his portrayal of Moriarty.[32] In Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel, 2017, Stanford explores Doyle's relationship with the Irish literary and political community in London. She suggests that Moriarty, Ireland's Napoleon, represents the Fenian threat at the heart of the British Empire. O'Connor Power studied at St Jarlath's Diocesan College in Tuam, County Galway.[33] In his third and last year he was Professor of Humanities. As an ex-professor, the Fenian leader successfully made a bid for a Westminster seat in County Mayo.[34]/nIt is averred that surviving Jesuit priests at the preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, instantly recognised the physical description of Moriarty as that of the Rev. Thomas Kay, SJ, Prefect of Discipline, under whose authority Doyle fell as a wayward pupil.[35] According to this hypothesis, Doyle as a private joke has Inspector MacDonald describe Moriarty: \"He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and grey hair and his solemn-like way of talking.\"[36]/nThe model which Doyle himself cited (through Sherlock Holmes) in The Valley of Fear is the London arch-criminal of the 18th century, Jonathan Wild. He mentions this when seeking to compare Moriarty to a real-world character that Inspector Alec MacDonald might know, but it is in vain as MacDonald is not so well read as Holmes./nT. S. Eliot's character Macavity the Mystery Cat is based on Moriarty.[37] Author Timothy Zahn's fictional Star Wars warlord Nuso Esva is also based on the professor; in fact, if each consonant and vowel of the character's name is replaced with the consonants and vowels before them in the Latin alphabet, \"Nuso Esva\" becomes \"Moriarty.\"[38]/nA Sherlockian society was formed by noted Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw[39] called \"The Brothers Three of Moriarty\", in honour of Professor Moriarty and his two brothers.[40] The group held annual dinners in Moriarty, New Mexico.[40]", "3033888": "Mykhailo Pylypovych Kravchuk, also Krawtchouk (Ukrainian: \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0301\u0439\u043b\u043e \u041f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0301\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0443\u0301\u043a) (September 27, 1892 \u2013 March 9, 1942), was a Soviet Ukrainian mathematician and the author of around 180 articles on mathematics./nHe primarily wrote papers on differential equations and integral equations, studying both their theory and applications.

During the Second World War, he made a brilliant and fundamental advance in cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher, a major Nazi German cipher system which was used for top-secret communications within the Wehrmacht High Command. The high-level, strategic nature of the intelligence obtained from Tutte's crucial breakthrough, in the bulk decrypting of Lorenz-enciphered messages specifically, contributed greatly, and perhaps even decisively, to the defeat of Nazi Germany.[2][3] He also had a number of significant mathematical accomplishments, including foundation work in the fields of graph theory and matroid theory.[4][5]/nTutte's research in the field of graph theory proved to be of remarkable importance. At a time when graph theory was still a primitive subject, Tutte commenced the study of matroids and developed them into a theory by expanding from the work that Hassler Whitney had first developed around the mid-1930s.[6] Even though Tutte's contributions to graph theory have been influential to modern graph theory and many of his theorems have been used to keep making advances in the field, most of his terminology was not in agreement with their conventional usage and thus his terminology is not used by graph theorists today.[7] \"Tutte advanced graph theory from a subject with one text (D. K\u0151nig's) toward its present extremely active state.\"[7]/nTutte was born in Newmarket in Suffolk. He was the younger son of William John Tutte (1873\u20131944), an estate gardener, and Annie (n\u00e9e Newell; 1881\u20131956), a housekeeper. Both parents worked at Fitzroy House stables where Tutte was born.[5] The family spent some time in Buckinghamshire, County Durham and Yorkshire before returning to Newmarket, where Tutte attended Cheveley Church of England primary school[8] in the nearby village of Cheveley.[4] In 1927, when he was ten, Tutte won a scholarship to the Cambridge and County High School for Boys. He took up his place there in 1928./nIn 1935 he won a scholarship to study natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he specialized in chemistry and graduated with first-class honours in 1938.[4] He continued with physical chemistry as a graduate student, but transferred to mathematics at the end of 1940.[4] As a student, he (along with three of his friends) became one of the first to solve the problem of squaring the square, and the first to solve the problem without a squared subrectangle. Together the four created the pseudonym Blanche Descartes, under which Tutte published occasionally for years.[9]/nSoon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Tutte's tutor, Patrick Duff, suggested him for war work at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP). He was interviewed and sent on a training course in London before going to Bletchley Park, where he joined the Research Section. At first, he worked on the Hagelin cipher that was being used by the Italian Navy. This was a rotor cipher machine that was available commercially, so the mechanics of enciphering was known, and decrypting messages only required working out how the machine was set up.[11]/nIn the summer of 1941, Tutte was transferred to work on a project called Fish. Intelligence information had revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"S\u00e4gefisch\" (sawfish). This led the British to use the code Fish for the German teleprinter cipher system.  The nickname Tunny (tunafish) was used for the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic that they enciphered.[12]/nTelegraphy used the 5-bit International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). Nothing was known about the mechanism of enciphering other than that messages were preceded by a 12-letter indicator, which implied a 12-wheel rotor cipher machine. The first step, therefore, had to be to diagnose the machine by establishing the logical structure and hence the functioning of the machine. Tutte played a pivotal role in achieving this, and it was not until shortly before the Allied victory in Europe in 1945, that Bletchley Park acquired a Tunny Lorenz cipher machine.[13] Tutte's breakthroughs led eventually to bulk decrypting of Tunny-enciphered messages between the German High Command (OKW) in Berlin and their army commands throughout occupied Europe and contributed\u2014perhaps decisively\u2014to the defeat of Germany.[2][3]/nOn 31 August 1941, two versions of the same message were sent using identical keys, which constituted a \"depth\". This allowed John Tiltman, Bletchley Park's veteran and remarkably gifted cryptanalyst, to deduce that it was a Vernam cipher which uses the Exclusive Or (XOR) function (symbolised by \"\u2295\"), and to extract the two messages and hence obtain the obscuring key. After a fruitless period during which Research Section cryptanalysts tried to work out how the Tunny machine worked, this and some other keys were handed to Tutte, who was asked to \"see what you can make of these\".[14]/nAt his training course, Tutte had been taught the Kasiski examination technique of writing out a key on squared paper, starting a new row after a defined number of characters that was suspected of being the frequency of repetition of the key.[15] If this number was correct, the columns of the matrix would show more repetitions of sequences of characters than chance alone. Tutte knew that the Tunny indicators used 25 letters (excluding J) for 11 of the positions, but only 23 letters for the other. He therefore tried Kasiski's technique on the first impulse of the key characters, using a repetition of 25 \u00d7 23 = 575. He did not observe a large number of column repetitions with this period, but he did observe the phenomenon on a diagonal. He therefore tried again with 574, which showed up repeats in the columns. Recognising that the prime factors of this number are 2, 7 and 41, he tried again with a period of 41 and \"got a rectangle of dots and crosses that was replete with repetitions\".[16]/nIt was clear, however, that the first impulse of the key was more complicated than that produced by a single wheel of 41 key impulses. Tutte called this component of the key \n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\chi _{1}}\n\n (chi1). He figured that there was another component, which was XOR-ed with this, that did not always change with each new character, and that this was the product of a wheel that he called \n\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\psi _{1}}\n\n (psi1). The same applied for each of the five impulses (\n\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n1\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n4\n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\chi _{1}\\chi _{2}\\chi _{3}\\chi _{4}\\chi _{5}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n1\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n2\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n4\n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\psi _{1}\\psi _{2}\\psi _{3}\\psi _{4}\\psi _{5}}\n\n). So for a single character, the whole key K consisted of two components:\n\n\n\n\nK\n=\n\u03c7\n\u2295\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K=\\chi \\oplus \\psi }/nAt Bletchley Park, mark impulses were signified by x and space impulses by \u2022.[nb 1] For example, the letter \"H\" would be coded as \u2022\u2022x\u2022x.[17] Tutte's derivation of the chi and psi components was made possible by the fact that dots were more likely than not to be followed by dots, and crosses more likely than not to be followed by crosses. This was a product of a weakness in the German key setting, which they later eliminated. Once Tutte had made this breakthrough, the rest of the Research Section joined in to study the other impulses, and it was established that the five chi wheels all advanced with each new character and that the five psi wheels all moved together under the control of two mu or \"motor\" wheels. Over the following two months, Tutte and other members of the Research Section worked out the complete logical structure of the machine, with its set of wheels bearing cams that could either be in a position (raised) that added x to the stream of key characters, or in the alternative position that added in \u2022.[18]/nDiagnosing the functioning of the Tunny machine in this way was a truly remarkable cryptanalytical achievement which, in the citation for Tutte's induction as an Officer of the Order of Canada, was described as \"one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II\".[5]/nTo decrypt a Tunny message required knowledge not only of the logical functioning of the machine, but also the start positions of each rotor for the particular message. The search was on for a process that would manipulate the ciphertext or key to produce a frequency distribution of characters that departed from the uniformity that the enciphering process aimed to achieve. While on secondment to the Research Section in July 1942, Alan Turing worked out that the XOR combination of the values of successive characters in a stream of ciphertext and key emphasised any departures from a uniform distribution. The resultant stream (symbolised by the Greek letter \"delta\" \u0394) was called the difference because XOR is the same as modulo 2 subtraction./nThe reason that this provided a way into Tunny was that although the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext could not be distinguished from a random stream, the same was not true for a version of the ciphertext from which the chi element of the key had been removed. This was the case because where the plaintext contained a repeated character and the psi wheels did not move on, the differenced psi character (\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\psi }\n\n) would be the null character ('/ ' at Bletchley Park). When XOR-ed with any character, this character has no effect. Repeated characters in the plaintext were more frequent both because of the characteristics of German (EE, TT, LL and SS are relatively common),[19] and because telegraphists frequently repeated the figures-shift and letters-shift characters[20] as their loss in an ordinary telegraph message could lead to gibberish.[21]/nTo quote the General Report on Tunny:/nTuringery introduced the principle that the key differenced at one, now called \u0394\u039a, could yield information unobtainable from ordinary key. This \u0394 principle was to be the fundamental basis of nearly all statistical methods of wheel-breaking and setting.[10]/nTutte exploited this amplification of non-uniformity in the differenced values [nb 2] and by November 1942 had produced a way of discovering wheel starting points of the Tunny machine which became known as the \"Statistical Method\".[22] The essence of this method was to find the initial settings of the chi component of the key by exhaustively trying all positions of its combination with the ciphertext, and looking for evidence of the non-uniformity that reflected the characteristics of the original plaintext.[23][24] Because any repeated characters in the plaintext would always generate \u2022, and similarly \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\u03c8\n\n1\n\n\n\u2295\n\u0394\n\n\u03c8\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta \\psi _{1}\\oplus \\Delta \\psi _{2}}\n\n would generate \u2022 whenever the psi wheels did not move on, and about half of the time when they did \u2013 some 70% overall./nAs well as applying differencing to the full 5-bit characters of the ITA2 code, Tutte applied it to the individual impulses (bits).[nb 3] The current chi wheel cam settings needed to have been established to allow the relevant sequence of characters of the chi wheels to be generated. It was totally impracticable to generate the 22 million characters from all five of the chi wheels, so it was initially limited to 41 \u00d7 31 = 1271 from the first two. After explaining his findings to Max Newman, Newman was given the job of developing an automated approach to comparing ciphertext and key to look for departures from randomness. The first machine was dubbed Heath Robinson, but the much faster Colossus computer, developed by Tommy Flowers and using algorithms written by Tutte and his colleagues, soon took over for breaking codes.[25][26][27]/nIn late 1945, Tutte resumed his studies at Cambridge, now as a graduate student in mathematics. He published some work begun earlier, one a now famous paper that characterises which graphs have a perfect matching, and another that constructs a non-Hamiltonian graph./nTutte completed a doctorate in mathematics from Cambridge in 1948 under the supervision of Shaun Wylie, who had also worked at Bletchley Park on Tunny. His thesis An Algebraic Theory of Graphs was considered ground breaking and was about the subject later known as matroid theory.[28]/nThe same year, invited by Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter, he accepted a position at the University of Toronto. In 1962, he moved to the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, where he stayed for the rest of his academic career. He officially retired in 1985, but remained active as an emeritus professor. Tutte was instrumental in helping to found the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo./nHis mathematical career concentrated on combinatorics, especially graph theory, which he is credited as having helped create in its modern form, and matroid theory, to which he made profound contributions; one colleague  described him as \"the leading mathematician in combinatorics for three decades\". He was editor in chief of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory until retiring from Waterloo in 1985.[28] He also served on the editorial boards of several other mathematical research journals./nTutte's work in graph theory includes the structure of cycle spaces and cut spaces, the size of maximum matchings and existence of k-factors in graphs, and Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian graphs.[28] He disproved Tait's conjecture, on the Hamiltonicity of polyhedral graphs, by using the construction known as Tutte's fragment. The eventual proof of the four colour theorem made use of his earlier work. The graph polynomial he called the \"dichromate\" has become famous and influential under the name of the Tutte polynomial and serves as the prototype of combinatorial invariants that are universal for all invariants that satisfy a specified reduction law./nThe first major advances in matroid theory were made by Tutte in his 1948 Cambridge PhD thesis which formed the basis of an important sequence of papers published over the next two decades. Tutte's work in graph theory and matroid theory has been profoundly influential on the development of both the content and direction of these two fields.[7] In matroid theory, he discovered the highly sophisticated homotopy theorem and founded the studies of chain groups and regular matroids, about which he proved deep results./nIn addition, Tutte developed an algorithm for determining whether a given binary matroid is a graphic matroid. The algorithm makes use of the fact that a planar graph is simply a graph whose circuit-matroid, the dual of its bond-matroid, is graphic.[29]/nTutte wrote a paper entitled How to Draw a Graph in which he proved that any face in a 3-connected graph is enclosed by a peripheral cycle. Using this fact, Tutte developed an alternative proof to show that every Kuratowski graph is non-planar by showing that K5 and K3,3 each have three distinct peripheral cycles with a common edge. In addition to using peripheral cycles to prove that the Kuratowski graphs are non-planar, Tutte proved that every simple 3-connected graph can be drawn with all its faces convex, and devised an algorithm which constructs the plane drawing by solving a linear system. The resulting drawing is known as the Tutte embedding.\nTutte's algorithm makes use of the barycentric mappings of the peripheral circuits of a simple 3-connected graph.[30]/nThe findings published in this paper have proved to be of much significance because the algorithms that Tutte developed have become popular planar graph drawing methods.\nOne of the reasons for which Tutte's embedding is popular is that the necessary computations that are carried out by his algorithms are simple and guarantee a one-to-one correspondence of a graph and its embedding onto the Euclidean plane, which is of importance when parameterising a three-dimensional mesh to the plane in geometric modelling. \"Tutte's theorem is the basis for solutions to other computer graphics problems, such as morphing.\"[31]/nTutte was mainly responsible for developing the theory of enumeration of planar graphs, which has close links with chromatic and dichromatic polynomials. This work involved some highly innovative techniques of his own invention, requiring considerable manipulative dexterity in handling power series (whose coefficients count appropriate kinds of graphs) and the functions arising as their sums, as well as geometrical dexterity in extracting these power series from the graph-theoretic situation.[32]/nTutte summarised his work in the Selected Papers of W.T. Tutte, 1979, and in Graph Theory as I have known it, 1998.[28]/nTutte's work in World War II and subsequently in combinatorics brought him various positions, honours and awards:/nTutte served as Librarian for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1959\u20131960, and asteroid 14989 Tutte (1997 UB7) was named after him.[37]/nBecause of Tutte's work at Bletchley Park, Canada's Communications Security Establishment named an internal organisation aimed at promoting research into cryptology, the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing (TIMC), in his honour in 2011.[38]/nIn September 2014, Tutte was celebrated in his hometown of Newmarket, England, with the unveiling of a sculpture, after a local newspaper started a campaign to honour his memory.[39]/nBletchley Park in Milton Keynes celebrated Tutte's work with an exhibition Bill Tutte: Mathematician + Codebreaker from May 2017 to 2019, preceded on 14 May 2017 by lectures about his life and work during the Bill Tutte Centenary Symposium.[40][41]/nIn addition to the career benefits of working at the new University of Waterloo, the more rural setting of Waterloo County appealed to Bill and his wife Dorothea.  They bought a house in the nearby village of West Montrose, Ontario where they enjoyed hiking, spending time in their garden on the Grand River and allowing others to enjoy the beautiful scenery of their property./nThey also had an extensive knowledge of all the birds in their garden. Dorothea, an avid potter, was also a keen hiker and Bill organised hiking trips. Even near the end of his life Bill still was an avid walker.[7][42] After his wife died in 1994, he moved back to Newmarket (Suffolk), but then returned to Waterloo in 2000, where he died two years later.[43] He is buried in West Montrose United Cemetery.[28]", "41929528": "Ravi P.

He continued working at UC Berkeley until 1972, the year he became professor emeritus./nFrom 1945 to 1946, Lehmer served on the Computations Committee at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, a group established as part of the Ballistics Research Laboratory to prepare the ENIAC for utilization following its completion at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering; the other Computations Committee members were Haskell Curry, Leland Cunningham, and Franz Alt. It was during this short tenure that the Lehmers ran some of the first test programs on the ENIAC\u2014according to their academic interests, these tests involved number theory, especially sieve methods, but also pseudorandom number generation. When they could arrange child care, the Lehmers spent weekends staying up all night running such problems, the first over the Thanksgiving weekend of 1945. (Such tests were run without cost, since the ENIAC would have been left powered on anyway in the interest of minimizing vacuum tube failures.) The problem run during the 3-day Independence Day weekend of July 4, 1946, with John Mauchly serving as computer operator, ran around the clock without interruption or failure. The following Tuesday, July 9, 1946, Lehmer delivered the talk \"Computing Machines for Pure Mathematics\" as part of the Moore School Lectures, in which he introduced computing as an experimental science, and demonstrated the wit and humor typical of his teaching lectures./nLehmer would remain active in computing developments for the remainder of his career.

On October 17, 1952, the State Supreme Court proclaimed the oath unconstitutional, and Lehmer returned to Berkeley shortly thereafter./nLehmer continued to be active for many years. When John Selfridge was at Northern Illinois University he twice invited Lehmer and Emma to spend a semester there. One year Selfridge arranged that Erd\u0151s and Lehmer taught a course together on Research Problems in the Theory of Numbers. Lehmer taught the first eight weeks and then Erd\u0151s taught the remainder. Erd\u0151s didn't often teach a course, and he said, \"You know it wasn't that difficult. The only problem was being there.\"/nLehmer had quite a wit. On the occasion of the first Asilomar number theory conference, which became an annual event (now called West Coast Number Theory), Lehmer, as the organizer, was inspecting the facilities of the Asilomar Conference Grounds\u2014basically a wooden building on the beach. Someone said they couldn't find a blackboard and Lehmer spotted some curtains in the middle of the wall. Moving the curtains aside revealed a very small blackboard, whereupon Lehmer said \"Well, I guess we won't be doing any analytic number theory!\"/nIn addition to his significant contributions to number theory algorithms for multiprecision integers, such as factoring, Euclid's algorithm, long division, and proof of primality, he also formulated Lehmer's conjecture and participated in the Cunningham project./nLehmer died in Berkeley on May 22, 1991.", "18729795": "John Robert Stallings Jr. (July 22, 1935 \u2013 November 24, 2008) was a mathematician known for his seminal contributions to geometric group theory and 3-manifold topology. Stallings was a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley[1] where he had been a faculty member since 1967.[1] He published over 50 papers, predominantly in the areas of geometric group theory and the topology of 3-manifolds. Stallings' most important contributions include a proof, in a 1960 paper, of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture in dimensions greater than six and a proof, in a 1971 paper, of the Stallings theorem about ends of groups./nJohn Stallings was born on July 22, 1935, in Morrilton, Arkansas.[1]/nStallings received his B.Sc. from University of Arkansas in 1956 (where he was one of the first two graduates in the university's Honors program)[2] and he received a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University in 1959 under the direction of Ralph Fox.[1]/nAfter completing his PhD, Stallings held a number of postdoctoral and faculty positions, including being an NSF postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford as well as an instructorship and a faculty appointment at Princeton. Stallings joined the University of California at Berkeley as a faculty member in 1967 where he remained until his retirement in 1994.[1] Even after his retirement, Stallings continued supervising UC Berkeley graduate students until 2005.[3] Stallings was an Alfred P. Sloan Research fellow from 1962 to 1965 and a Miller Institute fellow from 1972 to 1973.[1]\nOver the course of his career, Stallings had 22 doctoral students including Marc Culler, Stephen M. Gersten, and J. Hyam Rubinstein and 100 doctoral descendants.  He published over 50 papers, predominantly in the areas of geometric group theory and the topology of 3-manifolds./nStallings delivered an invited address as the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice in 1970[4] and a James K. Whittemore Lecture at Yale University in 1969.[5]/nStallings received the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Algebra from the American Mathematical Society in 1970.[6]/nThe conference \"Geometric and Topological Aspects of Group Theory\", held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley in May 2000, was dedicated to the 65th birthday of Stallings.[7]\nIn 2002 a special issue of the journal Geometriae Dedicata was dedicated to Stallings on the occasion of his 65th birthday.[8] Stallings died from prostate cancer on November 24, 2008.[3][9]/nMost of Stallings' mathematical contributions are in the areas of geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology (particularly the topology of 3-manifolds) and on the interplay between these two areas./nAn early significant result of Stallings is his 1960 proof[10] of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in dimensions greater than six. (Stallings' proof was obtained independently from and shortly after the different proof of Stephen Smale who established the same result in dimensions bigger than four[11])./nUsing \"engulfing\" methods similar to those in his proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture for n > 6, Stallings proved that ordinary Euclidean n-dimensional space has a unique piecewise linear, hence also smooth, structure, if n is not equal to 4. This took on added significance when, as a consequence of work of Michael Freedman and Simon Donaldson in 1982, it was shown that 4-space has exotic smooth structures, in fact uncountably many such./nIn a 1963 paper[12] Stallings constructed an example of a finitely presented group with infinitely generated 3-dimensional integral homology group and, moreover, not of the type \n\n\n\n\nF\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{3}}\n\n, that is, not admitting a classifying space with a finite 3-skeleton. This example came to be called the Stallings group and is a key example in the study of homological finiteness properties of groups. Robert Bieri later showed[13] that the Stallings group is exactly the kernel of the homomorphism from the direct product of three copies of the free group \n\n\n\n\nF\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{2}}\n\n to the additive group \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} }\n\n of integers that sends to \n\n\n\n1\n\u2208\n\nZ\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1\\in \\mathbb {Z} }\n\n the six elements coming from the choice of free bases for the three copies of \n\n\n\n\nF\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{2}}\n\n. Bieri also showed that the Stallings group fits into a sequence of examples of groups of type \n\n\n\n\nF\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{n}}\n\n but not of type \n\n\n\n\nF\n\nn\n+\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F_{n+1}}\n\n. The Stallings group is a key object in the version of discrete Morse theory for cubical complexes developed by Mladen Bestvina and Noel Brady[14] and in the study of subgroups of direct products of limit groups.[15][16][17]/nStallings' most famous theorem in group theory is an algebraic characterization of groups with more than one end (that is, with more than one \"connected component at infinity\"), which is now known as Stallings' theorem about ends of groups. Stallings proved that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting as an amalgamated free product or as an HNN extension over a finite group (that is, in terms of Bass\u2013Serre theory, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action on a tree with finite edge stabilizers). More precisely, the theorem states that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if either G admits a splitting as an amalgamated free product \n\n\n\nG\n=\nA\n\n\u2217\n\nC\n\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G=A\\ast _{C}B}\n\n, where the group C is finite and \n\n\n\nC\n\u2260\nA\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C\\neq A}\n\n, \n\n\n\nC\n\u2260\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C\\neq B}\n\n, or G admits a splitting as an HNN extension \n\n\n\nG\n=\n\u27e8\nH\n,\nt\n\n|\n\n\nt\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\nK\nt\n=\nL\n\u27e9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G=\\langle H,t|t^{-1}Kt=L\\rangle }\n\n where \n\n\n\nK\n,\nL\n\u2264\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle K,L\\leq H}\n\n are finite subgroups of H./nStallings proved this result in a series of works, first dealing with the torsion-free case (that is, a group with no nontrivial elements of finite order)[18] and then with the general case.[5][19] Stalling's theorem yielded a positive solution to the long-standing open problem about characterizing finitely generated groups of cohomological dimension one as exactly the free groups.[20] Stallings' theorem about ends of groups is considered one of the first results in geometric group theory proper since it connects a geometric property of a group (having more than one end) with its algebraic structure (admitting a splitting over a finite subgroup). Stallings' theorem spawned many subsequent alternative proofs by other mathematicians (e.g.[21][22]) as well as many applications (e.g.[23]). The theorem also motivated several generalizations and relative versions of Stallings' result to other contexts, such as the study of the notion of relative ends of a group with respect to a subgroup,[24][25][26] including a connection to CAT(0) cubical complexes.[27] A comprehensive survey discussing, in particular, numerous applications and generalizations of Stallings' theorem, is given in a 2003 paper of C. T. C. Wall.[28]/nAnother influential paper of Stallings is his 1983 article \"Topology of finite graphs\".[29] Traditionally, the algebraic structure of subgroups of free groups has been studied in combinatorial group theory using combinatorial methods, such as the Schreier rewriting method and Nielsen transformations.[30] Stallings' paper put forward a topological approach based on the methods of covering space theory that also used a simple graph-theoretic framework. The paper introduced the notion of what is now commonly referred to as Stallings subgroup graph for describing subgroups of free groups, and also introduced a foldings technique (used for approximating and algorithmically obtaining the subgroup graphs) and the notion of what is now known as a Stallings folding. Most classical results regarding subgroups of free groups acquired simple and straightforward proofs in this set-up and Stallings' method has become the standard tool in the theory for studying the subgroup structure of free groups, including both the algebraic and algorithmic questions (see [31]). In particular, Stallings subgroup graphs and Stallings foldings have been the used as a key tools in many attempts to approach the Hanna Neumann conjecture.[32][33][34][35]/nStallings subgroup graphs can also be viewed as finite-state automata[31] and they have also found applications in semigroup theory and in computer science.[36][37][38][39]/nStallings' foldings method has been generalized and applied to other contexts, particularly in Bass\u2013Serre theory for approximating group actions on trees and studying the subgroup structure of the fundamental groups of graphs of groups. The first paper in this direction was written by Stallings himself,[40] with several subsequent generalizations of Stallings' folding methods in the Bass\u2013Serre theory context by other mathematicians.[41][42][43][44]/nStallings' 1991 paper \"Non-positively curved triangles of groups\"[45] introduced and studied the notion of a triangle of groups. This notion was the starting point for the theory of complexes of groups (a higher-dimensional analog of Bass\u2013Serre theory), developed by Andr\u00e9 Haefliger[46] and others.[47][48] Stallings' work pointed out the importance of imposing some sort of \"non-positive curvature\" conditions on the complexes of groups in order for the theory to work well; such restrictions are not necessary in the one-dimensional case of Bass\u2013Serre theory./nAmong Stallings' contributions to 3-manifold topology, the most well-known is the Stallings fibration theorem.[49] The theorem states that if M is a compact irreducible 3-manifold whose fundamental group contains a normal subgroup, such that this subgroup is finitely generated and such that the quotient group by this subgroup is infinite cyclic, then M fibers over a circle. This is an important structural result in the theory of Haken manifolds that engendered many alternative proofs, generalizations and applications (e.g.[50][51][52][53] ), including a higher-dimensional analog.[54]/nA 1965 paper of Stallings \"How not to prove the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture\"[55] gave a group-theoretic reformulation of the famous Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. The paper began with a humorous admission: \"I have committed the sin of falsely proving Poincar\u00e9's Conjecture. But that was in another country; and besides, until now, no one has known about it.\"[1][55] Despite its ironic title, Stallings' paper informed much of the subsequent research on exploring the algebraic aspects of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture (see, for example,[56][57][58][59])./nStallings was also interested in languages, and wrote one of the very few mathematical research papers in the constructed language Interlingua.[60][61]", "2673476": "John Philoponus (Greek: /f\u026a\u02c8l\u0252p\u0259n\u0259s/; \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; c. 490 \u2013 c. 570), also known as John the Grammarian or John of Alexandria, was a Byzantine Greek philologist, Aristotelian commentator, Christian theologian and an author of a considerable number of philosophical treatises and theological works. He was born in Alexandria. A rigorous, sometimes polemical writer and an original thinker who was controversial in his own time, John Philoponus broke from the Aristotelian\u2013Neoplatonic tradition, questioning methodology and eventually leading to empiricism in the natural sciences. He was one of the first to propose a \"theory of impetus\" similar to the modern concept of inertia over Aristotelian dynamics./nLater in life Philoponus turned to Christian apologetics, arguing against the eternity of the world, a theory which formed the basis of pagan attacks on the Christian doctrine of Creation. He also wrote on Christology and was posthumously condemned as a heretic by the Church in 680\u201381 because of what was perceived as a tritheistic interpretation of the Trinity.[citation needed]/nHis by-name \u1f41 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 translates as \"lover of toil\", i.e. \"diligent,\" referring to a miaphysite confraternity in Alexandria, the philoponoi, who were active in debating pagan (i.e. Neoplatonic) philosophers./nHis posthumous condemnation limited the spread of his writing, but copies of his work, The contra Aristotelem, resurfaced in medieval Europe, through translations from Arabic of his quotes included in the work of Simplicius of Cilicia, which was debated in length by Muslim philosophers such as al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali and later Averroes, influencing Bonaventure and Buridan in Christian Western Europe, but also Rabbanite Jews such  as Maimonides and Gersonides, who also used his arguments against their Karaite rivals. His work was largely debated in the Arabic scholarly tradition, where he is known as Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Na\u1e25w\u012b (i.e. \"John the Grammarian\"), and his views against Aristotelian physics were defended by philosophers at the court of Fatimid Imam Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, particularly Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani, who debated Avicenna on the topic, and Hamza ibn Ali. His critique of Aristotle in the Physics commentary was a major influence on Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Galileo Galilei, who cited Philoponus substantially in his works.[1][2]/nAlthough Philoponus' originating from a Christian family is possible, nothing is known of his early life. Philoponus studied at the school of Alexandria and began publishing from about 510. He was a pupil and sometime amanuensis to the Neoplatonic philosopher Ammonius Hermiae, who had studied at Athens under Proclus.[3]/nPhiloponus' early writings are based on lectures given by Ammonius, but gradually he established his own independent thinking in his commentaries and critiques of Aristotle's On the Soul and Physics. In the latter work Philoponus became one of the earliest thinkers to reject Aristotle's dynamics and propose the \"theory of impetus\":[4] i.e., an object moves and continues to move because of an energy imparted in it by the mover and ceases the movement when that energy is exhausted. This insightful theory was the first step towards the concept of inertia in modern physics, although Philoponus' theory was largely ignored at the time because he was too radical in his rejection of Aristotle./nBut this [view of Aristotle] is completely erroneous, and our view may be completely corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights, one many times heavier than the other you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend [solely] on the weights, but that the difference in time is very small. ... \u2014 John Philoponus' refutation of the Aristotelian claim that the elapsed time for a falling body is inversely proportional to its weight[5]/nPhiloponus is the only writer of antiquity to have formally presented such a concept. \nAs the discovery of the principle of inertia is the hallmark achievement of modern science as it emerges in the 16th to 17th centuries, Pierre Duhem argues that its invention would put Philoponus among the \"great geniuses of Antiquity\" and the \"principal precursors to modern science\", although he holds it more likely that Philoponus may have received the idea from an earlier, otherwise unrecorded Alexandrian school of mechanics.[6]/nIn 529 Philoponus wrote his critique On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus in which he systematically defeats every argument put forward for the eternity of the world, a theory which formed the basis of pagan attack of the Christian doctrine of Creation. The intellectual battle against eternalism became one of Philoponus' major preoccupations and dominated several of his publications (some now lost) over the following decade./nHe introduced a new period of scientific thought based heavily on three premises: (1) The universe is a product of one single God, (2) the heavens and the earth have the same physical properties, (3) and the stars are not divine.[7] With these principles Philoponus went after his rival, Simplicius of Cilicia, by questioning Aristotle's' view of dynamics and cosmology.[7] He argued that motion can occur in a void and that the velocity of a falling object is not based on its weight.[7] He also held that God created all matter with its physical properties and with natural laws that would allow matter to progress from a state of chaos to an organized state forming the present universe.[7] What remains of his writings indicate that he used the same didactic methods of reasoning that modern science uses and that he performed genuine experiments.[7]/nThe style of his commentaries and his conclusions made Philoponus unpopular with his colleagues and fellow philosophers, and he appears to have ceased his study of philosophy around 530, devoting himself to theology instead. Around 550 he wrote a theological work On the Creation of the World as a commentary on the Bible\u2019s story of creation, using the insights of Greek philosophers and Basil of Caesarea. In this work he transfers his theory of impetus to the motion of the planets, whereas Aristotle had proposed different explanations for the motion of heavenly bodies and for earthly projectiles. Thus, Philoponus' theological work is recognized in the history of science as the first attempt at a unified theory of dynamics. Another of his major theological concerns was to argue that all material objects were brought into being by God (Arbiter, 52A\u2013B)./nAround 553 Philoponus made some theological contributions to the Council of Constantinople concerning Christology. His doctrine on Christ's duality, according to which in Christ remain two united substances, united but divided, is analogous to the union of the soul and body in human beings and coincides with the miaphysite school of thought. He also produced writings on the Trinity around this time. Arbiter, John Philoponus' Christological \u201copus magnum\u201d stands in the line with Cyril of Alexandria and Severus of Antioch.[8] Philoponus asserted the understanding of Christ as divine and human, in opposition to Chalcedonian authors who strove to reach a middle ground./nAfter his death, John Philoponus was declared to have held heretical views of the Trinity and was made anathema at the Third Council of Constantinople in 680\u2013681. This limited the spread of his ideas in the following centuries, but in his own time and afterwards he was translated into Syriac and Arabic, and many of his works survived and were studied by the Arabs. Some of his works continued to circulate in Europe in Greek or Latin versions and influenced Bonaventure. The theory of impetus was taken up by Buridan in the 14th century./nPhiloponus and his contemporaries, Simplicius of Cilicia and Strato developed the Aristotelian concept of space further, eventually influencing the Renaissance theory of perspective, particularly the one highlighted by Leon Battista Alberti, and other architectural masters.[1][9]/nJohn Philoponus wrote at least 40 works on a wide array of subjects including grammar, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and theology./nThe commentaries of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages aimed to teach an audience. In that regard, the repetitive nature of Philoponus\u2019 commentaries demonstrates his pedagogical awareness. Although abstract in manner, Philoponus is chiefly focused on the concept in question./nMost of Philoponus\u2019 early philosophical works strive to define the distinction between matter, extension, place, and various kinds of change. For example, the commentary On the Eternity of the World against Aristotle represents a standardized description of Aristotelian natural philosophy.[27] Both Aristotle and Philoponus argue that in kinds of change there are differences, in their form and matter./nIn Physics, Aristotle operates with the idea of places, but dismisses the existence of space. The idea that came from Plato and was developed by Aristotle has been evolved by Philoponus. Philoponus attempts to combine the idea of homogeneous space with the Aristotelian system.[1] The argument made by Philoponus is that substances by themselves require some determinate quantity for their being. Similarly to Aristotle, who rejected the immaterial things, and in contrast to Plato who accepted immaterial substances in his metaphysics, Philoponus\u2019 concept of substance refers to the material objects./nConcerning the discussion of space, Philoponus\u2019 claim that from every point in space is possible to draw identical figures, made him be perceived as an innovative thinker who influenced later Renaissance scholars, for instance, Gianfranceso Pico della Mirandola and Galileo Galilei. Thus, Philoponus' idea of perspective signifies the concept of space as immaterial three-dimensional medium in which objects are located.[1]/nIn the third book of De Anima, entitled De Intellectu, Philoponus analyzes the doctrine of the intellect. The author (Philoponus or pseudo-Philoponus?) sets the theory on the role and functioning of the active intellect.[28] On one hand, there is the active intellect, and on the other, the idea of perception awareness or how we are aware that we are perceiving. In other words, in this reflective philosophy, there is a rationalist conclusion which emphasizes a relation between self and truth which leads to the discussion of the nature of knowledge./nAccording to this view, the knowledge is identical to its object, since the self-awareness of perception is divorced from the irrational soul.Therefore, the understanding arises through the identification of the intellect and its object. More specifically, perception deals only with material things.[29]/nPhiloponus has raised the central question of the scientific and philosophical Aristotle's work on chemistry. The work called On Generation and Corruption examines the question of how is the mixture (chemical combination) possible? Philoponus\u2019 contribution to the topic is in his new definition of potential, the third of the seven elements criteria. There are various interpretations of the theory of mixture, but it seems that Philoponus is rather refining Aristotle's approach than rejecting it. One of interpreters of Philophonus\u2019 work on the theory of mixture, De Haas, implies that \u201cno element can possess a quality essential to it except to a superlative extent\u201d.[30][31]/nPhiloponus\u2019 major Christological work is Arbiter. The work was written shortly before the Second Council of Constantinople of 553.[32] It became famous in regard to its doctrine on resurrection. Similarly to ideas presented in Physics, Philoponus in the work titled Arbiter states that our corrupted bodies (material things) will be eventually brought into being (matter and form) by God.[8]/nThis article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Publication was under the name Politzer-P\u00e9ter as she had changed her Jewish surname Politzer into P\u00e9ter that same year. For her research, she received her PhD summa cum laude in 1935. In 1936, she presented a paper entitled \"\u00dcber rekursive Funktionen der zweiten Stufe\" to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.[3] These papers helped to found the modern field of recursive function theory as a separate area of mathematical research.[6][7]/nIn 1937, she was appointed as contributing editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic.[4]/nAfter the passage of the Jewish Laws of 1939 in Hungary, P\u00e9ter was forbidden to teach because of her Jewish origin and was briefly confined to a ghetto in Budapest.

In 1959, she presented a major paper \"\u00dcber die Verallgemeinerung der Theorie der rekursiven Funktionen f\u00fcr abstrakte Mengen geeigneter Struktur als Definitionsbereiche\" to the International Symposium in Warsaw (later published in two parts in 1961[11] and 1962[12]).[3]/nBeginning in the mid-1950s, P\u00e9ter applied recursive function theory to computers. Her final book, published in 1976, was Rekursive Funktionen in der Komputer-Theorie (Recursive Functions in Computer Theory). Originally published in Hungarian, it was the second Hungarian mathematical book to be published in the Soviet Union because its subject matter was considered indispensable to the theory of computers. It was translated into English in 1981.[13][8]/nP\u00e9ter was awarded the Kossuth Prize in 1951.

Cavalieri's principle in geometry partially anticipated integral calculus./nBorn in Milan, Cavalieri joined the Jesuates order (not to be confused with the Jesuits) at the age of fifteen, taking the name Bonaventura upon becoming a novice of the order, and remained a member until his death.[2] He took his vows as a full member of the order in 1615, at the age of seventeen, and shortly after joined the Jesuat house in Pisa. By 1616 he was a student of geometry at the University of Pisa. There he came under the tutelage of Benedetto Castelli, who probably introduced him to Galileo Galilei. In 1617 he briefly joined the Medici court in Florence, under the patronage of Cardinal Federico Borromeo, but the following year he returned to Pisa and began teaching Mathematics in place of Castelli. He applied for the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna but was turned down.[1]/nIn 1620, he returned to the Jesuate house in Milan, where he had lived as a novitiate, and became a deacon under Cardinal Borromeo. He studied theology in the monastery of San Gerolamo in Milan, and was named prior of the monastery of St. Peter in Lodi. In 1623 he was made prior of St. Benedict's monastery in Parma, but was still applying for positions in mathematics. He applied again to Bologna and then, in 1626, to Sapienza University, but was declined each time, despite taking six months' leave of absence to support his case to Sapienza in Rome.[1] In 1626 he began to suffer from gout, which would restrict his movements for the rest of his life.[3] He was also turned down from a position at the University of Parma, which he believed was due to his membership of the Jesuate order, as Parma was administered by the Jesuit order at the time. In 1629 he was appointed Chair of Mathematics at the University of Bologna, which is attributed to Galileo's support of him to the Bolognese senate.[1][4]/nHe published most of his work while at Bologna, though some of it had been written previously; his Geometria Indivisibilius, where he outlined what would later become the method of indivisibles, was written in 1627 while in Parma and presented as part of his application to Bologna, but was not published until 1635. Contemporary critical reception was mixed, and Exercitationes geometricae sex (Six Exercises in Geometry) was published in 1647, partly as a response to criticism. Also at Bologna, he published tables of logarithms and information on their use, promoting their use in Italy./nGalileo exerted a strong influence on Cavalieri, and Cavalieri would write at least 112 letters to Galileo.  Galileo said of him, \"few, if any, since Archimedes, have delved as far and as deep into the science of geometry.\"[5] He corresponded widely; his known correspondents include Marin Mersenne, Evangelista Torricelli and Vincenzo Viviani.[3] Torricelli in particular was instrumental in refining and promoting the method of indivisibles.[1] He also benefited from the patronage of Cesare Marsili.[5]/nTowards the end of his life, his health declined significantly. Arthritis prevented him from writing, and much of his correspondence was dictated and written by Stephano degli Angeli, a fellow Jesuate and student of Cavalieri. Angeli would go on to further develop Cavalieri's method./nIn 1647 he died, probably of gout.[3]/nFrom 1632 to 1646, Cavalieri published eleven books dealing with problems in astronomy, optics, motion and geometry./nCavalieri's first book, first published in 1632 and reprinted once in 1650, was Lo Specchio Ustorio, overo, Trattato delle settioni coniche, or The Burning Mirror, or a Treatise on Conic Sections.[6]  The aim of Lo Specchio Ustorio was to address the question of how Archimedes could have used mirrors to burn the Roman fleet as they approached Syracuse, a question still in debate.[4][7] The book went beyond this purpose and also explored conic sections, reflections of light, and the properties of parabolas. In this book, he developed the theory of mirrors shaped into parabolas, hyperbolas, and ellipses, and various combinations of these mirrors. He demonstrated that if, as was later shown, light has a finite and determinate speed, there is minimal interference in the image at the focus of a parabolic, hyperbolic or elliptic mirror, though this was theoretical since the mirrors required could not be constructed using contemporary technology. This would produce better images than the telescopes that existed at the time.[4][8]/nHe also demonstrated some properties of curves. The first is that, for a light ray parallel to the axis of a parabola and reflected so as to pass through the focus, the sum of the incident angle and its reflection is equal to that of any other similar ray. He then demonstrated similar results for hyperbolas and ellipses. The second result, useful in the design of reflecting telescopes, is that if a line is extended from a point outside of a parabola to the focus, then the reflection of this line on the outside surface of the parabola is parallel to the axis. Other results include the property that if a line passes through a hyperbola and its external focus, then its reflection on the interior of the hyperbola will pass through the internal focus; the reverse of the previous, that a ray directed through the parabola to the internal focus is reflected from the outer surface to the external focus; and the property that if a line passes through one internal focus of an ellipse, its reflection on the internal surface of the ellipse will pass through the other internal focus. While some of these properties had been noted previously, Cavalieri gave the first proof of many.[4]/nLo Specchio Ustorio also included a table of reflecting surfaces and modes of reflection for practical use.[4]/nCavalieri's work also contained theoretical designs for a new type of telescope using mirrors, a reflecting telescope, initially developed to answer the question of Archimedes' Mirror and then applied on a much smaller scale as telescopes.[4][9] He illustrated three different concepts for incorporating reflective mirrors within his telescope model. Plan one consisted of a large, concave mirror directed towards the sun as to reflect light into a second, smaller, convex mirror. Cavalieri's second concept consisted of a main, truncated, paraboloid mirror and a second, convex mirror. His third option illustrated a strong resemblance to his previous concept, replacing the convex secondary lens with a concave lens.[4]/nInspired by earlier work by Galileo, Cavalieri developed a new geometrical approach called the method of indivisibles to calculus and published a treatise on the topic, Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota, or Geometry, developed by a new method through the indivisibles of the continua. This was written in 1627, but was not published until 1635. In this work, Cavalieri considers an entity referred to in the text as 'all the lines' or 'all the planes' of a figure, an indefinite number of parallel lines or planes within the bounds of a figure that are comparable to the area and volume, respectively, of the figure. Later mathematicians, improving on his method, would treat 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' as equivalent or equal to the area and volume, but Cavalieri, in an attempt to avoid the question of the composition of the continuum, insisted that the two were comparable but not equal.[1]/nThese parallel elements are called indivisibles respectively of area and volume and provide the building blocks of Cavalieri's method, and are also fundamental features of integral calculus.  He also used the method of indivisibles to calculate the result which is now written \n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\nd\nx\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\int _{0}^{1}x^{2}dx=1/3}\n\n, in the process of calculating the area enclosed in an Archimedean Spiral, which he later generalised to other figures, showing, for instance, that the volume of a cone is one-third of the volume of its circumscribed cylinder.[10]/nAn immediate application of the method of indivisibles is Cavalieri's principle, which states that the volumes of two objects are equal if the areas of their corresponding cross-sections are in all cases equal. Two cross-sections correspond if they are intersections of the body with planes equidistant from a chosen base plane. (The same principle had been previously used by Zu Gengzhi (480\u2013525) of China, in the specific case of calculating the volume of the sphere.[11])/nThe method of indivisibles as set out by Cavalieri was powerful but was limited in its usefulness in two respects. First, while Cavalieri's proofs were intuitive and later demonstrated to be correct, they were not rigorous; second, his writing was dense and opaque. While many contemporary mathematicians furthered the method of indivisibles, the Geometria indivisibilibus critical reception was severe. Andre Taquet and Paul Guldin both published responses to the Geometria indivisibilibus. Guldin's particularly in-depth critique suggested that Cavalieri's method was derived from the work of Johannes Kepler and Bartolomeo Sovero, attacked his method for a lack of rigorousness, and then argues that there can be no meaningful ratio between two infinities, and therefore it is meaningless to compare one to another.[3][1]/nCavalieri's Exercitationes geometricae sex or Six Geometric Exercises (1647) was written in direct response to Guldin's criticism. It was initially drafted as a dialogue in the manner of Galileo, but correspondents advised against the format as being unnecessarily inflammatory. The charges of plagiarism were without substance, but much of the Exercitationes dealt with the mathematical substance of Guldin's arguments. He argued, disingenuously, that his work regarded 'all the lines' as a separate entity from the area of a figure, and then argued that 'all the lines' and 'all the planes' dealt not with absolute but with relative infinity, and therefore could be compared. These arguments were not convincing to contemporaries.[1] The Exercitationes nonetheless represented a significant improvement to the method of indivisibles. By applying transformations to his variables, he generalised his previous integral result, showing that\n\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\nd\nx\n=\n1\n\n/\n\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\int _{0}^{1}x^{n}dx=1/(n+1)}\n\n for n=3 to n=9, which is now known as Cavalieri's quadrature formula.[3][10]/nTowards the end of his life, Cavalieri published two books on astronomy. While they use the language of astrology, he states in the text that he did not believe in or practice astrology. Those books were the Nuova pratica astromlogica (1639) and the Trattato della ruota planetaria perpetua (1646)./nHe published tables of logarithms, emphasizing their practical use in the fields of astronomy and geography.[3][1][5]/nCavalieri also constructed a hydraulic pump for a monastery that he managed. The Duke of Mantua obtained one similar.[5]/nAccording to Gilles-Gaston Granger, Cavalieri belongs with Newton, Leibniz, Pascal, Wallis and MacLaurin as one of those who in the 17th and 18th centuries \"redefine[d] the mathematical object\".[12]/nThe lunar crater Cavalerius is named for Cavalieri.", "22694802": "Gordon Bamford Preston (28 April 1925 \u2013 14 April 2015) was an English mathematician best known for his work on semigroups.

This allowed Bartel to continue his formal education while working as an apprentice.[6]/nAfter completing secondary school in 1901, Bartel studied mechanics at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic in the Mechanical Engineering Department. He graduated summa cum laude in 1907 and soon started working for his alma mater as an assistant in descriptive geometry to Placyd Zdzis\u0142aw Dziwinski.[7] From 1908 to 1909, he also studied mathematics and philosophy at the Franciscan University in Lviv and at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The travel grant to Munich allowed him to attend the lectures on art history by Karl Dochlemann and mathematics by Aurel Voss and Alfred Pringsheim.[6]/nHe returned to the Polytechnic and earned his doctor of technical sciences in 1909. His dissertation \"O utworach szereg\u00f3w i p\u0119k\u00f3w inwolucyjnych\" (Compositions series and involution pencils) allowed him to become one of the first title holders of such doctoral within Austria-Hungary. Bartel gave his habilitation thesis \"O p\u0142askich utworach inwolucji stopnia czwartego szeregu zerowego\" (On planar products of involution of the fourth series of the zero degree) in 1912,[8] then received the title of associate professor. Bartel became the chair of descriptive geometry after the retirement of Mieczys\u0142aw \u0141azarski in 1911 due to blindness.[9] Bartel attained the title of professor of mathematics at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic in 1917.[10][11]/nConscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, after the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 he returned to Lw\u00f3w, which became part of the newly-established Second Polish Republic. In 1919, as commander of railway troops, he fought in the defence of the city against the Ukrainian siege. Meanwhile, Bartel wrote his first textbook on descriptive geometry[6] and befriended and later supported Poland's future leader, marshal and commander-in-chief, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. Since May 1919 he served as the manager of the Armoured Trains Construction Management and Association. His numerous successes in this field led to Prime Minister Leopold Skulski appointing him the Minister of the Railway system of the Republic of Poland. Bartel met other significant and influential politicians and diplomats, most notably Prime Minister Wincenty Witos and Prime Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski. After the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1920, Bartel was nominated as a lieutenant colonel and was left in charge of the railway reserve officers and the Lw\u00f3w militia.[11] He was awarded a Virtuti Militari cross, a Polish distinction for valor, after the armed conflict.[6]/nIn 1921, Bartel spent six months travelling to museums and galleries in France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to research on art. Most of his holidays were spent likewise because of his interest stemming from Dochlemann's lectures. He accumulated a good personal archive of notes and photographs for this interest of his.[6]/nIn 1922, Bartel was elected a member of Poland's Sejm (parliament) and held that position until 1929. Initially, he was a member of the party PSL \"Liberation\", but he was not satisfied with the radicalization of the group. In March 1925 at the Congress of the Polish People's Party, he decided to adopt, among others, a reform without compensation. Bartel eventually left the party and the organisation in April 1925, along with Marian Zyndram-Ko\u015bcia\u0142kowski and Boles\u0142aw Wys\u0142ouch and later founded the parliamentary \"Labour Club\". This organization quickly came under the direct influence of commander-in-chief J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. Just before the May Coup of 1926, Bartel received an order from Marshal Pi\u0142sudski to prepare for a takeover as prime minister after the expected collapse of President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and his government.[12]/nOn 15 May 1926, after the resignation of the government led by Wincenty Witos and President Wojciechowski after the May Coup, Bartel was appointed by Marshal of the Sejm and the acting head of state Maciej Rataj as the prime minister of the Second Polish Republic, but Bartel later stated in his inauguration speech that he would be the head of government only until the election of a new president. His decision was possibly influenced by the fact that he suffered from kidney and stomach problems and was constantly in pain. One member of the parliament stated, \"He was a cheerful and ambitious man, but always in pain. Even his opponents in the Sejm admitted that in personal relationships, it is extremely hard not to be in favour of a man like Bartel. As prime minister, he tried to aid every man possible, even the men and women that opposed his policies and the government, but he was not able to help himself, which led to his early decline in politics and diplomacy of the Polish Republic. He was of weak stature and of weak health and would hardly make a good impression on the public, especially the socialists or communists in the east and therefore, this would not make him an influential Prime Minister nor a diplomat supporting democracy.\"/nBartel's new government consisted mostly of people not connected with any political parties (four of those politicians already were occupied ministerial positions). Bartel was described as ideologically centrist: Prime Minister's newly established office was occupied by both the right-wing and left-wing leaders. Bartel himself took over the Ministry in turn and Pi\u0142sudski the Minister of War. Such a system churned mainly the Polish Socialist Party, which supported the May Coup. On 16 May 1926, Prime Minister Bartel made a statement in which he highlighted the principles of his policies. Bartel stated that the cabinet took power in accordance with the law, without any prejudice to the constitutional order. He also called for peace, hard work and dedication to the Polish nation. At the same time, he promised the immediate removal of incompetent and corrupt politicians from any high posts that could negatively influence the future economic growth of the Second Polish Republic. Bartel's closest personal advisor in politics and diplomacy was Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who was in favour of the new minister.[13]/nBartel suggested that Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki should become a candidate for the post of head of state (president), who was also a professor at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic. Bartel's first government was one of the most active in the history of Poland; the politicians and members of parliament gathered every second day and on occasions everyday to discuss political matters. On 4 June 1926, Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki was elected the president of the Second Polish Republic, and Bartel resigned along with the entire cabinet, but soon after being appointed, President Mo\u015bcicki designated him again to become Prime Minister./nOn 8 June 1926, three days after the Mo\u015bcicki's designation, Bartel formed his second cabinet. On the same day, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski sent a letter to the head office in which he outlined the conditions of re-entry to the parliament. After his second election, Bartel primarily focused on the restoration of the decree based on the organization of the highest military authorities from 7 January 1921, which enables the free management of the Ministry of War without the vote of the government and the parliament. On 9 June 1926, the decree was officially restored, however, another decree was adopted, which increased the power of the president or head of state over the ministry. Bartel met with representatives of the parliamentary clubs and highlighted in a conversation with them his commitment towards the parliamentary system but also pointed out a more concerning issue:the economic development of the country. At a private meeting with senators, he highlighted his determination and involvement in fighting against bureaucracy, the introduction of an apolitical army and the elimination of the Ministry of Public Works. He vividly stated that before the May Coupn there was no democracy and that Poland was ruled by an oligarchy, nobles and influential leaders of wealthy privately-owned clubs and parties./nThe supporters of Bartel and his government emphasized his efficiency when they managed the state. His opponents, however, saw it as a tool to limit the role of the Polish Parliament and accused him of deliberate dictatorship and control over the ministers in his \"private parliament sittings\" - the so-called Sejm Bartlowy (Bartel's Parliament). Bartel was appointed prime minister when Marshal Pi\u0142sudski undertook an attempt to communicate with the rebellious senators and members of the Sejm. Bartel himself was considered to be representative of the liberal tendencies in the party and a spokesman of the Sanacja movement. Otherwise the post of the head of government (Prime Minister) was taken by Kazimierz \u015awitalski or Walery S\u0142awek, both of whom were considered to be uncompromising supporters of the conflict with the parliament.[12][14]/nBartel's government contributed to a marked improvement in administration, which was primarily caused by the Prime Minister's organizational skills and knowledge. He created an efficient system of government action in connection with the Sejm and officials of lower rank: \"The ministers of the previous governments generally considered themselves as autonomous rulers, which influenced the private interests of the members of different parties in charge. The government of Kazimierz Bartel was never focused or concentrated on any political ties and friendships. The officials of the Prime Minister were to validate the efficiency of each ministry. Each minister was responsible for the operation of his office and ministers could not engage in any political activities. Before his speech in the parliament on any topic, he had to submit the text to the Prime Minister himself for approval. Bartel demanded such procedures from every minister and senator of his cabinet and personally prepared the agenda for each meeting of the government and disallowed to discuss any topic without his permission or consent.\"/nBartel also tried to improve the situation of the Polish Jews and the Jewish minority around the country. He was determined to eliminate the remnants of regulations dating back to the times of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Congress Poland, focused on the persecution of religious minorities, especially the Jews and the Gypsies. Bartel's cabinet announced that it is against such inhumane procedures and actions, and in 1927 the Prime Minister gave permission to adopt a law officially recognizing and granting rights to the Jewish communities. Bartel was also against enforcing certain laws to the nature of the economic sanctions imposed on the Jews./nOn 2 August 1926, the Parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution (the so-called \"August Novella\"), significantly strengthening the role of the president. On 20 September 1926 the Christian Democratic Party raised a vote against two ministers in the government of Bartel: Antoni Sujkowski and Kazimierz M\u0142odzianowski. The party accused them of carrying out political purges in the state administration. Eventually, the vote was passed by the government, which forced Bartel and his cabinet to resign, but Marshal Pi\u0142sudski ordered President Mo\u015bcicki to appoint Bartel as Prime Minister. Once more, that was not in violation of the Constitution, but the anti-parliamentarian speakers and the socialist politicians, confused with the frequent changes in the administration and the government, threatened the Sejm and even suggested a rebellion or another coup. The conflict made Bartel's third new cabinet last only four days./nOn 30 September at the Belvedere palace in Warsaw, the council was holding a meeting in the study room, during which it was decided to dissolve the third government. Therefore, Bartel received the document on this subject, which for its validity required President Mo\u015bcicki's signature. Meanwhile, the Senate immediately demanded that the parliament passes the budget cut policy proposed by the Upper House. Bartel told the Speaker of the Sejm Maciej Rataj, that in such a situation he will personally take the decree to Mo\u015bcicki and ask for his signature. After the Sejm passed the budget cut policy, Bartel arrived at Mo\u015bcicki's private residence, but to his surprise, Mo\u015bcicki refused to sign the document allowing the dissolution. Instead, he ordered Bartel to terminate his employment. Bartel was once again forced to resign, but this time his cabinet would stay intact and his place would be taken by the marshal himself. The former prime minister was very bitter about this turn of events, despite the fact he went along with Pi\u0142sudski's and Rataj's plans. In its course, the Marshal warned that, in contrast to the previous government, he will not be \"competing\" with the ministers and if necessary he will use force if the members would not agree to his radical policies./nFollowing his resignation, Bartel was to become the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Enlightenment in Pi\u0142sudski's own, private council that operated in case of any unexpected conflict with the current operating government. The Marshal did not devote much attention towards his cabinet, focusing primarily on military and foreign policies. It was Kazimierz Bartel that was to replace the Marshal and take over his duties if absent and become the Speaker of the Sejm. He often spoke, as a representative of the government, on matters related to the budget and finances. These topics were possibly the main subject of a dispute between the \"Pi\u0142sudskites\" and the parliamentary opposition./nAfter the elections in March 1928, Pi\u0142sudski decided that Kazimierz Bartel should be appointed to the position of Speaker of the Sejm. On 27 March the \"Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government\" (BBWR), an ostensibly non-political organization that existed from 1928 to 1935, closely affiliated with J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and his Sanacja movement, declared Bartel's candidacy. However Pi\u0142sudski's plan to place Bartel in charge of the Sejm and nominate him as Marshal Speaker failed, because the senators and members of parliament decided to choose Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski of the Polish Socialist Party as the Marshal of the Sejm instead. In protest, following the results of the vote, the members and supporters of the parliamentary BBWR party left the room./nThe year 1928 also marked the release of his first book \"Perspektywa Malarska\". It dealt with the basic theory of perspective and its extension to architecture and art. It was published by Ksiaznica-Atlas, a publisher in Lw\u00f3w who provided the negatives for the German translation published by B.G. Teubner in 1934.[6]/nAs soon as the new government was formed without Kazimierz Bartel as its head, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, temporarily serving as Prime Minister of the country, resigned. He decided, however, that his position will be taken over by Kazimierz Bartel, considered his most trusted and most loyal friend and supporter among the members of the party, although this change was only formal\u00a0\u2013 Bartel was already responsible for leading the ongoing work of the Council of Ministers, even if he was not the Head of Cabinet. Pi\u0142sudski's decision greatly dissatisfied the senators of parliament, who would simply demonstrate their anger by not participating in the sessions and sittings of the Sejm. Some politicians dared to even throw rotten food at the ministers that were leaving the voting chamber. The situation worsened in the upcoming months and some ministers raised concerns about their safety, as some demonstrators, often made up of ordinary citizens working on the behalf of the party, tended to physically abuse officials travelling from their homes to the newly constructed government building located on Wiejska Street in Warsaw. Similar events occurred during the inauguration of the first President of the Second Polish Republic, Gabriel Narutowicz, in December 1922. The politicians and ministers were advised to travel with guards, police or at least a weapon that they could defend themselves with, however, the use of weapons may have strengthened the unity of the opposition and of the demonstrators that could use this as an act of violence against the common people and a violation of social democracy./nAfter the beginning of the so-called \"Czechowicz affair\" in which the opposition discovered that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gabriel Czechowicz, a strong admirer of Pi\u0142sudski, passed 8 million Polish z\u0142oty from the state budget for the BBWR campaign between 1927 and 1928, on 12 February 1929 the members of an anti-Sanacja movement have requested to place both Czechowicz and Bartel before the State Tribunal (Court). In protest against this decision, Kazimierz Bartel informed the press of his intention to resign. He also stated that in his opinion the Czechowicz affair was caused by the Parliament and its senators rather than by the doings of one politician. On 13 April 1929 Bartel ordered his government to resign. He was replaced by Kazimierz \u015awitalski, a stubborn and self-centred man considered to be the cause of relentless struggle with the parliamentary opposition. The following months were marked by disputes between the newly formed government and the Sejm. Bartel's new cabinet began operating on 5 November 1929, however, its first sitting occurred in December on the orders of President Mo\u015bcicki. After this, the Parliament adopted a motion of no confidence against \u015awitalski's Cabinet. Kazimierz Bartel became the Prime Minister once again./nOn 29 December 1929, Bartel was chosen for the third time to be Prime Minister and formed his fifth government and cabinet, however, he performed his duties with large uncertainties, mainly due to poor health. He had kidney illness and had a ureterolithotomy with help from Tadeusz Pisarski, a urologist he befriended during their conscription in the army.[15] He also suffered from depression and anxiety probably due to the constant disputes with the Sejm and its senators. On 10 January he appeared at a meeting with members of parliament, declaring his willingness to cooperate with the senators and the Sejm, saying \"I come with good will and determination gentlemen!\" Bartel initially managed to establish cooperation with the Sejm, which resulted in the stabilization of the entire situation and conflict. Later, however, the relations between the cabinet and the parliament deteriorated again. The apogee of another dispute was a request for the adoption of no-confidence motion against the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Aleksander Prystor. That was done primarily through the initiative of the Polish Socialist Party headed by Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski and his supporters like Boles\u0142aw Limanowski, a Polish socialist politician, historian journalist and advocate of agrarianism who was the oldest member of the Polish Senate until his death in 1935 at the age of 99./nOn 12 March Bartel gave a speech in the Senate sharply attacking the senators, which were \"not able to fulfill the tasks set in order to control the state and the country and that their stubbornness and pride in themselves was an astonishing blow to both the economy and the policies of Poland.\" He also stated that \"being a member of parliament is a profession. It does not require the members to acquire any skills and create new damaging campaigns, only to obey the ruling party. A man focused only on work and career often becomes a man in conflict with others, which entails long political consequences.\" Bartel believed that the motion of no confidence towards one member of the Senate was the lack of support of the entire government. On 15 March 1930, he decided to leave the office and his resignation was accepted by the president the next day. Soon, he also resigned from his parliamentary seat and left politics. Walery S\u0142awek was appointed the new Prime Minister of Poland.[13]/nAfter retiring from political life, he returned to the Technical University of Lw\u00f3w (Polytechnic). In the same year he was elected rector of the university and held that office in the academic year of 1930/1931. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate and membership of the Polish Academy of Sciences: in the years 1930-1932 he was president of the Polish Mathematical Society. During this time he published his most important works, including a series of lectures on the perspective of European painting. It was the first such publication in the world. During his work at the Technical University of Lw\u00f3w, he expressed strong opposition to plans focused on introducing the so-called \"ghetto benches\" for students of Jewish origin and ethnicity to separate them from Polish and Christian peers. His opinions, as well as other actions against anti-Semitic students, made Bartel the subject of numerous attacks including throwing eggs and rotten food at the professor or bringing a pig with the sign \"Bartel\" by Polish nationalists to the university grounds./nIn 1932, he testified as a witness in the Brest trials, lasting from 26 October 1931 to 13 January 1932, held at the Warsaw Regional Court where leaders of the Centrolew, a \"centre-Left\" anti-Sanacja political opposition movement, were tried. In 1937, Bartel was appointed Senator of Poland by the President to replace the deceased Emil Bobrowski, and served until the outbreak of World War II. In the autumn of 1938, he was one of the signatories of a document addressed to President Mo\u015bcicki, which called for the inclusion of representatives of the opposition to the government in connection with the threat of the country's independence. The document also postulated amnesty for politicians of the opposition, who were forced into exile or were imprisoned after the Brest trials. Bartel handed over a memorandum to Mo\u015bcicki, however, Mo\u015bcicki did not respond to the proposals. In February 1939 Bartel delivered a speech in the Senate, which has gained wide publicity in the country. In it, he sharply criticized the situation in universities and colleges around Poland; mentioned the widespread anti-Semitism there; and the failed organization of studies, subjects and courses./nIn September 1939, during the defence of Lw\u00f3w just before the attack of the German troops, Kazimierz Bartel served as the head of the Civic Committee. When Lw\u00f3w became occupied by the Soviet Union, he was allowed to continue his lectures at the Technical University. In July 1940 he was, along with several other politicians and professors, summoned to Moscow, where he took part in an All-Committee meeting of Universities of the Soviet Union. Conversations and topics mentioned mostly related scientific issues, and Bartel signed a contract with a publishing house to write a textbook of Science and Geometry for the schools of the Soviet Union. He also visited the scientific and cultural institutions like the Tretyakov Gallery and the Institute of Architecture in Moscow. There are some conflicting reports about whether during his stay in Moscow, the Soviets offered him political cooperation. According to some of his closest friends, Stalin issued a proposal for the creation of a new Polish government, but Bartel rejected it. As he wrote to his wife on 16 July 1941: \"By listening to private conversations of the officers, I conclude that my position as Prime Minister may be resurrected, but what great duty this will be to control a split, communist country. In Moscow with Joseph Stalin, I had the pleasure of finding out new information from the West - Winston Churchill's speech addressed to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski about Poland's supposed future.\"/nOne of the editions of \"Paris' Historical Notebooks\"[16] described the content of the letter sent to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It stated that M\u00fcller, the Deputy Head of the Security Police and Security Service (Reinhard Heydrich) believed that Bartel negotiated in early 1941 with the Soviet authorities about the establishment of a new nation that together with the Soviet Union was to declare war on Nazi Germany. Similar information can be found, among others, in a telegram sent by the Polish Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in Switzerland to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London dating from 26 September 1940: \"It's believed that Moscow professor Bartel has intention to create the Red Government of Poland.\" This information, however, was never proved to be true. Meanwhile, Maria Bartlowa, the wife of former Prime Minister, stated that her husband was talking only with the Soviets on the release of his new lecture book. It is also widely believed that Kazimierz Bartel never met Stalin in person./nThe Prime Minister-in-exile stationing in London, General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, had plans to co-operate with Bartel and appoint him an ambassador. Sikorski recognized him as one of the few people from the former political circles who would agree to cooperate on the terms and conditions of the British government. On 19 June 1941 Bartel's candidacy was officially reported by Sikorski during a meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was motivated by the political loyalty of the former Prime Minister, as well as his successful efforts to preserve the Polish character of the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic under Soviet occupation. Sikorski, however, failed to find Bartel in the Soviet Union, and Stanis\u0142aw Kot was appointed ambassador instead./nOn 30 June 1941, soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, the Wehrmacht entered Lw\u00f3w. Bartel was arrested on 2 July at a meeting with co-workers at the University. Thirty-six other colleagues in the faculty were arrested the next night.[6] Bartel was taken initially to a Gestapo prison on Pelczy\u0144ska Street. There, as mentioned by inmate Antoni Stefanowicz, he was treated properly. The former Prime Minister was allowed to receive, send letters and mathematical books and papers to his wife, and bring food from home. At the time, Bartel was not questioned, because there were some issues regarding the accusations made by the Gestapo. On 21 July, however, he was transferred to a prison at \u0141\u0105ckiego Street, where he was treated poorly. The guards called him a Commie-Jew, as reported by Stefanowicz, and the Nazi officials ordered Bartel to clean the boots of a Ukrainian Hilfsgestapo soldier. Stefanowicz reported that Bartel was mentally devastated and could not understand the essence of the tragedy./nAccording to some sources, the Nazi officials proposed the establishment of a Polish puppet government dependent on the Reich. Such information was given by General Sikorski during a press conference in Cairo in November 1941 (on the way to Moscow). According to his version, Bartel refused and on the orders of Heinrich Himmler was executed on the 26 July 1941 at dawn. He was shot probably near Piaski Janowskie in the context of the Massacre of Lw\u00f3w professors.[17] Being barred from her daily delivery of food to her husband on Saturday, June 26, Bartel's wife learned of his death the following Monday.[6]/nAccording to one account, during the night of October 1943 the Sonderkommando composed of Jewish prisoners unearthed the bodies of the murdered Polish professors that were filed in a mass grave. It was carried out to remove the traces of the murder in connection with the approaching Soviet troops. On 9 October 1943, the corpses were piled. The prisoners were forced to take any personal belongings and clothes, including documents of Kazimierz Bartel and Professor Tadeusz Ostrowski. Later the pile of corpses was set on fire and in the following days the Sonderkommando scattered the ashes on the surrounding fields.[17][14]/nIn 1966, on the 25th anniversary of the execution of Lw\u00f3w professors, a plaque with the names of the victims of Nazism was placed on the church of St. Francis of Assisi in Krak\u00f3w. Next to the memorial there is also a separate epitaph in honour of Kazimierz Bartel./nKnowing the importance that Bartel gave to his work on perspective, his wife saved his manuscript after his death by begging from the Nazi officials. Bartel's library of books were either shipped with some pieces of furniture to Germany or burned with his personal papers. His second book was supposed to be published first in German by B. G. Teubner, who would provide Ksiaznica-Atlas the negatives for the Polish edition. However, war delayed the printing and ultimately caused the destruction of all materials. In the 1950s, the second book was reconstructed in the 1950s by Professor F. Otto of the University of Gdansk using the surviving manuscript and the printer's proofs which Teubner had sent for Bartel's approval. It dealt with analyzing pictures geometrically, artistic reconstruction of geometry exhibited in pictures, and tracing art history using tenets of his theory of perspective. A uniform series was released by Polskie Wydawnictwo Naukowe, the second book in 1958 and the first volume in 1960.[6]/nHe was decorated with, among others, the Order of the White Eagle (1932) for outstanding achievements, the French Legion of Honour (class I), the Cross of Valour, the Cross of Independence and the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari (1922).", "34327454": "Giulio Benedetto Isacco Vivanti (24 May 1859 \u2013 19 November 1949) was an Italian mathematician.

He later changed his name to Liu Xiu (Chinese: \u5289\u79c0) due to the naming taboo of Emperor Ai of Han. He was the son of Imperial librarian Liu Xiang and an associate of other eminent thinkers such as the philosopher Huan Tan.[1] Liu was a prominent supporter of the Old Text classics./nLiu Xin was the son of Confucian scholar Liu Xiang (77 \u2013 6 BCE). Liu was a distant relative of Liu Bang, the founder of the Han dynasty, and was thus a member of the ruling dynastic clan (the Liu family). Liu Xin's paternal grandfather ranked as a hou (\u4faf, roughly \"marquess\").[2] As a young man, Liu helped his father in cataloguing the contents of the imperial library, and his friendship with the well-connected minister Wang Mang brought him power and rewards,[3] rising under Emperor Ai of Han to the rank of Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Imperial Equipages (\u4f8d\u4e2d\u5949\u8eca\u90fd\u5c09).[4]:\u200a763/nAs a curator of the imperial library he was the first to establish a library classification system and the first book notation system. At this time the library catalog was written on scrolls of fine silk and stored in silk bags.[5] Liu Xin's Qil\u00fce (\u4e03\u7565; \"Seven Surveys\") has not survived, but it formed the basis for the later bibliographic treatise Yiwenzhi (\u85dd\u6587\u5fd7; \"Treatise on Arts and Letters\") in the Book of Han,[4]:\u200a764\u200a which acted as a model for later imperial bibliographies./nAs the imperial librarian, Liu Xin both catalogued and annotated or edited ancient texts. These projects of his produced what became definitive texts of a number of orthodox canons of Chinese philosophy and history./nLiu Xin played an important role in the transmission of the Zuozhuan. A scholar of the Old Texts school, he was attracted to the Zuozhuan's earlier graphical forms, whose inaccessibility deterred the compound exegesis found in the rival Chunqiu commentarial traditions.[6] In editing the Zuozhuan with the assistance of Yin Xian (\u5c39\u54b8), Liu rearranged the material into chronological order to map more neatly onto the Chunqiu chronicle as the Gongyang and Guliang commentaries did.[7] He aimed to have an imperial academician assigned to the work, a crucial bureaucratic step towards canonization in the official orthodoxy.[3]/nLiu's advocacy for the Zuozhuan was controversial in his own day, partly due to its lineage and prior reputation, and partly due to his own approach towards the situation.[8] This scholarly dispute is sometimes taken as evidence for a larger dispute about classic texts written using variant scripts./nDuring Liu Xin's career, there may have been some debate about certain texts called guwen (\u53e4\u6587, \"Ancient Script Texts\"). One set of manuscripts discovered by Kong Anguo in the Western Han was consistently labeled as guwen owing to the graphical forms it preserved, a script which had diverged during the Eastern Zhou from the more conservative script of the state of Qin which became the official and only standard following their unification in 221 BCE. As a consequence of the variant graphical forms, parts of the text were already difficult to decipher for Han scholars./nIt is not clear to what extent the content of guwen works differed from the transmitted versions of the same titles, nor what criteria allowed for labeling a document guwen. It may have been the case that even a handful of words would suffice to impart this characteristic upon the text that contained them.[9]/nLiu Xin was attracted to guwen texts, and his position in the imperial library meant he was well placed to ensure that these versions would officially be considered the authoritative ones.[10]:\u200a212\u2013213/nFrom the 19th through early 20th centuries, antiquarians and historians, beginning with Kang Youwei, accused Liu of excessive editing, to the point of falsifying historical texts.[11]:\u200a136\u200a These criticisms were systematically analysed by the Doubting Antiquity School of historians. According to their theory, first articulated by Qian Mu in 1930,[12] Liu edited ancient texts for political purposes, particularly the Rites of Zhou, the Zuozhuan,[13]:\u200a49\u200a and the Mao commentary to the Shijing.[14] This accusation of forgery had legitimate precedent: in the late 17th century Yan Ruoqu demonstrated that the transmitted Classic of History was mostly a forgery dating to the 4th century. This text had been based on the Ancient Script version, and only the parts that were present in the separately transmitted New Script version could be considered authentically early.[15]/nLiu Xin was a political ally of the powerful and divisive minister Wang Mang, who would go on to usurp the Han dynasty around the turn of the millennium for a brief period known as the Xin dynasty. As the imperial librarian, Liu had the power to establish the definitive redactions of ancient texts and expunge variant versions. According to his accusers, the librarian falsified accounts of ancient historical events,[16] and inserted into the legendary lineage of ancient rulers figures or relationships that were either invented, or borrowed from separate legends. In this way, he created a narrative of ancient rulers and successive dynasties which satisfied the \"five phases\" theory, wherein each ruler and/or dynasty represented one of the five traditional Chinese elements, between which the Mandate of Heaven rotated. An account thus falsified would satisfactorily explain the rule of the Han and Xin dynasties in terms of the phases they were said to represent, and according to the forgery theory, Liu Xin's edited account conveniently showed a series of successions between various claimed ancestors of the Han and Xin houses./nThe possibility of Liu Xin's forgeries became a crucial question for the Doubting Antiquity School in their search for a rationalist past for China.[17]:\u200a152\u200a They drew evidence from discrepancies between the texts edited by Liu and earlier or contemporaneous texts. For example, figures or events appearing in Liu's edited versions did not appear in earlier or contemporaneous texts. The forgery theory has been largely discredited.[13]:\u200a49/nFor centuries before the usurpation of Wang Mang (r.\u2009 9\u201323), the Chinese had used the value of 3 for their calculation of pi,[18] the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Some time between the years 1 and 5, Liu Xin was the first Chinese researcher to give a geometrical figure which implies the improved approximation \u03c0 \u2248 3.1547,[19] although the exact method he used to reach this figure is unknown.[20] The original jialiang hu standard Liu Xin designed and used in his measurements is still extant.[21] British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham inspected it in Beijing, describing it as follows:/nThe standardised chia liang hu (has) a square with each side 1 chhih (foot) long, and outside it a circle. The distance from each corner of the square to the circle (thiao phang) is 9 li 5 hao. The area of the circle (mu) is 162 (square) tshun (inches), the depth 1 chhih (foot), and the volume (of the whole) 1620 (cubic) tshun (inches).[20]/nLater early Chinese mathematicians such as Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) and Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century) would improve Liu's calculation for pi,[22] and were improved upon in turn by Zu Chongzhi (429\u2013500)./nAs Emperor of Xin, Wang Mang attempted to return to the lost ways of the ancient sage-kings, a golden age of order and peace. Assisting him in some of the practicalities of this ambition was Liu Xin. Upon ascending the throne, Wang Mang named Liu Xin his Guoshi (\u570b\u5e2b, \"Professor Laureate\"), a newly created office which was one of the Four Viziers (\u56db\u8f14, named after a legend about a constellation), the most powerful and exalted ministers in the empire. As part of the rebranding schema implemented across the government, Liu Xin gained the noble title \"Eminence of New Excellence\" (\u5609\u65b0\u516c).[23] He assisted in standardising the measures of liquid volume and the harmonic frequencies of musical instruments. The jialiang hu used to calculate pi was designed as the standard for the five measures of liquid volume stipulated by statute, and was constructed with a separate compartment for each of them.[24]/nIn the course of his scientific work, Liu wrote a treatise which  survives in the Book of Han: L\u00fcli zhi (\u5f8b\u66c6\u5fd7, \"Treatise on Standards and Calendrics\").[25] This text records detailed information about Han dynasty mathematics, measures of length and volume, harmonics, weights and balances, and the calendar via wuxing theory.[26]/nAs a classicist, Liu Xin was able to support the legitimation of his patron Wang Mang as a restorer of an ancient mode of governance,[27] and as a proponent and theorist of the \"generative cycle\" of the popular \"five phases\" theory,[28]:\u200a569\u200a Liu advised the new emperor on ritual matters to better accord with these fundamental essences.[29] Liu additionally developed a new more accurate model of astronomy, the Triple Concordance calendar (\u4e09\u7d71\u6b77; San tong li), for predicting the motion of heavenly bodies.[30] In the second half of the 20th century, a crater on Mars was named in his honor.[31]/nAlthough Liu Xin was originally a loyal partisan of Wang Mang, after Wang's troops suffered defeat on July 7, 23 at the Battle of Kunyang, Liu Xin plotted with others to overthrow Wang Mang. The plot was discovered, and all the conspirators committed suicide or were executed.[32]", "57330594": "NSF CAREER Award (2014)\nSIAM Control and Systems Theory Prize (2011)/nMichael Charles Rotkowitz (born 1974) is an applied mathematician best known for his work in decentralized control theory.

Catherine's will was proved at London in March 1752.[6]  Nicolas himself was never married.[5][4]/nNicolas Fatio received his elementary schooling at the Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve, proceeding in 1678 to the Acad\u00e9mie de Gen\u00e8ve (now the University of Geneva), where he remained until 1680.[5]  At the Academy he came under the influence of the rector, Jean-Robert Chouet, a prominent Cartesian.[3] Before he was eighteen, Fatio wrote to the director of the Paris Observatory, the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, suggesting a new method of determining the distances to the Sun and Moon from the Earth, as well as an explanation of the form of the rings of Saturn.  With Chouet's support, Fatio travelled to Paris in the spring of 1682 and was warmly received by Cassini.[5]/nThat same year, Cassini presented his findings on the astronomical phenomenon of zodiacal light.  Fatio repeated Cassini's observations in Geneva in 1684, and in 1685 he offered an important development of Cassini's theory, which was communicated by Chouet in the March 1685 number of Nouvelles de la r\u00e9publique des lettres.[3] Fatio's own Lettre \u00e0 M. Cassini touchant une lumi\u00e8re extraordinaire qui paro\u00eet dans le Ciel depuis quelques ann\u00e9es (\"Letter to Mr. Cassini concerning the extraordinary light that has appeared in the Heavens for some years\") was published in Amsterdam in 1686.  There Fatio correctly explained the zodiacal light as sunlight scattered by an interplanetary dust cloud (the \"zodiacal cloud\") that straddles the ecliptic plane./nFatio then studied the dilatation and contraction of the eye's pupil.  He described the fibres of the anterior uvea and the choroid in a letter to Edme Mariotte, dated 13 April 1684.  That same year he published an article in the Journal des s\u00e7avans on how to improve the fabrication of lenses for the objectives of telescopes.[7]/nAlso in 1684, Fatio met the Piedmontese Count Fenil, who, having offended the Duke of Savoy and the King of France, had taken refuge in the house of Fatio's maternal grandfather in Alsace and then at Duillier. Fenil confided to Fatio his plan to stage a raid on the beach at Scheveningen to kidnap the Dutch Prince William of Orange.[5] Fenil showed Fatio a letter from the Marquis de Louvois, the French Secretary of State, approving of the kidnapping, offering the king's pardon as recompense for the successful completion of the operation, and enclosing an order for money. Fatio betrayed Fenil's plot to Gilbert Burnet, whom he then accompanied to Holland in 1686 to warn Prince William.[3]/nIn Holland, Fatio met Christiaan Huygens, with whom he began to collaborate on mathematical problems concerning the new infinitesimal calculus.  Encouraged by Huygens, Fatio compiled a list of corrections to the published works on differentiation by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus.[3] The Dutch authorities wished to reward Fatio, whose mathematical abilities Huygens vouched for, with a professorship.[4] While those plans were delayed, Fatio received permission to visit England in the spring of 1687./nFatio arrived in England in June 1687, carrying with him the conviction that the two greatest living natural philosophers were Robert Boyle, \"for the details of his experiments concerning earthly bodies\", and Christiaan Huygens \"for physics in general, above all in those areas in which it is involved with mathematics.\"[8] Fatio hoped to procure Boyle's patronage,[3] and in London he soon made the acquaintance of John Wallis, John Locke, Richard Hampden, and his son John Hampden, among other important figures connected with the Whig party./nFatio worked out new solutions of the \"inverse tangent problem\" (i.e., the solution of ordinary differential equations) and was introduced to the Royal Society by Henri Justel.[5] He began to attend Society's meetings in June of that year, thus learning of the upcoming publication of Newton's Principia.  In the winter of 1687 Fatio went to the University of Oxford, where he collaborated with Edward Bernard, the Savilian Professor of Astronomy, in an investigation into the units of measurement used in the ancient world.[4]/nAged only 24, Fatio was elected fellow of the Royal Society on 2 May 1688.[5] That year, Fatio gave an account of Huygens's mechanical explanation of gravitation before the Royal Society, in which he tried to connect Huygens' theory with Isaac Newton's work on universal gravitation.[3] Fatio's personal prospects seemed to brighten even further as a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688\u20139, which marked the ascendancy of the Whigs and culminated with Parliament deposing the Catholic King James II and giving the English throne jointly to James's Protestant daughter Mary and to her husband, the Dutch Prince William of Orange.[4] Fatio also had an opportunity to enhance his intellectual reputation during Huygen's visit to London in the summer of 1689.[5]/nFatio met Newton, probably for the first time, at a meeting of the Royal Society on 12 June 1689.  Newton and Fatio soon became friends and Newton even suggested that the two share rooms in London while Newton attended the post-Revolutionary session of Parliament, to which he had been elected as member for the University of Cambridge.[3] In 1690, Fatio wrote to Huygens outlining his own understanding of the physical cause of gravity, which would later become known as \"Le Sage's theory of gravitation\".[7][9][10]  Soon after that, he read his letter to Huygens before the Royal Society. Fatio's theory, on which he continued to work until his death, is based on minute particles streaming through space and pushing upon gross bodies, an idea that Fatio probably derived in part from his successful explanation of zodiacal light as sunlight scattered by a cloud of fine dust surrounding the Sun.[5]/nFatio turned down Newton's offer to reside in Cambridge as his assistant, seeking instead academic preferment in the Netherlands.[5] In the spring of 1690 he traveled to The Hague as tutor to two of John Hampden's nephews.[5] There, Fatio shared with Huygens a list that he had compiled of errata to Newton's Principia.  Fatio and Huygens collaborated on problems relating to differential equations, gravity, and optics.  At this time, Huygens shared with Gottfried Leibniz some of Fatio's work on differential equations.  Fatio returned to London in September 1691, following the death of one of his pupils.[3] He vied unsuccessfully for the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy at Oxford, a post that had been left vacant by the death of his friend Edward Bernard.[4]/nFatio convinced Newton to write a new treatise on a general method of integration, De quadratura curvarum.[3] Initially, he also expected to collaborate with Newton on a new edition of the Principia that would include Fatio's mechanical explanation of gravity.  By the end of 1691, Fatio realised that Newton would not proceed with that project, but he still hoped to collaborate with Newton on corrections to the text of the Principia.[4] In a letter to Huygens, Fatio wrote, concerning those corrections, \"I may possibly undertake it myself, as I know no one who so well and thoroughly understands a good part of this book as I do.\"[11]/nAs a result of reading Newton's De quadratura curvarum, Fatio became convinced that Newton had for some time had a complete understanding of the differential and integral calculus, rendering Fatio's own mathematical discoveries superfluous.  He reported as much to Huygens in 1692.[3] In 1696, Johann Bernoulli, a close ally of Leibniz, posed the brachistochrone problem as a challenge to the mathematicians who claimed to understand the new calculus.  The problem was solved by Leibniz, Tschirnhaus, L'H\u00f4pital, Jacob Bernoulli, and Newton.  In 1699, Fatio published Line\u00e6 brevissim\u00e6 descensus investigatio geometrica duplex, cui addita est investigatio geometrica solidi rotundi in quo minima fiat resistentia (\"A two-fold geometrical investigation of the line of briefest descent, to which is added a geometric investigation of the solid of revolution that produces the minimum resistance\"), a pamphlet containing his own solutions to the brachistochrone and to another problem, treated by Newton in book II of the Principia (see Newton's minimal resistance problem), in what is now called the \"calculus of variations\"./nIn his book, Fatio drew attention to his own original work on the calculus from 1687, while stressing Newton's absolute priority and questioning the claims of Leibniz and his followers.[4]/nI recognize that Newton was the first and by many years the most senior inventor of this calculus: whether Leibniz, the second inventor, borrowed anything from him, I prefer that the judgment be not mine, but theirs who have seen Newton's letters and his other manuscripts.  Nor will the silence of the more modest Newton, or the active exertions of Leibniz in everywhere ascribing the invention of the calculus to himself, impose upon any person who examines these papers as I have done./nThis provoked angry responses from Johann Bernoulli and Leibniz in the Acta Eruditorum.  Leibniz stressed that Newton himself had admitted in his Principia to Leibniz's independent discovery of the calculus.[13] Fatio's reply to his critics was finally published, in abbreviated form, in 1701.[5] Fatio also corresponded on the history of calculus and on his own theory of gravity with Jacob Bernoulli, by then estranged from his brother Johann.[4] Fatio's writings on the history of the calculus are often cited as precursors to the bitter priority dispute that would erupt between Newton and Leibniz in the 1710s, after the Scottish mathematician John Keill effectively accused Leibniz of plagiarism.[14]/nIn the 1690s, Fatio discovered a method for piercing a small and well-rounded hole in a ruby, using a diamond drill.  Such pierced rubies can serve as jewel bearings in mechanical watches, reducing the friction and corrosion of the watch's internal mechanism, and thereby improving both accuracy and working life.  Fatio sought unsuccessfully to interest Parisian watchmakers in his invention.[15] Back in London, Fatio partnered with the Huguenot brothers Peter and Jacob Debaufre (or \"de Beaufr\u00e9\"), who kept a successful watchmaking shop in Church Street, Soho.[16] In 1704, Fatio and the Debaufres obtained a fourteen-year patent (no. 371) for the sole use in England of Fatio's invention relating to rubies.[5] They later attempted unsuccessfully to have the patent extended to \"the sole applying [of] precious and more common stones in Clocks and Watches\".[15][17]/nIn March 1705, Fatio exhibited specimens of watches thus jewelled to the Royal Society.[5] The correspondence of Isaac Newton shows that in 1717 Fatio agreed to make a watch for Richard Bentley in exchange for a payment of \u00a315, and that in 1724 he sought permission from Newton to use Newton's name in advertising his jewelled watches.[18] Fatio's method for piercing rubies remained a speciality of English watchmaking until it was adopted in the Continent in 1768 by Ferdinand Berthoud.[19] Jewel bearings are still used today in luxury mechanical watches./nModern historian of alchemy William R. Newman regards Fatio as Newton's principal alchemical collaborator during Newton's long career in that field.[20]  Newton and Fatio corresponded extensively on alchemy between 1689 and 1694.  Both men were primarily interested in chrysopoeia and the deciphering of recipes for the preparation of the philosopher's stone that circulated privately within circles of alchemical adepts.  They were also interested in the preparation of medical remedies.  Fatio acted as an intermediary between Newton and a Huguenot (French-speaking) alchemist living in London. Modern scholars have tentatively identified this Huguenot alchemist as M. de Tegny, a captain in the infantry regiment led by Colonel Fran\u00e7ois Dupuy de Cambon, which fought with William III in Flanders during the Nine Years' War.[21]/nBy the summer of 1694, Fatio was employed as a tutor to Wriothesley Russell, the heir of the Duke of Bedford, a position for which he had been recommended by Locke.[4] Fatio accompanied his pupil to Oxford and, during 1697\u20138, to Holland.[4]  Fatio was in Switzerland in 1699, 1700, and 1701.[22]  In Duillier he was reconciled to his father and collaborated with his brother Jean-Christophe in surveying the mountains around Lac L\u00e9man.  At this time Fatio began a deep study of the prophetic books in the Bible.[5]/nBack in London, Fatio worked as a mathematical tutor in Spitalfields.  In 1706, he began to associate with the Camisards, radical Protestant exiles (\"Huguenots\") who had fled from France during the Wars of Religion in that country.[5]  Fatio became attached to a millenarian group known as the \"French prophets\", who preached impending destruction and judgment.  In 1707, \u00c9lie Marion, Jean Daud\u00e9, and Fatio were tried before the Queen's Bench on charges brought against them by the mainstream Huguenot churches in London.  This prosecution for sedition was backed by the British government, which suspected the French prophets of contriving a political scheme./nMarion, Daud\u00e9, and Fatio were convicted of sedition and sentenced to the pillory. On 2 December, Fatio stood on a scaffold at Charing Cross with an inscription on his hat that read/nNicolas Fatio convicted for abetting and favouring Elias Marion, in the Wicked and counterfeit prophecies, and causing them to be printed and published, to terrify the Queen's people.[7]/nBy the influence of the Duke of Ormonde, to whose brother, Lord Arran, Fatio had been tutor, he was protected from the violence of the mob.[4]/nFatio was among those who believed in the prophecy that Thomas Emes would be raised from the dead, attracting ridicule and condemnation even from his own brother.  In 1711 Fatio travelled to Berlin, Halle, and Vienna as a missionary of the French prophets.  A second mission in 1712\u201313 took him to Stockholm, Prussia, Halle, Constantinople, Smyrna, and Rome.[4]  Fatio then moved to Holland, where he wrote accounts of his missions and of the prophecies delivered during them.  Some of these accounts, in French and Latin, were published in 1714.[5]/nBack in London, Fatio once again communicated with the Royal Society, of which his old friend Sir Isaac Newton had been president since 1704.  In 1717 Fatio presented a series of papers on the precession of the equinoxes and climate change, subjects that he regarded from both a scientific and a millenarian perspective.[5]  In the spring of that same year he moved to Worcester, where he formed some congenial friendships and busied himself with scientific pursuits, alchemy, and study of the cabbala.  Fatio would spend the rest of his life in Worcester and nearby Madresfield./nAfter the death of Isaac Newton in 1727, Fatio composed a poetic hymn (eclogue) on Newton's genius, written in Latin and published in 1728.  According to modern Newton scholar Robert Iliffe, this is \"the most interesting poetic response to Newton\".[23]/nIn 1732, Fatio collaborated with Newton's nephew-in-law and executor, John Conduitt, in the design of the funerary monument to Newton in Westminster Abbey, and in composing the inscription for it.[23]  At that time, Fatio also sought Conduitt's help in his effort (which was ultimately unsuccessful) to obtain a belated reward for having saved the Prince of Orange from Count Fenil's kidnapping plot.  Fatio also unsuccessfully sought Conduitt's support for the publication of his \"push-shadow\" theory of gravity, on which he had been working for more than forty years.[23]/nFatio died on either 28 April or 12 May 1753[24] in Madresfield, at the age of 89.  He was buried at the church of St Nicholas, Worcester,[25] now deconsecrated. His compatriot Georges-Louis Le Sage later purchased many of his scientific papers which, together with those of Le Sage, are now in the Geneva Library./nThroughout his long life Fatio proposed and developed various technological innovations.  Undoubtedly the most significant of these was the jewel bearing, still used today in the manufacture of luxury mechanical watches.  But Fatio's efforts as an inventor extended into many areas beyond watchmaking./nTo optimise the capture of solar energy and thereby increase agricultural yields, Fatio suggested building sloping fruit walls, precisely angled to maximize the collection of heat from sunlight. Having supervised the building of such walls in Belvoir Castle, in 1699 he published an illustrated treatise that described his invention and included theoretical considerations about solar radiation.[5]  That work appeared with the imprimatur of the Royal Society.[26]  Fatio also proposed a tracking mechanism that could pivot to follow the Sun.[27]  Such ideas were superseded by the development of modern greenhouses./nOne must add to the catalogue of Fatio's inventions his early work on improving the grinding of lenses for the objectives of telescopes, as well as his later proposals for taking advantage of a ship's motion to grind corn, saw, raise anchors, and hoist rigging.  He also contrived a ship's observatory and measured the height of the mountains surrounding Geneva, planning, but never completing, a detailed map of Lac L\u00e9man./nFatio considered that his greatest work was his explanation of Newtonian gravity in terms of collisions between ordinary matter and aetherial corpuscles moving rapidly in all directions.[7]  Fatio was motivated by Huygens's earlier work on a \"mechanical\" explanation of gravity in terms of contact interactions between ordinary matter and an aether,[29] and perhaps also by the success of his explanation of zodiacal light as sunlight scattered by an interplanetary cloud of fine particles.[5]  The need to make the collisions between ordinary matter and the aetherial corpuscles inelastic implied that Fatio's aetherial corpuscles must also exert a drag resistance on the motion of celestial bodies.  Fatio therefore failed to interest Huygens (who believed in the conservation of vis viva) in his proposal.[30]  Huygens may also have found Fatio's theory uncongenial because it assumed an empty space in which the aetherial corpuscles moved, a view contrary to the plenism of Huygens and Leibniz, who conceived of the aether as a fluid pervading all of space.[29]/nFinding that the drag resistance was proportional to the product of the speed and the density of the aetherial corpuscles, while the gravitational attraction was proportional to the density and the square of the speed of the corpuscles, Fatio concluded that the drag could be made negligible by decreasing the density while increasing the speed.[29]  However, despite some initial enthusiasm on the part of Newton and Halley, Fatio's theory of gravity soon fell into oblivion and Newton abandoned all attempts to explain gravity in terms of contact interactions.[30]/nFatio corresponded about his theory with Jacob Bernoulli in 1700 and he continued to revise and promote his theory until the end of his life, but he never published that work.[29]  A copy of Fatio's manuscript came to the attention of the Genevan mathematician Gabriel Cramer, who in 1731 published a dissertation containing a summary of Fatio's theory, without attribution.[29]  Another Genevan, Georges-Louis Le Sage, independently re-discovered the same idea before Cramer introduced him to Fatio's work in 1749.[29]  Since then, the corresponding theory has been commonly known as \"Le Sage's theory of gravitation\"./nThe success of the kinetic theory of gases contributed to reviving interest in the Fatio-Le Sage theory during the second half of the 19th century.  In 1878, James Clerk Maxwell characterized it as \"the only theory of the cause of gravitation which has been so far developed as to be capable of being attacked and defended.\"[31]  Another leading physicist who took this theory seriously was Nobel laureate J. J. Thomson.[32]/nFatio's account of his gravitational theory finally published in 1929, in an edition prepared by the German historian of mathematics Karl Bopp,[28] and then again independently in 1949 by Bernard Gagnebin, the conservator of manuscripts at the Geneva Library.[7][9]  Even though the modern scientific consensus is that the Fatio-Le Sage theory is inviable as an account of gravity, the process that he described does give rise to an attractive inverse-square force between particles immersed in a rare medium at a higher temperature. George Gamow proposed in 1949 that such a \"mock gravity\" could have played a role in galaxy formation after the Big Bang.[33]   A. M. Ignatov showed in 1996 that a similar process produces an attraction between dust grains in a dusty plasma.[34]/nThe Genevan naturalist Jean Senebier, writing thirty years after Fatio's death, declared that/nThis man who was the friend of Newton, of Huygens, of Jacob Bernoulli; who learned from Newton the infinitesimal calculus and who taught it to De Moivre; who, after having been linked to Leibniz and Johann Bernoulli, crossed them by taking sides against Leibniz in his dispute over the invention of the higher calculus.  This man, illustrious in his many titles, is hardly known today in the Republic of Letters, or at least he is not cited anywhere, nor named in the history of the sciences that he so advantageously cultivated./nTwo scholarly biographies of Isaac Newton published in the 20th century, Frank E. Manuel's A Portrait of Isaac Newton (1968) and Richard S. Westfall's Never at Rest (1980) considered at length the personal relationship between Fatio and Newton.  Manuel and Westfall both suggested that there might have been a sentimental or sexual element to the attachment between both men,[35][36] and that Newton's nervous breakdown in 1693 might have been connected with a rupture in that relationship.[37][38]  A similar interpretation appears in Michael White's popular biography Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer (1997).[39]  On the other hand, historian Scott Mandelbrote writes:/nI see no merit in [Manuel\u2019s and Westfall\u2019s] suggestion that Newton\u2019s behaviour in 1693 might be due to developments in his relationship with Fatio, nor in the view that their friendship was based on sexual attraction, whether consummated or unconsummated [...] This interpretation is based largely on the exaggeration of Newton\u2019s comments in a single letter.[40]/nMandelbrote's judgment has found support in later work by professional historians specializing on Newton, including Robert Iliffe[3] and William R. Newman.[20]  According to Newman,/nAny attempt to link Newton\u2019s \"derangement\" to a precipitous break with Fatio around the time of the letters to Pepys and Locke can no longer be countenanced. In fact, one cannot avoid the suspicion that previous writers on Newton may have overdramatized both his reaction to Fatio and his strange behavior of 1693.[41]/nFatio's connection with Newton has been treated in several works of historical fiction.  He appears as a supporting character in Michael White's novel Equinox (2006), in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle (2003\u201304), and in Gregory Keyes's novel series The Age of Unreason (1998\u20132001)./nFatio was the author of the following works, published in book form during his lifetime:/nWith Jean Allut, Elie Marion, and other of the \"French prophets\", Fatio issued a prophecy with the title Plan de la Justice de Dieu sur la terre dans ces derniers jours et du rel\u00e9vement de la ch\u00fbte de l'homme par son p\u00e9ch\u00e9 (\"Plan of God's Justice upon the earth in these last days, and of the release of man's fall by his sin\") 2 parts, 8vo, 1714, of which a Latin version appeared during the same year./nIn periodicals Fatio published the following works:/nFatio also contributed articles on astronomy and ancient Hebrew units of measurement to nearly every number of the Gentleman's Magazine for 1737\u201338./nUpon his death, Fatio left a number of manuscripts, some of which passed into the hands of Dr. James Johnstone of Kidderminster.  Others were acquired by Prof. Georges-Louis Le Sage of Geneva, who amassed a large collection of Fatio's letters, now at the Biblioth\u00e8que de Gen\u00e8ve.[7]  A few of Fatio's papers and letters are in the British Library. Among them is a Latin poem entitled N. Facii Duellerii Auriacus Throno-servatus (\"N. Fatio de Duillier's Orange Throne Preserved\", Addit. MS. 4163), containing a narrative of Count Fenil's plot against Prince William of Orange, as well as a description of Fatio's jewelled watches. A series of letters to Sir Hans Sloane (ib. 4044) extend from 1714 to 1736. Other letters of his are in fasciculus 2 of C. Hugenii aliorumque seculi xvii. virorum celebrium Exercitationes Mathematic\u00e6 et Philosophic\u00e6, 4to, the Hague, 1833./nSome of Fatio's letters were included in the correspondence volumes of the Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes (\"Complete Works\") of Christiaan Huygens (published between 1888 and 1950 by the Dutch Academy of Sciences) and in The Correspondence of Isaac Newton (published between 1959 and 1977 by the Royal Society).  Fatio's treatise describing his work on the push-shadow theory of gravity circulated during his lifetime only as a manuscript.  That work was published, long after his death, in two independent scholarly editions:/nEven though it appeared twenty years earlier, Bopp's edition of Fatio's manuscript is the more complete of the two./nThe full Latin text of Fatio's 1728 eclogue on Newton, along with an English translation and commentary, was published in:", "2182070": "Jacob Theodore \"Jack\" Schwartz (January 9, 1930 \u2013 March 2, 2009)[1] was an American mathematician, computer scientist, and professor of computer science at the New York University Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

He tried to propound the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus without, in his writings, openly breaking with the scholastic tradition. He wrote on the astronomical findings of Galileo Galilei, but without directly endorsing them or attacking the classical cosmology.[2]  Nevertheless, these were radical steps, and the scientific community he headed in Mexico accepted them about 30 years before their colleagues in Spain. One reason for this surprising difference is that the books of modern science originating in Protestant countries were refused entry into Spain by the censors. Booksellers, in order not to lose their investments, often sent the contraband books on to America. Because of this aspect of Rodriguez's work, he was a target of Mexican Inquisition.[3]/nRodr\u00edguez was at the center of a small circle of intellectuals that met semiclandestinely in private homes to discuss the new ideas. The 1640s, however, brought them to the attention of the Inquisition. A series of investigations and trials followed, continuing into the mid-1650s. A frantic hiding of books followed the Inquisition's 1647 edict imposing careful censorship on scientific works. In July 1655 the Inquisition required all Mexico City's booksellers (six) to submit their book lists to the Holy Office for approval, on pain of fine and excommunication.[4]/nMelchor P\u00e9rez de Soto, one of the group of scientific modernizers headed by Diego Rodr\u00edguez and chief architect at the cathedral, was subjected to the Inquisition. Thanks to this process, a catalog of his library, more than 1,660 volumes, has come down to us. Many of the works dealt with the modern science of contemporary Europe; many others had more traditional content./nBBC Rodr\u00edguez wrote many works, some of them truly revolutionary contributions to mathematics (like his treatise on logarithms), astronomy and engineering. He also wrote treatises on technology, such as the one dealing with the construction of precise clocks. Many of these works were developed for his own courses in the university; others were written to support his own investigations. In the latter category is the report on the prediction and exact measurement of eclipses, which is fundamental for calculation of exact geographic positions (longitude), because the eclipse permits synchronization of the time with that in other geographic localities. This and his work on the improvement of clocks allowed him to measure the longitude of Mexico City with a precision greater than Alexander von Humboldt was able to make a century and a half later, even with improved methods. Rodr\u00edguez's Peruvian student and correspondent, Francisco Ruiz Lozano, used the samtechnique to measure the position of his birthplace, Lima, Peru./nIt is strange that the many valuable contributions of Rodr\u00edguez and his students did not make a bigger impact on the history of the colony. His methods of calculating positions were not used by Spanish navigators, who could have benefited greatly from them. Most of his writings were never published, remaining in manuscript. In New Spain it was difficult to print them, not only because of high costs but also because special type faces were unavailable, for example, for mathematical symbols. And there was no market for the published works. For that reason some of his manuscripts were sent to Spain, but there was no greater interest there and they were ignored. At his death in 1668, most of his manuscripts were buried in the library of his order; the rest were dispersed in private collections or were irretrievably lost./nRodr\u00edguez's successors in the chair of astronomy and mathematics occupied the position only briefly, and are of little interest, up until Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora took over the position in 1672./nThis article is a free translation of the article at the Spanish Wikipedia, accessed on July 13, 2007, with a little additional information.", "58510274": "Sidney Martin Webster (born 12 November 1945 in Danville, Illinois) is an American mathematician, specializing in multidimensional complex analysis.[1]/nAfter military service, Webster attended the University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate and then as a graduate student, receiving a PhD in 1975 under the supervision of Shiing-Shen Chern[1] with thesis Real hypersurfaces in complex space.[2] Webster was a faculty member at Princeton University from 1975 to 1980 and at the University of Minnesota from 1980 to 1989.

Since his knowledge of mathematics was self-taught and he did not belong to any mathematical organizations, he likely pursued mathematics as a hobby rather than a profession./nArgand moved to Paris in 1806 with his family and, when managing a bookshop there, privately published his Essai sur une mani\u00e8re de repr\u00e9senter les quantit\u00e9s imaginaires dans les constructions g\u00e9om\u00e9triques (Essay on a method of representing imaginary quantities). In 1813, it was republished in the French journal Annales de Math\u00e9matiques. The Essay discussed a method of graphing complex numbers via analytical geometry. It proposed the interpretation of the value i as a rotation of 90 degrees in the Argand plane. In this essay he was also the first to propose the idea of modulus to indicate the magnitude of vectors and complex numbers, as well as the notation for vectors \n\n\n\n\n\n\na\nb\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {ab}}}\n\n. The topic of complex numbers was also being studied by other mathematicians, notably Carl Friedrich Gauss and Caspar Wessel.  Wessel's 1799 paper on a similar graphing technique did not attract attention./nArgand is also renowned for delivering a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra in his 1814 work R\u00e9flexions sur la nouvelle th\u00e9orie d'analyse (Reflections on the new theory of analysis). It was the first complete and rigorous proof of the theorem, and was also the first proof to generalize the fundamental theorem of algebra to include polynomials with complex coefficients./nThe first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was Cauchy's Cours d'analyse de l'\u00c9cole Royale Polytechnique (1821). It contained Argand's proof, although Argand is not credited for it. And the proof was later referenced in Chrystal's influential textbook Algebra./nArgand died of an unknown cause on August 13, 1822, in Paris. In 1978 his proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra was called by The Mathematical Intelligencer \u201cboth ingenious and profound.\u201d", "34196465": "Harry Pollard (28 February 1919 \u2013 November 20, 1985)[1] was an American mathematician.

This was studied by Clint McCrory in his 1972 Brandeis thesis following a suggestion of Dennis Sullivan that one make \"a general study of the Zeeman spectral sequence to see how singularities in a space perturb Poincar\u00e9 duality\".

He was especially active encouraging the application of mathematics, and catastrophe theory in particular, to biology and behavioral sciences./nZeeman was born in Japan to a Danish father, Christian Zeeman, and a British mother. They moved to England one year after his birth. After being educated at Christ's Hospital in Horsham, West Sussex, he served as a Flying Officer with the Royal Air Force from 1943 to 1947.[2] He studied mathematics at Christ's College, Cambridge, but had forgotten much of his school mathematics while serving for the air force. He received an MA and PhD (the latter under the supervision of Shaun Wylie) from the University of Cambridge, and became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College where he tutored David Fowler and John Horton Conway.[3]/nZeeman is one of the founders of engulfing theory in piecewise linear topology and is credited with working out the engulfing theorem (independently also worked out by John Stallings), which can be used to prove the piecewise linear version of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture for all dimensions above four.[4][5]/nAfter working at Cambridge (during which he spent a year abroad at University of Chicago and Princeton as a Harkness Fellow) and the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, he founded the Mathematics Department and Mathematics Research Centre at the new University of Warwick in 1964. In his own words/nZeeman's style of leadership was informal, but inspirational, and he rapidly took Warwick to international recognition for the quality of its mathematical research. The first six appointments he made were all in topology, enabling the department to immediately become internationally competitive, followed by six in algebra, and finally six in analysis and six in applied mathematics. He was able to trade four academic appointments for funding that enabled PhD students to give undergraduate supervisions in groups of two for the first two years, in a manner similar to the tutorial system at Oxford and Cambridge.  He remained at Warwick until 1988, but from 1966 to 1967 he was a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, after which his research turned to dynamical systems, inspired by many of the world leaders in this field, including Stephen Smale and Ren\u00e9 Thom, who both spent time at Warwick. In 1963, Zeeman showed that that causality in special relativity expressed by preservation of partial ordering is given exactly and only by the Lorentz transforms.[7] Zeeman subsequently spent a sabbatical with Thom at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques in Paris, where he became interested in catastrophe theory. On his return to Warwick, he taught an undergraduate course in Catastrophe Theory that became immensely popular with students; his lectures generally were \"standing room only\". In 1973 he gave an MSc course at Warwick giving a complete detailed proof of Thom's classification of elementary catastrophes, mainly following an unpublished manuscript, \"Right-equivalence\" written by John Mather at Warwick in 1969. David Trotman wrote up his notes of the course as an MSc thesis. These were then distributed in thousands of copies throughout the world and published both in the proceedings of a 1975 Seattle conference on catastrophe theory and its applications,[8] and in a 1977 collection of papers on catastrophe theory by Zeeman.[9] In 1974 Zeeman gave an invited address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver, about applications of catastrophe theory./nZeeman was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1975, and was awarded the Society's Faraday Medal in 1988.

In spring 1885 he successfully completed the examinations for teachers at secondary schools, authorizing him for mathematics and physics in all classes of grammar schools and junior highs, as well as for geography excluding the preparations of the final secondary school examinations./nA travel grant of the Polytechnikum allowed him to earn a doctorate, possible in those days at universities only. On 1 April 1885 Witting commenced his probationary year as teacher at the Thomasschule in Leipzig, and at the same time he attended courses and seminars at the university of Leipzig, esp. under Felix Klein, from whom he also received the topic for his dissertation. On 4 August 1886 he was accredited with a PhD at the Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t in G\u00f6ttingen, the new work-place of Felix Klein./nFrom 1 December 1886 he worked as permanent teacher at the St\u00e4dtische Gymnasium zum Heiligen Kreuz (Kreuzschule) by the will of the council of city Dresden.

Extra officially he assisted for a long time at the chair for descriptive geometry of the TH Dresden, and he designed advertising brochures for the renowned concern Koch & Stenzel at Dresden./nAlexander Witting was one of those secondary-school teachers, who remained being associated with the development of their science, and who published frequently themselves. As teacher of a grammar school with close contacts to both, high schools and praxis, he was open-minded to the reforms movement for mathematics and natural science education, which to the end of the 1880s / beginnings of 1890s gained strength. Felix Klein, being elected as leader of the international mathematics education commission (IMUK), consulted Alexander Witting for the papers published by the IMUK. Der mathematische Unterricht an den Gymnasien und Realanstalten und die Ausbildung der Lehramtskandidaten im K\u00f6nigreich Sachsen, (The mathematics class at grammar schools and junior highs, and the education of teachers in the Saxon kingdom) written by Witting was published 1910. The Verein zur F\u00f6rderung des mathematischen und naturwissenschaftlichen Unterrichts (development association for mathematics and natural science classes) played an essential role for the reforms movement, esp. because of its grass-roots workload. Alexander Witting was one of its board members for a long time, and too was among the founders of the F\u00f6rderverein\u2019s very busy local union in Dresden./nAs, in the run of these reforms, differential and integral calculus found entrance to the curriculum of secondary schools for the first time (since 1907 in Saxon), a representation of this subject area was needed which was fitting for these students. On this background Walther Lietzmann (1880\u20131956) and Alexander Witting together with Teubner Verlag established the Mathematisch-Physikalische Bibliothek in Leipzig. Witting not only was co-publisher, he also was author of several multiply reprinted booklets of that series. His booklets on differential and integral calculus were published since the middle of the 1930s in the G\u00f6schen compilation \u2013 in a highly extended form and supplemented by separate exercise books. For several years from 1911 on, Alexander Witting additionally published Verhandlungen der Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und \u00c4rzte (Proceedings of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Doctors)./nBeginning in 1891, Witting attended military practices nearly every year.

His ISIS lectures reflected the results of own researches, experiences from being a teacher, as well as from his works in specialist societies./nWhen the National Socialists took over, Alexander Witting had already retired from teaching. He had been active in World War I, and his achievements about secondary schools were generally honoured. All this taken together caused that (being a \"half-Jew\" in the sense of the Nuremberg Laws of the National Socialists) he was not bothered too hard. He was not affiliated to the NS teachers alliance, but was at first allowed to join as a guest. He also remained an honorary member of the development association, which in that form only existed until 1936.

His work was noted especially for clarity of exposition. He was the first to prove consistency of non-Euclidean geometry by modeling it on a surface of constant curvature, the pseudosphere, and in the interior of an n-dimensional unit sphere, the so-called Beltrami\u2013Klein model. He also developed singular value decomposition for matrices, which has been subsequently rediscovered several times. Beltrami's use of differential calculus for problems of mathematical physics indirectly influenced development of tensor calculus by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita./nBeltrami was born in 1835 in Cremona (Lombardy), then a part of the Austrian Empire, and now part of Italy. Both parents were artists Giovanni Beltrami and the Venetian Elisa Barozzi. He began studying mathematics at University of Pavia in 1853, but was expelled from Ghislieri College in 1856 due to his political opinions\u2014he was sympathetic with the Risorgimento. During this time he was taught and influenced by Francesco Brioschi. He had to discontinue his studies because of financial hardship and spent the next several years as a secretary working for the Lombardy\u2013Venice railroad company. He was appointed to the University of Bologna as a professor in 1862, the year he published his first research paper. Throughout his life, Beltrami had various professorial jobs at the universities of Pisa, Rome and Pavia. From 1891 until the end of his life, Beltrami lived in Rome. He became the president of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1898 and a senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1899./nIn 1868 Beltrami published two memoirs (written in Italian; French translations by J. Ho\u00fcel appeared in 1869) dealing with consistency and interpretations of non-Euclidean geometry of J\u00e1nos Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky.  In his \"Essay on an interpretation of non-Euclidean geometry\", Beltrami proposed that this geometry could be realized on a surface of constant negative curvature, a pseudosphere. For Beltrami's concept, lines of the geometry are represented by geodesics on the pseudosphere and theorems of non-Euclidean geometry can be proved within ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and not derived in an axiomatic fashion, as Lobachevsky and Bolyai had done previously. In 1840, Ferdinand Minding already considered geodesic triangles on the pseudosphere and remarked that the corresponding \"trigonometric formulas\" are obtained from the corresponding formulas of spherical trigonometry by replacing the usual trigonometric functions with hyperbolic functions; this was further developed by Delfino Codazzi in 1857, but apparently neither of them noticed the association with Lobachevsky's work. In this way, Beltrami attempted to demonstrate that two-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry is as valid as the Euclidean geometry of the space, and in particular, that Euclid's parallel postulate could not be derived from the other axioms of Euclidean geometry. It is often stated that this proof was incomplete due to the singularities of the pseudosphere, which means that geodesics could not be extended indefinitely. However, John Stillwell remarks that Beltrami must have been well aware of this difficulty, which is also manifested by the fact that the pseudosphere is topologically a cylinder, and not a plane, and he spent a part of his memoir designing a way around it. By a suitable choice of coordinates, Beltrami showed how the metric on the pseudosphere can be transferred to the unit disk and that the singularity of the pseudosphere corresponds to a horocycle on the non-Euclidean plane. On the other hand, in the introduction to his memoir, Beltrami states that it would be impossible to justify \"the rest of Lobachevsky's theory\", i.e., the non-Euclidean geometry of space, by this method./nIn the second memoir published during the same year (1868), \"Fundamental theory of spaces of constant curvature\", Beltrami continued this logic  and gave an abstract proof of equiconsistency of hyperbolic and Euclidean geometry for any dimension. He accomplished this by introducing several models of non-Euclidean geometry that are now known as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model, the Poincar\u00e9 disk model, and the Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model, together with transformations that relate them. For the half-plane model, Beltrami cited a note by Joseph Liouville in the treatise of Gaspard Monge on differential geometry. Beltrami also showed that n-dimensional Euclidean geometry is realized on a horosphere of the (n\u00a0+\u00a01)-dimensional hyperbolic space, so the logical relation between consistency of the Euclidean and the non-Euclidean geometries is symmetric. Beltrami acknowledged the influence of Bernhard Riemann's groundbreaking Habilitation lecture \"On the hypotheses on which geometry is based\" (1854; published posthumously in 1868)./nAlthough today Beltrami's \"Essay\" is recognized as very important for the development of non-Euclidean geometry, the reception at the time was less enthusiastic. Luigi Cremona objected to perceived circular reasoning, which even forced Beltrami to delay the publication of the \"Essay\" by one year. Subsequently, Felix Klein failed to acknowledge Beltrami's priority in construction of the projective disk model of the non-Euclidean geometry. This reaction can be attributed in part to the novelty of Beltrami's reasoning, which was similar to the ideas of Riemann concerning abstract manifolds. J. Ho\u00fcel published Beltrami's proof in his French translation of works of Lobachevsky and Bolyai.", "4115474": "Calvin Kingsley (8 September 1812 \u2013 6 April 1870) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church elected in 1864./nKingsley was born in Annsville, Oneida County, New York, US, the first child and eldest son of Oren (Jr.)  and Margaret (Buchanan) Kingsley.

This principle was based on the Ross\u2013Fahroo lemma which proves[25] that dualization and discretization are not necessarily commutative operations  and that certain steps must be taken to promote commutation.  When discretization is commutative with dualization, then, under appropriate conditions, Pontryagin's minimum principle emerges as a consequence of the convergence of the discretization.  \nTogether with F.

They may have even discovered the inverse square law of gravitation (Russo's argument on this point hinges on well-established, but seldom discussed, evidence). Hellenistic scientists, among them Euclid, Archimedes, Eratosthenes, developed an axiomatic and deductive way of argumentation. When this way of argumentation was dropped, the ability to understand the results were lost as well. Thus Russo conjectures that the definitions of elementary geometric objects were introduced in Euclid's Elements by Heron of Alexandria, 400 years after the work was completed.[4] More concretely, Russo shows how the theory of tides must have been well-developed in Antiquity, because several pre-Newtonian sources relay various complementary parts of the theory without grasping their import or justification (getting the empirical facts wrong but the theory right)./nHellenistic science was focused on the city of Alexandria. The emerging scientific revolution in Alexandria was ended when Ptolemy VIII Physcon came to power. He engaged in mass purges and expulsions of all intellectuals. Other centers of Hellenistic science mentioned in Russo's book were Antioch, Pergamon, Cyzicus, Rhodes, Syracuse and Massilia./nHe also concludes that the 17th-century scientific revolution in Europe was due in large part to the recovery of Hellenistic science.[5] The Forgotten Revolution has received mixed reviews, praising Russo's enthusiasm but noting that his conclusions outreach his sources.[6][7][8][9]/nIn L'America dimenticata, Russo suggests that the Americas were known to some European civilizations in ancient times, probably discovered by the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, but that the knowledge was lost under Roman expansion in the second century BC.[10]/nRusso notes paintings dating to the Roman period and representing American fruits (Ananas), and small Mesoamerican toys representing wheeled trucks, when the wheel had not been invented nor used in pre-Columbian times./nWith the collapse of the Hellenistic world under the attacks of the Romans around the middle of the 2nd century BC (specifically, the destruction of Corinth and Carthage in 146 BC and the expulsion of the scientific elite from Alexandria in 145 BC), these geographic notions were lost. Later Ptolemy incorrectly identified the Blessed Islands with the Canaries and since it was known that the Blessed Islands were at the antipodes relative to the eastern part of China, Ptolemy made ends meet by erroneously enlarging the longitude of all known places, and shrinking the width of a degree of longitude (500 instead of 700 stadia)./nWith this correction Lucio Russo manages[citation needed] to pinpoint the position of the mythical Thule, reached in the 4th century BC by explorer Pytheas, on the coast of Greenland.

He was born in Ohlau, Prussian Silesia (now O\u0142awa, Poland) and died in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland./nPringsheim came from an extremely wealthy Silesian merchant family with Jewish roots. He was the first-born child and only son of the Upper Silesian railway entrepreneur and coal mine owner Rudolf Pringsheim (1821\u20131901) and his wife Paula, n\u00e9e Deutschmann (1827\u20131909). He had a younger sister, Martha./nPringsheim attended the Maria Magdalena Gymnasium in Breslau, where he excelled in music and mathematics. Starting in 1868 he studied mathematics and physics in Berlin and at the Ruprecht Karl University in Heidelberg. In 1872 he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics, studying under Leo K\u00f6nigsberger. In 1875, he moved from Berlin, where his parents lived, to Munich to earn his habilitation. Two years later he became a lecturer at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich./nIn 1886 Pringsheim was appointed associate professor of mathematics there, and in 1901 full professor. He retired as emeritus professor in 1922. He was elected a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1898, a position he held until 1938, and was a corresponding member of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences. He was also awarded membership in the Leopoldina, Germany's oldest academy of natural sciences./nPringsheim considered himself to be a German citizen who no longer followed the \"Mosaic belief\" (meaning conservative or orthodox Judaism). He repeatedly declined to have himself baptized./nIn 1878 Pringsheim married the Berlin actress Gertrude Hedwig Anna Dohm (1855\u20131942), whose mother was the Berlin advocate of women's rights Hedwig Dohm (1831\u20131919). They had five children: Erik (born 1879), Peter (born 1881), Heinz (born 1882) and twins born in 1883, Klaus and Katharina, known as Katia. His first-born son, Erik, was exiled to Argentina because of his dissolute life and gambling debts and died there at an early age. His sons Peter and Klaus followed him in pursuing academic careers, obtaining professorships in physics and musical composition. One musician in the family was enough, so his third son, Heinz, became an archaeologist with a doctorate in that field, but soon changed course, becoming a successful conductor and critic in Berlin and Munich. His daughter Katia was the first female in Munich to earn the qualifications for university admission and was one of the first active women students at Munich University. She later became the wife of the author and Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann./nIn 1889 Pringsheim and his family moved into a Neo-Renaissance villa at Arcisstrasse 12 designed by the Berlin architects Kayser & von Gro\u00dfheim with interior furnishings provided by Joh. Wachter and the court furniture manufacturer O. Fritsche of Munich. On major social nights the Munich elite was hosted here in what was known as the Pringsheim Palace. There he had the Romantic painter Hans Thoma, of similar political affiliation, decorate the music room./nBesides mathematics, ever since his youth Pringsheim was also intensively occupied with music, and adapted various compositions of Richard Wagner for the piano./nLater he became interested in the theory and history of art, building up important collections of majolica earthenware and silver.[1] His was the largest and most important private collection of majolica in Germany consisting of 440 pieces.[2] He also collected enamels, stained-glass panels, tapestries, and paintings by Franz von Lenbach.[3]/nIn his novel Royal Highness, Thomas Mann portrayed his father-in-law as the character Samuel Spoelman./nIn mathematical analysis, Pringsheim studied real and complex functions, following the power-series-approach of the Weierstrass school.[4] Pringsheim published numerous works on the subject of complex analysis, with a focus on the summability theory of infinite series and the boundary behavior of analytic functions./nOne of Pringsheim's theorems, according to Hadamard[5] earlier proved by E. Borel, states[6]  that a power series with positive coefficients and radius of convergence equal to 1 has necessarily a singularity at the point 1.\nThis theorem is used in analytic combinatorics[7] and the Perron\u2013Frobenius theory of positive operators on ordered vector spaces.[8][9]/nAnother theorem named after Pringsheim gives an analyticity criterion for a C\u221e function on a bounded interval, based on the behaviour of the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion around a point of the interval.\nHowever, Pringsheim's original proof had a flaw (related to uniform convergence), and a correct proof was provided by Ralph P. Boas.[10][11]/nPringsheim and Ivan \u015aleszy\u0144ski, working separately, proved what is now called the \u015aleszy\u0144ski\u2013Pringsheim theorem on convergence of certain continued fractions./nBesides his research in analysis, Pringsheim also wrote articles for the Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften on the fundamentals of arithmetic and on number theory.  He published papers in the Mathematische Annalen.  As an officer of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, he recorded the minutes of its scientific meetings./nPringsheim had a deep, early interest in music and was especially fascinated by the works of Richard Wagner. He corresponded with Wagner personally, and he took Wagner's letters with him when he went into exile to Switzerland. His musical inclinations led to the publication of several arrangements of Wagner's work, and he also wrote on subjects in the field of music./nHis association with Wagner was so intense that Pringsheim supported Wagner financially to a significant extent, and also backed the Bayreuth music festival. In gratitude, he received a certificate designating him as a patron, which guaranteed him a seat at certain performances. In her memoirs about this acquaintance with Wagner, his granddaughter, Erika Mann, wrote that Prof. Pringsheim was even once involved in a duel because someone had insulted Wagner./nHis family's fortune left Pringsheim a wealthy man. He also had a sizeable monthly income as a full professor at the university. After the death of the family patriarch in 1913 he had at his disposal assets amounting to 13 million marks and an annual income of 800,000 marks,[12] which is today equivalent to 10.5 million euro and 646,000 euro, respectively.[13]/nPringsheim's financial decline began with World War I. As a \u201cGerman patriot\u201d he subscribed to war loans which lost their nominal value after the war, which meant the loss of a major part of his capital. The disastrous inflation of 1923 and 1924 resulted in additional high losses. As a result, he had to sell part of his art collection, which probably included a mural by Hans Thoma. He commented, ironically, \u201cI live from wall to mouth\u201d. He also had to sell his marvellous mathematics library which contained many precious books dating back to the sixteenth century. The auction catalogue is still preserved in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.[14]/nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Pringheim was persecuted because of his Jewish origins.[15]/nPrimarily because of his age (he was in his mid-80s) he did not want to go abroad, as did most of his family, and remained in Germany. One of many antisemitic pieces of Nazi legislation, the Namens\u00e4nderungsverordnung\u00a0[de] which came into effect 1 January 1938, forced him to legally change his name into Alfred Israel Pringsheim at age 87. At first, he was not allowed to leave the country. Winifred Wagner was not able to help the elderly Wagner devotee in this respect. Through the intervention of the then-rector of Munich University (LMU), his former neighbor Karl Haushofer, who was a friend of Rudolf Hess, and the professor of mathematics Oskar Perron, one of Alfred Pringsheim's former students, as well as through the initiative of a courageous member of the SS who arranged for passports at the last minute, he and his wife were able to leave for Zurich, Switzerland on 31 October 1939 after suffering further grave humiliations./nDuring Kristallnacht, in November 1938, the SS seized Pringsheim's maiolica collection from his home in Munich. His world famous collection of majolica was sold in a forced sale by the Nazis at Sotheby's in London in 1939 in exchange for permission to emigrate.[16][17]/nPringsheim's house had to be sold to the Nazi party. It was torn down and replaced by a party administration building. The files of all German Nazi party members were stored there until 1945. Today it houses the Institute of Art History of Munich University (LMU) and the offices of the Munich State Collection of Antiquities, among others entities./nPringsheim died on 25 June 1941 in Zurich. His wife then apparently burned all of the personal effects which had been brought to Switzerland, including the letters from Richard Wagner. She died one year later./nPringheim's heirs have requested that artworks looted by the Nazis and sold in forced sales be returned to the family. Many, though not all, of the looted works were restituted in 1953.[18] In 2008 Pringheim's heirs asked the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Foundation to restitute to them seven pieces of Italian maiolica that the museum had acquired by the collector J.N.

Shortly before coming to the United States of America, Yamabe married his wife Etsuko, and by 1956 they had two daughters. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,[5] just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University./nAfter graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1947, Yamabe became an assistant at Osaka University. From 1952 until 1954 he was an assistant at Princeton University, receiving his Ph.D. from Osaka University while at Princeton. He left Princeton in 1954 to become assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. Except for one year as a professor at Osaka University, he stayed in Minnesota until 1960. Yamabe died suddenly of a stroke in November 1960,[6] just months after accepting a full professorship at Northwestern University./nAfter coming back to Japan, Etsuko Yamabe and her daughters lived with the benefits of Hidehiko's social security and of funds raised privately by her and her husband's friends in the United States of America.[7] When she had achieved some financial stability, it was her wish to return the kindness shown to her in a time of great need by setting up funds for an annual lecture, to be alternatively held at Northwestern and Minnesota: the Yamabe Memorial Lecture was so established, and was able to attract distinguished lecturers as Eugenio Calabi.[8] Further funding permitted the expansion of the lecture to the present state bi-annual Yamabe Symposium.[9]/nYamabe published eighteen papers on various mathematical topics:.[10] These have been collected and published as a book, edited by Ralph Philip Boas, Jr. for Gordon and Breach Science Publishers.[11]/nHalf of Yamabe's papers concern  the theory of Lie groups and related topics. However, he is best known today for his remarkable posthumous paper, \"On a deformation of Riemannian structures on compact manifolds,\" Osaka Math. J. 12 (1960) 21\u201337. This paper claims to prove that any Riemannian metric on any compact manifold without boundary is conformal to  another metric for which the scalar curvature is constant. This assertion, which naturally generalizes the uniformization of Riemann surfaces to arbitrary dimensions,  is completely correct, as is the broad outline  of Yamabe's proof. However, Yamabe's argument contains a subtle analytic mistake arising form  the failure  of certain natural inclusions of Sobolev spaces to be compact. This mistake was only corrected in stages, on a case-by-case basis, first by Trudinger (\"Remarks Concerning the Conformal Deformation of Metrics to Constant Scalar Curvature\", Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa 22 (1968) 265\u2013274), then by Aubin (\u00c9quations Diff\u00e9rentielles Non Lin\u00e9aires et Probl\u00e8me de Yamabe, J. Math. Pures Appl. 9: 55 (1976) 269\u2013296), and finally, in full generality,  by Schoen (\"Conformal Deformation of a Riemannian Metric to Constant Scalar Curvature,\"  Journal of Differential Geometry 20 (1984) 478-495). Yamabe's visionary paper thereby became  a cornerstone of modern Riemannnian geometry, and  is thus largely responsible for his posthumous fame. For example, as of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet records 186 citations of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal, compared with only 148 citations of all of his other publications combined.\nAs of January 16, 2015, MathSciNet also lists 997 reviews containing the word \"Yamabe.\" This, of course, is notably larger than the number of papers that  explicitly cite any of Yamabe's articles. However, the vast majority of these reviews contain one of the phrases  \"scalar curvature\" or \"Yamabe equation,\" referring to Yamabe's equation  governing the behavior of the scalar curvature under conformal rescaling. In this sense, the influence of Yamabe's 1960 paper in the Osaka Journal has become such a universal fixture of current mathematical thought that it is often implicitly referred to without an explicit citation.", "7163006": "John W.

The original goal of the research project was \"obtain the most reliable consensus of opinion of a group of experts ... by a series of intensive questionnaires interspersed with controlled opinion feedback.\"[4]/nThe most noted outcomes were published in the 1962 memorandum of the Rand Corporation, entitled \"An experimental application of the Delphi method to the use of experts\" by Norman Dalkey and Olaf Helmer, republished under the same title in Management science in 1963. The research had started a decade earlier, and was published earlier in the RAND Memorandum, entitled \"The Use of Experts for the Estimation of Bombing Requirements.\"[5] It concerned the application of \"expert opinion to the selection, from the point of view of a Soviet strategic planner, of an optimal U. S. industrial target system and to the estimation of the number of A-bombs required to reduce the munitions output by a prescribed amount.\"[6]/nLinstone and Turoff (1975) further explained that \"it is interesting to note that the alternative method of handling this problem at that time would have involved a very extensive and costly data-collection process and the programming and execution of computer models of a size almost prohibitive on the computers available in the early fifties. Even if this alternative approach had been taken, a great many subjective estimates on Soviet intelligence and policies would still have dominated the results of the model. Therefore, the original justifications for this first Delphi study are still valid for many Delphi applications today, when accurate information is unavailable or expensive to obtain, or evaluation models require subjective inputs to the point where they become the dominating parameters. A good example of this is in the \"health care\" evaluation area, which currently has a number of Delphi practitioners.\"[7]/nThe 1984 book Multiple Perspectives for Decision Making, again co-authored with Ian Mitroff, presented a multiple perspective approach for decision making. This work was based on ideas of Graham T. Allison, published in his Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis from 1971. Linstone (1999) explained:/nAllison had seen that his analysis and modeling for corporate decision making only took into account some of the factors vital in the corporate decision process and Allison\u2019s work examined the missile crisis from three different points of view, rational actor, organizational process, and bureaucratic politics. Each provided insights not obtainable with the others.[8]/nCombined with his own experience in the aerospace industry, Linstone & Mitroff distinguished three types of perspectives for decision making. At first the Technical Perspectives (T), with the characteristics:/nSecond The Organizational Perspectives (O), which \"focuses on process rather than product, on action rather than problem-solving. The critical questions are 'does something need to be done, and if so, what?' and 'who needs to do it and how?' rather than 'what is the optimal solution?' There must be a recognition that top-down imposition of solutions may well fail if there is no 'bottom-up' support.\"[8]/nAnd third the Personal Perspectives (P), which \"views the world through a unique individual. It sweeps in aspects that relate individuals to the system and are not captured by technical and organizational perspectives.\"[8]/nLater Linstone further developed this approach to decision making, and presented it in his 1999 Decision Making for Technology Executives: Using Multiple Perspectives to Improve Performance./nBooks published by Linstone:", "53398669": "Franz Aurenhammer (born September 25, 1957) is an Austrian computational geometer known for his research in computational geometry on Voronoi diagrams, straight skeletons, and related structures.

He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880 after being proposed by Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown, John Gray McKendrick, and Alexander Buchan. He won the Society's Keith Prize for the period 1893-95. He served as Secretary 1905-1912 and General Secretary 1912-1922.[3] He was also a founder of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, taking the chair for its first meeting on Friday 2 February 1883.[4]/nJapan's Public Works was found in October 1871 with 11 departments, one of which was the engineering institution. Yamao Yozo, head of the institution asked William Rankine and Lord Kelvin to send proper teaching staffs to the technical school through Hugh Mateson, and hired 6 instructors lead by Henry Dyer  as a principal,  John Milne a Professor of Geology and Mining, and James Alfred Ewing  Professor of Physics and Engineering at Tokyo Imperial University from 1878./nWhen Ewing returned to Scotland in 1883, the rector of Tokyo Imperial University wrote to Lord Kelvin, asking for his recommendation for a successor, Lord Kelvin recommended Knott, and the recommendation was supported by Ewing. Thus, Knott replaced Ewing as Professor of Physics and Engineering at Tokyo Imperial University.[5] For the next nine years, he worked closely with Milne, Gray and the Japanese seismologist Fusakichi Omori in establishing a network of recording seismometers across the Japanese Empire. Knott also taught courses in mathematics, acoustics, and electromagnetism at the Tokyo Imperial University./nKnott also undertook the first geomagnetic survey of Japan, assisted by Japanese geophysicist Tanakadate Aikitsu, from which was developed the first earthquake hazard map of Japan. Knott's key contribution was his background in mathematics and data analysis. One of his innovations was to apply the technique of Fourier analysis to the occurrence of earthquakes. Two chapters in his 1908 book The Physics of Earthquake Phenomena were devoted to this subject, which Knott hoped would enable him to deduce the probability of when future earthquakes would occur./nCargil Knott married Mary Dixon in 1885, becoming the brother-in-law of the literary scholar James Main Dixon.[6]/nOn the conclusion of his stay in Japan in 1891, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun by Emperor Meiji.[7]/nOn his return to Edinburgh, Knott took up the position of a Reader in Applied Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, holding the post until his death in 1922./nWhile in Japan, Knott began to develop mathematical equations describing how seismic vibrations are reflected and transmitted across the boundary between seawater and seabed.

It fell to Knott to prepare a third edition in 1904. By then the Universal Algebra of Alfred North Whitehead (1898) presumed some grounding in quaternions as students encountered matrix algebra. In Knott's introduction to his textbook edition he says \"Analytically the quaternion is now known to take its place in the general theory of complex numbers and continuous groups,...\". Thus he was aware of the diversity to be encountered in modern mathematical structures, and that quaternions stand as a milestone on the way to others./nHe became more active in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, serving on the Council from 1894 to 1905, moving up to a Secretary to Ordinary Meetings in 1905 and finally becoming its general secretary in 1912 until his death in 1922.[11] Knott also took an active social role in his community including Sunday school teaching and church affairs with the United Free Church of Scotland.

Sciulli and Steven Frautschi, and chaired by Richard D. Field.[21][22]/nWolfram, at the age of 15, began research in applied quantum field theory and particle physics and published scientific papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals including Nuclear Physics B, Australian Journal of Physics, Nuovo Cimento, and Physical Review D.[citation needed] Working independently, Wolfram published a widely cited paper on heavy quark production at age 18[4][failed verification] and nine other papers.[23] Wolfram's work with Geoffrey C. Fox on the theory of the strong interaction is still used in experimental particle physics.[citation needed]/nFollowing his PhD, Wolfram joined the faculty at Caltech and became the youngest recipient[24] of a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, at age 21.[18]/nIn 1983, Wolfram left for the School of Natural Sciences of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. By that time, he was no longer interested in particle physics. Instead, he began pursuing investigations into cellular automata,[citation needed] mainly with computer simulations. He produced a series of papers systematically investigating the class of elementary cellular automata, conceiving the Wolfram code, a naming system for one-dimensional cellular automata, and a classification scheme for the complexity of their behaviour.[25] He conjectured that the Rule 110 cellular automaton might be Turing complete, which a research assistant to Wolfram, Matthew Cook, later proved correct.[26] Wolfram sued Cook and temporarily blocked publication of the work on Rule 110 for allegedly violating a non-disclosure agreement until Wolfram could publish the work in his controversial book A New Kind of Science.[4][27] Wolfram's cellular-automata work came to be cited in more than 10,000 papers.[23]/nIn the mid-1980s, Wolfram worked on simulations of physical processes (such as turbulent fluid flow) with cellular automata on the Connection Machine alongside Richard Feynman[28] and helped initiate the field of complex systems.[29] In 1984, he was a participant in the Founding Workshops of the Santa Fe Institute, along with Nobel laureates Murray Gell-Mann, Manfred Eigen, and Philip Warren Anderson, and future laureate Frank Wilczek.[30] In 1986, he founded the Center for Complex Systems Research (CCSR) at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign.[31] In 1987, he founded the journal Complex Systems.[31]/nWolfram led the development of the computer algebra system SMP (Symbolic Manipulation Program) in the Caltech physics department during 1979\u20131981. A dispute with the administration over the intellectual property rights regarding SMP\u2014patents, copyright, and faculty involvement in commercial ventures\u2014eventually led him to resign from Caltech.[32] SMP was further developed and marketed commercially by Inference Corp. of Los Angeles during 1983\u20131988./nIn 1986, Wolfram left the Institute for Advanced Study for the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he had founded their Center for Complex Systems Research, and started to develop the computer algebra system Mathematica, which was first released on 23 June 1988, when he left academia. In 1987, he founded Wolfram Research, which continues to develop and market the program.[4]/nFrom 1992 to 2002, Wolfram worked on his controversial book A New Kind of Science,[4][33] which presents an empirical study of simple computational systems. Additionally, it argues that for fundamental reasons these types of systems, rather than traditional mathematics, are needed to model and understand complexity in nature. Wolfram's conclusion is that the universe is discrete in its nature, and runs on fundamental laws which can be described as simple programs. He predicts that a realization of this within scientific communities will have a revolutionary influence on physics, chemistry, biology, and a majority of scientific areas in general, hence the book's title. The book was met with skepticism and criticism that Wolfram took credit for the work of others and made conclusions without evidence to support them.[34][35]/nIn March 2009, Wolfram announced Wolfram Alpha, an answer engine. WolframAlpha later launched in May 2009,[36] and a paid-for version with extra features launched in February 2012 that was met with criticism for its high price that was later dropped from $50.00 to $2.00.[37][38] The engine is based on natural language processing and a large library of rules-based algorithms. The application programming interface allows other applications to extend and enhance Wolfram Alpha.[39]/nIn 2010, Wolfram co-founded Touchpress along with Theodore Gray, Max Whitby, and John Cromie.

Since the launch, Touchpress has published more than 100 apps.[40] The company is no longer active./nIn March 2014, at the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) event, Wolfram officially announced the Wolfram Language as a new general multi-paradigm programming language,[41] though it was previously available through Mathematica and not an entirely new programming language. The documentation for the language was pre-released in October 2013 to coincide with the bundling of Mathematica and the Wolfram Language on every Raspberry Pi computer with some controversy because of the proprietary nature of the Wolfram Language.[42] While the Wolfram Language has existed for over 30 years as the primary programming language used in Mathematica, it was not officially named until 2014, and is not widely used.[43][44]/nIn April 2020, Wolfram announced the \"Wolfram Physics Project\" as an effort to reduce and explain all the laws of physics within a paradigm of a hypergraph that is transformed by minimal rewriting rules that obey the Church-Rosser property.[45][46]  The effort is a continuation of the ideas he originally described in A New Kind of Science. Wolfram claims that \"From an extremely simple model, we're able to reproduce special relativity, general relativity and the core results of quantum mechanics.\" Physicists are generally unimpressed with Wolfram's claim, and state that Wolfram's results are non-quantitative and arbitrary.[47][48]/nWolfram has an extensive log of personal analytics, including emails received and sent, keystrokes made, meetings and events attended, recordings of phone calls, and even physical movement dating back to the 1980s.

In 1957, a few years after the Indonesian independence, they came back to the Netherlands and Duistermaat completed his high school studies in Vlaardingen.[3][4]/nFrom 1959 to 1965 he studied mathematics at Utrecht University, and he obtained his PhD degree at the same institution in 1968, with a thesis on the mathematical structures of thermodynamics entitled \"Energy and Entropy as Real Morphisms for Addition and Order\".[5] His original supervisor was the applied mathematician G\u00fcnther K. Braun, who passed away one year before the thesis defense, so the official supervision was taken over by geometer Hans Freudenthal.[6][7][8][9]/nAfter a postdoctoral stay in Lund (1969\u201370), Duistermaat returned to the Netherlands in 1971 and became in 1972 full professor in Nijmegen. In 1974 he returned to Utrecht, where he was offered the chair of Freudenthal./nIn 2004 he was awarded a special academy professorship by the KNAW, allowing him to focus exclusively on research, even after his official retirement in 2007.[6][8][10][4] He died in March 2010, due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pneumonia.[11]/nHe was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982,[12] and of Academia Europaea in 1993.[13] In 2007 he became a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion.[14][8][15]/nApart from being an eminent mathematician, Duistermaat was also a good chess player. In a simultaneous match of 10 against Anatoly Karpov in 1977, Duistermaat was the only one who did not lose.[4][7][16]/nDuistermaat defined himself a geometric analyst,[8] but his research covered many different areas in analysis, geometry and mathematical physics, including classical mechanics, symplectic geometry, Fourier integral operators, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and dynamical systems./nDuistermaat dropped thermodynamics after his PhD, due to dissents between mathematicians and physicists in Utrecht. Nevertheless, during his PhD research he read the work by Sophus Lie, and in particular encountered contact transformations. These topics exerted an important influence for his future pioneering works in microlocal analysis,[6][8][10] most prominently during his collaboration with Lars H\u00f6rmander, when they developed the theory of Fourier integral operators and proved the Propagation of singularities theorem\u00a0[de].[17] This led him also to the work with Victor Guillemin on the link between spectra of elliptic operators and periodic bicharacteristics.[18]/nDuistermaat introduced the notion of monodromy in Hamiltonian systems[8][9][7] as obstruction to the existence of global action-angle coordinates,[19] later, together with Richard Cushman, he extended it to the quantum systems.[20]/nIn symplectic geometry he is well known[9][15][7] for his article with his PhD student Gert Heckman\u00a0[de] on the Duistermaat\u2013Heckman formula,[21] which will later be placed in the more general framework of equivariant cohomology,[22] independently by Berline and Vergne[23] and by Atiyah and Bott.[24] Other contributions in this field include a generalisation of the Morse index theorem[25] and a contribution to the problem of quantisation commutes with reduction.[26]/nIn his book on Lie groups, together with his PhD student Johan Kolk,[27] he provided an alternative proof of the third Lie theorem, which will turn out to be crucial for proving the analogous theorem for Lie groupoids and for its applications to Poisson geometry.[6][8][7]/nHis work with Alberto Gr\u00fcnbaum on the bispectral problem[28] was influential for integrable systems and noncommutative algebraic geometry.[7] In the last stages of his life he became interested in algebraic geometry[8][15] and wrote a book on QRT maps and elliptic surfaces.[29]/nDuistermaat contributed also to applied mathematics.[6][8][10] He was a consultant to Royal Dutch Shell, which led to the thesis of Christiaan Stolk on the inversion of seismic data.[30] He also worked on barrier functions in convex programming,[31] collaborated with biomedical technologists on computer vision[32] and with geophysicists on modeling the polarity reversals of the Earth's magnetic field.[33]/nHe supervised 25 PhD students.[5]", "806139": "Quintino Sella (Italian pronunciation: [kwin\u02c8tino \u02c8s\u025blla]; 7 July 1827 \u2013 14 March 1884) was an Italian politician, economist and mountaineer./nSella was born at Sella di Mosso, in the Province of Biella./nAfter studying engineering at Turin, he was sent in 1843 to study mineralogy at the Parisian school of mines (Mines ParisTech). In Paris he witnessed the revolution of 1848, and only returned to Turin in 1852, when he taught applied geometry at the technical institute. In 1853 he became professor of mathematics at the university, and in 1860 professor of mineralogy in the school of applied engineering.[1]/nIn 1860 he was elected deputy for Cossato. A two years later he was selected to be secretary-general of public instruction, and in 1862 received from Rattazzi the portfolio of finance. The Rattazzi cabinet fell before Sella could efficaciously provide for the deficit of 17,500,000 with which he was confronted; but in 1864 he returned to the ministry of finance in the La Marmora cabinet, and dealt energetically with the deficit of 8,000,000 then existing. Persuading the king to forgo 120,000 of his civil list, and his colleagues in the cabinet to relinquish part of their ministerial stipends, he effected savings amounting to 2,400,000, proposed new taxation to the extent of 1,600,000, and induced landowners to pay one year's instalment of the land tax in advance.[1]/nA vote of the chamber compelled him to resign before his preparations for financial restoration were complete; but in 1869 he returned to the ministry of finance in a cabinet formed by himself, but of which he made over the premiership to Giovanni Lanza. By means of the grist tax (which he had proposed in 1865, but which the Menabrea cabinet had passed in 1868), and by other fiscal expedients necessitated by the almost desperate condition of the national exchequer, he succeeded, before his fall from power in 1873, in placing Italian finance upon a sound footing, in spite of fierce attacks and persistent misrepresentation.[1]/nIn 1870 his great political influence turned the scale against interference in favour of France against Prussia, and in favour of an immediate occupation of Rome. From 1873 until his premature death, he acted as leader of the Right (Destra Storica), and was more than once prevented by an ephemeral coalition of personal opponents from returning to power as head of a Moderate Conservative cabinet. After the failure of an attempt to form a cabinet in May 1881 he practically retired from public life, devoting himself to his studies and his linen factory.[1]/nQuintino Sella died in 1884 and was buried at Oropa where a pyramid was erected by the engineer Carlo Maggia as his monument; the implied anti-clericalism of this choice of an \u2018Egyptian\u2019 style matched Sella's r\u00f4le in the occupation of Rome.[2]/nA passionate alpinist, he had found time during his political career to found the Club Alpino Italiano and a number of its mountain huts are named in his honour. He was also involved in the competition for the first ascent of the Matterhorn and he was portrayed in several related films such as The Mountain Calls and The Challenge.[citation needed]/nHis Discorsi parlamentari were published (5 vols., 1887\u20131890) by order of the Chamber of Deputies. An account of his life and his scientific labours was given by A Cossa in the Proceedings of the Accademia dei Lincei (1884\u20131885).[1]/nThe mineral sellaite was named in his honor in 1869.[3][4]", "1559807": "Guo Shoujing (Chinese: \u90ed\u5b88\u656c, 1231\u20131316), courtesy name Ruosi (\u82e5\u601d), was a Chinese astronomer,[1] hydraulic engineer, mathematician, and politician of the Yuan dynasty. The later Johann Adam Schall von Bell (1591\u20131666) was so impressed with the preserved astronomical instruments of Guo that he called him \"the Tycho Brahe of China.\"[2] Jamal ad-Din cooperated with him.[1]/nIn 1231, in Xingtai, Hebei province, China, Guo Shoujing was born into a poor family.[3] He was raised primarily by his paternal grandfather, Guo Yong, who was famous throughout China for his expertise in a wide variety of topics, ranging from the study of the Five Classics to astronomy, mathematics, and hydraulics. Guo Shoujing was a child prodigy, showing exceptional intellectual promise. By his teens, he obtained a blueprint for a water clock which his grandfather was working on, and realized its principles of operation. He improved the design of a type of water clock called a lotus clepsydra, a water clock with a bowl shaped like a lotus flower on the top into which the water dripped.  After he had mastered the construction of such water clocks, he began to study mathematics at the age of 16. From mathematics, he began to understand hydraulics, as well as astronomy.[3]/nAt 20, Guo became a hydraulic engineer. In 1251, as a government official, he helped repair a bridge over the Dahuoquan River. Kublai realized the importance of hydraulic engineering, irrigation, and water transport, which he believed could help alleviate uprisings within the empire, and sent Liu Bingzhong and his student Guo to look at these aspects in the area between Dadu (now Beijing or Peking) and the Yellow River. To provide Dadu with a new supply of water, Guo had a 30\u00a0km channel built to bring water from the Baifu spring in the Shenshan Mountain to Dadu, which required connecting the water supply across different river basins, canals with sluices to control the water level. The Grand Canal, which linked the river systems of the Yangtze, the Huai, and the Huang since the early 7th century, was repaired and extended to Dadu in 1292\u201393 with the use of corv\u00e9e (unpaid labor).[4]   After the success of this project, Kublai Khan sent Guo off to manage similar projects in other parts of the empire.  He became the chief advisor of hydraulics, mathematics, and astronomy for Kublai Khan.[5]/nGuo began to construct astronomical observation devices.  He has been credited with inventing the gnomon, the square table, the abridged or simplified armilla, and a water powered armillary sphere called the Ling Long Yi.  The gnomon is used to measure the angle of the sun, determine the seasons, and is the basis of the sundial, but Guo Shoujing revised this device to become much more accurate and improved the ability to tell time more precisely. The square table was used to measure the azimuth of celestial bodies by the equal altitude method and could also be used as protractor.  The abridged or simplified armilla was used to measure the angle of the sun, as well as the position of any celestial body.  The Ling Long Yi is similar to an abridged armilla except larger, more complex, and more accurate.[6]   Kublai Khan, after observing Guo's mastery of astronomy, ordered that he, Zhang, and Wang Xun make a more accurate calendar. They built 27 observatories throughout China in order to gain thorough observations for their calculations.  In 1280, Guo completed the calendar, calculating a year to be 365.2425 days, just 26 seconds off the year's current measurement.  In 1283, Guo was promoted to director of the Observatory in Beijing and, in 1292, he became the head of the Water Works Bureau.  Throughout his life he also did extensive work with spherical trigonometry.  After Kublai Khan's death, Guo continued to be an advisor to Kublai's successors, working on hydraulics and astronomy.[3]/nHis year of death is variously reported as 1314[6] or 1316.[3]/nGuo Shoujing was a major influence in the development of science in China.  The tools he invented for astronomy allowed him to calculate an accurate length for the year, which allowed Chinese culture to set up a whole new system of exact dates and times, allowing for increasingly accurate recording of history and a sense of continuity throughout the country.  The calendar stabilized the Chinese culture allowing subsequent dynasties to rule more effectively. Through his work in astronomy, he was also able to more accurately establish the location of celestial bodies and the angles of the Sun relative to Earth.  He invented a tool which could be used as an astrological compass, helping people find north using the stars instead of magnets./nWithin the field of hydraulics, even at a young age, Guo was revolutionizing old inventions.  His work on clocks, irrigation, reservoirs, and equilibrium stations within other machines allowed for a more effective or accurate result. The watches he perfected through his work in hydraulics allowed for an extremely accurate reading of the time. For irrigation, he provided hydraulics systems which distributed water equally and swiftly, which allowed communities to trade more effectively, and therefore prosper.  His most memorable engineering feat is the man-made Kunming Lake in Beijing, which provided water for all of the surrounding area of Beijing and allowed for the best grain transport system in the country.  His work with other such reservoirs allowed people in inner China access to water for planting, drinking, and trading. Guo's work in mathematics was regarded as the most highly knowledgeable in China for 400 years. Guo worked on spherical trigonometry, using a system of approximation to find arc lengths and angles.  He stated that pi was equal to 3, leading to a complex sequence of equations which came up with an answer more accurate than the answer that would have resulted if he did the same sequence of equations, but instead having pi equal to 3.1415.[3]/nAs people began to add onto his work, the authenticity of his work was questioned.  Some believe that he took Middle Eastern mathematical and theoretical ideas and used them as his own, taking all the credit.[7] However, he never left China which would have made it more difficult for him to access others' ideas.  Otherwise, Guo was highly regarded throughout history, by many cultures, as a precursor of the Gregorian calendar as well as the man who perfected irrigation techniques in the new millennium.  Many historians regard him as the most prominent Chinese astronomer, engineer, and mathematician of all time./nHis calendar would be used for the next 363 years, the longest period during which a calendar would be used in Chinese history.[8] He also used mathematical functions in his work relating to spherical trigonometry,[9][10] building upon the knowledge of Shen Kuo's (1031\u20131095) earlier work in trigonometry.[11] It is debated amongst scholars whether or not his work in trigonometry was based entirely on the work of Shen, or whether it was partially influenced by Islamic mathematics which was largely accepted at Kublai's court.[10] Sal Restivo asserts that Guo Shoujing's work in trigonometry was directly influenced by Shen's work.[12] An important work in trigonometry in China would not be printed again until the collaborative efforts of Xu Guangqi and his Italian Jesuit associate Matteo Ricci in 1607, during the late Ming Dynasty.[11]/nGuo Shoujing was cited by Tang Shunzhi \u5510\u9806\u4e4b (1507\u20131560)[13] as an example of solid practical scholarship, anticipating the rise of the Changzhou School of Thought and spread of the \"evidential learning\"./nAsteroid 2012 Guo Shou-Jing is named after him, as is the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope near Beijing.", "53398787": "K\u014dkichi Sugihara (Japanese: \u6749\u539f\u539a\u5409, born June 29, 1948, in Gifu Prefecture)[1][2]  is a Japanese mathematician and artist[3] known for his three-dimensional optical illusions that appear to make marbles roll uphill,[4][5] pull objects to the highest point of a building's roof,[6] and make circular pipes look rectangular.[7] His illusions, which often involve videos of three-dimensional objects shown from carefully chosen perspectives,[3] won first place at the Best Illusion of the Year Contest in 2010,[4] 2013,[8] 2018,[9]and 2020[10]\nand second place in 2015[11] and 2016.[7]/nSugihara earned bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in mathematical engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1971, 1973, and 1980 respectively.

He then became an associate professor in the Department of Information and Computer Engineering at Nagoya University in 1981, and moved back to the Department of Mathematical Engineering and Information Physics at the University of Tokyo in 1986. Since 2009 he has been a professor at Meiji University.[12]/nFive of Sugihara's illusions have won awards at the annual Best Illusion of the Year Contest:/nHis interest in illusions stems from his research in the 1980s on automating the analysis of perspective drawings,[3][13] which he published in the 1986 MIT Press book Machine Interpretation of Line Drawings. When he asked his computer system to interpret impossible objects such as the ones in the art of M. C.

He was accepted at King's College, Cambridge, in 1925, but decided to spend a year studying in hopes of gaining admittance to Trinity College, where the standard of mathematics was higher.[2] Coxeter won an entrance scholarship and went to Trinity in 1926 to read mathematics. There he earned his BA (as Senior Wrangler) in 1928, and his doctorate in 1931.[5][6] In 1932 he went to Princeton University for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow, where he worked with Hermann Weyl, Oswald Veblen, and Solomon Lefschetz.[6] Returning to Trinity for a year, he attended Ludwig Wittgenstein's seminars on the philosophy of mathematics.[5] In 1934 he spent a further year at Princeton as a Procter Fellow.[6]/nIn 1936 Coxeter moved to the University of Toronto.

He was tasked with reforming the university from a medieval school concentrated on humanities (philosophy and theology) to a modern scientific institution.[3] Under Poczobutt the university improved its science, medicine, and law departments.[4] As rector of the university he promoted the use of Latin and opposed any use of Polish or Lithuanian languages.[3]/nHe often travelled to London where he ordered astronomical equipment from Jesse Ramsden and John Dollond: a 4-foot transit telescope in 1765, 3.5-foot achromatic telescope in 1770, 8-foot mural quadrant in 1777, and meridian circle in 1788.[2] Other purchases included octant, equatorial, two theodolites, 10-foot sextant.[5] The observatory was expanded by architect Marcin Knackfus in 1782\u20131788 to accommodate the new equipment. Poczobutt observed solar and lunar eclipses, comets and asteroids (including Ceres, Pallas, Juno), and calculated geographic coordinates of settlements in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (including Vilnius and Hrodna).[1] In addition, he made measurements of Mercury to compute its orbit; later this data was used by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande.[6] He described 16-star constellation, which he named Taurus Poniatovii in honour of King Poniatowski (it is now obsolete and considered to be part of the Ophiuchus).[7] His recorded observations amounted to 34 volumes.[6] In 1770 he became the first in Lithuania to systematically measure and record weather temperature (continuous records survive since 1777).[8] Poczobutt was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1771 and a corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1778. He was made a member of the Order of Saint Stanislaus in 1785 and Order of the White Eagle in 1793.[3]", "51694863": "Edward Neuman (born September 19, 1943[1] in Rydu\u0142towy, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland)[2] is a Polish-American mathematician, currently a professor emeritus of mathematics at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.[3]/nNeuman received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wroc\u0142aw in 1972[4] under the supervision of wmpl:Stefan Paszkowski.[5] His dissertation was entitled \"Projections in Uniform Polynomial Approximation.\" He held positions at the Institute of Mathematics and the Institute of Computer Sciences of the University of Wroclaw,[6] and the Institute of Applied Mathematics Bonn[7] in Germany.

He was a member of the prominent Hindu Indo-Trinidadian Capildeo family. Capildeo was the leader of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) from 1960 to 1969 and the first Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of the independent Trinidad and Tobago from 1962 to 1967. He was also a faculty member at the University of London, eventually holding the position of Reader of Mathematics. He was awarded the Trinity Cross, the nation's highest award, in 1969./nRudranath Capildeo was born on the 2nd of February 1920 into a Brahmin Hindu Indo-Trinidadian family at Anand Bhavan (translation: Mansion of Eternal Bliss; aka Lion House) on the Main Road in the city of Chaguanas in Caroni County in the then British-ruled Trinidad and Tobago.[3] His father was Pundit Capil Deo Dubey, an indentured laborer who emigrated from Mahadeva Dubey Village, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, North-Western Provinces, British India (present-day Mahadeva Dubey, Maharajganj, Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India) in 1894, and his mother was Soogee Capildeo (n\u00e9e Gobin).[4] Capildeo was the youngest child of the prominent Capildeo family. He was educated at Queen's Royal College in Port of Spain where he won an island scholarship in 1938.

He also taught briefly at Queen's Royal College (1945) and was Principal of the Polytechnic Institute in Port of Spain in 1959./nCapildeo's entry into politics in the late 1950s was because the political figures who entered the DLP in 1957 did not trust each other, and could only agree on him. Though he left Trinidad in 1939 to study medicine, he changed his course of study, focusing on applied mathematics and physics. He was committed to understanding the nature of space and time, and this sparked his interest in understanding Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity. This work led to several new theories, which had practical implications in aerodynamics and space. They included \"The Flexure Problem in Elasticity\" (Ph.D. thesis) and his study on the \"Theory of Rotation and Gravity\" named Capildeo's Theory, which had applications in early outer-space expeditions in the 1960s and 1970s.[3]/nHis political career was unusual, since he was active only during election campaigns (in 1961 and 1967) and during the summer months. His conduct of the last pre-independence electoral campaign, in 1961, was also unusual, beginning with his declaration that because he understood Einstein he could \"compress the time\" necessary to undo what the sitting government had done. Not only did Capildeo produce many significant mathematical theories and a book on Vector Algebra and Mechanics in 1967, he also studied law in London in 1956. Two years later he was admitted to practice as a barrister-at-law in Trinidad. He founded and led the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) in 1960, and became Leader of the Opposition in the Trinidad & Tobago Parliament (1960\u201367).

He was also the author of the Nong Zheng Quan Shu, a treatise on agriculture. He was one of the \"Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism\"; the Roman Catholic Church considers him a Servant of God.[8]  On April 15, 2011, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi announced the beatification of Xu Guangqi.[9][10]/nXu Guangqi is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of Xu's Chinese name.

In the Jesuits' records, it is the last which is used as his Chinese name, in the form \"Si\u00f9 Hsven H\u00fa\".[11]/nAt his conversion, he adopted the baptismal name Paul (Latin: Paulus). In Chinese, its transcription is employed as a kind of courtesy name (i.e., Xu Baolu) and the Jesuits sometimes referred to him as \"Si\u00f9 Pao L\u00f2\"[11] or Ci\u00f9 Paulus.[12] More often, however, they describe him as \"Doctor Paul\" (Latin: Doctor Paulus;[13][11] Portuguese: Doutor Paulo),[14] \"Our Paul\" (Latin: noster Paulus), or \"Paul Siu\"[15] or \"Ciu\".[12][11][16]/n/nXu Guangqi was born in Shanghai in Southern Zhili's Songjiang Prefecture on April 24, 1562,[1] under China's Ming dynasty. At the time, Shanghai was merely a small walled county seat in the old quarter around the present city's Yu Garden. His family, including an older and younger sister, lived in the Taiqing Quarter at the south end of the town. Guangqi's branch of the Xus were not related to those who had passed the imperial examinations and joined Shanghai's local gentry.[17] His father Xu Sicheng (died\u00a0c.\u20091607)[18] had been orphaned at age 5 and seen most of his inheritance lost to \"Japanese\" pirate raids and insolvent friends in the 1550s.[17]/nAt the time of Guangqi's birth, his father worked twenty mu (1\u00bc\u00a0ha)[19] or less south of the city wall.[20] About half of this would have been used to feed the family,[21] with the rest used to supplement his income from small-scale trading.[17] By the time Guangqi was 6, the family had saved enough to send him to a local school, where a later hagiographer records him piously upbraiding his classmates when they spoke of wanting to use their education for wealth or mystical power. Instead, he supposedly advised, \"None of these things is worth doing. If you want to talk about the sort of person you want to become, then it should be to establish yourself and to follow the Way. Bring order to the state and the people. Revere the orthodox and expose the heterodox. Don't waste the chance to be someone who matters in this world.\"[20] From 1569 to 1573, the family sent Guangqi to the school at the Buddhist monastery at Longhua.[1] It is not recorded, but this school was probably a separate secular and fee-based institution for families too poor to hire private tutors for their sons.[20]/nHis mother died on May 8, 1592, and he undertook the ritual mourning period in her honor.[22] His whereabouts over the next few years are uncertain but he seems to have failed the provincial exam at Beijing in 1594, after the mourning period was over.[22]/nIn 1596, he moved to Xunzhou (now Guiping) in Guangxi to assist its prefect Zhao Fengyu, a Shanghai native who had passed the juren exams in 1555.[22] The next year, he traveled to Beijing in the spring and passed its provincial exam, becoming a juren.[22] He seems to have stayed there for the imperial exam the next year, but failed to pass. He then returned to Shanghai around April, turning his attention to the study of military and agricultural subjects.[22] The next year he studied under Cheng Jiasui.[22]/nHe first met Matteo Ricci, the Italian Jesuit, in Nanjing in March or April 1600.[22] He collaborated with Ricci in translating several classic Western texts\u2014most notably the first part of Euclid's Elements\u2014into Chinese, as well as several Chinese Confucian texts into Latin.[7]  Ricci's influence led to Xu being baptized as a Roman Catholic in 1603. His descendants remained Catholics or Protestants into the 21st century.[citation needed]/nFrom 1607 until 1610, Xu was forced to retire from public office and returned to his home in Shanghai. It was during this time that he experimented with Western-style irrigation methods.[23] He also experimented with the cultivation of sweet potatoes, cotton, and the nu zhen tree.[23] He was called once more to serve the Chinese bureaucracy, where he rose to a high rank and became known late in his career simply as \"The Minister\".[7] Yet he continued to experiment and learn of new agricultural practices while he served his office, promoting the use of wet-rice in the Northeast China.[23] From 1613 until 1620 he often visited Tianjin, where he helped organize self-sufficient military settlements (tun tian).[23]/nIn 1629, memorials by Xu successfully moved the court to permit the Portuguese captain Gon\u00e7alo Teixeira-Correa to bring 10 artillery pieces and 4 \"excellent bombards\" across China to the capital to demonstrate the effectiveness of Western artillery.[13] An earlier demonstration in 1623 had gone disastrously, with an exploding cannon killing one Portuguese artillerist and three Chinese observers, but on this occasion the pieces were accepted and directed to Dengzhou (now Penglai) in Shandong.[24] The Christian convert Ignatius Sun, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Xu's, was governor there[25] and had also been a strong advocate of modernizing China's military. Together with Captain\u00a0Teixeira and his translator Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues, Sun used the pieces to train his troops to oppose the ongoing Manchu invasion. However, Sun's lenient treatment of a 1632 mutiny under Kong Yude and Geng Zhongming permitted them to successfully capture Dengzhou, seize the artillery, and establish an independent power base that eventually joined the Manchus.[25] Xu's memorials for clemency were unsuccessful and Sun was court-martialed and executed.[15]/nHe held the positions of Minister of Rites (\u79ae\u90e8\u5c19\u66f8), overseeing government programs related to culture, education, and foreign affairs, and Deputy Senior Grand Secretary (\u5167\u95a3\u6b21\u8f14), effectively a deputy premier for the imperial cabinet./nJohann Adam Schall von Bell stayed with Xu during his final illness in 1633 and oversaw the return of his body to his family in Shanghai.[26] There, it was publicly displayed at his villa until 1641, when it was buried \"in a time of hardship\".[15]/nXu Guangqi's tomb remains the centerpiece of Shanghai's Guangqi Park on Nandan Road (\u5357\u4e39\u8def), just south of Xujiahui Cathedral./nThe 350th anniversary of his death in 1983 was celebrated very publicly, both with ceremonies in Shanghai and a laudatory article in the Beijing Review. The vocal Communist support for these memorials has been seen as signaling support for Deng Xiaoping's policies of opening up and modernizing China.[27] Most Chinese treatments of his life and legacy, however, focus upon his desire for scientific, technological, and political progress and its effect upon Chinese development, whereas Western treatments nearly universally attach great importance to his Christian conversion and identity.[27]/nXu Guangqi wrote a book on military techniques and strategies entitled Mr Xu's Amateur Observations in response to the criticisms he faced for daring discuss military matters in spite of being a mere scholar.[28] He frequently cited the Xunzi and Guanzi, and made use of rewards and punishments along the lines of the Legalists, at least in relief activities.[29]/nXu Guangqi put forward the concept of a \"Rich Country and Strong Army\" (\u5bcc\u570b\u5f37\u5175), which would be adopted by Japan for its modernization in the end of the 19th century, under the name Fukoku Kyohei./nIn 1607, Xu and Ricci translated the first parts of Euclid's Elements (a treatise on mathematics, geometry, and logic) into Chinese. Some Chinese scholars credit Xu as having \"started China's enlightenment\".[7]/nAfter followers of Xu and Ricci publicly predicted a solar eclipse in 1629, Xu was appointed by the Emperor as the leader of an effort to reform the Chinese calendar. The reform, which constituted the first major collaboration between scientists from Europe and from the Far East, was completed after his death and became known as the Chongzhen calendar.[7] It's notable for systematically introducing the concepts and development of European mathematics and astronomy to China for the first time, including extensive translations and references to Euclid's Elements and the works of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Tycho Brahe, whose Tychonic system was used its main theoretical basis.[30][31]/nXu Guangqi wrote the Complete Treatise on Agriculture, an outstanding agricultural treatise that followed in the tradition of those such as Wang Zhen (wrote the Wang Zhen Nong Shu of 1313 AD) and Jia Sixia (wrote the Chi Min Yao Shu of 535 AD).[32] Like Wang Zhen, Xu lived in troubled times, and was devoted as a patriot to aiding the rural farmers of China.[23] His main interests were in irrigation, fertilizers, famine relief, economic crops, and empirical observation with early notions of chemistry.[23] It was an enormous written work, some 700,000 written Chinese characters, making it 7 times as large as the work of both Jia Sixia and Wang Zhen.[33] Although its final draft was unfinished by Xu Guangqi by the time of his death in 1633, the famous Jiangnan scholar Chen Zilong assembled a group of scholars to edit the draft, publishing it in 1639.[33]/nThe topics covered by his book are as follows:[33]/nXu's only son was John Xu[15] (t\u00a0\u5f90\u9a65, s\u00a0\u5f90\u9aa5, X\u00fa J\u00ec),[3] whose daughter was Candida Xu (\u5f90\u7518\u7b2c\u5927, X\u00fa G\u0101nd\u00ecd\u00e0; 1607\u20131680). A devout Christian, she was recognized as an important patron of Christianity in Jiangnan during the early Qing era.

He was an algebraist, group theorist, and numerical analyst. He is best known for Zorn's lemma, a method used in set theory that is applicable to a wide range of mathematical constructs such as vector spaces, and ordered sets amongst others. Zorn's lemma was first postulated by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1922, and then independently by Zorn in 1935./nZorn was born in Krefeld, Germany. He attended the University of Hamburg. He received his PhD in April 1930 for a thesis on alternative algebras. He published his findings in Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universit\u00e4t Hamburg.[1][2] Zorn showed that split-octonions could be represented by a mixed-style of matrices called Zorn's vector-matrix algebra./nMax Zorn was appointed to an assistant position at the University of Halle. However, he did not have the opportunity to work there for long as he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 because of policies enacted by the Nazis. According to grandson Eric, \"[Max] spoke with a raspy, airy voice most of his life. Few people knew why, because he only told the story after significant prodding, but he talked that way because pro-Hitler thugs who objected to his politics, had battered his throat in a 1933 street fight.\"[3]/nZorn immigrated to the United States and was appointed a Sterling Fellow at Yale University. While at Yale, Zorn wrote his paper \"A Remark on Method in Transfinite Algebra\"[4] that stated his Maximum Principle, later called Zorn's lemma. It requires a set that contains the union of any chain of subsets to have one chain not contained in any other, called the maximal element. He illustrated the principle with applications in ring theory and field extensions. Zorn's lemma is an alternative expression of the axiom of choice, and thus a subject of interest in axiomatic set theory./nIn 1936 he moved to UCLA and remained until 1946. While at UCLA Zorn revisited his study of alternative rings and proved the existence of the nilradical of certain alternative rings.[5] According to Angus E. Taylor, Max was his most stimulating colleague at UCLA.[6]/nIn 1946 Zorn became a professor at Indiana University, where he taught until retiring in 1971. He was thesis advisor for Israel Nathan Herstein./nZorn died in Bloomington, Indiana, in March 1993, of congestive heart failure.[7]/nMax Zorn married Alice Schlottau and they had one son, Jens, and one daughter, Liz. Jens (born June 19, 1931) is an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Michigan and an accomplished sculptor. Max Zorn's grandson Eric Zorn was a columnist for the Chicago Tribune from 1986 until 2021; after retirement Eric Zorn started a Substack newsletter titled \"The Picayune Sentinel\",[8] named after the mathematics newsletter that Max Zorn had distributed during his years at Indiana University.

February 23, 1953) is a mathematician working in different areas of mathematics including group theory, dynamical systems, geometry and computer science. He holds the rank of Distinguished Professor in the Mathematics Department of Texas A&M University. Grigorchuk is particularly well known for having constructed, in a 1984 paper,[1] the first example of a finitely generated group of intermediate growth, thus answering an important problem posed by John Milnor in 1968. This group is now known as the Grigorchuk group[2][3][4][5][6]  and it is one of the important objects studied in geometric group theory, particularly in the study of branch groups, automaton groups and iterated monodromy groups. Grigorchuk is one of the pioneers of asymptotic group theory as well as of the theory of dynamically defined groups. He introduced the notion of branch groups[7][8][9][10] and developed the foundations of the related theory. Grigorchuk, together with his collaborators and students, initiated the theory of groups generated by finite Mealy type automata,[11][12][13] interpreted them as groups of fractal type,[14][15] developed the theory of groups acting on rooted trees,[16] and found numerous applications[17][18][19] of these groups in various fields of mathematics including functional analysis, topology, spectral graph theory, dynamical systems and ergodic theory./nGrigorchuk was born on February 23, 1953, in Ternopil Oblast, now Ukraine (in 1953 part of the USSR).[20]\nHe received his undergraduate degree in 1975 from Moscow State University.\nHe obtained a PhD (Candidate of Science) in Mathematics in 1978, also from Moscow State University, where his thesis advisor was Anatoly M. Stepin. Grigorchuk received a habilitation (Doctor of Science) degree in Mathematics in 1985 at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Moscow.[20] During the 1980s and 1990s, Rostislav Grigorchuk held positions at the Moscow State University of Transportation, and subsequently at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics and Moscow State University.[20] In 2002 Grigorchuk joined the faculty of Texas A&M University as a Professor of Mathematics, and he was promoted to the rank of Distinguished Professor in 2008.[21]/nRostislav Grigorchuk gave an invited address at the 1990 International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto[22] an AMS Invited Address at the March 2004 meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Athens, Ohio[23] and a plenary talk at the 2004 Winter Meeting of the Canadian Mathematical Society.[24]/nGrigorchuk is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal \"Groups, Geometry and Dynamics\",[25] published by the European Mathematical Society, and is or was a member of the editorial boards of the journals \"Mathematical Notes\",[26] \"International Journal of Algebra and Computation\",[27] \"Journal of Modern Dynamics\",[28] \"Geometriae Dedicata\",[29] \"Ukrainian Mathematical Journal\",[30] \"Algebra and Discrete Mathematics\",[31] \"Carpathian Mathematical Publications\",[32] \"Bukovinian Mathematical Journal\",[33]  and \"Matematychni Studii\".[34]/nGrigorchuk is most well known for having constructed the first example of a finitely generated group of intermediate growth which now bears his name and is called the Grigorchuk group (sometimes it is also called the first Grigorchuk group since Grigorchuk constructed several other groups that are also commonly studied). This group has growth that is faster than polynomial but slower than exponential. Grigorchuk constructed this group in a 1980 paper[35] and proved that it has intermediate growth in a 1984 article.[1] This result answered a long-standing open problem posed by John Milnor in 1968 about the existence of finitely generated groups of intermediate growth. Grigorchuk's group has a number of other remarkable mathematical properties. It is a finitely generated infinite residually finite 2-group (that is, every element of the group has a finite order which is a power of 2). It is also the first example of a finitely generated group that is amenable but not elementary amenable, thus providing an answer to another long-standing problem, posed by Mahlon Day in 1957.[36] Also Grigorchuk's group is \"just infinite\": that is, it is infinite but every proper quotient of this group is finite.[2]/nGrigorchuk's group is a central object in the study of the so-called branch groups and automata groups. These are finitely generated groups of automorphisms of rooted trees that are given by particularly nice recursive descriptions and that have remarkable self-similar properties. The study of branch, automata and self-similar groups has been particularly active in the 1990s and 2000s and a number of unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics have been discovered there, including dynamical systems, differential geometry, Galois theory, ergodic theory, random walks, fractals, Hecke algebras,  bounded cohomology, functional analysis, and others. In particular, many of these self-similar groups arise as iterated monodromy groups of complex polynomials. Important connections have been discovered between the algebraic structure of self-similar groups and the dynamical properties of the polynomials in question, including encoding their Julia sets.[37]/nMuch of Grigorchuk's work in the 1990s and 2000s has been on developing the theory of branch, automata and self-similar groups and on exploring these connections. For example, Grigorchuk, with co-authors, obtained a counter-example to the conjecture of Michael Atiyah about L2-betti numbers of closed manifolds.[38][39]/nGrigorchuk is also known for his contributions to the general theory of random walks on groups and the theory of amenable groups, particularly for obtaining in 1980[40] what is commonly known (see for example[41][42][43]) as Grigorchuk's co-growth criterion of amenability for finitely generated groups./nIn 1979 Rostislav Grigorchuk was awarded the Moscow Mathematical Society.[44]/nIn 1991 he obtained Fulbright Senior Scholarship,[45] Columbia University, New York./nIn 2003 an international group theory conference in honor of Grigorchuk's 50th birthday was held in Gaeta, Italy.[46] Special anniversary issues of the \"International Journal of Algebra and Computation\",[47] the journal \"Algebra and Discrete Mathematics\"[20] and the book \"Infinite Groups: Geometric, Combinatorial and Dynamical Aspects\"[48]  were dedicated to Grigorchuk's 50th birthday./nIn 2009 Grigorchuk R.I. was awarded the Association of Former Students Distinguished Achievement in Research,[49] Texas A&M University./nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[50]/nIn 2015 Rostislav Grigorchuk was awarded the AMS Leroy P.

He wrote about every discipline: legal, historical, theological, grammatical, linguistic, astronomy, political, mathematics, archaeology, music, secularism, euthanasia, and the tides.  He wrote speeches, poems, appeals to Catherine II for the liberation of Greece, and hundreds of letters. He edited valuable editions of Byzantine writers and classical books and translated many texts from Latin into French.  He was one of the students of Methodios Anthrakites.  He translated many important foreign language academic documents to Greek.  He was bishop of Cherson (in Crimea).  He was a leading contributor to the Modern Greek Enlightenment.[2]/nHe was born on the island of Corfu, ruled by the Republic of Venice at that time, as Eleftherios Vulgares on 10 August 1716.  He studied in Corfu under Vikentios Damodos, a scholar, and continued his studies in the School of Ioannina (in western Greece) under Athanasios Psalidas./nIn 1737 or 1738 he became a monk and presbyter with the name Eugenios, and afterwards went to the University of Padua to study theology, philosophy, European languages and natural sciences./nIn 1742, Boulgaris became director of an important school of Ioannina, the Maroutsaia. There he was involved in a public dispute with Balanos Vasilopoulos, who was the director of another high level school of the city, regarding the curricula of their respective schools \u2013 Voulgaris arguing for the institution of natural philosophy./nFrom 1753 to 1759 Voulgaris was director of the Athonite Academy (Athoniada Akademia) at Vatopedi Monastery aiming at upgrading the level of studies. There he taught philosophy as well as mathematics. Though he was considered one of the most eminent teachers, his eagerness to communicate some of the new ideas of the western European 'Enlightenment' caused a negative reaction among some Orthodox Christian leaders on Mount Athos. He was eventually forced to abandon the school in the beginning of 1759./nHe then temporarily headed the Patriarchal Academy in Constantinople (known to Greeks as the \"Great School of the Nation\"). However, in 1761 he permanently abandoned his educational career./nAlthough Eugenios was associated by some Orthodox Christians with the unsuccessful attempt to found a Western-style academy on Mt. Athos and at the Patriarchal Academy, he was also a strong opponent of Uniate and Roman Catholic proselytising among other Christians; and in his correspondence with Pierre Leclerc,[3] the French Catholic Jansenist theologian sympathetic to Orthodox Christian traditions, he says that since the time of the Schism Orthodox Christians have been blessed with many saints and martyrs equal to the ancients and with a bounty of miracles: \"Our Church is continuously glorified and made wondrous by God, no less after the Schism than before it, and up to our times\" (Epistle of Eugenios Voulgaris to Pierre Leclerc, first edition, by Andreas Koromelas [Athens, 1844], p.\u00a068).[4]/nAfter his unsuccessful attempts to introduce Enlightenment ideas to the Athonite School and Patriarchal Academy Eugenios accepted the patronage of the Russian Empress Catherine II, and spent the rest of his career in Russia. In 1763 he went to Leipzig and Berlin at the invitation of Empress Catherine.  In 1771 he arrived at St. Petersburg, and between 1772 and 1774 worked as a librarian at the court./nIn 1775 he was ordained archbishop, and became the first archbishop of the newly created Eparchy (Diocese) of Slaviansk and Cherson.[dubious  \u2013 discuss]\nThe new diocese included lands of the Novorossiya and Azov Governorates north of the Black Sea, recently conquered by Russia from the Ottoman Crimean Khanate. \nAlong with Russians and Ukrainians Orthodox Greeks were invited to settle in the region, and the Imperial Government thought it appropriate to appoint a Greek-speaking bishop to preside over the new diocese.[5][6] Despite its name, the seat of the bishop was in neither Slaviansk (soon to be renamed Nikopol) nor Cherson, but in the more centrally located city of Poltava; where the Monastery of the Exaltation of the Cross (Russian: \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0440\u044c, Krestovozdvizhensky Monastyr) became the bishop's residence. The following year (1776), Eugenios invited another Corfiot, Nikephoros Theotokis, to join him in Poltava, and started training the younger Greek as his successor. In 1779, Eugenios retired, although he continued to live in the same monastery in Poltava, while Nicephoros took over the diocese.[5][6]\n[7]/nIn 1787 Boulgaris was allowed to move to St. Petersburg. From 1801 until the end of his life the retired bishop lived there in Alexander Nevsky Lavra. In 1788 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[8]/nHe died on 12 June 1806, and was buried in the Lavra's Church of St. Theodor (Fyodorovskaya Tserkov)[5]/nThe 18th century dawned in the Greek East with Orthodox Christians estranged from both groups of western Christians. While they remained largely uninvolved in dialogue with western Christians until the 19th century, they nevertheless grappled with new intellectual challenges emanating from the west in the form of secular learning.[9] In this period Eugenios Voulgaris was one of the most influential Greek writers. Although he was strictly an Orthodox Christian, he tried to convey the ideas of this western European Enlightenment to Greek Orthodox cultural circles, through translations and teaching of the works of John Locke, Voltaire, and Christian Wolff. Voulgaris' model for the revival and development of learning in Orthodox Christian society included the maintenance of training in the classics combined with an exposure to modern European philosophy.[9]/nThe discussion on the Greek language question began at the end of the 18th century. Because western Europeans were familiar with, and valued, the ancient Greek language, Eugenios Voulgaris, along with Lambros Photiadis, Stephanos Commitas (1770\u20131832) and Neophytos Doukas, proposed that the modern Greek language should be archaised[10] and assimilated to Ancient Greek, while his students Iosipos Moisiodax (1725\u20131800) and Dimitrios Katartzis (c. 1725\u20131807) preferred the use of the contemporary vernacular language as it had evolved (Dimotiki). This discussion would become crucial when it was to be decided which form should be the official language of the modern Greek state./nThe humanist scholar Adamantios Korais (1748\u20131833) also influenced this discussion. While supporting the language of the people, Korais sought to 'cleanse' it from elements that he considered 'vulgar' and evolved the 'purifying' or Katharevousa forms, which were supposedly set at some midpoint between ancient and contemporary Greek./nIn his Treatise on Euthanasia (1804), Bishop Eugenios tried to moderate the fear of death by exalting the power of faith and trust in the divine providence, and by presenting death as a universal necessity, a curative physician and a safe harbour. He presented his views in the form of a consoling sermon, enriched with references to classical texts, the Bible and the Church Fathers, as well as to secular sources, including statistics from contemporary Britain and France. Besides euthanasia he introduced terms such as dysthanasia (\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1), etoimothanasia (\u1f11\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) and prothanasia (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). The Treatise on Euthanasia is one of the first books, if not the very first, devoted to euthanasia in modern European thought, and a remarkable text for the study of developing attitudes towards \"good death\". In the Treatise 'euthanasia' is clearly meant as a spiritual preparation and reconciliation with dying rather than the physician-related mercy-killing that the term came to mean during the 19th and the 20th centuries. This text has been studied not only by the historian of medical or religious ethics, but by many trying to confront death, in private or professional settings.[11]", "53890402": "Volodymyr Mazorchuk (born 1972) is a Ukrainian-Swedish mathematician at Uppsala University and was awarded the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson Prize in 2016.[1][2]/nHe received his PhD in mathematics from Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv in 1996 with advisor Yuriy Drozd.[3]/n/nThis article about a Swedish mathematician is a stub.

He eventually became head of Referat Ia of Group IV of the organization in November 1944[2] engaged in research into German Army hand cryptographic systems.[3] Prior to that period Marquart had been chief cryptanalysis in KONA 5.[2]/nMarquart was educated in the Oberrealschule in Erolzheim. He then attended the University of T\u00fcbingen, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, University of Vienna and the Goethe University Frankfurt. From Frankfurt University in 1932, he received his degree (German: diplomierter Mathematiker) in mathematics.[3] He was employed as Actuarial Mathematician   (German: Versicherungsmathematik) until 1940, when he was employed into the Signal Corps of the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS (German: Nachrichtentruppe des Heeres).[3] In 1940 Marquart was posted to OKH/In 7/VI as an employee (German: Angestellter) and for the first year carried out research on German hand ciphers. From 1940 to 1941, Marquart assisted Hans Pietsch, who was director of the mathematical cryptography department at In 7/VI, on hand ciphers, while working as a civilian.[4]/nIn 1942, he was drafted to In 7/VI with the rank of Sonderf\u00fchrer, equivalent to the military rank of Major, and was put in charge of a series of courses in elementary cryptanalysis, which work he continued until 1944.[4] He was then promoted to Government technical expert (German: Regierungsbaurat) and was given command over Referat Ia for special research. Marquart's speciality at OKH had been research on the possibility of solution of hand ciphers, and after that with the hand cyphers of foreign countries which were passed to Section Ia from the various (German: Laender) sections of Referat IV.[3][4]/nAfter the war, Marquart worked in the German insurance firm, Allianz Lebensversicherung in Stuttgart, as a field insurance agent for the territory around Mittelbiberach, that at the time was part of the French Zone.[3]/nAs head of special research section for hand ciphers, Marquart's work was of a varied nature. Marquart worked on the following hand ciphers:/nThis Josip Broz Tito cipher consisted of the alphabet substituted into figures in such a way that the commonest letters were allotted one figure equivalents while the rarer letters were expressed as figure digraphs. The resulting figures were then reciphered (recencrypted) by a periodic additive, the length of which varied from time to time. At first, the period was very short (5,7 or 9); later it rose to 35 or 45 and at the end, Marquart thought that it was used on a one-time basis, since no further successes could be achieved.[4]/nThe Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 hand cipher was a Double Transposition cipher, using the same key for both cages, the keys being derived from a novel. Marquarts section achieved a fair measure of success with this system, owing to errors in encipherment, stereotyped signatures and also the fact that the cages were often filled up to rectangles with rare letters. Under such circumstances, it was often possible to recover the key from a single message. In some cases, by working out the basic text from which the keys had been derived, they were able to recognize and obtain the novel and hence to read all message traffic currently. All cryptanalytic work on the double transposition systems was carried out entirely by hand by Marquart, and no attempt was made to develop any statistical machine methods for solution.[4]/nThis code used two different keys, which were taken from a large group. Marquart was unable to guess at the size of the book that had never been captured. His work was looking for errors in encipherment which happened rarely and for messages in depth, which practically never occurred.[4]/nMarquart conducted research in the Soviet Union Blocknot traffic. Blocknots were random sequences of numbers contained in a book and organized by numbered rows and columns and were used as additives in reciphering. Marquart and his unit conducted extensive research in an attempt to discover the method by which they were produced.[4] All the counts which they made, however, failed to reveal any non-random characteristics in the design of the tables, and while they thought the Blocknots must have been generated by machine, they were never able to draw any concrete deductions as a result of their research./nLastly, Marquart worked on a system used by the military forces of the Lublin Government just before the end of the war.[4]", "56413562": "The Turing Guide, written by Jack Copeland, Jonathan Bowen, Mark Sprevak,[1] Robin Wilson, and others and published in 2017, is a book about the work and life of the British mathematician, philosopher, and early computer scientist, Alan Turing (1912\u20131954)./nThe book includes 42 contributed chapters by a variety of authors, including some contemporaries of Alan Turing.

His work in World War II led to the construction of Colossus,[6] the world's first operational, programmable electronic computer, and he established the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester, which produced the world's first working, stored-program electronic computer in 1948, the Manchester Baby.[7][8][9][10][11]/nNewman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in Chelsea, London, England, to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897.[4] His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of Bromberg (now in Poland), who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15.[12] Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann Pike, an Irish schoolteacher, in 1896.[1]/nThe family moved to Dulwich in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then City of London School from 1908.[1][13] At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well.[14]/nNewman won a scholarship to study mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.[4]/nNewman's studies were interrupted by World War I. His father was interned as an enemy alien after the start of the war in 1914, and upon his release he returned to Germany. In 1916, Herman changed his name by deed poll to the anglicised \"Newman\" and Sarah did likewise in 1920.[15] In January 1917, Newman took up a teaching post at Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School in York, leaving in April 1918. He spent some months in the Royal Army Pay Corps, and then taught at Chigwell School for six months in 1919 before returning to Cambridge.[12] He was called up for military service in February 1918, but claimed conscientious objection due to his beliefs and his father's country of origin, and thereby avoided any direct role in the fighting.[16]/nNewman resumed his interrupted studies in October 1919, and graduated in 1921 as a Wrangler (equivalent to a First) in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, and gained distinction in Schedule B (the equivalent of Part III).[4][12] His dissertation considered the use of \"symbolic machines\" in physics, foreshadowing his later interest in computing machines.[14]/nOn 5 November 1923, Newman was elected a Fellow of St John's.[1] He worked on the foundations of combinatorial topology, and proposed that a notion of equivalence be defined using only three elementary \"moves\".[4] Newman's definition avoided difficulties that had arisen from previous definitions of the concept.[4] Publishing over twenty papers established his reputation as an \"expert in modern topology\".[14] Newman wrote Elements of the topology of plane sets of points,[5] a work on general topology and undergraduate text.[17] He also published papers on mathematical logic, and solved a special case of Hilbert's fifth problem.[1]/nHe was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1927.[4] His 1935 lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics and G\u00f6del's theorem inspired Alan Turing to embark on his work on the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) that had been posed by Hilbert and Ackermann in 1928.[18] Turing's solution involved proposing a hypothetical programmable computing machine.[19][20] In spring 1936, Newman was presented by Turing with a draft of \"On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\". He realised the paper's importance and helped ensure swift publication.[14] Newman subsequently arranged for Turing to visit Princeton where Alonzo Church was working on the same problem but using his Lambda calculus.[12] During this period, Newman started to share Turing's dream of building a stored-program computing machine.[21]/nDuring this time at Cambridge, he developed close friendships with Patrick Blackett, Henry Whitehead and Lionel Penrose.[14]/nIn September 1937, Newman and his family accepted an invitation to work for six months at Princeton. At Princeton, he worked on the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture and, in his final weeks there, presented a proof. However, in July 1938, after he returned to Cambridge, Newman discovered that his proof was fatally flawed.[14]/nIn 1939, Newman was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[14]/nIn December 1934, he married Lyn Lloyd Irvine, a writer, with Patrick Blackett as best man.[1] They had two sons, Edward (born 1935) and William (born 1939).[12]/nThe United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Newman's father was Jewish, which was of particular concern in the face of Nazi Germany, and Lyn, Edward and William were evacuated to America in July 1940, where they spent three years before returning to England in October 1943. After Oswald Veblen \u2014 maintaining 'that every able-bodied man ought to be carrying a gun or hand-grenade and fight for his country'\u2014 opposed moves to bring him to Princeton, Newman remained at Cambridge and at first continued research and lecturing.[12]/nBy spring 1942, Newman was considering involvement in war work. He made enquiries. After Patrick Blackett recommended him to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Newman was sounded out by Frank Adcock in connection with the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.[12]/nNewman was cautious, concerned to ensure that the work would be sufficiently interesting and useful, and there was also the possibility that his father's German nationality would rule out any involvement in top-secret work.[22] The potential issues were resolved by the summer, and he agreed to arrive at Bletchley Park on 31 August 1942. Newman was invited by F. L. (Peter) Lucas to work on Enigma but decided to join Tiltman's group working on Tunny.[12]/nNewman was assigned to the Research Section and set to work on a German teleprinter cipher known as \"Tunny\". He joined the \"Testery\" in October.[23] Newman enjoyed the company[14] but disliked the work and found that it was not suited to his talents.[4] He persuaded his superiors that Tutte's method could be mechanised, and he was assigned to develop a suitable machine in December 1942. Shortly afterwards, Edward Travis (then operational head of Bletchley Park) asked Newman to lead research into mechanised codebreaking.[12]/nWhen the war ended, Newman was presented with a silver tankard inscribed 'To MHAN from the Newmanry, 1943\u201345'.[14]/nConstruction started in January 1943, and the first prototype was delivered in June 1943.[24] It was operated in Newman's new section, termed the \"Newmanry\", was housed initially in Hut 11 and initially staffed by himself, Donald Michie, two engineers, and 16 Wrens.[25] The Wrens nicknamed the machine the \"Heath Robinson\", after the cartoonist of the same name who drew humorous drawings of absurd mechanical devices.[25]/nThe Robinson machines were limited in speed and reliability. Tommy Flowers of the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill had experience of thermionic valves and built an electronic machine, the Colossus computer which was installed in the Newmanry. This was a great success and ten were in use by the end of the war./nIn September 1945, Newman was appointed head of the Mathematics Department and to the Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Manchester.[21][26]/nI am ... hoping to embark on a computing machine section here, having got very interested in electronic devices of this kind during the last two or three years ... I am of course in close touch with Turing./nNewman lost no time in establishing the renowned Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at the University.[26] In February 1946, he wrote to John von Neumann, expressing his desire to build a computing machine.[21] The Royal Society approved Newman's grant application in July 1946.[21] Frederic Calland Williams and Thomas Kilburn, experts in electronic circuit design, were recruited from the Telecommunications Research Establishment.[21][26] Kilburn and Williams built Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program digital computer based on Alan Turing's and John von Neumann's ideas.[21][26]/nNow let's be clear before we go any further that neither Tom Kilburn nor I knew the first thing about computers when we arrived at Manchester University... Newman explained the whole business of how a computer works to us./nAfter the Automatic Computing Engine suffered delays and set backs, Turing accepted Newman's offer and joined the Computer Machine Laboratory in May 1948 as Deputy Director (there being no Director). Turing joined Kilburn and Williams to work on Baby's successor, the Manchester Mark I. Collaboration between the University and Ferranti later produced the Ferranti Mark I, the first mass-produced computer to go on sale.[21]/nNewman retired in 1964 to live in Comberton, near Cambridge. After Lyn's death in 1973, he married Margaret Penrose, widow of his friend Lionel Penrose, father of Sir Roger Penrose.[14][27]/nHe continued to do research on combinatorial topology during a period when England was a major centre of activity notably Cambridge under the leadership of Christopher Zeeman. Newman made important contributions leading to an invitation to present his work at the 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm at the age of 65, and proved a Generalized Poincar\u00e9 conjecture for topological manifolds in 1966./nAt the age of 85, Newman began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease. He died in Cambridge two years later.[14]/nThe Newman Building at Manchester was named in his honour. The building housed the pure mathematicians from the Victoria University of Manchester between moving out of the Mathematics Tower in 2004 and July 2007 when the School of Mathematics moved into its new Alan Turing Building, where a lecture room is named in his honour./nIn 1946, Newman declined the offer of an OBE as he considered the offer derisory.[25] Alan Turing had been appointed an OBE six months earlier and Newman felt that it was inadequate recognition of Turing's contribution to winning the war, referring to it as the \"ludicrous treatment of Turing\".[12]", "1494427": "Ken Keeler is an American television producer and writer.

Scant information exists about his early life.  It is only known that as a 23-year-old he matriculated at the Krak\u00f3w Academy (now Jagiellonian University), where he remained through nearly all his life, teaching there for two decades.  He served as the academy's dean, as procurator (administrator of its property), and as head of the Bursa Hungarorum (\"Hungarians' Dormitory\")./nAlbert is remembered as a remarkable teacher.  At the Krak\u00f3w Academy he impressed students by his extraordinary knowledge of literature, and taught mathematics and astronomy.  When in 1490 he became a bachelor of theology, he also lectured on Aristotle's philosophy.  These lectures were attended by Nicolaus Copernicus, who enrolled at the academy in 1491.  A major accomplishment of Albert's was his modernization of the teaching of astronomy by introducing the most up-to-date  texts./nAlbert was well versed in Georg von Peuerbach's Theory of the Planets and Regiomontanus' Astronomical Tables.  He was skeptical of the geocentric system.  He was the first to state that the Moon moves in an ellipse and always shows its same side to the Earth.[5]/nHe drew up tables for calculating the positions of heavenly bodies.  In 1482 he wrote a Commentariolum super Theoricas novas planetarum Georgii Purbachii [...] per Albertum de Brudzewo \u2014 a commentary on Georg von Peuerbach's text, Theoricae novae planetarum \u2013 New Theories of the Planets \u2014 published in Milan, Mediolani, in 1495, by his pupil, Jan Otto de Kraceusae with this title Commentaria utilissima in theoricis planetarum./nBesides Copernicus, Albert's students included the mathematician Bernard Wapowski and the German poet and Renaissance humanist, Conrad Celtis, who in Krak\u00f3w established the first Central European literary society, Sodalitas Litterana Vistulana./nIn 1495, at the behest of Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiello\u0144czyk (Frederick Jagiellon), Brudzewski moved to Vilnius as secretary to Grand Duke of Lithuania Aleksander Jagiellon, who would later become King Alexander of Poland.  He served the Grand Duke as a diplomat; one of his most important missions involved negotiations with Muscovy's Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  It was in Vilnius that Albert wrote his treatise, Conciliator, the original of which has not yet been found./nAlbert of Brudzewo died in Vilnius.  The exact date of his death is not known; some sources state that he died at the age of fifty.[6]/nAlbert of Brudzewo or Albert Brudzewski was seen as influential and persuasive astronomer, a fictionalist, and an opponent of Averroes. Averroes disagreed with the majority of the astronomer Ptolemy's work. He believed that Ptolemy's devices and principles disobeyed the fundamental principles and basic consequences of Aristotle's physics. Averroes worked to replace the Ptolemaic astronomical system with a novel system that was similar to a system created by Eudoxus. Albert Brudzewski disagreed and criticized Averroes immediately. The major dispute was the figuring out the number of celestial orbs or spheres that lay in the heavens. Averroes refused to believe that there was a ninth sphere in the heavens. He believed that the creation of all celestial beings had to arise from the stars, but the ninth sphere did not possess any stars, so this could not be true. Albert Brudzewski argued with this and said that the heavens possessed more than ten spheres. He believed that the Sun itself had three spheres and the planets had their own as well.[7]/nTo make sense and clarify to his followers, Brudzewski said that the terms 'orb' or 'sphere' had three meanings of interpretation. The first meaning could be the whole entire heavens was designated into a single object which was the orb or sphere. This object was not separate from the whole heavens yet it could exist by itself. The second meaning he paralleled it to the sphere or orb from George Peurbach's Theoricae novae planetarum although it was unconventional, it still existed in the heavens. The third meaning or clarification of orb was an orb that was aligned with the Earth. The third meaning was actually a collection of orbs that was crucial to the motion of a planet.[7]/nAlbert Brudzewski further disputes Averroes by depending on the assumptions of Aristotle. He said that Aristotle demonstrated and verified five claims about the heavens that could disprove Averroes. The first claim was that the heavens was a simple being. The second claim was that because the heavens was a simple being, the motion of the being also had to be simple and uncomplicated. There could only be one motion and it had to follow the laws of nature. The third claim was that any motion that did not follow the laws of nature had to have an addition motion that did follow the laws of nature. The fourth claim was that a single sphere or orb could not be moved by several motions because it was a simple body. The fifth claim was that any superior or greater orb could have an impact on lesser orbs and spheres but the lesser orbs and spheres could not have any leverage on the superior's ones.[7]/nTo finally disprove Averroes, Albert Brudzewski mentions the three recognizable motions of the sphere of fixed stars. The first motion was that the sphere possessed a daily rotation that occurred from the East to the West. The second motion was movement of the sphere in the opposition direction from West to East. The third motion was a cyclical motion that Brudzewski named trepidation. Brudzewski gave these three motions to the last three spheres respectively. With the assumptions of Aristotle as well as the motions of the sphere of the fixed stars, Brudzewski is able to prove that Averroes is wrong about the number of celestial spheres in the heavens.[7]/nAlbert Brudzewski was known as a fictionalist. He did not think that the motions of the heavens were understood by any human.[8] Richard of Wallingford, an astronomer in the 1300s, had an opposing view for the spheres of the planets. He claimed that no mortal knows whether eccentrics truly exist in the spheres of the planets, but spirits could give humans revelations about the true planetary motion of the heavens through mathematicians.[7] This claim limits the astronomical knowledge of mortals and suggests that spirits do not have the same limitations. Brudzewski acknowledges the existence of these viewpoints but criticized their validity. To astronomers, spirits had an accurate knowledge of the number of celestial orbs. Although, he did not want to discredit the ability of mortals to make claims based on astronomical observations. Albert Brudzewski made the claim for the fundamental principle of astrology that the heavens exert causal influences on the earth.[7]/nThe paths of planets were thought to be moved by orbs instead of circles. This was a claim by Brudzeski about causal relationships between the planets and their motion. With this view, he disagreed with Averroes about the number of orbs, the concept of epicycles and eccentric circles, and on theoretical orbs. Brudzewski was seen as a source for some of Copernicus's work on orbs, specifically with the Tusi Couple.[7]/nTusi's couple was known as an epicycle arrangement that creates straight line motion of the planets, created by Copernicus.[9] Some think that Brudzewski is the source for Copernicus's model of the Tusi couple. Albert does account for the moon and its double epicycles where he mentions a spot on the moon.[7] The spot on the moon is the problem of explaining the appearance of the face of the moon when always viewing the Earth. These views were not aligned with the Tusi couple. Although, it is speculated that Copernicus could have encountered such a model, where the primary epicycle carries the center of a second epicycle. This is not the Tusi couple, but it could be slightly changed to match its model. The spot on the moon that is always viewed from the Earth would not appear if there was no epicyclical motion of the moon. The motion of the moon was termed as \"prosneusis motion\" which was part of the lunar theory. This motion means motion of inclination and turning, which corresponds to the single epicycle in Ptolemy's theory of the moon, and the two epicycles in Brudzewski's model.[7]/nBrudzewski was aware of the possibility of linear motions from circular motions based on his model of Mercury's motion. This could be an alternative way that Copernicus generated his idea of linear motion for the Tusi couple. Although it seems that Copernicus used Albert's ideas, he highly relied on Islamic sources for the Tusi couple. Copernicus's parameters for the moon are exactly the same as those of Ibn ash-Sh\u0101tir. It is unclear where Copernicus truly got his ideas.[7]", "6409655": "Maryam Mirzakhani (Persian: \u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062e\u0627\u0646\u06cc, pronounced [m\u00e6\u027e\u02c8j\u00e6m mi\u02d0\u027ez\u0251\u02d0x\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ni\u02d0]; 12 May 1977\u00a0\u2013 14 July 2017) was an Iranian[5][4] mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Stanford University.[6][7] Her research topics included Teichm\u00fcller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry.[5] On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani was honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics,[8][9] becoming the first woman to win the prize, as well as the first Iranian.[10] The award committee cited her work in \"the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\".[11]/nOn 14 July 2017, Mirzakhani died of breast cancer at the age of 40.[12]/nMirzakhani was born on 12 May 1977[13][3] in Tehran, Iran.[14] As a child, she attended Tehran Farzanegan School, part of the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET).

Mirzakhani's early work solved the problem of counting simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces by finding a relationship to volume calculations on moduli space. Geodesics are the natural generalization of the idea of a \"straight line\" to \"curved spaces\". Slightly more formally, a curve is a geodesic if no slight deformation can make it shorter. Closed geodesics are geodesics which are also closed curves\u2014that is, they are curves that close up into loops. A closed geodesic is simple if it does not cross itself.[26]/nA previous result, known as the \"prime number theorem for geodesics\", established that the number of closed geodesics of length less than \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n grows exponentially with \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n \u2013 it is asymptotic to \n\n\n\n\ne\n\nL\n\n\n\n/\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e^{L}/L}\n\n. However, the analogous counting problem for simple closed geodesics remained open, despite being \"the key object to unlocking the structure and geometry of the whole surface,\" according to University of Chicago topologist Benson Farb.[27] Mirzakhani's 2004 PhD thesis solved this problem, showing that the number of simple closed geodesics of length less than \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n is polynomial in \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n. Explicitly, it is asymptotic to \n\n\n\nc\n\nL\n\n6\ng\n\u2212\n6\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle cL^{6g-6}}\n\n, where \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n is the genus (roughly, the number of \"holes\") and \n\n\n\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c}\n\n is a constant depending on the hyperbolic structure. This result can be seen as a generalization of the theorem of the three geodesics for spherical surfaces.[28][29]/nMirzakhani solved this counting problem by relating it to the problem of computing volumes in moduli space\u2014a space whose points correspond to different complex structures on a surface genus \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n. In her thesis, Mirzakhani found a volume formula for the moduli space of bordered Riemann surfaces of genus \n\n\n\ng\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g}\n\n with \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n geodesic boundary components. From this formula followed the counting for simple closed geodesics mentioned above, as well as a number of other results. This led her to obtain a new proof for the formula discovered by Edward Witten and Maxim Kontsevich on the intersection numbers of tautological classes on moduli space.[6][30]/nHer subsequent work focused on Teichm\u00fcller dynamics of moduli space. In particular, she was able to prove the long-standing conjecture that William Thurston's earthquake flow on Teichm\u00fcller space is ergodic.[31] One can construct a simple earthquake map by cutting a surface along a finite number of disjoint simple closed geodesics, sliding the edges of each of these cut past each other by some amount, and closing the surface back up. One can imagine the surface being cut by strike-slip faults. An earthquake is a sort of limit of simple earthquakes, where one has an infinite number of geodesics, and instead of attaching a positive real number to each geodesic, one puts a measure on them./nIn 2014, with Alex Eskin and with input from Amir Mohammadi, Mirzakhani proved that complex geodesics and their closures in moduli space are surprisingly regular, rather than irregular or fractal.[32][33] The closures of complex geodesics are algebraic objects defined in terms of polynomials and therefore, they have certain rigidity properties, which is analogous to a celebrated result that Marina Ratner arrived at during the 1990s.[33] The International Mathematical Union said in its press release that \"It is astounding to find that the rigidity in homogeneous spaces has an echo in the inhomogeneous world of moduli space.\"[33]/nMirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for \"her outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces\".[34] The award was made in Seoul at the International Congress of Mathematicians on 13 August.[35] At the time of the award, Jordan Ellenberg explained her research to a popular audience:/n[Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other things, she studies billiards. But now, in a move very characteristic of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just one billiard table, but the universe of all possible billiard tables. And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern the motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange planet around the universe of all possible tables\u00a0... This isn't the kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's the kind of thing you do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to expose the dynamics at the heart of geometry; for there's no question that they're there.[36]/nIn 2014, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran congratulated her for winning the award.[37]/nMirzakhani has an Erd\u0151s number of 3.[38]/nIn 2008, Mirzakhani married Jan Vondr\u00e1k, a Czech theoretical computer scientist and applied mathematician who currently is a professor at Stanford University.[39][40] They had a daughter.[41] Mirzakhani lived in Palo Alto, California.[42]/nMirzakhani described herself as a \"slow\" mathematician, saying that \"you have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math.\" To solve problems, Mirzakhani would draw doodles on sheets of paper and write mathematical formulas around the drawings. Her daughter described her mother's work as \"painting\".[22][43]/nShe declared:/nI don't have any particular recipe [for developing new proofs]\u00a0...

Rouhani said in his message that \"the unprecedented brilliance of this creative scientist and modest human being, who made Iran's name resonate in the world's scientific forums, was a turning point in showing the great will of Iranian women and young people on the path towards reaching the peaks of glory and in various international arenas.\"[22]/nUpon her death, several Iranian newspapers, along with President Hassan Rouhani, broke taboo and published photographs of Mirzakhani with her hair uncovered. Although most newspapers used photographs with a dark background, digital manipulation, and even paintings to \"hide\" her hair,[10][46] this gesture was widely noted in the western press and on social media.[47][48] Mirzakhani's death has also renewed debates within Iran regarding matrilineal citizenship for children of mixed-nationality parentage; Fars News Agency reported that, subsequent to Mirzakhani's death, 60 Iranian MPs urged the speeding up of an amendment to a law that would allow children of Iranian mothers married to foreigners to be given Iranian nationality, in order to make it easier for Mirzakhani's daughter to visit Iran.[10][47]/nNumerous obituaries and tributes were published in the days following Mirzakhani's death.[49][50] As a result of advocacy carried out by the Women's Committee within the Iranian Mathematical Society (Persian: \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0646 \u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0636\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646), the International Council for Science agreed to declare Mirzakhani's birthday, 12 May, as International Women in Mathematics Day in respect of her memory.[51][52]/nVarious establishments have also taken after Mirzakhani's namesake in honor of her life and achievements.

Acknowledged as the \"father of glacier photogrammetry\";[1][2] he pioneered the use of repeat photography as a temporal surveying instrument in measurement of the geology and structure of the Alps and their glacier flows.[3] The measurement techniques he developed and the data he produced are still in use to discover evidence for climate change.[4][5][a][7][8]/nSebastian Finsterwalder was born 4 October 1862 in Rosenheim, son of Johann Nepomuk Finsterwalder, a master baker from Antdorf near Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, and Anna Amman of Rosenheim.[9] He died 4 December 1951 in Munich[10]).[11] He was a Bavarian mathematician and surveyor.[12] In 1892 he married Franziska Mallepell (d. 1953) from Brixen, South Tyrol. Their two sons worked in similar fields; Richard Finsterwalder\u00a0[de] (1899-1963), Professor at the Technical University in Hanover and Munich, and Ulrich Finsterwalder (1897-1988), a civil engineer./nA keen mountaineer, Finsterwalder became interested, through the influence of his friend E. Richter, in alpine fossils as indicators of the geology and structure of the Alps and their glaciers. His desire for accurate, but also less costly, motion measurements on glaciers led him to glaciological applications of photogrammetry in geodesy.[13]/nIn 1886, aged 24, he received his doctorate from the University of T\u00fcbingen, under the guidance of the algebraic geometer Alexander von Brill. Finsterwalder observed that Rudolf Sturm's analysis of the \"homography problem\" (1869) can be used to solve the problem of 3D-reconstruction using point matches in two images; which is the mathematical foundation of photogrammetry./nFinsterwalder pioneered geodetic surveys in the high mountains. At the age of 27 years he conducted a first glacier mapping project at Vernagtferner in the \u00d6tztal Alps, Austria./nFollowing the 1878 work of Italian engineer Pio Paganini of the Istituto Geografico Militare[b] and others,[c] Finstenwalder advanced methods for reconstruction and measurements of three-dimensional objects from photographic images./nHe was appointed professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1891, succeeding his teacher, A. Voss, at the Department of Analytical Geometry, Differential and Integral Calculus (remaining at the university for forty years until 1931). The next year, he married, and completed the first recording of the Bavarian glacier in Wettersteingebirge and the Berchtesgaden Alps./nHe applied the technique of plane table photogrammetry in addition to a conventional geodetic survey, assisted by the novel lightweight, accurate phototheodolite that he had developed for high-mountain applications. The device was based on the prototype phototheodolite developed by Albrecht Meydenbauer\u00a0[de] (1834-1921) for architectural applications. From 1890 Finsterwalder also employed aerial photography,[16] reconstituting the topography of the area of Gars am Inn in 1899 from a pair of balloon photographs using mathematical calculations of many points in the images.[17]/nIn 1897 Finsterwalder addressed the German Mathematical Society, and he described some of the results of projective geometry he was applying to photogrammetry.[18] His theory of large triangle meshes became known as the \"Finsterwaldersche fields method\" (1915). His analytical approach was laborious however, prompting development of analogue instrumentation with stereo measurement permitting faster optical/mechanical reconstruction of the photographic data arrays to determine object points.[19] This was assisted by new technology; Carl Pulfrich's stereocomparator (1901) and Eduard Ritter von Orel's stereoautograph (1907), both instruments built by the company Carl Zeiss.[20]/nIn 1911 he took over the chair of descriptive geometry, turning down offers of appointment from Vienna, Berlin and Potsdam./nFelix Klein commissioned Finsterwalder while the latter was professor of mathematics at the Munich polytechnic, to write on aerodynamics for his Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen (EMW) (tr. 'Encyclopedia of mathematical sciences including their applications'). The article, which he submitted in August 1902, more than a year before the Wrights achieved powered flight is thus prescient in its insights into the mathematics behind this new field of engineering. Finsterwalder also worked with Martin Kutta (1867-1944) at the Institute in Munich to devise formulas relating to the lift on an aerofoil in terms of the circulation round it. Kutta's habilitation thesis, completed in the same year, 1902, with which Finsterwalder assisted, contains the Kutta-Joukowski theorem giving the lift on an aerofoil./nIn 1922 Finsterwalder mapped the topography of the \u00d6tztal Alps[d] focusing on two glaciers, i.e. Gepatschferner\u00a0[de] and Wei\u00dfseeferner\u00a0[de], using stereophotogrammetry.[21] During this work he discovered \u00d6lgruben\u00a0[de] rock glacier and the rock glacier north of Krummgampenspitze\u00a0[de].[22] In 1923 and 1924 Finsterwalder measured a flow velocity profile across \u00d6lgruben rock glacier.[23][24] Because of Finsterwalder's efforts, \u00d6lgruben rock glacier became the subject of a notably extended, longitudinal study of flow velocity with high value in climate research,[25] with repeat surveys undertaken by Wolfgang Pillewizer in 1938, 1939, and 1953 using photogrammetry,[26] and which is still ongoing, employing modern satellite-based positioning techniques.[27] His son Richard assisted in the mapping project in the \u00d6tztal Alps and went on to advance his father's studies./nUnder his leadership the Bavarian International Commission for Geodesy undertook precise gravity measurements with relative gravimeters throughout Bavaria.", "64638402": "Donald Steven Passman (born March 28, 1940 in New York City) is an American mathematician, specializing in ring theory, group theory, and Lie algebra theory.[1]/nAfter attending the Bronx High School of Science, Passman matriculated at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where he graduated with B.S. in 1960.

During his studies, he attended a seminar on modular forms and started to work in this area under the supervision of professor Anatoli N. Andrianov. After graduation, he continued research in the theory of modular forms, and in 1977 earned his PhD degree (Candidate of Sciences) from  Leningrad Department of  Steklov Mathematical Institute of USSR Academy of Sciences with the thesis \"Euler products for congruence subgroups of the Siegel group of genus\". During 1981\u20131993 he was a senior researcher of Laboratory of Theory of Algorithms at  Leningrad Institute for Informatics and Automation of  USSR Academy of Sciences. That time his scientific interests were switched to the computational complexity of algorithms in algebra and number theory. He was an active participant of a seminar on computational complexity headed by Anatol Slissenko  and Dima Grigoriev. From 1993 he also began active collaboration with Ilia Ponomarenko, in algebraic combinatorics, which lasted until the end of his life. Many of the results obtained in this collaboration were included in his DSc thesis \"Schurity and separability of association schemes\", that was defended in 2004.\nStarting in 2005, he was a leading researcher in St. Petersburg Department Mathematical Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences./nDuring 1975-1982 Sergei had published a series of impressive papers on the arithmetic of Siegel modular forms. His PhD thesis contains very fine arithmetic constructions related to the ray classes of ideals of imaginary quadratic fields. Continuing his research on the theory of modular forms, he found an elegant analytical description of the Maass subspace of Siegel modular forms of genus 2,[2] an explicit formula for the generating Hecke series of the symplectic group of genus 3, and the first explicit formulas for the action of degenerate Hecke operators on the space of theta-series\n[3]/nIn the mid-1980s, switching to the computational complexity of algorithms in algebra and number theory, he found a delicate and simple algorithm for factorization of polynomials over finite fields.[4] The algorithm has a quasi-polynomial complexity under the assumption of generalized Riemann's hypothesis. Despite considerable efforts by mathematicians working in the theory of computational complexity, up to the present (2019), his estimate for the complexity of the factorization problem has not been improved./nStarting in 1993, Sergei has been engaged into problems of algebraic combinatorics. Several profound results were obtained, including the refutation of the Schur-Klin conjecture on Schur rings over a cyclic group, [5] a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing and testing isomorphism of circulant graphs, [6] and building a theory of multidimensional coherent configurations\n.[7] The latter provided an algebraic explanation for the fact that the problem of isomorphism of finite graphs cannot be solved using only combinatoric methods. Another series of  works was devoted to the problem of isomorphism and the algorithmic theory of permutation groups. In particular, a number of algorithms  (which became already classical) for testing graph isomorphism were constructed./nIn the last years of his life, Sergei became also interested in p-adic analysis. Jointly with  Sergio Albeverio and Maria Skopina he studied  p-adic wavelet bases. These studies revealed an unexpected and highly nontrivial fact: \n[8]\nunlike similar theories in other structures, the standard method in p-adic analysis leads to nothing except the Haar basis. Moreover, any   p-adic orthogonal wavelet basis generated by test functions is some modification of the Haar basis.[9] In his last work on this topic,[10] an orthogonal p-adic wavelet basis generated by functions with non-compact support was constructed, while all previously known bases, as well as frames, were generated by the test functions.", "2805218": "Hans Ivar Riesel (May 28, 1929 in Stockholm \u2013 December 21, 2014) was a Swedish mathematician who discovered the 18th Mersenne prime in 1957, using the computer BESK:[1][2] this prime is 23217-1 and consists of 969 digits.

Blind since childhood, she is chiefly known for her work in set-theoretic topology and Braille technology./nNavy was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1953. Born premature, she was diagnosed as totally blind from retinopathy of prematurity. Her family soon discovered that she could actually see from the corner of one eye, but at age 10 she lost all sight due to retinal detachment.[1]/nThe next year, in sixth grade, Navy began learning to read and write Braille at school. She also learned the Nemeth Braille system for writing mathematics,[2] which became her favorite subject. She enjoyed team math competitions, and at age 14 independently rediscovered Euclid's formula for even perfect numbers.[1] She also learned Hebrew Braille in preparation for her bat mitzvah service.[3] At age 16 Navy was hired for her first job, as a Dictaphone typist in New York City. She took a class to learn to travel the New York City Subway.[1]/nNavy attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1971\u20131975, majoring in mathematics. The only textbook she had\nin Braille was her calculus book. All her other books were obtained as audiobooks from Recording for the Blind.\nAt MIT, her undergraduate advisor James Munkres introduced her to the subject of topology. Upon her graduation with a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1975,[2] she received the AMITA Senior Academic Award from the Association of MIT Alumnae.[4] Early in her undergraduate career, Navy met David Holladay, an electrical engineering student. He looked up enough Braille to write her a note after their first meeting. They were married after graduation.[1]/nNavy attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, majoring in mathematics, with a minor in computer science. During her graduate education, she used an Optacon device to read textbooks that were not available in Braille or as audiobooks.[1] She received her M.A. in 1977,[2] and her Ph.D. in 1981 under the supervision of topologist Mary Ellen Rudin.[5]/nNavy's doctoral thesis, \"Nonparacompactness in Para-Lindel\u00f6f Spaces\", was important in the development of metrizability theory. The paper examines the properties of para-Lindel\u00f6f topological spaces, which are a generalization of both Lindel\u00f6f spaces and paracompact spaces. In a para-Lindel\u00f6f space, every open cover has a locally countable open refinement, that is, one such that each point of the space has a neighborhood that intersects only countably many elements of the refinement. The spaces constructed by Navy are counterexamples to the conjecture that all para-Lindel\u00f6f spaces are paracompact. Some of her spaces are even normal Moore spaces under suitable set-theoretic assumptions. Since every metrizable space is paracompact, these are counterexamples to the normal Moore space conjecture./nStephen Watson called Navy's construction \"a rather general one that permitted quite a lot of latitude\" and said, \"No other way of getting para-Lindel\u00f6f is known. I don't think another way of getting para-Lindel\u00f6f is even possible\u2014Navy's method looks quite canonical to me.\"[6] In 1983, William Fleissner modified one of her spaces to be a normal Moore space under the assumption of a particular covering property. Fleissner's examples finally resolved the normal Moore space conjecture by showing that it requires large cardinal axioms.[6][7]/nAfter graduate school, Navy took a position as a visiting assistant professor in the mathematics department of Bucknell University in 1981.[2] While they were living in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Holladay started a software company called Raised Dot Computing, focused on computer Braille technology. He was inspired by Navy's need for Braille translation to help with her math teaching.[8] She was an important consultant for the company, helping with software ideas and testing products in her university work. In December 1981, Raised Dot Computing released its first major product, BRAILLE-EDIT, a word processor and two-way Braille translator program for the Apple II.[9] Navy left the university in 1984 to work for the company,[2] and the couple and the company moved back to Madison, Wisconsin in July 1984.[9]/nNavy applied her computer skills to improving Raised Dot Computing's assistive software, producing enhanced versions of BRAILLE-EDIT and utility programs to handle textbook-format Braille and other special formats. In 1985 they added a line of MS-DOS software, culminating in the company's most successful product, MegaDots. Released in August 1992 and maintained until 2016, MegaDots provided Braille translation and word processing for the PC. Raised Dot Computing was transferred in September 1998 to a Wisconsin nonprofit organization called Braille Planet,[9] which was then bought out in August 1999 by Duxbury Systems.[10] Navy and Holladay live in Westford, Massachusetts,[8] and still work at Duxbury.[11]/nNavy is a member of the Braille Authority of North America, where she serves as a consultant to the Nemeth Code Technical Committee.[12]", "8637946": "George William Hart (born 1955)[1] is an American sculptor and geometer.

Since this curves upward (unlike Sarnoff's law), it implies that Metcalfe's conclusion \u2013 that there is a critical mass in networks, leading to a network effect \u2013 is qualitatively correct.  But since this linearithmic function does not grow as rapidly as Metcalfe's law, it implies that many of the quantitative expectations based on Metcalfe's law were excessively optimistic./nFor example, by Metcalfe, if a hypothetical network of 100,000 members has a value of $1M, doubling its membership would increase its value fourfold (200,0002/100,0002). However Odlyzko predicts its value would only slightly more than double: 200,000*log(200,000)/(100,000*log(100,000).[8] Empirical tests, in part stimulated by this criticism, strongly support Metcalfe's law.[9]/nIn recent years, Odlyzko has published multiple papers on the financial history of bubbles, particularly the South Sea Bubble and the English Railway Mania of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, respectively.[10][11][12][13]", "64441855": "G\u00fcnther Hans Frei (born 19 May 1942 in St. Gallen) is a Swiss mathematician and historian of mathematics./nFrei studied mathematics, physics and languages at the University of Zurich.

The Borda count is in use today in some academic institutions, competitions and several political jurisdictions. The Borda count has also served as a basis for other methods such as the Quota Borda system, Black's method and Nanson's method./nIn 1778, he published his method of reducing lunar distance for computing the longitude, still regarded as the best of several similar mathematical procedures for navigation and position fixing in pre-chronometer days.

As a result of these efforts, the facsimile of two ancient texts of mathematics originally written in Arabic were realized. The first one is the preface of Mecmuatu'r-risail, the Arabic translation by Beni Musa b. Sakir (died in 873) of Conica, which is the work of Apollonius of Perga (BC 262\u2013190) on the conic sections. This preface, published with the title Das Vorwort des Astronomen Bani Musa b. Sakir, describes how the Apollonius' Conica was acquired by the Islamic world. After that, Terzioglu published the facsimile of the copy of the lost 8th book of Apollonius' Conica which was rewritten by Ibnu'l-Heysem (965\u20131039) with the help from other sources. In the introduction part of this book with the title Das Achte Buch zu den Conica des Apollonios von Perge, the following information is provided in summary:/nIn ancient mathematics, the interest for conics starts with Menaechmus (BC IV. Century) and reaches the summit with Apollonius of Perga. Apollonius wrote his famous work Conica by processing previous information and adding up his own inventions. The first 7 volumes of this work consisting of 8 volumes in total are known whereas the 8th volume is missing. The Islamic and Western mathematicians working in this field took place in the reconstruction of the 8th volume. The most successful one of these works is that of Edmund Halley's (1656\u20131742) Apollonii Per-gaei conicorum (Oxoniae, 1710). The 8th book of Conica reconstructed by Ibn el-Heysem is the 4th manuscript with the name Makalatu'l-Hasan b.el-Hasan b.el Heysem fi el-kitabu'l-mahrutat in the Mecmu'atu'r-risail, which is recorded under no. 1796 in Manisa Library. The fact that Ibn el-Heysem completed this work nearly 700 years before Halley is interesting./nWithin the framework of this program, Terzioglu was preparing for publication the first 7 books of Conica, which were translated into Arabic in 415/1024 AD by Ibnu'l-Heysem who had also examined the previous translations of his time. Terzioglu's death coincides with the time when the facsimile of the manuscript located at No. 2762 of Suleymaniye Library, Ayasofya had been completed. As the part of the book he wanted to include related to the history of conics remained incomplete, it was removed from press and was published later with the title Kitab al-Mahrutat Das Buch der Kegelschnitte des Apollonios von Perge by the Research Institute for Mathematics. It includes a part in which the description of the manuscript and the direct translation of its preface are given in Turkish and German./nOne of the most important services of Terzioglu to the Turkish history of science is to make translate into Turkish in Latin letters the published first two volumes and the third volume as a manuscript (see Istanbul University Library TY. 903, 904, 905 for copies of manuscripts) of  Asar-i  Bakiye} (Vol. I\u2013II, Istanbul, 1329/1913) by Salih Zeki Bey (1863\u20131921) during his presidency of the Turkish Mathematics Association.

He had earlier joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, after a BSc in Physics, but had to leave his studies mid-way to take care of the family business. Raghunathan fondly recalls that his father had a feeling for science and used to talk about it, making it very interesting to the children. Raghunathan's mother came from a family with an academic tradition. Her father was an esteemed Professor of English, who had contributed articles to the Cornhill Magazine.

He is known both for his original works and for translating many important Greek[1][2] scientific works of astrology, astronomy, philosophy, alchemy and mathematics into Latin from Arabic versions, which were then introduced to Western Europe. The oldest surviving Latin translation of Euclid's Elements is a 12th-century translation by Adelard from an Arabic version.[3] He is known as one of the first to introduce the Arabic numeral system to Europe. He stands at the convergence of three intellectual schools: the traditional learning of French schools, the Greek culture of Southern Italy, and the Arabic science of the East.[4]/nAdelard's biography is incomplete in places, and leaves some aspects open to interpretation. Consequently much of what is ascribed to Adelard is a product of his own testimony.[5]/nAdelard claims to come from the Roman English city of Bath. How he lived is not entirely known. Despite his extensive travels, by the end of his life he is thought to have returned to Bath where he died around 1160 CE.[6]/nThe parents of the philosopher are not known for sure, but Fastred, a tenant of the Bishop of Wells, is noted by scholars as a possible father.[7] The name Adelard is of Anglo-Saxon origin, which would make him to be of low status in 11th-century England.[8][9] It is believed that he left England toward the end of the 11th century for Tours,[6] likely on the advice of Bishop John de Villula, who had moved the seat of his bishopric from Wells to Bath in 1090. During his studies in Tours, an anonymous \"wise man of Tours\" inspired Adelard with his interest in astronomy to study the science.[10] Adelard later taught for a time at Laon, leaving no later than 1109 for travel.[11]/nAfter leaving Laon, Adelard describes himself as travelling to Southern Italy and Sicily no later than 1116.[4] Adelard also reports extensive travel throughout the \"lands of the Crusades\": Greece, West Asia, Sicily, possibly Spain, Tarsus, Antioch, and potentially Palestine.[12] Historians believe that Adelard learned Arabic in Sicily or in Spain during his travels. [6] The time spent in these areas would help explain his fascination with mathematics and his access to Arabic scholars. His travels are contested by scholars, some of whom speculate that he used references to \"travel\" and claims of discourse with \"Arabs\" as a cover for original ideas.[13]/nBy 1126, Adelard returned to the West with the intention of spreading the knowledge he had gained about Arab astronomy and geometry to the Latin world.[4] This time of remarkable transition and crusade marked an opportunity for someone to gain valuable influence over the evolution of human history. While the Crusades offered little in the way of a victor, Adelard's non-discriminatory scholarly work inspired him to bring back to England many ancient texts and new questions that would later give rise to an English Renaissance.[14] During Adelard's lifetime in the 11th century it was understandably difficult for him to have achieved his educational pursuits. As printing had not been introduced and the literacy rate was very low, books were rare in medieval Europe, usually held only by royal courts or Catholic monastic communities (Kraye, et al. 1987). Fittingly, Adelard studied with monks at the Benedictine Monastery at Bath Cathedral.[14]/nAmong Adelard of Bath's original works is a trio of dialogues, written to mimic the Platonic style, or correspondences with his nephew. The earliest of these is De Eodem et Diverso (On the Same and the Different). It is written in the style of a protreptic, or an exhortation to the study of philosophy.[15] The work is modelled on Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, evident in Adelard's vocabulary and phraseology.[16] It is believed to have been written near Tours after he had already travelled, though there is no indication that he had travelled past Southern Italy and Sicily at the time of writing.[4]  The work takes the form of a dramatic dialogue between Philocosmia, who advocates worldly pleasures, and Philosophia, whose defence of scholarship leads into a summary of the seven liberal arts. Underlining the entire work is the contrast between Philocosmia's res (perceptible reality), and Philosophia's verba (mental concepts).[17]  Each section of the liberal arts is divided into two parts. Presented first is a description of the allegorical figure representing the art, in which the importance of that art is indicated, followed by a summary of the doctrines of that art, as told by the allegorical figure who is presented as the founder or main proponent of the particular art.[16]/nThe second of this trio, and arguably Adelard's most significant contribution, was his Questiones Naturales or Questions on Natural Science. It can be dated between 1107 and 1133 as, in the text, Adelard himself mentions that seven years have passed since his lecturing in schools at Laon.[4] He chooses to present this work as a forum for Arabic learning, referring often to his experiences in Antioch.[15]  He sets out seventy-six questions, in the form of a Platonic dialogue about meteorology and natural science. It was used heavily in schools into and beyond the 13th century but the teaching on natural things would ultimately be superseded by Aristotle's writing.[12] The text is broken up into three parts: On Plants and Brute Animals, On Man and On Earth, Water, Air, and Fire.[18] Two of the more specific features associated with this text are (1) a preference for reason over authority in matters of science and nature (in other words, seeking solutions via reason and logic rather than through faith) and (2) the use of the literary device of invoking Arab teachings when presenting very controversial topics (e.g. that brute animals may possess knowledge and souls)[19] Adelard didn't think that the use of reason to seek knowledge was in any way contradictory with Christian faith in God. The soul is a large part of the dialogue in this text as On Man discusses a corporeal soul in man, while the final section elaborates on the incorporeal soul of elements and animals.[15] Questiones Naturales appears to have been an immediate success as it was copied on both sides of the English Channel and was even presented in a \"pocket-book\" format, suggesting that it was meant to be carried around.[20]/nThe final section in his trilogy is a treatise on hawking called De Avibus Tractatus (Treatise on Birds).[21] It is a medical text that addresses disease from head-to-toe.[15] While it has been argued that this treatise was not widely distributed, an investigation of later Latin and French treatises reveals a number of excerpts from Adelard's work.[22]/nThe remainder of Adelard's original works did not involve the persona of his nephew. He wrote a treatise on the use of the abacus called Regulae Abaci,[23] which was likely written very early in his career because it shows no trace of Arab influence.[4] This treatise is believed to be proof that Adelard was connected to the Exchequer table that was used for monetary calculations in the medieval period.[24] If you read the source quoted, its obvious Adelard of Bath probably knew who worked at the Exchequer and might have met them at Laon, but what is common among them is that their educations are in Laon! Further evidence for this can be found in the Pipe Roll of Henry I, which shows that he had received a discharge from the \"murder fine\" (a fine levied on all inhabitants of a certain area based on the murder of a Norman that occurred in a generally accessible field in the area)[25] levied on the community of Wiltshire in 1130,[24] though there is no other proof for this fact. There is debate about whether the Adelard who lived in Bath and who was levied with this charge really is the same Adelard of Bath, considering Adelard is a common name. The work that Adelard of Bath is known for in the Latin world is his translation of the astronomical tables of al-Khwarizmi, the first widely accessible Latin translation of the Islamic ideas about algebra.[4] In the Middle Ages he was known for his rediscovery and teaching of geometry, earning his reputation when he made the first full translation of Euclid's \"Elements\" and began the process of interpreting the text for a Western audience.[10]/nAdelard's work impacted the course of natural philosophy, notably influencing Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon.[26] His work in natural philosophy helped lay the foundations for much of the progress that was made in the later centuries after Aristotle. His work surrounding Euclid's Elements provided training in demonstrative and geometrical proofs. While his original writings demonstrate a sincere passion for the seven liberal arts (grammar, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, geometry, music, and astronomy), his work in Quaestiones naturales illustrated a more encompassing dedication to subjects such as physics, the natural sciences, and metaphysics./nHis influence is evident in De philosophia mundi by William of Conches,[27] in the work of Hugh of Saint Victor, in Isaac of Stella's Letters to Alcher on the Soul and in Peter Abelard's Hexaemeron./nHe introduced algebra to the Latin world and his commentaries in Euclid's Elements were extremely influential in the 13th century.[19] Adelard was also responsible for introducing Arabic numerals, including the symbol for zero, to Western Europe. [6] Adelard displayed original thought of a scientific bent, questioning the shape of the Earth (he believed it was round) and asking how it remains stationary in space. He developed the classic physics question of how far a rock would fall if a hole were drilled through the Earth and a rock dropped through it (see center of gravity). He later supplemented his mathematical translations with \"De opere astrolapsus,\" a text explaining the use of an astrolabe.  [6]/nCampanus of Novara probably had access to Adelard's translation of Elements, and it is Campanus' edition that was first published in Venice in 1482 after the invention of the printing press. It became the chief textbook of the mathematical schools of Western Europe until the 16th century.[28]", "36163134": "Allen Ivar Knutson is an American mathematician who is a professor of mathematics at Cornell University.[1]/nKnutson completed his undergraduate studies at the California Institute of Technology[2] and received a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996 under the joint advisorship of Victor Guillemin and Lisa Jeffrey.[3]/nHe was on the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley before moving to the University of California, San Diego in 2005 and then to Cornell University in 2009.[4] In 2005, he and Terence Tao won the Levi L.

He was the fifth player to become World Chess Champion, a title he held from 1935 until 1937. He served as President of FIDE, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978./nEuwe was born in the Watergraafsmeer, in Amsterdam. He studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam under the founder of intuitionistic logic, L.E.J. Brouwer (who later became his friend and for whom he held a funeral oration), and earned his doctorate in 1926 under Roland Weitzenb\u00f6ck.[2] He taught mathematics, first in Rotterdam, and later at a girls' Lyceum in Amsterdam. After World War II, Euwe became interested in computer programming and was appointed professor in this subject at the universities of Rotterdam and Tilburg, retiring from Tilburg University in 1971. He published a mathematical analysis of the game of chess from an intuitionistic point of view, in which he showed, using the Thue\u2013Morse sequence, that the then-official rules (in 1929) did not exclude the possibility of infinite games.[3]/nEuwe played his first tournament at age 10, winning every game.[4]\nHe won every Dutch chess championship that he entered from 1921 until 1952, and won the title in 1955;\u00a0 his 12 titles are still a record. The only other winners during this period were Salo Landau in 1936, when Euwe, then world champion, did not compete; and Jan Hein Donner in 1954.[5] He became the world amateur chess champion in 1928, at The Hague, with a score of 12/15.[6]/nEuwe married in 1926, started a family soon afterwards, and could play competitive chess only during school vacations, so his opportunities for top-level international chess competition were limited. But he performed well in the few tournaments and matches for which he could find time, from the early 1920s to mid-1930s. He lost a training match to Alexander Alekhine in the Netherlands in December 1926 / January 1927, with 4\u00bd/10 (+2\u22123=5).[7] The match was played to help Euwe prepare for a future encounter with Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca, then world champion.[8] Euwe lost both the first and second FIDE Championship matches to Efim Bogoljubow, held in the Netherlands in 1928 and 1928\u201229 respectively, scoring 4\u00bd/10 in each match ((+2\u22123=5) in the first match, (+1\u22122=7) in the second match).[9][10] He lost a match to Capablanca in Amsterdam in 1931 with 4/10 (+0\u22122=8). He won a match against Spielmann in Amsterdam in 1932, 3\u20131, played to help Euwe prepare for his upcoming match with Salo Flohr./nIn 1932, Euwe drew a match with Flohr 8\u20138,[8] and was equal second with Flohr, behind Alekhine, at a major tournament in Bern.[11] According to Reuben Fine, these results established Euwe and Flohr as Alekhine's most credible challengers.[12]/nAt Z\u00fcrich 1934, Euwe again finished equal second with Flohr, behind Alekhine, and he defeated Alekhine in their game.[13][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nIn 1933, Max Euwe challenged Alekhine to a championship match.[14] Alekhine accepted the challenge for October 1935. Earlier that year, Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander asked Capablanca for his views on the forthcoming match. In the rare archival film footage where Capablanca and Euwe both speak, Capablanca replies: \"Dr. Alekhine's game is 20% bluff. Dr. Euwe's game is clear and straightforward. Dr. Euwe's game\u2014not so strong as Alekhine's in some respects\u2014is more evenly balanced.\" Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch, explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism, but in the previous ten years, their score had been evenly matched at 7\u20137.[15][16]/nOn December 15, 1935, after 30 games played in 13 different cities around the Netherlands over a period of 80 days, Euwe defeated Alekhine by 15\u00bd\u201314\u00bd, becoming the fifth World Chess Champion. Alekhine quickly went three games ahead, but Euwe managed to even out and eventually win the match.[17] His title gave a huge boost to chess in the Netherlands. It was also the first world championship where the players had seconds to help them with analysis during adjournments.[18]/nEuwe's win was regarded as a major upset \u2013 he reportedly had believed that beating Alekhine was unlikely[19] \u2013 and is sometimes attributed to Alekhine's alcoholism.[20] But Salo Flohr, who helped Euwe during the match, thought Alekhine's over-confidence was more of a problem than alcohol; Alekhine himself said he would win easily.[19][14] Former World Champions Vasily Smyslov, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov, and Garry Kasparov later analysed the match and concluded that Euwe deserved to win and that the standard of play was worthy of a world championship.[19] Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik has said that Euwe won the 1935 match on merit and that the result was not affected by Alekhine's drinking before or during the match.[21]/nEuwe's performance in the great tournament of Nottingham 1936 (equal third, half a point behind Botvinnik and Capablanca, half a point ahead of Alekhine) indicated he was a worthy champion, even if he was not as dominant as the earlier champions. Reuben Fine wrote, \"In the two years before the return match, Euwe's strength increased. Although he never enjoyed the supremacy over his rivals that his predecessors had, he had no superiors in this period.\"[12]/nEuwe lost the title to Alekhine in a rematch in 1937, also played in the Netherlands, by the lopsided margin of 15\u00bd\u20139\u00bd. Alekhine had given up alcohol and tobacco to prepare for the rematch, although he resumed drinking later. He returned to the sort of form he had shown from 1927 to 1934, when he dominated chess. The match was a real contest initially, but Euwe's play collapsed near the end, and he lost four of the last five games.[21][22] Fine, who was Euwe's second, attributed the collapse to nervous tension, possibly aggravated by Euwe's attempts to maintain a calm appearance.[12]/nThe two world title matches against Alekhine represent the heart of Euwe's career. Altogether, they played 86 competitive games, and Alekhine had a +28\u221220=38 lead. Many of Alekhine's wins came early in their series; he was nine years older, and had more experience during that time. The rematch was also one-sided in Alekhine's favour./nEuwe finished equal fourth with Alekhine and Reshevsky in the AVRO tournament of 1938 in the Netherlands, which featured the world's top eight players and was an attempt to decide who should challenge Alekhine for the world championship. Euwe also had a major organizational role in the event.[14]/nHe played a match with Paul Keres in the Netherlands in 1939\u201340, losing 6\u00bd\u20137\u00bd./nAfter Alekhine's death in 1946, Euwe was considered by some to have a moral right to the position of world champion, based at least partially on his clear second-place finish in the great tournament at Groningen in 1946, behind Mikhail Botvinnik. But Euwe consented to participate in a five-player tournament to select the new champion, the World Chess Championship 1948.[14] At 47, Euwe was significantly older than the other players, and well past his best. He finished last.[23] In 1950, FIDE granted Euwe the title of international grandmaster on its inaugural list. He took part in the Gij\u00f3n international tournament in 1951,[24] winning ahead of Pilnik and Rossolimo with a score of (+7 =2)./nEuwe's final major tournament was the double round robin Candidates' Tournament in Z\u00fcrich, 1953, where he finished next to last. He was in the top half of the field after the first half of the tournament, but tired in the second half./nEuwe played for the Netherlands in seven Chess Olympiads from 1927 to 1962, a 35-year span, always on first board. He scored 10\u00bd/15 at London 1927, 9\u00bd/13 at Stockholm 1937 for a bronze medal, 8/12 at Dubrovnik 1950, 7\u00bd/13 at Amsterdam 1954, 8\u00bd/11 at Munich 1958 for a silver medal at age 57, 6\u00bd/16 at Leipzig 1960, and finally 4/7 at Varna 1962. His aggregate was 54\u00bd/87 for 62.6 percent./nIn 1957, Euwe played a short match against 14-year-old future world champion Bobby Fischer, winning one game and drawing the other. His lifetime score against Fischer was one win, one loss, and one draw./nEuwe won a total of 102 first prizes in tournaments during his career, many of them local.[4]/nHe became a computer science professor at Tilburg University in 1964./nFrom 1970 (at age 69) until 1978, Euwe was president of FIDE. As president, he usually did what he considered morally right rather than what was politically expedient. On several occasions this brought him into conflict with the USSR Chess Federation, which thought it had the right to dominate matters because it contributed a very large share of FIDE's budget and Soviet players dominated the world rankings\u00a0\u2013 in effect, they treated chess as an extension of the Cold War. These conflicts included:[19]/nEuwe lost some of his battles with the Soviets. According to Sosonko, in 1973, he accepted the Soviets' demand that Bent Larsen and Robert H\u00fcbner, the two strongest non-Soviet contenders (Fischer was now champion), should play in the Leningrad Interzonal tournament rather than the weaker one in Petr\u00f3polis. Larsen and H\u00fcbner were eliminated from the competition for the World Championship because Korchnoi and Karpov took the first two places at Leningrad.[19]/nSome commentators have also questioned whether Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title in 1975.[19]/nIt is also notable that in 1976, Rohini Khadilkar became the first female to compete in the Indian Men's Championship. Her involvement in a male competition caused a furore that necessitated a successful appeal to the High Court and caused Euwe to rule that women could not be barred from national or international championships.[26]/nDespite the turbulence of the period, most assessments of Euwe's performance as president of FIDE are sympathetic:[19]/nHe died in 1981, age 80, of a heart attack. Revered around the chess world for his many contributions, he had travelled extensively while FIDE President, bringing many new members into the organization./nEuwe was noted for his logical approach and for his knowledge of openings, in which he made major contributions to chess theory.[12] Paradoxically his two title matches with Alekhine were displays of tactical ferocity from both sides. But the comments by Kmoch and Alekhine (below) may explain this: Euwe \"strode confidently into some extraordinarily complex variations\" if he thought logic was on his side; and he was extremely good at calculating these variations. On the other hand, he \"often lacked the stamina to pull himself out of bad positions\".[12]/nAlekhine was allegedly more frank in his Russian-language articles than in those he wrote in English, French or German. In his Russian articles he often described Euwe as lacking in originality and in the mental toughness required of a world champion. Sosonko thought Euwe's modesty was a handicap in top-class chess (although Euwe was well aware of how much stronger he was than \"ordinary\" grandmasters).[19]/nVladimir Kramnik also says Euwe anticipated Botvinnik's emphasis on technical preparation,[21] and Euwe was usually in good shape physically because he was a keen sportsman./nEuwe wrote over 70 chess books, far more than any other World Champion; some of the best-known are The Road to Chess Mastery, Judgement and Planning in Chess, The Logical Approach to Chess, and Strategy and Tactics in Chess.[6][14] Former Soviet grandmaster Sosonko used Euwe and den Hertog's 1927 Practische Schaaklessen as a textbook when teaching in the Leningrad House of Pioneers, and considers it \"one of the best chess books ever\".[19] Fischer World Champion, an account of the 1972 World Chess Championship match, co-authored by Euwe with Jan Timman, was written in 1972 but not published in English until 2002.[27] Euwe's book From My Games, 1920\u20131937 was originally published in 1939 by Harcourt, Brace and Company, and was republished by Dover in 1975 (ISBN\u00a00-486-23111-9).

The kernel could be considered pure philosophical logic, i.e. logic tout court which is characterised by its properties, that is identity, contradiction and their interweaving (German: Verflechtung).

In awe, ibn Masawayh reconciled with Hunayn, and the two started to work cooperatively.[23]/nHunayn was extremely motivated in his work to master Greek studies, which enabled him to translate Greek texts into Syriac and Arabic. The Abbasid Caliph al-Mamun noticed Hunayn's talents and placed him in charge of the House of Wisdom, the Bayt al Hikmah. The House of Wisdom was an institution where Greek works were translated and made available to scholars.[24] (Sylvain Gougenheim argued, though, that there is no evidence of Hunayn being in charge of the Bayt al Hikmah[25]) The caliph also gave Hunayn the opportunity to travel to Byzantium in search of additional manuscripts, such as those of Aristotle and other prominent authors.[23]/nIn Hunayn ibn Ishaq's lifetime, he devoted himself to working on a multitude of writings; both translations and original works.[23]/nHunayn wrote on a variety of subjects that included philosophy, religion and medicine. In \"How to Grasp Religion\", Hunayn explains the truths of religion that include miracles not possibly made by humans and humans' incapacity to explain facts about some phenomena, and false notions of religion that include depression and an inclination for glory. He also worked on Arabic grammar and lexicography,[23] writing a unique grammar of the Arabic language titled \"The Rules of Inflexion According to the System of the Greeks.\"[26]/nHunayn ibn Ishaq enriched the field of ophthalmology. His developments in the study of the human eye can be traced through his innovative book, \"Book of the Ten Treatises of the Eye\". This textbook is the first known systematic treatment of this field and was most likely used in medical schools at the time. Throughout the book, Hunayn explains the eye and its anatomy in minute detail; its diseases, their symptoms, their treatments. Hunain repeatedly emphasized that he believed the crystalline lens to be in the center of the eye.  Hunain may have been the originator of this idea.  The idea of the central crystalline lens was widely believed from Hunain's period through the late 1500s.[27]\nHe discusses the nature of cysts and tumors, and the swelling they cause. He discusses how to treat various corneal ulcers through surgery, and the therapy involved in repairing cataracts. \"Ten Treatises on Ophthalmology\" demonstrates the skills Hunayn ibn Ishaq had not just as a translator and a physician, but also as a surgeon.[7]/nHunayn ibn Ishaq's reputation as a scholar and translator, and his close relationship with Caliph al-Mutawakkil, led the caliph to name Hunayn as his personal physician, ending the exclusive use of physicians from the Bukhtishu family.[23] Despite their relationship, the caliph became distrustful; at the time, there were fears of death from poisoning, and physicians were well aware of its synthesis procedure. The caliph tested Hunayn's ethics as a physician by asking him to formulate a poison, to be used against a foe, in exchange for a large sum. Hunayn ibn Ishaq repeatedly rejected the Caliph's generous offers, saying he would need time to develop a poison. Disappointed, the caliph imprisoned his physician for a year. When asked why he would rather be killed than make the drug, Hunayn explained the physician's oath required him to help, and not harm, his patients.[24]  He completed many different medical works that pushed the idea of treating medicine with the practice and art of physic treatments. Some of his medical works were pulled from Greek sources such as, Fi Awja al-Ma'idah (On Stomach Ailments) and al-Masail fi'l-Tibb li'l-Muta'allimin (Questions on Medicine for Students) and having these sources to drawn on keeps the original text clear.[28]/nWith the construction of the House of Wisdom, the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun wanted to have a place to gather world knowledge from Muslim and non-Muslim educators. Hunayn ibn Ishaq was one of the most well-known translators at the institution and was called the sheikh of the translators, as he mastered the four principal languages of the time: Greek, Persian, Arabic, and Syriac. He was able to translate compositions on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and even in subjects such as magic and oneiromancy.[3] Nonetheless, none of his extant translations credit the House of Wisdom, which questions the legitimacy of whether this place actually was the origin of the Translation Movement.[29] He laid down the basis of accurate translating techniques, which was extremely important for the accurate transmission of knowledge.[30][31]/nSome of Hunayn's most notable translations were his rendering of \"De Materia Medica\", a pharmaceutical handbook, and his most popular selection, \"Questions on Medicine\",[6] a guide for novice physicians. Information was presented in the form of questions taken from Galen's \"Art of Physic\" and answers, which are based on \"Summaria Alexandrinorum\". For instance, Hunayn explains what the four elements and the four humors are and that medicine divides into therapy and practice and also defines health, disease, neutrality, and as well as the natural and the contranatural, and the six necessary conditions of living healthily.[23]/nHunayn translated writings on agriculture, stones, and religion and also some of Plato's and Aristotle's works, in addition to commentaries. He also translated many medicinal texts and summaries, mainly those of Galen, such as Galen's \"On Sects\" and \"On the Anatomy of the Veins and Arteries\".[23] His translations are some of the only remaining documents of Greek manuscripts, and he helped influence the art of medicine, and through his book al-'Ashar Maqalat fi'l-Ayn (The Ten Treatises on the Eye) he helped to expand the science of ophthalmology through theory and practice.[3]/nMany R. Duval's published works on chemistry represent translations of Hunayn's work.[32] Also in Chemistry a book titled ['An Al-Asma'] meaning \"About the Names\", did not reach researchers but was used in \"Dictionary of Ibn Bahlool\" of the 10th century./nIn his efforts to translate Greek material, Hunayn ibn Ishaq was accompanied by his son Ishaq ibn Hunayn and his nephew Hubaysh. Hunayn would translate Greek into Syriac, and then he would have his nephew finish by translating the text from Syriac to Arabic, after which he then would seek to correct any of his partners' mistakes or inaccuracies he might find.[6][33]/nUnlike many translators in the Abbasid period, he largely did not try to follow the text's exact lexicon. Instead, he would try to summarize the topics of the original texts and then in a new manuscript paraphrase it in Syriac or Arabic.[6] He also edited and redacted the available texts of technical works by comparing the information included therein with other works on similar subjects.[23] Thus, his renditions may be seen as interpretations of medical, astronomical, and philosophical texts after researching the topics over which they range.[6][34] Some scholars argue Hunayn's approach differed from previous translators through his commentaries on the subject and was influenced by Galen's ideas along the way.[35]/nHunayn says:[36][31]/nGalen's works were translated before me by a certain Bin Sahda ... When I was young I translated them from a faulty Greek manuscript. Later when I was forty, my pupil Hubaish asked me to correct the translation. Meanwhile a number of manuscripts had accumulated in my possession. I collated these manuscripts and produced a single correct copy. Next I collated the Syriac text with it and corrected it. I am in the habit of doing this with everything I translate.", "70045370": "Ronen Eldan (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05df \u05d0\u05dc\u05d3\u05df) is an Israeli mathematician.

Other notable buildings by Wren include the Royal Hospital Chelsea, the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and the south front of Hampton Court Palace./nEducated in Latin and Aristotelian physics at the University of Oxford, Wren was a founder of the Royal Society and served as its president from 1680 to 1682.[4] His scientific work was highly regarded by Isaac Newton and Blaise Pascal./nWren was born in East Knoyle in Wiltshire, the only surviving son of Christopher Wren the Elder (1589\u20131658) and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from Fonthill Bishop. Christopher Sr. was, at that time, the rector of East Knoyle and, later, Dean of Windsor. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children who were born, died within a few weeks of their birth. Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate.[6]/nAs a child Wren \"seem'd consumptive\".[7] Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father's royal appointment as Dean of Windsor in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.[6]/nLittle is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at Westminster School between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by Parentalia, the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there \"for some short time\" before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster Doctor Busby's well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.[8]/nSome of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in Latin and also learned to draw. According to Parentalia, he was \"initiated\" in the principles of mathematics by William Holder, who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, Cerebri Anatome (1664), published by Thomas Willis, which coined the term \"neurology\".[9] During this time period, Wren became interested in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met Sir Charles Scarburgh whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.[citation needed]\nAnother sister Anne Brunsell, married a clergyman and is buried in Stretham.[10]/nOn 25 June 1650, Wren entered Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied Latin and the works of Aristotle. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with John Wilkins, the Warden of Wadham. The Wilkins circle was a group whose activities led to the formation of the Royal Society, comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.[11]/nAfter receiving his M.A. in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of All Souls' College in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford.[12] Among these were a number of physiological experiments on dogs, including one now recognized as the first injection of fluids into the bloodstream of a live animal under laboratory conditions.  At Oxford he became part of the group around John Wilkins, he was key to the correspondence network known as the Invisible College,[13]  within All Souls arms the arms of Wren's Robert Boyle appear in the colonnade of the Great Quadrangle, opposite the arms of the Hill family of Shropshire, close by a sundial designed by Boyle's friend Wren.[14]/nHis days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, in 1657.[15][16] He was there provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and required to give weekly lectures in both Latin and English.[16] Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helped in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:/nMemorandum November 28, 1660. These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz. The Lord Brouncker, Mr Boyle, Mr Bruce, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paule Neile, Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, Dr Petty, Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill. And after the lecture was ended they did according to the usual manner, withdraw for mutual converse.[17]/nIn 1662, they proposed a society \"for the promotion of Physico-Mathematicall Experimental Learning\". This body received its Royal Charter from Charles II and \"The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge\" was formed. In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.[4]/nIn 1661, Wren was elected Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make periodic trips to London.[15]/nThe main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, optics, the problem of finding longitude at sea, cosmology, mechanics, microscopy, surveying, medicine and meteorology. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.[18]/nIt was probably around this time that Sir Christopher Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered St Paul's Cathedral. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of Bernini, the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the Great Fire destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of 51 churches; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.[citation needed]/nWren was knighted on 14 November 1673.[19] This honour was bestowed on him after his resignation from the Savilian chair in Oxford, by which time he had already begun to make his mark as an architect, both in services to the Crown and in playing an important part in rebuilding London after the Great Fire.[citation needed]/nAdditionally, he was sufficiently active in public affairs to be returned as Member of Parliament on four occasions.[20] Wren first stood for Parliament in a by-election in 1667 for the Cambridge University constituency, losing by six votes to Sir Charles Wheler.[21] He was unsuccessful again in a by-election for the Oxford University constituency in 1674, losing to Thomas Thynne.[22] At his third attempt Wren was successful, and he sat for Plympton Erle during the Loyal Parliament of 1685 to 1687.[23] Wren was returned for New Windsor on 11 January 1689 in the general election, but his election was declared void on 14 May 1689.[24] He was elected again for New Windsor on 6 March 1690, but this election was declared void on 17 May 1690.[25] Over a decade later he was elected unopposed for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis at the November 1701 general election. He retired at the general election the following year.[26]/nWren's career was well established by 1669, and it may have been his appointment as Surveyor of the King's Works early that year that persuaded him that he could finally afford to marry. In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of Bletchingdon. Little is known of Faith, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:/nI have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye.\u00a0... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling\u00a0... but as for me you may be confident I shall never\u00a0...[27]/nThis brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of St Paul's in 1710 and wrote the famous Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens. Faith Wren died of smallpox on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.[citation needed]/nIn 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam,[28] and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.[citation needed]/nShe was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions. Robert Hooke, who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage.[29] As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677\u20131702); and a son William, \"Poor Billy\" born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed.[citation needed]/nLike the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren died of tuberculosis in September 1680. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine.[citation needed]/nBletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder, who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford. An intellectual of considerable ability, he is said to have been the figure who introduced Wren to arithmetic and geometry.[30]/nWren's later life was not without criticisms and attacks on his competence and his taste. In 1712, the Letter Concerning Design of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715. On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of William Benson.[31]/nIn 1713, he bought the manor of Wroxall, Warwickshire, from the Burgoyne family, to which his son Christopher retired in 1716 after losing his post as Clerk of Works.[32] Several of Wren's descendants would be buried there in the Church of St Leonard./nThe Wren family estate was at The Old Court House in the area of Hampton Court. He had been given a lease on the property by Queen Anne in lieu of salary arrears for building St Paul's.[33] For convenience Wren also leased a house on St James's Street in London. According to a 19th-century legend, he would often go to London to pay unofficial visits to St Paul's, to check on the progress of \"my greatest work\". On one of these trips to London, at the age of ninety, he caught a cold and on 25 February 1723 a servant who tried to awaken Wren from his nap found that he had died in his sleep.[34]/nWren was laid to rest on 5 March 1723. His body was placed in the southeast corner of the crypt of St Paul's. There is a memorial to him in the crypt at St Paul's Cathedral.[35] beside those of his daughter Jane, his sister Susan Holder, and her husband William.[36] The plain stone plaque was written by Wren's eldest son and heir, Christopher Wren the Younger[37] The inscription, which is also inscribed in a circle of black marble on the main floor beneath the centre of the dome, reads:/nSUBTUS CONDITUR HUIUS ECCLESI\u00c6 ET VRBIS CONDITOR CHRISTOPHORUS WREN, QUI VIXIT ANNOS ULTRA NONAGINTA, NON SIBI SED BONO PUBLICO.

According to Parentalia (pp.\u00a0210\u2013211), his solid model of the Moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him./nHe contrived an artificial Eye, truly and dioptrically made (as large as a Tennis-Ball) representing the Picture as Nature makes it: The Cornea, and Crystalline were Glass, the other Humours, Water./nHe experimented on terrestrial magnetism and had taken part in medical experiments while at Wadham College, performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In Gresham College, he did experiments involving determining longitude through magnetic variation and through lunar observation to help with navigation, and helped construct a 35-foot (11\u00a0m) telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the microscope and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in De corpore saturni but before the work was published, Huygens presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and De corpore saturni was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the cycloid using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression./nA year into Wren's appointment as a Savilian Professor in Oxford, the Royal Society was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied mechanics thoroughly, especially elastic collisions and pendulum motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of meteorology: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket rain gauge and, in 1663, designed a \"weather-clock\" that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.[41]/nIn addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation./nAnother topic to which Wren contributed was optics. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the hyperboloid of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669.[42] In subsequent years, Wren continued with his work with the Royal Society, although after the 1680s his scientific interests seem to have waned: no doubt his architectural and official duties absorbed more time./nIt was a problem posed by Wren that serves as an ultimate source to the conception of Newton's Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis. Robert Hooke had theorised that planets, moving in vacuo, describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to Halley and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking Kepler's laws with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, De motu corporum in gyrum, which was later to be expanded into the Principia.[43]/nMentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, ballistics, water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. Thomas Birch's History of the Royal Society (1756\u201357) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded.[citation needed]/nWren was a prominent man of science at the height of the Scientific Revolution. The Scientific Revolution seemed to promise a merger of the science of mechanics and the art of building. In Galileo Galilei's Two New Sciences the first science is not dynamics, for which the book is now better known, but rather the strength of materials, which Galileo had recognized 30 years earlier as a \u201cscience that is very necessary in making machines and buildings of all kinds.\u201d In 1624 Henry Wotton, the British ambassador to Venice, published a book on architecture in which he analyzed in a rudimentary way the structure of a stone arch. Moreover, in the 17th century, it was people who would now be called scientists who were awarded the commissions to design and build monumental structures. In Turin, Guarino Guarini, a mathematician, devised the plans for such celebrated buildings as the Royal Church of Saint Lawrence, the Chapel of the Holy Shroud and the Palazzo Carignano. In Paris, Claude Perrault, a physician and an anatomist, designed the fa\u00e7ade of the Louvre and the observatory of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. In London, it was Wren and Hooke who collaborated as chief architect and city surveyor after the city was devastated by the Great Fire of 1666./nIn 1661, just months after taking his post at Oxford, Wren was invited by Charles II to oversee the construction of new harbour defences at Tangier\u2014then-newly under British control. Wren ultimately excused himself from the King's offer. Letters dated to the end of 1661 note that in addition to the Tangier project, Charles II had also sought Wren for consultation regarding repairs to Old St Paul's Cathedral, the reconstruction of which would ultimately be the architect's magnum opus. Speaking of Wren's vocational transition from academic to architect-engineer, biographer Adrian Tinniswood writes \"the use of mathematicians in military fortification was not unusual... Perhaps Wren also had experience of the business of fortification, more than we know.\"[15]/nWren's first known foray into architecture came after his uncle, Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely, offered to finance a new chapel for Pembroke College, Cambridge. Matthew commissioned his nephew for the design, finding the architecturally inexperienced Christopher to be both ideologically sympathetic and stylistically deferential. Wren produced his design in the Winter of 1662 or 1663 and the chapel was completed in 1665./nWren's second, similarly collegiate work followed soon after, when he was commissioned to design Oxford's \"New Theatre,\" financed by Gilbert Sheldon.[44] His design for the structure was met with lukewarm to negative reception, with even Wren's defenders admitting the young architect to have not yet been \"capable of handling a large architectural composition with assurance\".[15] Adrian Tinniswood credits the building's flaws to \"Sheldon's refusal to pay for an elaborate exterior, Wren's inability to find an adequate external expression for a building which was wholly conditioned by the functionality of its interior space and, ...his refusal to bend the knee to classical authority in the way that our experience of eighteenth-century architecture has conditioned us to believe is right.\"[15] Prior to the theatre's 1669 completion, Wren had received further commissions for the Garden Quadrangle at Trinity College, Oxford, and the chapel of Emmanuel College, Cambridge.[15]/nWren left for Paris in July 1665 on his first and only trip abroad. In France, the architect encountered an architectural milieu more closely linked to the ideals of the Italian Renaissance. Wren also met  Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was \"widely acknowledged by contemporaries as the greatest artist of the century\". Though Bernini's concrete influence on Wren's designs was transmitted via published plans and engravings, the encounter surely impacted the budding architect and his vocational trajectory.[15]/nSt Paul's Cathedral in London has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.[citation needed]Letters document Wren's involvement in St Paul as early as 1661, when he was consulted by Charles II regarding repairs to the medieval structure.[15] In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for St Paul's. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the Great Fire of London reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September, he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A Rebuilding of London Act which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed./nIt was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A second rebuilding act was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the City of London. Wren presented his initial \"First Model\" for St Paul's. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called \"Great Model\", was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the chapter and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a \"cathedral form\" desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before./nThe cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally, in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, Parliament had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes, the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a balustrade around the roof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt parthian comment that \"ladies think nothing well without an edging\".[45]/nDuring the 1670s, Wren received significant secular commissions. Among many of his notable designs at this time, the monument (1671\u201376)[46] commemorating the Great Fire also involved Robert Hooke, but Wren was in control of the final design, the Royal Observatory (1675\u201376),[46] and the Wren Library at Trinity College, Cambridge (1676\u201384)[46] were the most important ones.[citation needed]/nIn 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on St George's Chapel, Windsor be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.[47]/nBy historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relate both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the Chelsea Hospital (1682\u201392),[46] does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfils its original function. The reconstruction of the stateroom at Windsor Castle was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of Hugh May, who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works./nBetween 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the King's House, Winchester, where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that \" a year is a great time in my life\"./nAfter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to Whitehall (1685\u201387).[46] The new king, James II, required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the Queen. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as Kensington Palace (1689\u201396)[46] and Hampton Court (1689\u20131700).[46]/nThe erection of the present Windsor Guildhall was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir Thomas Fitz (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed at a cost of \u00a32687 \u2013 1s \u2013 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for corn markets./nThe story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually, the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren's connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a Member of Parliament for Windsor, commissioned the statue of Prince George of Denmark in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the corn market from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829.[48] The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals./nWren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of Greenwich Naval Hospital,[46] and in 1698 he was appointed Surveyor of Westminster Abbey.[49] He resigned from the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature[50] Burlington's revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School./nSince at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the Premier Grand Lodge of England in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the Goose and Gridiron at St. Paul's churchyard.[51] Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been \"adopted\" on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul's, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. James Anderson made the claims in his widely circulated Constitutions while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the \"speculative\" or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death. By the standards of his time, a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body[citation needed]; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or \"interest\" of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes, a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School)./nIn 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with William Talman, not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest to the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778)./nThe evidence of whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture[52] of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and Aubrey's memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson./nChristopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British \u00a350 banknote (Series D) issued in modern times. The notes were printed between 1981 and 1994, and were in circulation until 1996.[53]/nIn 1997, UNESCO inscribed Wren's Greenwich Hospital on the World Heritage list, citing the complex's \"outstanding architectural and artistic achievements\".[54]/nWren appears, or is mentioned in several Restoration-era novels or movies.", "30232274": "Max Koecher (German: [\u02c8k\u0153\u00e7\u0250]; 20 January 1924 in Weimar \u2013 7 February 1990, Lengerich) was a German mathematician./nKoecher studied mathematics and physics at the Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t in G\u00f6ttingen.\nIn 1951, he received his doctorate under Max Deuring with his work (Koecher 1953) on Dirichlet series with functional equation where he introduced Koecher\u2013Maass series.

In particular, generalizing the Vitali convergence theorem, the Fichera convergence theorem and previous results of Vladimir Mikhailovich Dubrovskii, he proved a necessary and sufficient condition for the passage to the limit under the sign of integral:[3] this result is, in some sense, definitive.[4] In the field of ordinary differential equations, he studied existence and uniqueness problems under very general hypotheses for the left member of the given first order equation, developing an important approximation method and proving a fundamental uniqueness theorem.[5]/nCafiero was born in Riposto, Province of Catania, on May 24, 1914.[6] He obtained his Laurea in mathematics, cum laude, from the University of Naples Federico II in 1939.[7] During the 1939\u20131940 academic year, he won an  \"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica\" scholarship and went in Rome to the institute:[8] there he followed the courses held by Francesco Severi, Mauro Picone, Luigi Fantappi\u00e8, Giulio Krall and Leonida Tonelli.[9]/nHe was appointed instructor of the course of \"Elementi di matematica\"[10] by the Faculty of Statistical Sciences of the University of Rome, for the 1940\u20131941 academic year:[11] however, he was able to hold the course only for few months, since he was called to arms in January 1941[12] and stationed from May 1942 to September 1943 on the Northern African coasts as an officer of the San Marco Battalion.[13] It was there that, after having successfully completed a dangerous sabotage operation, the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces surprised him and the other members of his unit, leaving them without any support.[12] Nonetheless, in desperate conditions, he was able to lead his men to the Italian coasts with a rubber dinghy, and was awarded of a Silver Medal of Military Valor for this act.[12]/nBeing discharged from Military Service in February 1944,[7] he was not able to reach Rome and remained in Napoli.[12] The institution which currently is the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Naples was on the way of reconstituting,[14] the eight former mathematics institutes of the university having been literally \"torn to pieces\" by the Allied forces Military Police.[15] It was necessary to collect and reorder in a new library all the volumes of the previously existed ones, then piled on the floor of a single room, catalogue them ex novo and create new records, provide the library administration, and of course there was no administrative personnel available nor financial resources.[16] It was also necessary to organize courses and exams for the numerous war veterans coming back from the front and for new students, with more than a half of the teaching personnel blocked beyond the Gothic Line:[15] and in performing all those task Cafiero, jointly with few others and working as an adjunct professor of \"Esercitazioni di Matematiche\", was an outstanding collaborator of Renato Caccioppoli and Carlo Miranda.[17]/nAlso in 1944 he married Jole Giorgini, his lifelong companion, and soon after they had a daughter, Anna.[7]/nDue to the scarce possibilities of being hired permanently by the Faculty of Sciences at that time, he accepted a position as adjunct assistant professor to the chair of Financial Mathematics,[18] working with Luigi Lordi first at the Istituto Universitario Navale and then to the Faculty of Economics and Business, where he was appointed full assistant professor in June 1949.[19] Nonetheless, his ties with the Faculty of Sciences remained strong, being employed there as adjunct professor of \"Esercitazioni di Matematiche\" several times, during those years:[20] he was likewise assigned to several other courses related to Financial Mathematics by the Istituto Universitario Navale and by the Faculty of Business and Economics.[20][21]/nThe scientific aspect of the collaboration with the Faculty of Sciences was nonetheless very intense,[20] leading him to the \"libera docenza\" in March 1951, and to a full professorship chair in 1953:[22][23] during this period, his scientific activity was done side by side at first with Carlo Miranda and later with Renato Caccioppoli, who found in him a dear pupil and friend.[24]/nRanked first of the three winners of the competition for the chair of mathematical analysis of the University of Catania,[25] in December 1953 he was appointed as extraordinary professor to that chair, and left Napoli for Catania.[26][27]/nCafiero started his service at the University of Catania in January 1954.[28] His arrival at the university brought several innovations, both in teaching and in the research activity on mathematical analysis.[27][29] In particular, he established a seminar on abstract measure theory open to assistant professors and to graduate students as well, and this was felt as true scientific revolution:[29] he held the chair of mathematical analysis for three years.[30] After becoming ordinary professor in 1956,[7] he went to the University of Pisa on request by Sandro Faedo:[31] during his stay, he held courses also at the Scuola Normale Superiore,[32] becoming director of the \"Leonida

He was offered a position at Manchester University in 1957 by Max Newman, on the basis of work he had done while outside academia. In 1960 he moved to the University of Exeter, and in 1963 became a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Macdonald became Fielden Professor at Manchester in 1972, and professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, in 1976./nHe worked on symmetric products of algebraic curves, Jordan algebras and the representation theory of groups over local fields. In 1972 he proved the Macdonald identities, after a pattern known to Freeman Dyson. His 1979 book Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials has become a classic. Symmetric functions are an old theory, part of the theory of equations, to which both K-theory and representation theory lead.

She is a senior investigator and co-chief of the Computational and Statistical Genomic Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute./nBailey-Wilson received a B.A. magna cum laude in Biology from Western Maryland College followed by a Ph.D. in medical genetics with a minor in biomathematics from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1981 under the direction of Joe C. Christian. She completed post-doctoral training with Robert Elston in the Department of Biometry and Genetics at Louisiana State University Medical Center.[1]/nBailey-Wilson became a professor at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans before joining the National Institutes of Health in 1995. She was appointed co-branch chief of the Inherited Disease Research Branch in 2006 and became co-chief of the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2014.[1] Her research program focuses on understanding the genetic factors that increase risk for various complex diseases and their interactions with environmental risk factors. Bailey-Wilson specializes in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology and is especially interested in risk factors for lung cancer, prostate cancer, eye disorders, autism and oral clefts.[2]/nShe has served on many scientific advisory boards including the Cancer Family Registry CFRCCS Advisory Board, the World Trade Center Kinship and Data Analysis Panel for the National Institute of Justice and the Genetic Analysis Workshop Advisory Board. She also served as a member of the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) Board of Directors (1999-2001), as IGES president-elect, president and past president (2006-2008) and as chair of the IGES Ethical, Legal and Social Issues committee.[1]/nBailey-Wilson is actively studying a range of diseases, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, myopia and other eye diseases, autism and cleft lip and palate. Trained in statistical genetics, she is interested in understanding the genetics of complex diseases and developing novel methodologies to disentangle the roles that genes and environment play in disease causation. She has been particularly interested in lung cancer since the early 1980s, when very few scientists believed there might be a genetic link to the condition. Today, significantly more data support the idea that there are susceptibility alleles for one or more unknown genes that dramatically increase certain smokers' risk of developing lung cancer. In a collaboration called the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC), Bailey-Wilson and others recently narrowed down the location of a potential lung-cancer gene to a region of chromosome 6, and showed that RGS17 is a tumor suppressor gene in this region that shows association with lung cancer risk in highly aggregated lung cancer families. With her collaborators, she is using dense genotyping panels and next-generation DNA sequencing in the GELCC's set of highly aggregated lung cancer families, their family-history-positives cases, and age-gender-smoking matched controls to search for causal variants in additional lung cancer susceptibility loci.[1]/nBailey-Wilson has used similar approaches to locate other cancer-related genes. For example, she and her collaborators published evidence that genes involved in prostate cancer reside on specific regions of chromosomes 1, 8, 17 and X. These findings have been replicated, and three candidate genes with rare variants that appear to increase prostate cancer risk have been cloned: RNASEL (HPC1), which encodes ribonuclease L, MSRI, which encodes the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 and HOXB13, which encodes the homeobox B13 protein. Bailey-Wilson is focusing on identifying additional susceptibility genes for these and other cancers in ongoing studies. At present, she is collaborating with the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics on a whole exome sequencing study of families with strong family history of prostate cancer and is the lead statistician on the study of the ICPCG's African-American families.[1]/nBailey-Wilson is also applying these next-generation sequencing tools to her studies of highly aggregated non-syndromic oral cleft families from the Syrian Arab Republic (2 to 17 affected individuals per family) and to a set of multiplex autism spectrum disease families. In the autism study, a subset of families in which at least one child with autism also has abnormal cholesterol levels are of particular interest.[1]/nBailey-Wilson develops and tests novel computational methods to analyze genetic markers. Her group is especially interested in using machine learning methods to detect causal variants that have limited or no marginal effects on risk of a disease but which do show strong interaction effects (with either other genetic variants or with environmental risk factors). She is also working to address the effects of linkage disequilibrium, or the nonrandom association of closely spaced loci, on genetic interaction tests and machine learning methods. Linkage disequilibrium can be caused by a low frequency of recombinations between two loci when they are very close together on a chromosome. The closer two loci are, the more likely they are to exhibit linkage disequilibrium. Thus, markers that are only 100 kb apart display significantly greater linkage disequilibrium than markers that are 100\u20135,000 kb apart. Because standard linkage analysis methods typically assume no linkage disequilibrium exists between loci, Bailey-Wilson's group has developed approaches to streamline these methods to study sets of dense genetic markers. She is using association methods that take advantage of linkage disequilibrium data, HapMap data, and the sequence of the human genome to determine the location of genetic loci that increase risk for various diseases. She has used these and other analytical methods to determine, for example, whether alleles at specific marker loci are transmitted along with a disease through generations in families with several affected members.[1]/nBailey-Wilson has also used statistical methods to determine the marker alleles that people with a specific disease carry more frequently - and disease-free people carry less frequently - than can be explained by chance. This work has helped to greatly reduce the number of target regions that investigators need to search for potential disease-related genes. Her group is also developing approaches to mitigate the increased false-positive evidence of epistatic interaction that can be observed when strong LD exists between variants within a single genetic locus that all have a marginal effect on the trait.[1]/nBailey-Wilson has received a number of awards and honors, including the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Department of Medical Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine (1995), the Trustee's Alumni Award from Western Maryland College (1998), the Leadership Award from the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (2006), induction as an alumni member into Phi Beta Kappa (2010) and the NHGRI Outstanding Mentor Award (2011).

Elston is one of the leading figures in statistical genetics, a then-emerging field that draws on elements of epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, computer science, and statistics. They entered LSU as postdoctoral fellows and stayed for 15 years, each ultimately reaching the rank of full professor. When Elston left LSU for Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1995, Wilson and Bailey-Wilson decided to relocate as well, to NHGRI.[3]/nInitially they were in separate branches\u2014Wilson in the Genetic Disease Research Branch led by Robert Nussbaum and Bailey-Wilson in the Medical Genetics Branch led at the time by Clair Francomano.

When we buy computers, it's not laptop computers, it's big servers,\" explained Wilson.[3]/nSo two years later, Wilson and Bailey-Wilson became a branch unto themselves\u2014the Inherited Disease Research Branch (IDRB). Because NIH's anti-nepotism rules prohibit one spouse from supervising the other, Nussbaum was appointed acting chief of the branch. Over the years, Nussbaum gradually taught Wilson and Bailey-Wilson the administrative aspects of the chief's job; thus, they were well prepared to take over this year. \"He trained us up,\" said Wilson.[3]/nCo-branch chiefs are rare at the NIH; married co-chiefs are even rarer.

This Vararuci is often identified with K\u0101ty\u0101yana.[1] K\u0101ty\u0101yana is the author of V\u0101rtik\u0101s which is an elaboration of certain s\u016btr\u0101s (rules or aphorisms) in P\u0101\u1e47ini's much revered treatise on Sanskrit grammar titled A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b. K\u0101ty\u0101yana is believed to have flourished in the 3rd century BCE.[2] However, this identification of Vararuci with K\u0101ty\u0101yana has not been fully accepted by scholars.[3]\nVararuci is believed to be the author of Pr\u0101krita Prak\u0101\u015ba, the oldest treatise on the grammar of Pr\u0101krit language.[1]\nVararuci's name appears in a verse listing the 'nine gems' (navaratnas) in the court of one Samrat Vikramaditya.[4] Vararuci appears as a prominent character in Kathasaritsagara (\"ocean of the streams of stories\"), a famous 11th century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold by a Saivite Brahmin named Somadeva.The Aithihyamala of Kottarathil Shankunni states that Vararuchi was the son of Govinda Swami i.e. Govinda Bhagavatpada. It also states that King Vikramadithya, Bhatti- minister of King Vikramaditya and Bhartruhari were his brothers.[citation needed]/nVararuci is the father figure in a legend in Kerala popularly referred to as the legend of thetwelve clans born of a pariah woman (Parayi petta panthirukulam).[5]\nVararuci of Kerala legend was also an astute astronomer believed to be the author of Chandrav\u0101kyas (moon sentences), a set of numbers specifying the longitudes of the Moon at different intervals of time.[6] These numbers are coded in the katapay\u0101di system of numeration and it is believed that Vararuci himself was the inventor of this system of numeration. The eldest son of Vararuci of Kerala legend is known as Mezhathol Agnihothri and he is supposed to have lived between 343 and 378 CE.[7]/nThe name Vararuchi is associated with more than a dozen works in Sanskrit, and the name Katyayana is associated with about sixteen works.[8] There are around ten works connected with astronomy and mathematics associated with the name of Vararuci.[9]/nPossibly there are at least three persons named Vararuci in the astronomical tradition of South India./nThis Vararuchi is the father figure in the astronomical tradition of Kerala.  He is also the father figure in the legend of the twelve clans born of the Pariah woman. The eldest son of this Vararuci, the establisher of the first of the twelve clans, was one Mezhattol Agnihotri and he is supposed to have lived between 343 and 378 CE.  Based on this, Vararuci is supposed to have lived in the first half of the 4th century CE. The manuscript tradition of Kerala ascribes to Vararuci the authorship of Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s (moon sentences)[10][11] which is a set of 248 numbers for calculating the position of the sun and moon. This work is also known by the name Vararuci-V\u0101ky\u0101s.  Vararuci is also believed to be the originator of the Katapayadi notation of depicting numbers, which has been used in the formulation of Chandrav\u0101ky\u0101s./nThis astronomer is the author of the well-known V\u0101kyakara\u1e47a, which is the source book of the V\u0101kya Panch\u0101nga, popular in South India, .[12][13] This Vararuchi belonged to the Kerala region, as is clear from the introductory verses of the work. It has been shown that this treatise was originally produced around 1282 CE.[12] The treatise is also known as V\u0101kyapa\u00f1c\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b and is based on the works of Haridatta (c. 650 CE) of Kerala. Sundararaja, an astronomer from Tamil Nadu contemporaneous with Nilakantha Somayaji, has composed a commentary on V\u0101kyakarana and the commentary contains several references to Vararuci.[12] In five chapters V\u0101kyakara\u1e47a deals with all aspects of astronomy required for the preparation of the Hindu almanac. Chapter I is concerned with the computation of the sun, the moon and the moon's nodes, Chapter II with that of the planets. Chapter III is devoted to problems involving time, position and direction and other preliminaries like the precession of the equinoxes. Chapter IV deals with the computation of the lunar and solar eclipses. Chapter V is devoted to computation of the conjunction of the planets and of the planets and stars./nMany texts have been ascribed to Vararuci, such as Kerala-Vararuchi-Vakya, Kerala-Vararuchi-proktha, Kerala-dv\u0101da\u015ba-bh\u0101va-v\u0101ky\u0101ni, Vararuchi-Kerala, Bh\u0101rgava-pa\u00f1c\u0101\u1e45ga etc. The Vararuchi, who is the author of the above works on astrology might be identical to Vararuchi of Kerala, but it is not possible to assert that he is the same as the author of the Chandra-V\u0101ky\u0101s.[14]/nIn ancient India, grammar was the first and most important of all sciences. When one had first studied grammar, he could go in for learning any other science.[15]\nThis historical mindset justifies the great respect and prestige attributed to the ancient grammarians of India like P\u0101\u1e47ini and Patanjali. P\u0101\u1e47ini was an ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian from Pushkalavati, Gandhara (fl. 4th century BCE).\nHe is known for his Sanskrit grammar text known as A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b (meaning 'eight chapters'). The Ashtadhyayi is one of the earliest known grammars of Sanskrit. After P\u0101\u1e47ini, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya ('great commentary') of Pata\u00f1jali on the Ashtadhyayi is one of the three most famous works in Sanskrit grammar.[citation needed] It was with Pata\u00f1jali that Indian linguistic science reached its definite form.\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana (c. 3rd century BCE) was a Sanskrit grammarian, mathematician and Vedic priest who lived in ancient India. He is known as the author of the Varttika, an elaboration on P\u0101\u1e47ini grammar. Along with the Mah\u0101bh\u0101sya of Pata\u00f1jali, this text became a core part of the vy\u0101karana (grammar) canon. (A v\u0101rttika is defined as a single remark or a whole work attempting to present a detailed commentary.) In many accounts Katyayana has been referred to as Vararuci.[15] K\u0101ty\u0101yana's V\u0101rtik\u0101s correct, supplement, eliminate as unnecessary, or justify the rules of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[16]\n[17]\nIn his Vajasaneyi Pratisakhya, he subjected about 1500 sutras of Panini to critical\nobservations.[18]/nThe term Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt or Prakrit denotes a multitude of languages all originated from Sanskrit. They are all considered as derived from Sanskrit and developed by adopting deviations and by corruption.[19] There is no complete agreement on what languages are to be included in this group. Prakrit is also closely connected with the development of Buddhist and Jaina philosophical thought./nVararuci is the name of the author of the oldest extant grammar of Prakrit, titled Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt Prak\u0101\u015ba.[1] In this work Vararuci has considered four different dialects: Maharashtri, the older form of Marathi; Sauraseni, which evolved into the Braj language; Magadhi, the former form of Bihari; and Paisaci, a language no longer extant.  The book is divided into twelve chapters.  The first nine chapters containing a total of 424 rules are devoted to Maharashtri and of the remaining three chapters, one each is devoted to Paisaci with 14 rules, M\u0101gadhi with 17 rules, and Sauraseni with 32 rules respectively.[19]/nThe author of Prakrita Prakasa was also known by the name Katyayana, perhaps the gotra name of Vararuci. This gotra name was given to him by the unknown author of a commentary of Prakrita Prakasa named Prakritamanjari. In Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara and Kshemendra's Brihatkathamanjari one can see that Katyayana was called Vararuci. The oldest commentator of Prakrita Prakasa was Bhamaha an inhabitant of Kashmir who was also a rhetorician as well as a poet.[19]/nThe \u015aulbas\u016btras are appendices to the Vedas which give rules for constructing altars. They are the only sources of knowledge of Indian mathematics from the Vedic period. There are several \u015aulbas\u016btras. The most important of these are the Baudhayana \u015aulbas\u016btra, written about 800 BCE; the Apastamba \u015aulbas\u016btra, written about 600 BCE; Manava \u015aulbas\u016btra, written about 750 BCE; and the Katyayana \u015aulbas\u016btra, written about 200 BCE.[20] Since Katyayana has been identified with one Vararuci, possibly the author of the Vartikas, Katyayana \u015aulbas\u016btra is referred to as Vararuci \u015aulbas\u016btra also.[21]/nVararuci was also a legendary figure in the Indian literary tradition.[22]/nThough litt\u00e9rateur Vararuci is recorded to have composed several Kavyas, only one complete work is currently extant. This is a satirical monologue titled Ubhayabhisarika.[22]\nThe work titled Ubhayabhisarika (The mutual elopement) appears in a collection of four monologues titled Chaturbhani, the other monologues in the collection being Padma-prabhritaka (The lotus gift) by Shudraka, Dhurta-vita-samvada (Rogue and pimp confer) by Isvaradatta and Padataditaka (The kick) by Shyamalika. The collection along with an English translation has been published in Clay Sanskrit Library under the title The Quartet of Causeries.[23] Ubhayabhisarika is set in Pataliputra and it is dated to somewhere between the 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE. It might be the earliest Indian play extant.[23] Some scholars are of the opinion that the work was composed in the 5th century CE.[23]/nHe is also said to have written two kavyas by names Kanthabharana (The necklace) and Charumati. There are several verses ascribed to Vararuci appearing in different literary works. Other works attributed to Vararuci are: Nitiratna, a book with didactic contents; Niruktasamuccaya, a commentary on the Nirukta of Yaska; Pushpasutra, a Pratishakhya of the Samaveda; a lexicon; and, an alamkara work.[citation needed]/nVararuci's name appears in a Sanskrit verse specifying the names of the 'nine gems' (navaratnas) in the court of the legendary Samrat Vikramaditya who is said to have founded the Vikrama era in 57 BCE. This verse appears in Jyotirvidabharana,[24] which is supposed to be a work of the great Kalidasa but is in fact a late forgery.\n[25] This verse appears in the last chapter (Sloka 20\u00a0: Chapter XXII) of Jyotirvidabharana.[26] That the great Kalidasa is the author of Jyotirvidabharana is difficult to believe because Varahamihira, one of the nine gems listed in the verse, in his Pancasiddhantika refers to Aryabhata, who was born in 476 CE and wrote his Aryabhatiya in 499 CE or a little later.  Jyotirvidabharana is a later work of about 12th century CE.[26] There might have been a very respected Vararuci in the court of one King Vikrama, but the identities of the particular Vararuci and the King Vikrama are uncertain./nThe names of the nine gems are found in the following Sanskrit verse:/ndhanvantarik\u1e63apa\u1e47ak\u0101marasi\u1e43ha\u015ba\u1e45ku\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vet\u0101labha\u1e6d\u1e6da gha\u1e6dakarpara k\u0101lid\u0101s\u0101\u1e25 |\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0khy\u0101to var\u0101hamihiro n\u1e5bpate sabh\u0101y\u0101\u1e43\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ratn\u0101ni vai vararucirnava vikramasya ||/nThe names of the nine gems and their traditional claims to fame are the following:/nThere are several versions of these legends./nOne of these versions is given in Castes and tribes of Southern India  by Edgar Thurston. This seven volume work is a systematic and detailed account of more than 300 castes and tribes in the erstwhile Madras Presidency and the states of Travancore and Cochin. It was originally published in 1909. The Vararuci legend is given in Volume 1 (pp.\u00a0120 \u2013 125) in the discussion on the Paraiyan caste. Thurston has recorded that the discussion is based on a note prepared by L.K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar./nA slight variant of the legend can be seen in Aithihyamala by Kottarathil Sankunny (1855\u20131937). This work originally written in Malayalam and published as a series of pamphlets during the years 1909 \u2013 1934 is a definitive source of myths and legends of Kerala. (An English language translation of the work has recently been published under the title Lore and Legends of Kerala.[27][28]) The story of Vararuci is given in the narration of the legend of Parayi petta panthirukulam./nIn these legends,[29] Vararuchi, a son of a Brahmin named Chandragupta and his Brahmin wife who was an astute astrologer, became king of Avanti and ruled until Vikram\u0101ditya, son of Chandragupta by his K\u1e63atriya wife came of age and the king abdicated in his favor. Once when he was resting under an a\u015bvastha (ficus religiosa) tree he happened to overhear a conversation between two Gandharv\u0101s on the tree to the effect that he would marry a certain, just then born, paraiya girl. This he tried to prevent by arranging, with the help of the king, to have the girl enclosed in a box and floated down a river with a nail stuck into her head./nAfter floating down the river through a long distance, the box came into the hands of a Br\u0101hman who was bathing in the river. Finding a beautiful and charming little girl inside the box and accepting it as a divine gift he adopted her as his own daughter and helped her groom up accordingly. Vararuci in his travels happened to pass by the house of this Br\u0101hman and the Br\u0101hman invited him to lunch with him. Vararuci accepted the invitation on condition that the Br\u0101hman had to prepare eighteen curries and would give him what remained after feeding a hundred other Br\u0101hmans. The host was puzzled. But his adopted daughter was unfazed. She placed a long plantain leaf in front of Vararuci and served a preparation using ginger (symbolically corresponding to eighteen curries) and some rice which had been used an offering at the Vaisvadeva ceremony (symbolically equivalent to feeding a hundred a Br\u0101hmans). Knowing this to be the work of the host's daughter and fully convinced of her superior intellect Vararuci expressed his desire to marry her. The desire was acceded to by the Br\u0101hman./nDays passed. One day while conversing with his wife about their past lives he accidentally saw a nail stuck in her head and he immediately knew her to be the girl whom he caused to be floated down a river.  He realised the impossibility of altering one's fate and resolved to go on a pilgrimage with his wife bathing in rivers and worshiping at temples./nAt the end of these pilgrimages they reached Kerala and while in Kerala the woman bore him twelve children. All these children, except one, were abandoned on the wayside and were picked up members of different castes and were brought up according to the customs and traditions of those castes. They were all remarkable for their wisdom, gifted with the power of performing miracles, and were all believed to incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. These children are known by the names:[30]/nThere are several legends about these children of Vararuci.  In one such legend, P\u0101kkan\u0101r tries to dissuade a group of Br\u0101hmans who had resolved to go to Benares from so doing, by telling them that the journey to the sacred city would not be of productive of salvation. To prove the fruitlessness of the journey, he plucked a lotus flower from a stagnant pool and gave it to the Br\u0101hmans and instructed them to give it to a hand which would rise from the Ganges and to say that it was a present for Goddess Ganga from P\u0101kkan\u0101r. They did as directed and returned with news of the miracle. P\u0101kkan\u0101r then led them to a stagnant pool and said: \"Please return the lotus flower, Oh! Ganga!\". According to the legend, the same lotus flower instantly appeared in his hand./nThere is another legend regarding the circumstances leading to Vararuci's arrival in Kerala.[30][31][32] In this legend, Vararuci appears as a very learned scholar in the court of Vikramaditya. Once King Vikramaditya asked Vararuci to tell him about the most important verses in the whole of Valmiki's Ramayana. Since Vararuci could not give an immediate answer, the King granted him 40 days to find out the same and to report back to the king.  If he were unable to find the correct answer, he would be required to leave the court. Vararuci left the court in search of an answer and during his wanderings, on the last night of the stipulated period, Vararuci happened to rest under a tree. While half awake and half asleep Vararuci happened to overhear a conversation of the Vanadevatas resting on the tree regarding the fate of a newly born Paraiah infant girl and they were telling each other that the poor Br\u0101hman who does not know that the verses beginning with \"m\u0101\u1e43 viddhi..\" is the most important verse in Ramayana would marry her. Vararuci most pleased with his discovery returned to the court and told the king the surprising answer. The king was very pleased and Vararuci prevailed upon Vikramiditya to destroy all pariah infant girls recently born in a certain locality. The girl was not killed instead was floated down a river with a nail stuck through the heads. The rest of the legend is as described in the first version of the legend./nKathasaritsagara ('ocean of the streams of stories') is a famous 11th century collection of Indian legends, fairy tales and folk tales as retold by a Saivite Brahmin named Somadeva. Nothing is known about the author other than that his father's name was Ramadevabatta. The work was compiled for the entertainment of the queen Suryamati, wife of king Anantadeva of Kashmir (r. 1063\u201381). It consists of 18 books of 124 chapters and more than 21,000 verses in addition to prose sections. Vararuchi's story is told in great detail in the first four chapters of this great collection of stories. The following is a very brief account of some of the main events in the life of Vararuchi as told in this classic. It emphasises the divine ancestry and magical powers of Vararuchi.[33][34][35][36][37]/nOnce P\u0101rvati pleaded with Shiva to tell her a story nobody had heard before. After much persuasions Shiva agreed and narrated the story of Vidyadharas. To ensure that nobody else would hear the story, Parvati had ordered that nobody be allowed to enter the place where they were and Nandi (The Vehicle of Lord Shiva) kept guard at the door. While Shiva was thus speaking to his consort in private thus, Pushpadanta, one of Shiva's trusted attendants, a member of his gana, appeared at the door. Having denied entry and overcame by curiosity, Pushpadanta summoned his special powers to move about unseen and entered the chamber of Shiva and eavesdropped the entire story as told by Shiva. Pushpadanta then narrated the entire story to his wife Jaya and Jaya retold the same to Parvati! Parvati became enraged and told Shiva: \"Thou didst tell me any extraordinary tale, for Jaya knows it also.\" Shiva, due to his meditational powers, immediately knew the truth and told Parvati of the role of Pushpadanta in leaking the story to Jaya. Having heard this, Parvati became exceedingly enraged and cursed Pushpadanta to be mortal. Then he together with Jaya fell at Parvati's feet and entreated her to say when the curse would end.\n\"A Yaksha named Suprat\u00eeka, who has been made a Pisacha by the curse of Kuvera, is residing in the Vindhya forest under the name of K\u0101\u1e47abh\u016bti.

Vararuchi was also known as K\u0101ty\u0101yana. At the time of his birth there was a heavenly pronouncement that he would be known as Varauchi because of his interest (ruchi) in the best (vara) things. It was also pronounced that he would be a world-renowned authority on grammar. Vararuchi was divinely blessed with a special gift: who could get anything by heart by hearing only once. In course of time Vararuchi became a student of Varsha along with Indradatta and Vy\u0101di. Though Vararuchi was defeated by P\u0101\u1e47ini in a test of scholarship, Vararuchi by hard work excelled P\u0101\u1e47ini in grammar. Later Vararuchi became a minister to King Yogananda of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra./nOnce he went on a visit to the shrine of Durg\u0101. Goddess Durga, being pleased with his austerities, ordered him in a dream to go to the forests of the Vindhya to behold K\u0101\u1e47\u0101bh\u016bti. Proceeding to Vindhya, he saw, surrounded by hundreds of Pi\u015b\u0101chas, that Pai\u015b\u0101cha K\u0101\u1e47\u0101bh\u016bti, in stature like a \u015b\u0101la tree. When K\u0101\u1e47\u0101bh\u016bti had seen him and respectfully clasped his feet, K\u0101ty\u0101yana sitting down immediately spoke to him thus: \"Thou art an observer of the good custom, how hast thou come into this state?\" When K\u0101\u1e47\u0101bh\u016bti finished his story, Vararuchi remembered his origin, and exclaimed like one aroused from sleep: \"I am that very Pushpadanta, hear that tale from me.\" and Vararuchi told all his history from his birth at full length./nVararuchi then went to the tranquil site of the hermitage of Badar\u00ee. There he, desirous of putting off his mortal condition, resorted for meditation with intense devotion to that goddess and she, manifesting her real form to him, told him the secret of that meditation which arises from fire, to help him to put off the body. Then Vararuchi, having consumed his body by that form of meditation, reached his own heavenly home./nThe characters in one of the several stories in Pancatantra are King Nanda and Vararuci.[38] This story appear as the fifth story titled A Three in One Story in Strategy Four\u00a0: Loss of Gains./nOnce upon a time, there was a much respected popular king called Nanda. He had a minister called Vararuchi. He was a very learned man well versed in philosophy and statecraft./nVararuchi's wife was one day annoyed with her husband and kept away from him. Extremely fond of his wife, the minister tried every possible tactics he could think of to please her. Every method failed. Finally he pleaded with her: \"Tell me what can I do to make you happy.\" The wife said sarcastically: \"Shave your head cleanly and prostrate before me, then I will be happy.\" The minister meekly complied with her wish and succeeded in winning back her company and love./nKing Nanda's queen also enacted the same drama of shunning his company. Nanda tried every trick he knew of to win her affection. King also failed in his efforts. Then the King fell on her feet and prayed: \"My darling, I cannot live without you even for a while. Tell me what should I do to win back your love?\" The queen said: \"I will be happy if you pretend to be a horse, agree to be bridled and to let me ride you. While racing you must neigh like a horse. Is this acceptable to you?\"  \"Yes,\" said the king and he did as his wife demanded./nNext day, the king saw Vararuchi with a shaven head and asked him, \"Vararuchi, why have you shaved your head all of a sudden?\"  Vararuchi replied: \"O king, is there anything that a woman does not demand and a man does not readily concede? He would do anything, shave his head or neigh like a horse.\"/nRaktamukha, the monkey, then told Karalamukha, the crocodile: \"You wicked crocodile, you are a slave of your wife like Nanda and Vararuchi.

Bjerknes' earlier work was in pure mathematics, but he is principally known for his studies in hydrodynamics.[1]/nCarl Anton Bjerknes was born in Oslo, Norway. His father was Abraham Isaksen Bjerknes and his mother Elen Birgitte Holmen. Bjerknes studied mining at the University of Oslo, and after that mathematics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and the University of Paris. In 1866 he held a chair for applied mathematics and in 1869 for mathematics. Over a fifty-year time period,  Bjerknes taught mathematics at the University of Oslo and at the military college./nA pupil of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Gabriel Lam\u00e9 and Augustin-Louis Cauchy Bjerknes worked for the rest of his life in the field of hydrodynamics. He tried to explain the electrodynamics of James Clerk Maxwell by hydrodynamical analogies and similarly he proposed a mechanical explanation of gravitation. Although he did not succeed in his attempts to explain all those things, his findings in the field of hydrodynamics were important. His experiments were shown at the first International Exposition of Electricity in Paris that ran from August 15, 1881 through to November 15, 1881 at the Palais de l'Industrie on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and at the Scandinavian naturalist meeting in Stockholm./nJohn Charles Fields the founder of the Fields Medal for outstanding achievement in mathematics had this to say about the great minds that Norway had produced since it gained independence:/n...for the number of great men which Norway has produced within the comparatively short period of its national existence is quite remarkable. Niels Henrik Abel was the first of a succession of eminent mathematicians, and it is not alone in mathematics that Norwegians have distinguished themselves ... [Among those] are to be found such men as Bjerknes, Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow and Sophus Lie in mathematics, Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson and Henrik Ibsen in literature, Edvard Grieg and Christian Sinding in music.[2]/nWhen at the 1881 Paris International Electric Exhibition, he (Carl Anton) and his son (Vilhelm Bjerknes), demonstrated instruments that reproduced hydrodynamic analogies, few observers could ignore these baffling phenomena. Such celebrities as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the Siemens brothers, and the Marquis of Salisbury visited the small Norwegian exhibit booth and watched with amazement as a system of pulsating spheres and similar devices appeared to reproduce well-known electric and magnetic phenomena. For many observers the Bjerknes apparatus seemed to illustrate that the mysterious nature of electricity could perhaps be revealed. British observers allegedly exclaimed, \"Maxwell should have seen this!\" Of the eleven dipl\u00f4mes d'honneur, seven went to non-French exhibitors, including Werner Siemens, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and William Thomson. Professor Carl Anton Bjerknes, representing Norway, joined their ranks.[3]/nOn June 30, 1859, after returning from his foreign travels, Bjerknes married Wilhelmine Dorothea Koren (10.11.1837\u201321.10.1923) whose father was a minister in the Church in West Norway.

Jake Waddington by her father's first marriage. Her mother was the daughter of Amber Reeves, the noted feminist, author and lover of H. G. Wells. McDuff grew up in Scotland where her father was Professor of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. McDuff was educated at St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh and, although the standard was lower than at the corresponding boys' school, The Edinburgh Academy, McDuff had an exceptionally good mathematics teacher.[7] She writes:/nI always wanted to be a mathematician (apart from a time when I was eleven when I wanted to be a farmer's wife), and assumed that I would have a career, but I had no idea how to go about it: I didn't realize that the choices which one made about education were important and I had no idea that I might experience real difficulties and conflicts in reconciling the demands of a career with life as a woman.[8]/nTurning down a scholarship to the University of Cambridge to stay with her boyfriend in Scotland, she enrolled at the University of Edinburgh.[7] She graduated with a BSc Hons in 1967, going on to Girton College, Cambridge as a doctoral student. Here, under the guidance of mathematician George A. Reid, McDuff worked on problems in functional analysis. She solved a problem on Von Neumann algebras, constructing infinitely many different factors of type II1, and published the work in the Annals of Mathematics./nAfter completing her doctorate in 1971 McDuff was appointed to a two-year Science Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship at Cambridge. Following her husband, the literary translator David McDuff, she left for a six-month visit to Moscow. Her husband was studying the Russian Symbolist poet Innokenty Annensky. Though McDuff had no specific plans[9] it turned out to be a profitable visit for her mathematically. There, she met Israel Gelfand in Moscow who gave her a deeper appreciation of mathematics.[7][8] McDuff later wrote:/n[My collaboration with him]... was not planned: it happened that his was the only name which came to mind when I had to fill out a form in the Inotdel office. The first thing that Gel'fand told me was that he was much more interested in the fact that my husband was studying the Russian Symbolist poet Innokenty Annensky than that I had found infinitely many type II-sub-one factors, but then he proceeded to open my eyes to the world of mathematics. It was a wonderful education, in which reading Pushkin, Mozart and Salieri played as important a role as learning about Lie groups or reading Cartan and Eilenberg. Gel'fand amazed me by talking of mathematics as though it were poetry. He once said about a long paper bristling with formulas that it contained the vague beginnings of an idea which he could only hint at and which he had never managed to bring out more clearly. I had always thought of mathematics as being much more straightforward: a formula is a formula, and an algebra is an algebra, but Gel'fand found hedgehogs lurking in the rows of his spectral sequences!/nOn returning to Cambridge McDuff started attending Frank Adams's topology lectures and was soon invited to teach at the University of York. In 1975 she separated from her husband, and was divorced in 1978.[6][10] At the University of York, she \"essentially wrote a second PhD\"[9] while working with Graeme Segal. At this time a position at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) opened up for her, reserved for visiting female mathematicians. Her career as a mathematician developed further while at MIT, and soon she was accepted to the Institute for Advanced Study where she worked with Segal on the Atiyah\u2013Segal completion theorem. She then returned to England, where she took up a lectureship at the University of Warwick.[11]/nAround this time she met mathematician John Milnor who was then based in Princeton University. To live closer to him she took up an untenured assistant professorship at the Stony Brook University.[9] Now an independent mathematician, she began work on the relationship between diffeomorphisms and the classifying space for foliations. She has since worked on symplectic topology. In the spring of 1985, McDuff attended the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques in Paris to study Mikhael Gromov's work on elliptic methods. Since 2007, she has held the Helen Lyttle Kimmel chair at Barnard College./nIn 1984 McDuff married Milnor, now a professor at Stony Brook University, and a Fields medallist, Wolf Prize winner and Abel Prize Laureate.[6][10][12]/nFor the past 30 years McDuff has been a contributor to the development of the field of symplectic geometry and topology. She gave the first example of symplectic forms on a closed manifold that are cohomologous but not diffeomorphic and also classified the rational and ruled symplectic four-manifolds, completed with Fran\u00e7ois Lalonde.[13] More recently, partly in collaboration with Susan Tolman,[14] she has studied applications of methods of symplectic topology to the theory of Hamiltonian torus actions.  She has also worked on embedding capacities of 4-dimensional symplectic ellipsoids with Felix Schlenk,[15] which gives rise to some very interesting number-theoretical questions. It also indicates a connection between the combinatorics of J-holomorphic curves in the blow up of the projective plane and the numbers that appear as indices in embedded contact homology.[10][12] With Katrin Wehrheim, she has challenged the foundational rigor of a classic proof in symplectic geometry.[16]/nWith Dietmar Salamon, she co-authored two textbooks Introduction to Symplectic Topology[17] and J-Holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology.[18][19]/nMcDuff was the first to be awarded the Satter Prize, in 1991, for her work on symplectic geometry; she is a Fellow of the Royal Society (1994), a Noether Lecturer (1998) and a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences (1999) and the American Philosophical Society (2013).[20] In 2008 she was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[21] She was a Plenary Lecturer at the 1998 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM)[22] and an Invited Speaker at the 1990 ICM.[23] In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[24] In 1999, she was the first female Hardy Lecturer, an award from the London Mathematical Society.[25] She is also a member of the Academia Europaea,[26] \nand is part of the 2019 class of fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics.[27]/nIn 2010, she was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize of the London Mathematical Society.[28] For 2017 she received, jointly with Dietmar Salamon, the AMS Leroy P.

He won several scholarships and prizes at Cambridge, one of which enabled him to study under J. J. Thomson.[4]/nTaylor published his first paper while he was still an undergraduate. In it, he showed that interference of visible light produced fringes even with extremely weak light sources.[5] The interference effects were produced with light from a gas light, attenuated through a series of dark glass plates, diffracting around a sewing needle. Three months were required to produce a sufficient exposure of the photographic plate. The paper does not mention quanta of light (photons) and does not reference Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, but today the result can be interpreted by saying that less than one photon on average was present at a time. Once it became widely accepted in around 1927 that the electromagnetic field was quantized, Taylor's experiment began to be presented in pedagogical treatments as evidence that interference effects with light cannot be interpreted in terms of one photon interfering with another photon\u2014that, in fact, a single photon must travel through both slits of a double-slit apparatus. Modern understanding of the subject has shown that the conditions in Taylor's experiment were not sufficient to demonstrate this, because the light source was not a single-photon source, but the experiment was reproduced in 1986 using a single-photon source, and the same result was obtained.[6]/nHe followed this up with work on shock waves, winning a Smith's Prize.[7]:\u200a43\u200a  In 1910 he was elected to a Fellowship at Trinity College, and the following year he was appointed to a meteorology post, becoming Reader in Dynamical Meteorology.

It was in this period that he did his most wide-ranging work on fluid mechanics and solid mechanics, including research on the deformation of crystalline materials which followed from his war work at Farnborough. He also produced another major contribution to turbulent flow, where he introduced a new approach through a statistical study of velocity fluctuations.[4]/nIn 1934, Taylor, roughly contemporaneously with Michael Polanyi and Egon Orowan, realised that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905.

He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences the following year.[16]/nTaylor was present at the Trinity nuclear test, July 16, 1945, as part of General Leslie Groves' \"VIP List\" of 10 people who observed the test from Compania Hill, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) northwest of the shot tower. By coincidence, Joan Hinton, another direct descendant of the mathematician George Boole, had been working on the same project and witnessed the event in an unofficial capacity. The cousins met at the time but later followed different paths. Joan, strongly opposed to nuclear weapons, defected to Mao's China, while Taylor maintained that political policy was not within the remit of the scientist.[17]/nIn 1950, he published two papers estimating the yield of the explosion using the Buckingham Pi theorem, and high speed photography stills from that test, bearing timestamps and physical scale of the blast radius, which had been published in Life magazine.  He gave two estimates of 16.8 and 23.7 kt, close to the accepted value of 20 kt, which was still highly classified at that time.[18]/nTaylor continued his research after the war, serving on the Aeronautical Research Committee and working on the development of supersonic aircraft. Though he officially retired in 1952, he continued research for the next twenty years, concentrating on problems that could be attacked using simple equipment. This led to such advances as a method for measuring the second coefficient of viscosity. Taylor devised an incompressible liquid with separated gas bubbles suspended in it. The dissipation of the gas in the liquid during expansion was a consequence of the shear viscosity of the liquid. Thus the bulk viscosity could easily be calculated.[11][19]\nHis other late work included the longitudinal dispersion in flow in tubes,[11][20] movement through porous surfaces, and the dynamics of thin sheets of liquids.[11]/nBetween the ages of 78 and 83, Taylor wrote six papers on electrohydrodynamics.  In this work he returned to his interest in electrical activity in thunderstorms, as jets of conducting liquid motivated by electrical fields. The cone from which such jets are observed is called the Taylor cone, after him. He went on to publish two more papers, on additional topics, in 1971 and 1973. In 1972 D. H. MIchael read Taylor's paper, on making holes in a thin sheet of liquid, at the 13th International Conferences for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics in Moscow. Taylor had suffered a stroke and could not attend. He had presented at every one of the previous conferences.[11]/nAspects of Taylor's life often found expression in his work. His over-riding interest in the movement of air and water, and by extension his studies of the movement of unicellular marine creatures and of weather, were related to his lifelong love of sailing. In the 1930s he invented the 'CQR' anchor, which was both stronger and more manageable than any in use, and which was used for all sorts of small craft including seaplanes.[21]/nTaylor married Grace Stephanie Frances Ravenhill, a school teacher in 1925. They stayed together until Stephanie's death in 1965. Taylor suffered a severe stroke in 1972 which effectively put an end to his work. He died in Cambridge in 1975.[11] He is buried in the churchyard of St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge./nTaylor received many awards and honours.[11]", "40423267": "Benjamin Weiss (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e1; born 1941) is an American-Israeli mathematician known for his contributions to ergodic theory, topological dynamics, probability theory, game theory, and descriptive set theory./nBenjamin (\"Benjy\") Weiss was born  in New York City.

Lander, a social studies teacher, and Harold Lander, an attorney.[13] He was captain of the math team at Stuyvesant High School,[14] graduating in 1974 as valedictorian and an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist for the U.S.[15] At age 17, he wrote a paper on quasiperfect numbers for which he won the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.[15]/nAfter graduating from Stuyvesant High School as valedictorian in 1974, Lander graduated from Princeton University in 1978 as valedictorian and with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics.[15][16] He completed his senior thesis, \"On the structure of projective modules\", under John Coleman Moore's supervision.[17] He then moved to the University of Oxford where he was a Rhodes Scholar and student of Wolfson College, Oxford.[18] He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree by the University of Oxford in 1980 with a thesis on algebraic coding theory and symmetric block designs supervised by Peter Cameron.[19]/nDuring his career, Lander has worked on human genetic variation, human population history, genome evolution, non-coding RNAs, three-dimensional folding of the human genome and genome-wide association studies to discover the genes essential for biological processes using CRISPR-based editing./nAs a mathematician, Lander studied combinatorics and applications of representation theory to coding theory. He enjoyed mathematics but did not wish to spend his life in such a \"monastic\" career.[20] Unsure what to do next, he took a job teaching managerial economics at Harvard Business School.  At the suggestion of his brother, developmental biologist Arthur Lander, he started to look at neurobiology, saying at the time, \"because there's a lot of information in the brain\".[21] To understand mathematical neurobiology, he felt he had to study cellular neurobiology; this, in turn, led to studying microbiology and eventually genetics. \"When I finally feel I have learned genetics, I should get back to these other problems. But I'm still trying to get the genetics right\", Lander said./nLander later became acquainted with David Botstein, a geneticist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Botstein was working on a way to unravel how subtle differences in complex genetic systems can become disorders such as cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, and even obesity. The two collaborated to develop a computer algorithm to analyze the maps of genes.[20] In 1986 Lander joined the Whitehead Institute and became an assistant professor at MIT. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1987. In 1990, he founded the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (WICGR). The WICGR became one of the world's leading centers of genome research, and under Lander's leadership made great progress in developing new methods of analyzing mammalian genomes. It also made important breakthroughs in applying this information to the study of human genetic variation and formed the basis for the foundation of the Broad Institute\u2014a transformation Lander spearheaded./nTwo main groups attempted to sequence the human genome. The first was the Human Genome Project, a loosely organized, publicly funded effort that intended to publish the information it obtained freely and without restrictions. Many research groups from countries all over the world were involved in this effort. The second was undertaken by Celera Genomics, which intended to patent the information obtained and charge subscriptions for use of the sequence data. Established first, the Human Genome Project moved slowly in the early phases as the Department of Energy's role was unclear and sequencing technology was in its infancy. Officially, the Human Genome Project had an eight-year head start before Celera entered the race, though discussions for the Human Genome Project began fourteen years before Celera announced their own project.[22][23] Because the Human Genome Project was a $3 billion publicly funded venture,[22] the consortia raced to enter as much of the human genome into the public domain as quickly as possible once Celera began work in 1998. This was a change of strategy for the Human Genome Project, because many scientists at the time wanted to establish a more complete copy of the genome, not simply publish the many fragments individually. Lander aggressively pressured Human Genome Project scientists to work longer and faster to publish genome fragments before Celera.[24] Lander himself is now listed on 73 patents and patent applications related to genomics.[25]/nIn February 2001, both the Human Genome Project and Celera published drafts of the human genome in the scientific journals Nature[26] and Science,[27] respectively. In the Human Genome Project's Nature publication, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Center for Genome Research, was listed first, with Lander listed as the first named author.[26][28]/nLeveraging Celera's sequencing and analysis techniques, the Whitehead Institute also made a contribution to the sequencing of the mouse genome,[29] an important step in fully understanding the molecular biology of mice, which are often used as model organisms in studies of everything from human diseases to embryonic development. The WICGR has since sequenced the genomes of Ciona savignyi (sea squirt),[30] the pufferfish,[31] the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa,[32] and multiple relatives of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[33] one of the most studied yeasts. The Ciona savignyi genome provides a good system for exploring the evolutionary origins of all vertebrates. Pufferfish have smaller-sized genomes than other vertebrates; as a result, their genomes are \"mini\" models for vertebrates. The sequencing of the yeasts related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae will facilitate the identification of key gene regulatory elements, some of which may be common to all eukaryotes (including both plant and animal kingdoms)./nLander was the founding editor of the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics.[34] He remained editor till 2004./nSequence data is a list of bases found in a given stretch of DNA. Its value lies in the discoveries and new technologies it allows. For Lander, one of these applications is the study of disease. Lander is the founder and director of the Broad Institute, a collaboration between MIT, Harvard, the Whitehead Institute, and affiliated hospitals. Its goal is \"to create tools for genome medicine and make them broadly available to the scientific community in order to apply these tools to propel the understanding and treatment of disease\". To this end, they are studying the variation in the human genome and have led an international effort that has assembled a library of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). These act as markers or signposts in the genome, allowing the identification of disease susceptibility genes. They hope to construct a map of the human genome using blocks of these SNP called linkage disequilibrium (LD). This map will be of significant help in medical genetics by allowing researchers to link a given condition to a given gene or set of genes using the LD as a marker. This will allow for improved diagnostic procedures. Lander and his colleagues are hoping the LD map will allow them to test the Common Disease-Common Variant hypothesis that states that many common diseases may be caused by a small number of common alleles. For example, 50% of the variance in susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease is explained by the common allele ApoE4. Lander's group has recently discovered an important association that accounts for a large proportion of the population's risk for adult-onset diabetes./nLander's most important work[35] may be his development of a molecular taxonomy for cancers.[36] The cancers are grouped according to gene expression and information such as their response to chemotherapy. The division of cancers into homogeneous subgroups will increase understanding of these cancers' molecular origins and help devise more effective therapies. Lander's group has also identified a new type of leukemia, MLL, and a gene that may serve as a target for a new drug./nFor several years, Lander has co-taught MIT's required undergraduate introductory biology course (7.012) with Robert Weinberg. Since 2013 he has also taught two online courses, \"Quantitative Biology Workshop\" and \"7.00x Introduction to Biology \u2013 The Secret of Life\" via the EdX platform by working with the MITx Bio group.[37]/nLander is a founding advisor of Foundation Medicine, a company that aims to bring comprehensive cancer genomic analysis to routine clinical care.[38] He is also a co-founder of Verastem, a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing drugs to treat cancer by targeting cancer stem cells.[39]/nIn 1989, Lander provided expert testimony in the New York criminal case People v. Castro. He showed that the then-current method of interpreting DNA evidence was liable to give false positive matches, implicating innocent defendants.[40][41][42] Two of the defense attorneys in that case, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, went on to found the Innocence Project, an organization that uses DNA analysis to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners. Lander is a member of the Innocence Project's board of directors.[43]/nIn January 2021, President-elect Joe Biden nominated Lander as Science Advisor to the President and announced that he would elevate the position to a Cabinet-level post.[6] In January 2021, 500 female scientists published an editorial in Scientific American to consider naming someone else to the position, because he was well known within the scientific community for offending women.[44]\nHis nomination had been held up possibly due to requests for clarification about his having attended two gatherings where Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy large-scale donor to science who was also a convicted sex offender, was present.[45] On April 29, a confirmation hearing was held in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.[46][47] On May 20, the committee voted to report favorably on the nomination, with five Republican senators voting against.[48] On May 28, 2021, before a Memorial Day recess, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote by the full Senate.

Enzo Martilnelli lived in Rome almost all of his life: the only exception was a period of nearly eight years, from 1947 to 1954, when he was in Genova, working at the local university.[4] In 1946 he married in Rome Luigia Panella, also her a mathematician, who later become an associate professor at the faculty of Engineering of the Sapienza University of Rome, and who was his loving companion for the rest of his life. They had a son, Roberto, and a daughter, Maria Renata, who later followed her parents footsteps becoming also her a mathematician:[5] four grandchildren completed their family.[6]/nIn 1933 he earned his laurea from the Sapienza University of Rome: the title of his thesis was \"Sulle funzioni poligene di una e di due variabili complesse\",[7] and his thesis supervisor was Francesco Severi.[8] From 1934 to 1946 he worked as an assistant professor first to the chair of mathematical analysis held by Francesco Severi and then to the chair of geometry held by Enrico Bompiani. In 1939 he became \"Libero Docente\" (free professor) of Mathematical analysis: he taught also courses on analytic geometry, algebraic geometry and topology as associate professor.[9] In 1946 he won a competitive examination by a judging commission for the chair of \"Geometria analitica con elementi di Geometria Proiettiva e Geometria Descrittiva con Disegno\",[10] awarded by the University of Genova: the second place and the third place went respectively to Giovanni Dantoni and Guido Zappa.[11] Martinelli held that chair from 1946 to 1954, teaching also mathematical analysis, function theory, differential geometry[6] and algebraic analysis[12] as  associate professor. In 1954 he went back in Rome to the chair of Geometry at the university, holding that chair up to his retirement, in 1982: he also taught courses on topology, higher mathematics, higher geometry upon charge. In the years 1968\u20131969, during a very difficult period for the Sapienza University of Rome,[13] he served the university as the director of the Guido Castelnuovo Institute of Mathematics./nHe attended various conferences and meetings. In 1943 and in 1946 he was invited in Zurich by Rudolf Fueter, in order to present his researches: later and during all his career he lectured in almost all Italian and foreign universities.[14]/nHe was also a member of the UMI Scientific Commission (from 1967 to 1972), of the editorial boards of the Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni (from 1955 to 1992) and of the Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata (from 1965 to 1999).[15]/nAccording to Rizza (2002, p.\u00a0165), Enzo's talent for mathematics was already evident when he was only a lyceum student. While still attending the university, he won the Cotronei Foundation prize, and after earning his laurea, the Beltrami Foundation prize, the Fubini and Torelli prizes,[1] and the Prize for Mathematical Sciences of the Ministry of National Education: this last one was awarded him in 1943, and the judging commission consisted of Francesco Severi (as the president of the commission), Ugo Amaldi[16] and Antonio Signorini (as the supervisor of the commission).[17]\nIn 1948 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Accademia Ligure di Scienze e Lettere:[18] in 1961 and in 1977 he was elected respectively Corresponding and Full Member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and from 1982 to 1985 he was \"Professore Linceo\".[19] Finally, in 1980 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino and then, in 1994, Full Member. Also, in 1986, the Sapienza University of Rome, to which Enzo Martinelli was particularly tied for all his life,[6] awarded him the title of professor emeritus./nHe is unanimously remembered as a real gentleman,[20] gifted by a caring attention, politeness, generosity and the rare ability to listen to colleagues and students alike:[21] Gallarati (2000, p.\u00a045) and Rizza (1984, p.\u00a06) remember long conversations with him on various mathematical research topics,[22] and his disposability to give help and advice to whoever asked for it. In particular Rizza (1984, p.\u00a07) recalls the time when he was his doctoral student at the University of Genova: they meet every Sunday in the afternoon at Martinelli's home, since Martinelli was not able to meet him during the week. During one of their meetings, lasting a little more than two hours, Martinelli taught him \u00c9lie Cartan's theory of exterior differential forms, and Rizza used successfully this tool in his first research works.[23] Another episode illustrating this aspect of Martinelli's personality is recalled by Gaetano Fichera.[24] When he was back in Rome in 1945, at the end of the Second World War, he exposed to Martinelli a theory identical to the theory of differential form: he developed it while being prisoner of the nazists in Teramo during wartime. Martinelli, very tactfully,[25] told him that the idea was already being developed by \u00c9lie Cartan and Georges de Rham./nAn excellent teacher himself, capable to arose curiosity and enthusiasm by his lessons,[21][26] he admired and respected much his own:[27] however, this was quite common for the Italian scientists of the same and the preceding generations, who were advised in the early days of their scientific career by some of the best Italian scientists ever.[28] His doctoral advisor was Francesco Severi: other great Italian mathematicians where among his teachers. Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques, Enrico Bompiani, Tullio Levi-Civita Mauro Picone and Antonio Signorini were all working at the Sapienza University of Rome when Enzo Martinelli was a student there, following their lessons: Zappa (1984) describes the activity of the institute of mathematics during that period as extremely stimulating.[29]/nAnother central aspect of his personality was a deep sense of justice and legality:[6] Martinelli was very careful in performing his citizen and university professor duties, and he was also ready to fight for his own rights and for the needs of higher education. Concerned by the growing interference of bureaucracy in university education, already in the 1950s he was heard by Rizza (1984, p.\u00a06) complaining that: \"In Italia mancano le menti semplificatrici\".[30] Martinelli was also free from every kind of authoritarianism to the point that when, during the protests of 1968 in Italy, many newspapers accused the Italian university scientific community of being so, all the assistant professors and students of Martinelli (and perhaps Martinelli himself) were perplexed.[31] In the same period, while performing his duties as the director of the Guido Castelnuovo Institute of Mathematics at the Sapienza university of Rome, his rare intellectual honesty[32] and rigorous rationality, according to Rizza, caused him troubles when dealing with many who \"believed in everything except the cold light of reason\".[33]/nFin troppo meticoloso, scriveva pi\u00f9 volte ogni suo lavoro, curandone fin nei minimi particolari sostanza e forma, fino a renderli di piacevole lettura. \u00c8 difficile trovare nei suoi scritti un concetto che possa essere espresso in modo migliore.[34]/nHe is the author of more than 50 research works, the first of which was published when Martinelli still was an undergraduate student:[35] precisely, his research production consist of 47 papers and 30 between treatises, textbooks and various other publications.[36] According to Rizza (1984, p.\u00a02), his research personality can be described by two words: \"enthusiasm\" and \"dissatisfaction\":[37] enthusiasm is meant as his steady interest in mathematics at all levels, while dissatisfaction is meant as the desire to going deeper into all mathematical problems investigated, without stopping at first success and expressing all the results in a simple, elegant and essential form./nThe aspects of his personality described before and his deep professional commitment also made him a great teacher:[38] at least fifteen textbooks on geometry, topology, complex analysis[36] testify his didactic activity.[31] Those books appear as models of clarity and mathematical rigour,[39] and also offer insights on more complex theories and problems to the clever student: indeed, it was one of Martinelli's concerns to teach mathematics showing its lively development and its attractiveness in term of interesting difficult problems offered, in order that no gifted student would abandon the idea to do mathematical research.[31]", "69717903": "V\u00e9ronique Gayrard is a French mathematician specializing in probability and statistical physics, with research topics including Hopfield networks, the long-term behavior of the random energy model and similar glassy systems, and metastability in reversible diffusion.

Shortly thereafter, the young man set out to convince government officials and private donors to build an astronomical observatory in Brussels; he succeeded in 1828.\nHe became a member of the Royal Academy in 1820. He lectured at the museum for sciences and letters and at the Belgian Military School. In 1825, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, in 1827 he became a member. In 1839, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.[8] From 1841 to 1851, he was a supernumerary associate in the institute, and when it became Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences he became foreign member.[9] In 1850, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nQuetelet also founded several statistical journals and societies, and was especially interested in creating international cooperation among statisticians. He encouraged the creation of a statistical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA), which later became the Royal Statistical Society, of which he became the first overseas member. In 1853 he chaired both the International Maritime Conference and the First International Statistical Congress. He was a founding member of the first Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des douze./nIn 1855, Quetelet developed apoplexy, which diminished but did not end his scientific activity.[citation needed]/nHe died in Brussels on 17 February 1874, and is buried in the Brussels Cemetery./nIn 1825, he married C\u00e9cile-Virginie Curtet.[10]/nHis scientific research encompassed a wide range of different scientific disciplines: meteorology, astronomy, mathematics, statistics, demography, sociology, criminology and history of science.  He made significant contributions to scientific development, but he also wrote several monographs directed to the general public. He founded the Royal Observatory of Belgium, founded or co-founded several national and international statistical societies and scientific journals, and presided over the first series of the International Statistical Congresses.  Quetelet was a liberal and an anticlerical, but not an atheist or materialist nor a socialist./nThe new science of probability and statistics was mainly used in astronomy at the time, where it was essential to account for measurement errors around means. This was done using the method of least squares. Quetelet was among the first to apply statistics to social science, planning what he called \"social physics\". He was keenly aware of the overwhelming complexity of social phenomena, and the many variables that needed measurement. His goal was to understand the statistical laws underlying such phenomena as crime rates, marriage rates or suicide rates. He wanted to explain the values of these variables by other social factors. These ideas were rather controversial among other scientists at the time who held that it contradicted the concept of freedom of choice./nHis most influential book was Sur l'homme et le d\u00e9veloppement de ses facult\u00e9s, ou Essai de physique sociale, published in 1835 (In English translation, it is titled Treatise on Man, but a literal translation would be \"On Man and the Development of his Faculties, or Essay on Social Physics\"). In it, he outlines the project of a social physics and describes his concept of the \"average man\" (l'homme moyen) who is characterized by the mean values of measured variables that follow a normal distribution. He collected data about many such variables. Quetelet wrote about these values as \"ideals\" with deviations from them as being less than or more than ideal. He saw the average body as an ideal beauty and something to be desired and his work was influential on Francis Galton who coined the term eugenics.[5][6][7]/nQuetelet's student Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst developed the logistic function in the 1830s as a model of population growth; see Logistic function \u00a7\u00a0History for details.[11]/nWhen Auguste Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term 'social physics', which Comte had originally introduced, Comte found it necessary to invent the term 'sociologie' (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet's notion that a theory of society could be derived from a collection of statistics./nAdolphe Quetelet also had a significant influence on Florence Nightingale who shared with him a religious view of statistics which saw understanding statistics as revealing the work of God in addition to statistics being a force of good administration. Nightingale met Quetelet in person at the 1860 International Statistical Congress in London, and they corresponded for years afterwards.[12]/nQuetelet was an influential figure in criminology.  Along with Andre-Michel Guerry, he helped to establish the cartographic school and positivist schools of criminology which made extensive use of statistical techniques.  Through statistical analysis, Quetelet gained insight into the relationships between crime and other social factors.  Among his findings were strong relationships between age and crime, as well as gender and crime.  Other influential factors he found included climate, poverty, education, and alcohol consumption, with his research findings published in Of the Development of the Propensity to Crime.[13]/nIn his 1835 text on social physics, he presented his theory of human variance around the average, showing human traits were distributed according to a normal curve. The existence of such variation provided the basis for later writers, including Darwin, to argue that natural populations contained sufficient variability for artificial or natural selection to operate.[14]/nIn terms of influence over later public health agendas, one of Quetelet's lasting legacies was the establishment of a simple measure for classifying people's weight relative to an ideal for their height. His proposal, the body mass index (or Quetelet index), has endured with minor variations to the present day.[15] Anthropometric data is used in modern applications and referenced in the development of every consumer-based product./nQuetelet was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1839.[1]/nThe asteroid 1239 Queteleta is named after him. The title of Quetelet professor at Columbia University is awarded in his name.", "2969494": "Joseph Henry Maclagan Wedderburn FRSE FRS (2 February 1882 \u2013 9 October 1948) was a Scottish mathematician, who taught at Princeton University for most of his career. A significant algebraist, he proved that a finite division algebra is a field, and part of the Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem on simple algebras. He also worked on group theory and matrix algebra.[2][3]/nHis younger brother was the lawyer Ernest Wedderburn./nJoseph Wedderburn was the tenth of fourteen children of Alexander Wedderburn of Pearsie, a physician, and Anne Ogilvie. He was educated at Forfar Academy then in 1895 his parents sent Joseph and his younger brother Ernest to live in Edinburgh with their paternal uncle, J R Maclagan Wedderburn, allowing them to attend George Watson's College. This house was at 3 Glencairn Crescent in the West End of the city.[4]/nIn 1898 Joseph entered the University of Edinburgh. In 1903, he published his first three papers, worked as an assistant in the Physical Laboratory of the University, obtained an MA degree with First Class Honours in mathematics, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, upon the proposal of George Chrystal, James Gordon MacGregor, Cargill Gilston Knott and William Peddie. Aged only 21 he remains one of the youngest Fellows ever.[5]/nHe then studied briefly at the University of Leipzig and the University of Berlin, where he met the algebraists Frobenius and Schur. A Carnegie Scholarship allowed him to spend the 1904\u20131905 academic year at the University of Chicago where he worked with Oswald Veblen, E. H. Moore, and most importantly, Leonard Dickson, who was to become the most important American algebraist of his day./nReturning to Scotland in 1905, Wedderburn worked for four years at the University of Edinburgh as an assistant to George Chrystal, who supervised his D.Sc, awarded in 1908 for a thesis titled On Hypercomplex Numbers. He gained a PhD in algebra from the University of Edinburgh in 1908.[6] From 1906 to 1908, Wedderburn edited the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society. In 1909, he returned to the United States to become a Preceptor in Mathematics at Princeton University; his colleagues included Luther P. Eisenhart, Oswald Veblen, Gilbert Ames Bliss, and George Birkhoff./nUpon the outbreak of the First World War, Wedderburn enlisted in the British Army as a private. He was the first person at Princeton to volunteer for that war, and had the longest war service of anyone on the staff. He served with the Seaforth Highlanders in France, as Lieutenant (1914), then as Captain of the 10th Battalion (1915\u201318). While a Captain in the Fourth Field Survey Battalion of the Royal Engineers in France, he devised sound-ranging equipment to locate enemy artillery./nHe returned to Princeton after the war, becoming Associate Professor in 1921 and editing the Annals of Mathematics until 1928.  While at Princeton, he supervised only three PhDs, one of them being Nathan Jacobson. In his later years, Wedderburn became an increasingly solitary figure and may even have suffered from depression. His isolation after his 1945 early retirement was such that his death from a heart attack was not noticed for several days. His Nachlass was destroyed, as per his instructions./nWedderburn received the MacDougall-Brisbane Gold Medal and Prize from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1921, and was elected to the Royal Society of London in 1933.[1]/nIn all, Wedderburn published about 40 books and papers, making important advances in the theory of rings, algebras and matrix theory./nIn 1905, Wedderburn published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that a noncommutative finite division ring could not exist. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the additive group of a finite division algebra A, and the multiplicative group A* = A-{0}. Parshall (1983) notes that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Meanwhile, Wedderburn's Chicago colleague Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. Parshall concludes that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof./nThis theorem yields insights into the  structure of finite projective geometries. In their paper on \"Non-Desarguesian and non-Pascalian geometries\" in the 1907 Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Wedderburn and Veblen showed that in these geometries, Pascal's theorem is a consequence of Desargues' theorem. They also constructed finite projective geometries which are neither \"Desarguesian\" nor \"Pascalian\" (the terminology is Hilbert's)./nWedderburn's best-known paper was his sole-authored \"On hypercomplex numbers,\" published in the 1907 Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, and for which he was awarded the D.Sc. the following year. This paper gives a complete classification of simple and semisimple algebras. He then showed that every finite-dimensional semisimple algebra can be constructed as a direct sum of simple algebras and that every simple algebra is isomorphic to a matrix algebra for some division ring. The Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem generalises these results to algebras with the descending chain condition./nHis best known book is his Lectures on Matrices (1934),[7] which Jacobson praised as follows:/nThat this was the result of a number of years of painstaking labour is evidenced by the bibliography of 661 items (in the revised printing) covering the period 1853 to 1936. The work is, however, not a compilation of the literature, but a synthesis that is Wedderburn's own. It contains a number of original contributions to the subject./nAbout Wedderburn's teaching:/nHe was apparently a very shy man and much preferred looking at the blackboard to looking at the students. He had the galley proofs from his book \"Lectures on Matrices\" pasted to cardboard for durability, and his \"lecturing\" consisted of reading this out loud while simultaneously copying it onto the blackboard.", "282522": "Nicholas of Cusa (1401 \u2013 11 August 1464), also referred to as Nicholas of Kues and Nicolaus Cusanus (/kju\u02d0\u02c8se\u026an\u0259s/), was a German Catholic cardinal and polymath active as a philosopher, theologian, jurist, mathematician and astronomer. One of the first German proponents of Renaissance humanism, he made spiritual and political contributions in European history. A notable example of this is his mystical or spiritual writings on \"learned ignorance,\" as well as his participation in power struggles between Rome and the German states of the Holy Roman Empire./nAs papal legate to Germany from 1446, he was appointed cardinal for his merits by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 and Prince\u2013Bishop of Brixen two years later. In 1459, he became vicar general in the Papal States./nNicholas has remained an influential figure. In 2001, the sixth centennial of his birth was celebrated on four continents and commemorated by publications on his life and work.[4]/nNicholas was born in Kues (Latinized as \"Cusa\") in southwestern Germany. He was the second of four children of Johan Krebs (or Cryfftz) and Katherina Roemer. His father was \"a prosperous boat owner and ferryman.\"[5] Nicholas entered the Faculty of Arts of the Heidelberg University in 1416 as \"a cleric of the Diocese of Trier,\" studying the liberal arts. He seemed to have left Heidelberg soon afterwards, as he received his doctorate in canon law from the University of Padua in 1423. In Padua, he met with the later cardinals Julian Cesarini and Domenico Capranica and became friends with the mathematician Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. Afterwards, he entered the University of Cologne in 1425 as \"a doctor of canon law,\" which he appears to have both taught and practiced there. In Cologne, he made friends with the scholastic theologian Heymeric de Campo./nFollowing a brief period in Cologne, Nicholas returned to his hometown and became secretary to Otto of Ziegenhain, the Prince\u2013Archbishop of Trier. Otto appointed him canon and dean at the stift of Saint Florinus in Koblenz affiliated with numerous prebends. In 1427 he was sent to Rome as an episcopal delegate. The next year he travelled to Paris to study the writings of Ramon Llull. At the same time he rejected a calling by the newly established University of Leuven. He acquired great knowledge in the research of ancient and medieval manuscripts as well as in textual criticism and the examination of primary sources. In 1433 he identified the Donation of Constantine as a fake, confirmed by Lorenzo Valla a few years later, and revealed the forgery of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals. He made friends with the Austrian astronomer Georg von Peuerbach and advocated a reform of the Julian calendar and the Easter computus, which, however, was not realized until the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582./nAfter the Archbishop Otto of Trier had died in 1430, Pope Martin V appointed the Speyer bishop Raban of Helmstatt his successor. Nevertheless, the Electorate was contested by opposing parties, and in 1432 Nicholas attended the Council of Basel representing the Cologne dean Ulrich von Manderscheid, one of the claimants,[6] who hoped to prevail against the new Pope Eugene IV. Nicholas stressed the determining influence of the cathedral chapter and its given right to participate in the succession policy, which even places the pope under an obligation to seek a consent. His efforts were to no avail in regard to Ulrich's ambitions; however, Nicholas's pleadings earned him a great reputation as an intermediary and diplomat. While present at the council, he wrote his first work, De concordantia catholica (The Catholic Concordance), a synthesis of ideas on church and empire balancing hierarchy with consent. This work remained useful to critics of the papacy long after Nicholas left Basel.[7]/nInitially as conciliarist, Nicholas approached his university friend Cardinal Julian Cesarini, who had tried to reconcile pope and council, combining reform and hierarchic order. Nicholas supported transfer of the council to Italy to meet with the Greeks, who needed aid against the Ottoman Turks. He arbitrated in the conflict with the Hussites. Between the summer of 1437 and early 1438 he was a member of the delegation sent to Constantinople with the pope's approval to bring back the Byzantine emperor and his representatives to the papally summoned Council of Florence of 1439, which was attempting to bring the Eastern Orthodox Church into union with the Western Catholic Church. The reunion achieved at this conference turned out to be very brief. Nicholas would later claim (in the postfaced dedicatory letter of On Learned Ignorance, which Nicholas finished writing on 12 February 1440) that he had chosen to write on this metaphysical topic because of a shipboard experience of divine illumination while on the ship returning from this mission to Constantinople./nAfter a successful career as a papal envoy, he was made a cardinal by Pope Nicholas V in 1448 or 1449. In 1450 he was both named Bishop of Brixen, in Tyrol, and commissioned as a papal legate to the German lands to spread the message of reform. In 1444, the White Tower of Brixen caught fire and in 1459 he commissioned its reconstruction in a Gothic style. This latter role, his 'Great Legation' of 1450\u20131452, involved travel of almost 3000 miles, preaching, teaching and reforming. He became known as the \"Hercules of the Eugenian cause.\"[8] His local councils enacted reforms, many of which were not successful. Pope Nicholas canceled some of Nicholas's decrees, and the effort to discourage pilgrimages to venerate the bleeding hosts of Wilsnack (the so-called Holy Blood of Wilsnack) was unsuccessful. His work as bishop between 1452 and 1458 \u2013 trying to impose reforms and reclaim lost diocesan revenues \u2013 was opposed by Duke Sigismund of Austria. The duke imprisoned Nicholas in 1460, for which Pope Pius II excommunicated Sigismund and laid an interdict on his lands. Nicholas returned to Rome, but was never able to return to his bishopric./nHe died at Todi in Umbria on 11 August 1464. Sigismund's capitulation came a few days after Nicholas's death.[9]/nUpon his death, Nicholas's body was interred in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, probably near the relic of Peter's chains; but it was later lost. His monument, with a sculpted image of the cardinal, remains. Two other tombstones, one medieval and one modern, also are found in the church. In accordance with his wishes, his heart rests within the chapel altar at the Cusanusstift in Kues. To this charitable institution that he had founded he bequeathed his entire inheritance; it still stands, and serves the purpose Nicholas intended for it, as a home for the aged. The Cusanusstift also houses many of his manuscripts.[1]/nNicholas's De Docta Ignorantia ('Of Learned Ignorance') is an epistemological and metaphysical treatise.  He maintains the finite human mind cannot fully know the divine, infinite mind ('the Maximum'). Nonetheless, he holds that the human intellect can become aware of its limitations in knowing God and thus attain \"learned ignorance\".  His theory shows the influence of neoplatonism and negative theology, and he frequently cites Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite./nNicholas was noted for his deeply mystical writings about Christianity. He wrote of the enfolding of creation in God and their unfolding in creation. He was suspected by some of holding pantheistic beliefs, but his writings were never accused of being heretical.[10] Nicholas also wrote in De coniecturis about using conjectures or surmises to rise to better understanding of the truth. The individual might rise above mere reason to the vision of the intellect, but the same person might fall back from such vision./nTheologically, Nicholas anticipated the implications of Reformed teaching on the harrowing of Hell (Sermon on Psalm 30:11), followed by Pico della Mirandola, who similarly explained the descensus in terms of Christ's agony./nMost of Nicholas's mathematical ideas can be found in his essays, De Docta Ignorantia (Of Learned Ignorance), De Visione Dei (On the Vision of God) and On Conjectures. He also wrote on squaring the circle in his mathematical treatises./nMathematics plays a key role for Cusanus in orienting the human mind towards God. Mathematical figures provide a means for the mind to consider how figures may be deformed and transformed,  and thus prepares the mind to reach the \"coincidence of opposites\" in the \"Absolutely maximal Being\"./nFrom the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913 edition):/nThe astronomical views of the cardinal are scattered through his philosophical treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the universe, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had Copernicus been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work.[11]/nLike Nicole Oresme, Nicholas also wrote about the possibility of the plurality of worlds.[12][13]/nNorman Moore tells us in The Fitz-Patrick Lectures of 1905:/nIn medicine he introduced an improvement which in an altered form has continued in use to this day. This improvement was the counting of the pulse which up to his time had been felt and discussed in many ways but never counted. ...Nicholas of Cusa proposed to compare the rate of pulses by weighing the quantity of water run out of a water clock while the pulse beat one hundred times. ...The manufacture of watches with second-hands has since given us a simpler method of counting, but the merit of introducing this useful kind of observation into clinical medicine belongs to Nicholas of Cusa.[14]/nIn 1433, Nicholas proposed reform of the Holy Roman Empire and a method to elect Holy Roman Emperors. Although it was not adopted by the Church, his method was essentially the same one known today as the Borda count, which is used in many academic institutions, competitions, and even some political jurisdictions, in original form and a number of variations. His proposal preceded Borda's work by over three centuries.[15][16]/nNicholas's opinions on the Empire, which he hoped to reform and strengthen, were cited against papal claims of temporal power in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Protestant writers were happy to cite a cardinal against Rome's pretensions. Protestants, however, found his writings against the Hussites wrong. Nicholas seemed to Protestants to give the church too much power to interpret Scripture, instead of treating it as self-interpreting and self-sufficient for salvation, the principle of sola scriptura.[17]/nNicholas's own thought on the church changed with his departure from Basel. He tried arguing that the Basel assembly lacked the consent of the church throughout the world, especially the princes. Then he tried arguing that the church was unfolded from Peter (explicatio Petri).[18] This allowed him to support the pope without abandoning ideas of reform. Thus, he was able to propose to Pius II reform of the church, beginning with the pope himself. Then it was to spread through the Roman curia and outward throughout Christendom.[19]/nNicholas noted that government was founded on the consent of the governed:/nShortly after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Nicholas wrote De pace fidei, On the Peace of Faith. This visionary work imagined a summit meeting in Heaven of representatives of all nations and religions. Islam and the Hussite movement in Bohemia are represented. The conference agrees that there can be una religio in varietate rituum, a single faith manifested in different rites, as manifested in the eastern and western rites of the Catholic Church. The dialog presupposes the greater accuracy of Christianity but gives respect to other religions.[22] Nicholas's position was for Europeans not to retake Constantinople but simply to trade with the Ottomans and allow them their conquests. Less irenic but not virulent, is his Cribratio Alchorani, Sifting the Koran, a detailed review of the Koran in Latin translation. While the arguments for the superiority of Christianity are still shown in this book, it also credits Judaism and Islam with sharing in the truth at least partially.[23]/nNicholas was widely read, and his works were published in the sixteenth century in both Paris and Basel. Sixteenth-century French scholars, including Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples and Charles de Bovelles, cited him. Lef\u00e8vre even edited the Paris 1514 Opera.[24] Nonetheless, there was no Cusan school, and his works were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, though Giordano Bruno quoted him, while some thinkers, like Gottfried Leibniz, were thought to have been influenced by him.[25] Neo-Kantian scholars began studying Nicholas in the nineteenth century, and new editions were begun by the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften in the 1930s and published by Felix Meiner Verlag.[26] In the early twentieth century, he was hailed by Ernst Cassirer as the \"first modern thinker,\"[27] and much debate since then has centered around the question whether he should be seen as essentially a medieval or Renaissance figure. What is more, Cassirer presented Cusanus as the main focal point (einfachen Brennpunkt) of Italian Renaissance philosophy. Eminent scholars like Eugenio Garin and Paul Oskar Kristeller challenged Cassirer\u2019s thesis, and went so far as to practically deny any considerable link between Nicholas of Cusa and Marsilio Ficino or Giovanni Pico.[28] In the following decades, new hypotheses on the relationship between Cusanus and Italian humanists appeared, more balanced and focused on the sources.[29]/nSocieties and centers dedicated to Nicholas can be found in Argentina, Japan, Germany, Italy and the United States. His well-known quote about the infinity of the universe is found paraphrased in the Central Holy Book of the Thelemites, The Book of the Law, which was \"received\" from the Angel Aiwass by Aleister Crowley in Cairo in April 1904: \"In the sphere I am everywhere the centre, as she, the circumference, is nowhere found.\"/nNicholas wrote a large number of works, which include:", "48648091": "Michel Ledoux (born 1958) is a French mathematician, specializing in probability theory.

He taught in various faculties (among them Rennes and Lyon) until 1943. Under the impact of the Second World War and the rapid French defeat in 1940, L\u00e9gaut acknowledged the lack of certain fundamental aspects in his life as well as in the lives of other university professors and civil servants. That is why he tried to alternate teaching with farm work. After three years his project was no longer accepted and he left the University to live as a shepherd in the Pr\u00e9-Alpes (Haut-Diois). L\u00e9gaut had married in 1940, and between 1945 and 1953 he became the father of six children./nTwenty years after this renunciation of his social status (and the consequent rooting in common life), L\u00e9gaut, almost sixty years old, started a deep and personal reflection around man's condition and existence, which was captured in the two volumes of his main work: Human Accomplishment./nMonsieur Portal, his mentor during his youth, had helped him discover that honesty and intellectual independence are essential to a vigorous, spiritual life. This wasn't usual in the Catholic education of the time, where obedience and adherence to the prevailing doctrine took priority. M. Portal had learned something from the modernist crisis period./nEncouraged in this secular direction by M. Portal, L\u00e9gaut ruled out the usual lifestyle in the Catholic system of the time (priesthood and religious life), and instead thoroughly followed the scientific path. As a result of these youthful decisions, but also by the way he lived the full engagement, L\u00e9gaut became a leader of the Catholic students in the Normale \u00c9coles during the interwar period up to the French defeat. He overcame the temptation of absolutizing his function as celibate leader in the group, and therefore L\u00e9gaut didn't consider himself as a philosopher, or a theologian of formation or occupation. His only degree was his tenacity and freedom of thought (other names for his responsibility). Writing as an older man, L\u00e9gaut recovered his dream as a youth: to express spiritual life just as it is, in a sincere and honest way, avoiding utopian speculation./nL\u00e9gaut died in Avignon./nMarcel L\u00e9gaut is the author of twenty books, sixteen of which have been published from 1970./nHis main work, published in two volumes in 1970 and 1971, is L\u2019accomplissement humain (Human Accomplishment).

Meditation, testimony and prayer are, in every human being, the three categories corresponding to the different destinataries of intimate \"conversation\", which is, in short, the sort of communication that every spiritual life aims to achieve according to its deep instinct./nL\u00e9gaut's books are written with an authority or value that doesn't come from an institutional command nor from a social reliability (command or reliability that would justify its separation from the rest and its leaning on a platform, either academic or other). Its truth comes from the full engagement of living and thinking deeply and freely, without calculation nor self-defence, immersed in \"the very living waters of life\" (Antonio Machado loved this expression by Teresa de \u00c1vila)./nIn L\u2019accomplissement humain, L\u00e9gaut reconsiders his itinerary, and that of his companions, during a century full of great upheavals and mutations, without forgetting to examine the failure of the churches, their current crisis, and thinking how they could truly come out of this decline. His response suggests \u00abtaking everything up again from the basis\u00bb through a conversion with the essential teachings of Jesus, and facing up without fear, that is to say, with faith, to mutation.\nIn order to take everything up from its origin, his thoughts were centered, in Vol I, around subjects as faith in oneself, married and paternal faith, and faith in the other and in front of reality, including one's death and that of people who are close.

Frank Baum, and G.\u00a0K. Chesterton.[4][5] He was also a leading authority on Lewis Carroll.[6] The Annotated Alice, which incorporated the text of Carroll's two Alice books, was his most successful work and sold over a million copies.[7] He had a lifelong interest in magic and illusion and in 1999, MAGIC magazine named him as one of the \"100 Most Influential Magicians of the Twentieth Century\".[8] He was considered the doyen of American puzzlers.[9] He was a prolific and versatile author, publishing more than 100 books.[10][11]/nGardner was best known for creating and sustaining interest in recreational mathematics\u2014and by extension, mathematics in general\u2014throughout the latter half of the 20th century, principally through his \"Mathematical Games\" columns.[12][13] These appeared for twenty-five years in Scientific American, and his subsequent books collecting them.[14][15]/nGardner was one of the foremost anti-pseudoscience polemicists of the 20th century.[16] His 1957 book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science[17] is a seminal work of the skeptical movement.[18] In 1976, he joined with fellow skeptics to found CSICOP, an organization promoting scientific inquiry and the use of reason in examining extraordinary claims.[19]/nHe was a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books.[20]/nMartin Gardner was born into a prosperous family in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to James Henry Gardner, a prominent petroleum geologist,[21] and his wife, Willie Wilkerson Spiers, a Montessori-trained teacher.  His mother taught Martin to read before he started school, reading him The Wizard of Oz, and this began a lifelong interest in the Oz books of L. Frank Baum.[22][23]  His fascination with mathematics started in his boyhood when his father gave him a copy of Sam Loyd's Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles, Tricks and Conundrums.[24][25]/nHe attended the University of Chicago where he studied history, literature and sciences under their intellectually-stimulating Great Books curriculum and earned his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1936.[7] Early jobs included reporter on the Tulsa Tribune, writer at the University of Chicago Office of Press Relations, and case worker in Chicago's Black Belt for the city's Relief Administration. During World War II, he served for four years in the U.S. Navy as a yeoman on board the destroyer escort USS Pope in the Atlantic. His ship was still in the Atlantic when the war came to an end with the surrender of Japan in August 1945./nAfter the war, Gardner returned to the University of Chicago.[26] He attended graduate school for a year there, but he did not earn an advanced degree.[1]/nIn the late 1940s, Gardner moved to New York City and became a writer and editor at Humpty Dumpty magazine, where for eight years, he wrote features and stories for it and several other children's magazines.[27] His paper-folding puzzles at that magazine led to his first work at Scientific American.[28] For many decades, Gardner, his wife Charlotte, and their two sons, Jim and Tom, lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he earned his living as a freelance author, publishing books with several different publishers, and also publishing hundreds of magazine and newspaper articles.[29]/nIn 1950, he wrote an article in the Antioch Review entitled \"The Hermit Scientist\".[30]  It was one of Gardner's earliest articles about junk science, and in 1952 a much-expanded version became his first published book: In the Name of Science: An Entertaining Survey of the High Priests and Cultists of Science, Past and Present. The year 1960 saw the original edition of the best-selling book of his career, The Annotated Alice.[31]/nI just play all the time and am fortunate enough to get paid for it./n\u2013 Martin Gardner, 1998/nFor over a quarter century Gardner wrote a monthly column on the subject of recreational mathematics for Scientific American. It all began with his free-standing article on hexaflexagons which ran in the December 1956 issue.[32][33] Flexagons became a bit of a fad and soon people all over New York City were making them. Gerry Piel, the SA publisher at the time, asked Gardner, \"Is there enough similar material to this to make a regular feature?\" Gardner said he thought so. The January 1957 issue contained his first column, entitled \"Mathematical Games\".[29] Almost 300 more columns were to follow.[1]/nThe \"Mathematical Games\" column became the most popular feature of the magazine and was the first thing that many readers turned to.[34] In September 1977 Scientific American acknowledged the prestige and popularity of Gardner's column by moving it from the back to the very front of the magazine.[35] It ran from 1956 to 1981 with sporadic columns afterwards and was the first introduction of many subjects to a wider audience, notably:[36]/nIronically, Gardner had problems learning calculus and never took a mathematics course after high school. While editing Humpty Dumpty's Magazine he constructed many paper folding puzzles. At a magic show in 1956 fellow magician Royal Vale Heath introduced Gardner to the intricately folded paper shapes known as flexagons and steered him to the four Princeton University professors who had invented and investigated their mathematical properties.   The subsequent article Gardner wrote on hexaflexagons led directly to the column.[29]/nGardner's son Jim once asked him what was his favorite puzzle, and Gardner answered almost immediately: \"The monkey and the coconuts\".[37] It had been the subject of his April 1958  Games column and in 2001 he chose to make it the first chapter of his \"best of\" collection, The Colossal Book of Mathematics.[38]/nIn the 1980s \"Mathematical Games\" began to appear only irregularly. Other authors began to share the column, and the June 1986 issue saw the final installment under that title. In 1981, on Gardner's retirement from Scientific American, the column was replaced by Douglas Hofstadter's \"Metamagical Themas\", a name that is an anagram of \"Mathematical Games\"./nVirtually all of the games columns were collected in book form starting in 1959 with The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles & Diversions.[39] Over the next four decades fourteen more books followed.[23] Donald Knuth called them the canonical books.[40][41]/nIn 1979, Gardner left Scientific American. He and his wife Charlotte moved to Hendersonville, North Carolina. He continued to write math articles, sending them to The Mathematical Intelligencer, Math Horizons, The College Mathematics Journal, and Scientific American. He also revised some of his older books such as Origami, Eleusis, and the Soma Cube.[42] Charlotte died in 2000 and in 2004 Gardner returned to Oklahoma,[43] where his son, James Gardner, was a professor of education at the University of Oklahoma[1] in Norman. He died there on May 22, 2010.[4] An autobiography\u00a0\u2013 Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner\u00a0\u2013 was published posthumously.[29]/nHis depth and clarity will illuminate our world for a long time.[44]/n\u2013Persi Diaconis/nMartin Gardner had a major impact on mathematics in the second half of the 20th century.[45][46] His column ran for 25 years and was read avidly by the generation of mathematicians and physicists who grew up in the years 1956 to 1981.[47][48] His writing inspired, directly or indirectly, many who would go on to careers in mathematics, science, and other related endeavors.[49][50][51][52][53][54]/nGardner's admirers included such diverse individuals as W. H. Auden,  Arthur C. Clarke, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and the entire French literary group known as the Oulipo.[55][56][33][57] Salvador Dal\u00ed once sought him out to discuss four-dimensional hypercubes.[58] David Auerbach wrote: \"A case can be made, in purely practical terms, for Martin Gardner as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. His popularizations of science and mathematical games in Scientific American, over the 25 years he wrote for them, might have helped create more young mathematicians and computer scientists than any other single factor prior to the advent of the personal computer.\"[59] Colm Mulcahy described him as \"without doubt the best friend mathematics ever had.\"[60]/nGardner's column has been credited with introducing the public to works and problems that have become mainstays of popular mathematics including the secretary problem, Conway's Game of Life, the Mandelbrot set, Penrose tiles, public-key cryptosystems, and books such as A K Dewdney\u2019s Planiverse and Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach.[61][62][63] Gardner was instrumental in spreading the awareness and understanding of M. C. Escher\u2019s work. Gardner wrote to Escher in 1961 to ask permission to use his Horseman tessellation in an upcoming column about H.S.M. Coxeter. Escher replied, saying that he knew Gardner as author of The Annotated Alice, which had been sent to Escher by Coxeter. The correspondence led to Gardner introducing the previously unknown Escher's art to the world.[60]/nHis writing was credited as both broad and deep.[64][65][66] Noam Chomsky once wrote, \"Martin Gardner's contribution to contemporary intellectual culture is unique\u00a0\u2013 in its range, its insight, and understanding of hard questions that matter.\"[56][67] Gardner repeatedly alerted the public (and other mathematicians) to recent discoveries in mathematics\u2013recreational and otherwise. In addition to introducing many first-rate puzzles and topics such as Penrose tiles[68] and Conway's Game of Life,[69] he was equally adept at writing columns about traditional mathematical topics such as knot theory, Fibonacci numbers, Pascal's triangle, the M\u00f6bius strip, transfinite numbers, four-dimensional space, Zeno's paradoxes, Fermat's Last Theorem, and the four-color problem.[59][70]/nGardner set a new high standard for writing about mathematics.[71][72][73][74][75] In a 2004 interview he said, \"I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don't understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying. If you are writing popularly about math, I think it's good not to know too much math.\"[1] John Horton Conway called him \"the most learned man I have ever met.\"[55]/nHe had carried on incredibly interesting exchanges with hundreds of mathematicians, as well as with artists and polymaths such as Maurits Escher and Piet Hein.[1]/n\u2013 AMS Notices/nGardner maintained an extensive network of experts and amateurs with whom he regularly exchanged information and ideas.[76] Doris Schattschneider would later term this circle of collaborators \"Gardner's mathematical grapevine\" or \"MG2\".[77][78]/nGardner's role as a hub of this network helped facilitate several introductions that led to further fruitful collaborations.[79] Mathematicians Conway, Berlekamp, and Guy, who met as a result of Gardner's influence, would go on to write Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays, a foundational book in combinatorial game theory that Gardner championed.[80] Gardner also introduced Conway to Benoit Mandelbrot because he knew of their mutual interest in Penrose tiles.[32][81] Gardner's network was also responsible for introducing Doris Schattschneider and Marjorie Rice, who worked together to document the newly discovered pentagon tilings.[76][82]/nGardner credited his network with generating further material for his columns: \"When I first started the column, I was not in touch with any mathematicians, and gradually mathematicians who were creative in the field found out about the column and began corresponding with me. So my most interesting columns were columns based on the material I got from them, so I owe them a big debt of gratitude.\"[77]/nGardner prepared each of his columns in a painstaking and scholarly fashion and conducted copious correspondence to be sure that everything was fact-checked for mathematical accuracy.[83] Communication was often by postcard or telephone and Gardner kept meticulous notes of everything, typically on index cards.[84] Archives of some of his correspondence stored at Stanford University occupy some 63 linear feet of shelf space.[85] This correspondence led to columns about the rep-tiles and pentominos of Solomon W. Golomb; the space filling curves of Bill Gosper;[86] the aperiodic tiles of Roger Penrose; the Game of Life invented by John H. Conway; the superellipse and the Soma cube of Piet Hein; the trapdoor functions of Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle; the flexagons of Stone, Tuckerman, Feynman, and Tukey; the geometrical delights in a book by H. S. M. Coxeter; the game of Hex invented by Piet Hein and John Nash; Tutte's account of squaring the square; and many other topics./nThe wide array of mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, philosophers, magicians, artists, writers, and other influential thinkers who can be counted as part of Gardner's mathematical grapevine includes:[77][87][70][88][89][55][90][52][76]/nThese new ciphers are not absolutely unbreakable in the sense of the one-time pad. but in practice they are unbreakable in a much stronger sense than any cipher previously designed for widespread use. In principle these new ciphers can be broken. but only by computer programs that run for millions of years![91]/n\u2013Martin Gardner/nIn his August 1977 column, \"A new kind of cipher that would take millions of years to break\", Gardner described a new cryptographic system invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman.[92][93] The system, based on trapdoor functions, was known as RSA (after the three researchers) and has become a component of the majority of secure data transmission schemes.[87]  Since RSA is a relatively slow algorithm it is not widely used to directly encrypt data.[94]\u00a0More often, it is used to transmit shared keys for\u00a0symmetric-key\u00a0cryptography.[95]/nGardner identified the memorandum that his column was based on and invited readers to write to Rivest to request a copy of it.[91] Over seven thousand requests came pouring in, some of them from other countries.  This caused significant consternation in the US defense agencies and possible legal problems for Gardner himself.[96] The National Security Agency (NSA) asked the RSA team to stop distributing the report and one letter to the IEEE suggested that disseminating such information might be violating the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.[91]  In the end the defense establishment could provide no legal basis for suppressing the new technology, and when a detailed paper about RSA was published in Communications of the ACM,[97] the NSA\u2019s crypto monopoly was effectively terminated.[95]/nMartin Gardner is the single brightest beacon defending rationality and good science against the mysticism and anti-intellectualism that surround us.[42]/n\u2013 Stephen Jay Gould/nGardner was a critic of fringe science. His book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (1952, revised 1957) launched the modern skeptical movement.[26] It debunked dubious movements and theories[98] including Fletcherism, Lamarckism, food faddism, Dowsing Rods, Charles Fort, Rudolf Steiner, Dianetics, the  Bates method for improving eyesight, Einstein deniers, the Flat Earth theory, the lost continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision, the reincarnation of Bridey Murphy, Wilhelm Reich's orgone theory, the spontaneous generation of life, extra-sensory perception and psychokinesis, homeopathy, phrenology, palmistry, graphology, and numerology. This book and his subsequent efforts (Science: Good, Bad and Bogus, 1981; Order and Surprise, 1983, Gardner's Whys & Wherefores, 1989, etc.) provoked a lot of criticism from the advocates of alternative science and New Age philosophy.[99] He kept up running dialogues (both public and private) with many of them for decades.[26]/nIn a review of Science: Good, Bad and Bogus, Stephen Jay Gould called Gardner \"The Quack Detector\", a writer who \"expunge[d] nonsense\" and in so doing had \"become a priceless national resource.\"[100]/nIn 1976 Gardner joined with fellow skeptics philosopher Paul Kurtz, psychologist Ray Hyman, sociologist Marcello Truzzi, and stage magician James Randi to found the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now called the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry). Intellectuals including astronomer Carl Sagan, author and biochemist Isaac Asimov, psychologist B. F. Skinner, and journalist Philip J. Klass became fellows of the program. From 1983 to 2002 he wrote a monthly column called \"Notes of a Fringe Watcher\" (originally \"Notes of a Psi-Watcher\") for Skeptical Inquirer, that organization's monthly magazine.[101] These columns have been collected in five books starting with The New Age: Notes of a Fringe Watcher in 1988.[102]/nGardner was a critic of self-proclaimed Israeli psychic Uri Geller and wrote two satirical booklets about him in the 1970s using the pen name \"Uriah Fuller\" in which he explained how such purported psychics do their seemingly impossible feats such as mentally bending spoons and reading minds.[103]/nMartin Gardner continued to criticize junk science throughout his life. His targets included not just safe subjects like astrology and UFO sightings, but topics such as chiropractic, vegetarianism, Madame Blavatsky, creationism, Scientology, the Laffer curve, Christian Science, and the Hutchins-Adler Great Books Movement.[59] The last thing he wrote in the spring of 2010 (a month before his death) was an article excoriating the \"dubious medical opinions and bogus science\" of Oprah Winfrey\u00a0\u2013 particularly her support for the thoroughly discredited theory that vaccinations cause autism; it went on to bemoan the \"needless deaths of children\" that such notions are likely to cause.[104]/nSkeptical Inquirer named him one of the Ten Outstanding Skeptics of the Twentieth Century.[105] In 2010 he was posthumously honored with an award for his contributions in the skeptical field from the Independent Investigations Group.[106] In 1982 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry awarded Gardner its In Praise of Reason Award for his \"heroic efforts in defense of reason and the dignity of the skeptical attitude\",[107] and in 2011 it added Gardner to its Pantheon of Skeptics.[108]/nCard magic, and magic in general, owe a far greater debt to Martin Gardner than most conjurors realize.[109]/n\u2013Stephen Minch/nMartin Gardner held a lifelong fascination with magic and illusion that began when his father demonstrated a trick to him.[110] He wrote for a magic magazine in high school and worked in a department store demonstrating magic tricks while he was at the University of Chicago.[111] Gardner's first published writing (at the age of fifteen) was a magic trick in The Sphinx, the official magazine of the Society of American Magicians.[112] He focused mainly on micromagic (table or close-up magic) and, from the 1930s on, published a significant number of original contributions to this secretive field. Magician Joe M. Turner said, The Encyclopedia of Impromptu Magic, which Gardner wrote in 1985, \"is guaranteed to show up in any poll of magicians' favorite magic books.\"[113][114] His first magic book for the general public, Mathematics, Magic and Mystery (Dover, 1956), is still considered a classic in the field.[112] He was well known for his innovative tapping and spelling effects, with and without playing cards, and was most proud of the effect he called the \"Wink Change\".[115]/nMany of Gardner's lifelong friends were magicians.[116] These included William Simon who introduced Gardner to Charlotte Greenwald, whom he married in 1952, Dai Vernon, Jerry Andrus, statistician Persi Diaconis, and polymath Raymond Smullyan. Gardner considered fellow magician James Randi his closest friend. Diaconis and Smullyan like Gardner straddled the two worlds of mathematics and magic.[70] Mathematics and magic were frequently intertwined in Gardner's work.[117] One of his earliest books, Mathematics, Magic and Mystery (1956), was about mathematically based magic tricks.[111] Mathematical magic tricks were often featured in his \"Mathematical Games\" column\u2013for example, his August 1962 column was titled \"A variety of diverting tricks collected at a fictitious convention of magicians.\" From 1998 to 2002 he wrote a monthly column on magic tricks called \"Trick of the Month\" in The Physics Teacher, a journal published by the American Association of Physics Teachers.[118]/nIn 1999 Magic magazine named Gardner one of the \"100 Most Influential Magicians of the Twentieth Century\".[8] In 2005 he received a 'Lifetime Achievement Fellowship' from the Academy of Magical Arts.[119] The last work to be published during his lifetime was a magic trick in the May 2010 issue of Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics.[112]/nI am a philosophical theist. I believe in a personal God, and I believe in an afterlife, and I believe in prayer, but I don't believe in any established religion. This is called philosophical theism. ... Philosophical theism is entirely emotional. As Kant said, he destroyed pure reason to make room for faith.[120]/n\u2013 Martin Gardner, 2008/nGardner was raised as a Methodist (his mother was very religious) but rejected established religion as an adult.[22] He considered himself a philosophical theist and a fideist.[120] He believed in a personal God, in an afterlife, and prayer, but rejected established religion. Nevertheless, he had abiding fascination with religious belief. In his autobiography, he stated: \"When many of my fans discovered that I believed in God and even hoped for an afterlife, they were shocked and dismayed ... I do not mean the God of the Bible, especially the God of the Old Testament, or any other book that claims to be divinely inspired. For me God is a \"Wholly Other\" transcendent intelligence, impossible for us to understand. He or she is somehow responsible for our universe and capable of providing, how I have no inkling, an afterlife.\"[121]/nGardner described his own belief as philosophical theism inspired by the works of philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. While eschewing systematic religious doctrine, he retained a belief in God, asserting that this belief cannot be confirmed or disconfirmed by reason or science.[122] At the same time, he was skeptical of claims that any god has communicated with human beings through spoken or telepathic revelation or through miracles in the natural world.[123] Gardner has been quoted as saying that he regarded parapsychology and other research into the paranormal as tantamount to \"tempting God\" and seeking \"signs and wonders\". He stated that while he would expect tests on the efficacy of prayers to be negative, he would not rule out a priori the possibility that as yet unknown paranormal forces may allow prayers to influence the physical world.[124]/nGardner wrote repeatedly about what public figures such as Robert Maynard Hutchins, Mortimer Adler, and William F. Buckley, Jr. believed and whether their beliefs were logically consistent. In some cases, he attacked prominent religious figures such as Mary Baker Eddy on the grounds that their claims are unsupportable. His semi-autobiographical novel The Flight of Peter Fromm depicts a traditionally Protestant Christian man struggling with his faith, examining 20th century scholarship and intellectual movements and ultimately rejecting Christianity while remaining a theist.[122]/nGardner said that he suspected that the fundamental nature of human consciousness may not be knowable or discoverable, unless perhaps a physics more profound than (\"underlying\") quantum mechanics is some day developed. In this regard, he said, he belonged to \"a group of thinkers known as the 'mysterians'.\"[125] His philosophical views in general are described and defended in his book The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener (1983, revised 1999).[126]/nGardner was considered a leading authority on Lewis Carroll. His annotated version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, explaining the many mathematical riddles, wordplay, and literary references found in the Alice books, was first published as The Annotated Alice (Clarkson Potter, 1960). Sequels were published with new annotations as More Annotated Alice (Random House, 1990), and finally as The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition (Norton, 1999), combining notes from the earlier editions and new material.[127] The original book arose when Gardner found the Alice books \"sort of frightening\" when he was young, but found them fascinating as an adult.[128] He felt that someone ought to annotate them, and suggested to a publisher that Bertrand Russell be asked; when the publisher was unable to get past Russell's secretary, Gardner was asked to take on the project himself.[129]/nThere had long been annotated books written by scholars for other scholars, but Gardner was the first to write such a work for the general public,[130] and soon many other writers followed his lead.[131][132] Gardner himself went on to produce annotated editions of G. K. Chesterton's The Innocence Of Father Brown and The Man Who Was Thursday, as well as of celebrated poems including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Casey at the Bat, The Night Before Christmas, and The Hunting of the Snark.[116]/nGardner wrote two novels. He was a fan of the Oz books written by L. Frank Baum,[133] and in 1988 he published Visitors from Oz, based on the characters in Baum's various Oz books. Gardner was a founding member of the International Wizard of Oz Club, and winner of its 1971 L. Frank Baum Memorial Award. His other novel was The Flight of Peter Fromm (1973), which reflected his lifelong fascination with religious belief and the problem of faith.[134]/nHis short stories were collected in The No-Sided Professor and Other Tales of Fantasy, Humor, Mystery, and Philosophy (1987).[1]/nAt the age of 95 Gardner wrote Undiluted Hocus-Pocus: The Autobiography of Martin Gardner.  He was living in a one-room apartment in Norman, Oklahoma and, as was his custom, wrote it on a typewriter and edited it using scissors and rubber cement.[89] He took the title from a poem, a so-called grook, by his good friend Piet Hein,[135] which perfectly expresses Gardner's abiding sense of mystery and wonder about existence.[136]/nWe glibly talk\n\u00a0of nature's laws\nbut do things have\n\u00a0a natural cause?\n\nBlack earth turned into\n\u00a0yellow crocus\nis undiluted\n\u00a0hocus-pocus./nGardner's interest in wordplay led him to conceive of a magazine on recreational linguistics. In 1967 he pitched the idea to Greenwood Periodicals and nominated Dmitri Borgmann as editor.[137] The resulting journal, Word Ways, carried many of his articles\u2014some of them  posthumously\u2014until publication ceased in 2020.[138] He also wrote a \"Puzzle Tale\" column for Asimov's Science Fiction magazine from 1977 to 1986. Gardner was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club, the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers.[139]/nGardner often used pen names. In 1952, while working for the children's magazine Humpty Dumpty, he contributed stories written by \"Humpty Dumpty Jnr\". For several years starting in 1953 he was a managing editor of Polly Pigtails, a magazine for young girls, and also wrote under that name. His Annotated Casey at the Bat (1967) included a parody of the poem, attributed to \"Nitram Rendrag\" (his name spelled backwards). Using the pen name \"Uriah Fuller\", he wrote two books attacking the alleged psychic Uri Geller. In later years, Gardner often wrote parodies of his favorite poems under the name \"Armand T. Ringer\", an anagram of his name.[140] In 1983 one George Groth panned Gardner's book The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener in the New York Review of Books. Only in the last line of the review was it revealed that George Groth was Martin Gardner himself.[126]/nIn his January 1960 \"Mathematical Games\" column, Gardner introduced the fictitious \"Dr. Matrix\" and wrote about him often over the next two decades. Dr. Matrix was not exactly a pen name, although Gardner did pretend that everything in these columns came from the fertile mind of the good doctor. Then in 1979 Dr. Matrix himself published an article in the quite respectable Two-Year College Mathematics Journal.[141] It was called Martin Gardner: Defending the Honor of the Human Mind and contained a biography of Gardner and a history of his \"Mathematical Games\" column. It would be a further decade before Martin published an article in such a mathematics journal under his own name.[140]/nGardner wrote on the philosophy of mathematics.[142] He wrote negative reviews of The Mathematical Experience by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh and What Is Mathematics, Really? by Hersh, both of which were critical of aspects of mathematical Platonism, and the first of which was well received by the mathematical community. While Gardner was often perceived as a hard-core Platonist, his reviews demonstrated some formalist tendencies.[143] Gardner maintained that his views are widespread among mathematicians, but Hersh has countered that in his experience as a professional mathematician and speaker, this is not the case.[144]/nIn the August 1998 edition of Scientific American, Gardner wrote his final piece for Scientific American titled, \"A Quarter Century of Recreational Mathematics.\"[145]  In it he said, \"For 40 years I have done my best to convince educators that recreational math should be incorporated into the standard curriculum. It should be regularly introduced as a way to interest young students in the wonders of mathematics. So far, though, movement in this direction has been glacial.\" He recalls how as a young boy a math teacher had scolded him for working on a bit of recreation mathematics and laments at how wrongheaded this attitude is.  He notes that the magazine Mathematics Teacher published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and specially dedicated to improving mathematics instruction for grades 8\u201314,[146] often has articles on recreational topics but that most teachers do not use them.[88]/nThe numerous awards Gardner received include:[147]/nThe Mathematical Association of America has established a Martin Gardner Lecture to be given each year on the last day of MAA MathFest, the summer meeting of the MAA. The first annual lecture, Recreational Mathematics and Computer Science: Martin Gardner's Influence on Research, was given by Erik Demaine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday, August 3, 2019, at MathFest in Cincinnati.[151]  The 2021 lecture Surprising discoveries of three amateur mathematicians:  M.C. Escher, Marjorie Rice, and Rinus Roelofs was virtual and was given by Doris Schattschneider.[152]/nThere are eight bricks honoring Gardner in the Paul R.

A video was made for the CBC Television program The Nature of Things with David Suzuki.[157] It featured Gardner along with many members of his circle and was called \"Martin Gardner: Mathemagician\" and broadcast on March 14, 1996.  At this point Rogers and his friends decided to make the gathering a regular, bi-annual event. Participants over the years have ranged from long-time Gardner friends such as John Horton Conway, Elwyn Berlekamp,  Ronald Graham, Donald Coxeter, and Richard K. Guy, to newcomers like mathematician and mathematical artist Erik Demaine, mathematical video maker Vi Hart, and  Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava.[42][158]/nThe program at the \"G4G\" meetings presents topics which Gardner had written about. The first gathering in 1993 was G4G1 and the 1996 event was G4G2.

His only preserved writings are some notes contained in manuscripts of Plato's dialogues. He has been called a \"true Renaissance man\"[2] and \"the cleverest man in Byzantium in the 9th century\".[3] He was archbishop of Thessalonica and later became the head of the Magnaura School of philosophy in Constantinople,[4] where he taught Aristotelian logic./nLeo was born in Thessaly, a cousin of the Patriarch of Constantinople, John the Grammarian. He was probably at least in part of Armenian descent.[5][6][7][8] In his youth he was educated at Constantinople, but found higher education options limited in the city and thus travelled to the monasteries of Andros, where he could obtain rare manuscripts and was taught mathematics by an old monk.[9][10] He originally taught privately in obscurity in Constantinople. The story goes that when one of his students[11] was captured during the Byzantine\u2013Arab Wars, the Caliph al-Mamun was so impressed by his knowledge of mathematics, providing proofs that his own scholars were unable to complete, and predictive abilities that he offered Leo great riches to come to Baghdad.[12] Leo took the letter from the caliph to the Byzantine emperor Theophilos, who, impressed by his international repute, conferred on him a school (ekpaideut\u0113rion) in either the Magnaura or the church of the Forty Martyrs.[13]/nIn the version of the story recorded by Theophanes Continuatus, the caliph, upon receiving Leo's letter of refusal, sent a letter requesting answers to some difficult questions of geometry and astrology, which Leo obliged. Al-Mamun then offered two thousands pounds of gold and a perpetual peace to Theophilos, if only he could borrow Leo's services briefly; the request was declined. The emperor then honoured Leo by having John the Grammarian consecrate him metropolitan of Thessalonica, which post he held from the spring of 840 to 843. There is a discrepancy in this account, however, in that the caliph died in 833. It has been suggested that either the connection between the caliph's final letter and Leo's appointment as metropolitan is in error, or the caliph in question was actually al-Mutasim. This latter option squares with the account of Symeon the Logothete, who makes Leo teach at the Magnaura from late 838 to early 840 and was paid handsomely.[14]/nLeo, an iconoclast sometimes accused of paganism, lost his metropolitancy with the end of the Iconoclasm in 843.[15] Despite this, he delivered a sermon favourable of icons within months of Theophilos' death.[16] Around 855, Leo was appointed at the head of a newly established Magnaura School by Bardas.[17] He was renowned for his philosophical, mathematical, medical, scientific, literary, philological, seismological, astronomic, and astrological learning, and was patronised by Theoktistos and befriended by Photios I of Constantinople.[18][19] Cyril was his student. Leo has been credited with a system of beacons (an optical telegraph) stretching across Asia Minor from Cilicia to Constantinople, which gave advance warning of Arab raids, as well as diplomatic communication.[4][20] Leo also invented several automata, such as trees with moving birds, roaring lions, and a levitating imperial throne.[2] The throne was in operation a century later, when Liutprand of Cremona witnessed it during his visit to Constantinople.[21][22]/nMost of Leo's writings have been lost. He wrote book-length works, poems, and many epigrams,[23] and was also a compiler, who brought together a wide range of philosophical, medical, and astronomic texts. His library can at least partially be reconstructed: Archimedes, Euclid, Plato, Paul of Alexandria, Theon of Alexandria, Proclus, Porphyry, Apollonius of Perga, the lost Mechanics of Quirinus and Marcellus, and possibly Thucydides.[9] He composed his own medical encyclopaedia.

Her family was wealthy, and often held parties where D\u00e1n would meet many different people from various stations in life./nAt 14, D\u00e1n became a national champion in figure skating.[7] She attended Veres P\u00e1ln\u00e9 Gimn\u00e1zium\u00a0[hu] in Budapest and graduated in 1929.[4]/nAfter their wedding, D\u00e1n and John von Neumann immigrated to the United States, where he held a professorship at Princeton University. Upon immigration, Kl\u00e1ra listed her profession as \"housewife\".[5] However, after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, more jobs for women opened up in the U.S. and Kl\u00e1ra was able to secure a position at Princeton.[5] Her title was \"Head of Statistical Computing Group\".[5] In 1943, von Neumann moved to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to work on calculations as part of the Manhattan Project. D\u00e1n remained at Princeton until 1946, working at the university's Office of Population Research.[8] At this time, she was sharing an office with Adele Goldstein.[9] D\u00e1n also enrolled in calculus at Princeton in 1947.[9] Both Goldstein and D\u00e1n were then contracted to work in Los Alamos New Mexico in early summer of 1947.[9]/nAnd so, after the war, D\u00e1n joined von Neumann in New Mexico to program the MANIAC I machine, which could store data, designed by her husband and Julian Bigelow.[4][10][11] This work was entirely novel, a feat that had never been completed before. Kl\u00e1r\u00e1 scored the job, however, due to the belief at the time that programming was menial work, similar to human computing, a job commonly held by women. For decades after this, society would devalue the work of programming, which ultimately allowed women to be a large part of the workforce.[9] More specifically, D\u00e1n's job was to translate mathematical instructions into a language the computer could understand. To do this she would look up \"codes\" - numbers that correspond to instructions for the computer. This is the origin of the word \"coder\", and the birth of the modern code paradigm. This coding also required her to ask for sections of the machine to be rebuilt, as there was not a clear distinction between software and hardware at the time.[9] She then worked on the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) on a project with von Neumann to produce the first successful meteorological forecast on a computer. D\u00e1n designed new controls for ENIAC and was one of its primary programmers.[12][13] She trained a group of people drawn from the Manhattan Project to store programs as binary code.[8] During this time she also wrote the code for the first computer simulation of the Monte Carlo method, which is a method to store and analyze large quantities of data and make predictions on everything from elections to COVID-19 trend forecasting.[9]/nShe taught the meteorologists how to program ENIAC where she managed 100,000 punch cards ensuring there were no data loss.[14] She worked for 32 days on the project, where she saw through and checked the final code.[3]/nAfter her husband's death from cancer in 1957, D\u00e1n wrote the preface to his Silliman Lectures. The lectures were published in 1958[15] and later edited and published by Yale University Press as The Computer and the Brain.[16] She also wrote an unpublished memoir entitled A Grasshopper in Very Tall Grass.[5] In 2022, D\u00e1n was the subject of a multi-episode season of the Lost Women of Science[17] podcast./nD\u00e1n met her first husband, Ferenc Engel at one of her parents' parties.[5] They wed in 1931.[18] Kl\u00e1ra was 19 and described herself as \"frighteningly in love\". Engel was an avid gambler, and took D\u00e1n on many trips to casinos. They were at a casino in Monte Carlo when D\u00e1n met her future husband, John von Neumann, for the first time. He explained that he had perfected a way to ensure that you could win roulette every time, and promptly lost all his money trying to prove his point. Afterwards, he asked D\u00e1n to buy him a drink. It was a very consequential interaction for both of them, and would set the stage for their later romance. Eventually, after a particularly tumultuous trip through Southern Europe, Engel's gambling became too much of a problem for D\u00e1n and she divorced him.[5] One month later she remarried, this time to Andor Rapoch in 1936.[18] He was an investment banker 18 years her senior. Throughout their marriage, Kl\u00e1ra maintained contact with John von Neumann, and eventually in 1938, after Neumann went through a divorce, divorced Rapoch and married Neumann soon after.[5] With the start of World War II looming, Kl\u00e1r\u00e1 went back to Budapest to convince her parents and in-laws to leave the country. She left on a boat on August 30, 1939.[5] Her father did not adjust well to leaving his home country and factory, and committed suicide soon after coming to the U.S. in 1939.[5] In June 1942 D\u00e1n suffered a late-term miscarriage.[5]/nD\u00e1n married oceanographer and physicist Carl Eckart in 1958 and moved to La Jolla, California. She died in 1963 when she drove from her home in La Jolla to the beach and walked into the surf and drowned.

He introduced the use of complex systems and generative models in developmental biology. He suggested that a reductionist view of nature fails to explain complex features, controversially proposing the structuralist theory that morphogenetic fields might substitute for natural selection in driving evolution.[1] He was also a visible member of the Third Culture movement.[2]/nBrian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\"[3] under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\"./nThereafter, he taught at the Schumacher College in Devon, UK, where he was instrumental in starting the college's MSc in Holistic Science. He was made a Founding Fellow of Schumacher College shortly before his death. Goodwin also had a research position at MIT and was a long time visitor of several institutions including the UNAM in Mexico City. He was a founding member of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico where he also served as a member of the science board for several years.[4][5]/nBrian Goodwin died in hospital in 2009, after surgery resulting from a fall from his bicycle.[6] Goodwin is survived by his third wife, Christel, and his daughter, Lynn./nShortly after Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod developed their first model of gene regulation, Goodwin proposed the first model of a genetic oscillator, showing that regulatory interactions among genes allowed  periodic fluctuations to occur. Shortly after this model became published, he also formulated a general theory of complex gene regulatory networks using statistical mechanics.\nIn its simplest form, Goodwin's oscillator involves a single gene that represses itself. Goodwin equations were originally formulated in terms of conservative (Hamiltonian) systems, thus not taking into account dissipative effects that are required in a realistic approach to regulatory phenomena in biology. Many versions have been developed since then. The simplest (but realistic) formulation considers three variables, X, Y and Z indicating the concentrations of RNA, protein and end product which generates the negative feedback loop. The equations are/nand closed oscillations can occur for n>8 and behave limit cycles: after a perturbation of the system's state, it returns to its previous attractor. A simple modification of this model, adding other terms introducing additional steps in the transcription machinery allows to find oscillations for smaller n values. Goodwin's model and its extensions have been widely used over the years as the basic skeleton for other models of oscillatory behavior, including circadian clocks, cell division or physiological control systems./nIn the field of developmental biology, Goodwin explored self-organization in pattern formation, using case studies from single-cell (as Acetabularia) to multicellular organisms, including early development in Drosophila. He proposed that morphogenetic fields, defined in terms of spatial distributions of chemical signals (morphogenes), could pattern and shape the embryo. In this way, geometry and development were linked through a mathematical formalism. Along with his colleague Lynn Trainor, Goodwin developed a set of mathematical equations describing the changes of both physical boundaries in the organism and chemical gradients./nBy considering the mechanochemical behaviour of the cortical cytoplasm (or cytogel) of plant cells, a viscoelastic material mainly composed of actin microfilaments and reinforced by a microtubules network, Goodwin & Trainor (1985) showed how to couple calcium and the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm. The cytogel is  treated as a continuous viscoelastic medium in which calcium ions can diffuse and interact with the cytoskeleton. The model consists in two non-linear partial differential equations which describe the evolution of the mechanical strain field and of the calcium distribution in the cytogel./nIt has been shown (Trainor & Goodwin, 1986) that, in a range of parameter values, instabilities may occur and develop in this system, leading to intracellular patterns of strain and calcium concentration. The equations read, in their general form:/nThese equations describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of the displacement from the reference state and the calcium concentration, respectively. Here x and t are the space and time coordinates, respectively. These equations can be applied to many different scenarios and the different functions P(x) introduce the specific mechanical properties of the medium. These equations can generate a rich variety of static and dynamic patterns, from complex geometrical motifs to oscillations and chaos (Briere 1994)[citation not found]./nHe was also a strong advocate of the view that genes cannot fully explain the complexity of biological systems. In that sense, he became one of the strongest defenders of the systems view against reductionism. He suggested that nonlinear phenomena and the fundamental laws defining their behavior were essential to understand biology and its evolutionary paths. His position within evolutionary biology can be defined as a structuralist one. To Goodwin, many patterns in nature are a byproduct of constraints imposed by complexity. The limited repertoire of motifs observed in the spatial organization of plants and animals (at some scales) would be, in Goodwin's opinion, a fingerprint of the role played by such constraints. The role of natural selection would be secondary./nThese opinions were highly controversial, and they brought Goodwin into conflict with many prominent Darwinian evolutionists, whereas some physicists found some of his views natural. Physicist Murray Gell-Mann for example acknowledged that \"when biological evolution \u2014 based on largely random variation in genetic material and on natural selection \u2014 operates on the structure of actual organisms, it does so subject to the laws of physical science, which place crucial limitations on how living things can be constructed.\" Richard Dawkins, the former professor for public understanding of science at Oxford University and a well known Darwinian evolutionist,  conceded: \"I don't think there's much good evidence to support [his thesis], but it's important that somebody like Brian Goodwin is saying that kind of thing, because it provides the other extreme, and the truth probably lies somewhere between.\" Dawkins also agreed that \"It's a genuinely interesting possibility that the underlying laws of morphology allow only a certain limited range of shapes.\". For his part, Goodwin did not reject basic Darwinism, only its excesses./nBiologist Gert Korthof has praised the research of Goodwin commenting he tried to \"improve Darwinism in a scientific way.\"[7] David B. Wake has also positively reviewed Goodwin's research describing him as a \"thoughtful scientist, one of the great dissenters from the orthodoxies of modern evolutionary, genetic and developmental biology\".[8]/nGoodwin had argued that natural selection was \"too weak [a] force\" to explain evolution and only operated as a filter mechanism. He claimed that modern evolutionary biology failed to provide an explanation for the theory of biological form and had ignored the importance of morphogenesis in evolution. He claimed to provide a new evolutionary theory to replace neo-Darwinism. In a critical review, biologist Catherine S. C. Price noted that although he had succeeded in providing an alternative to mutation as the only source of variation, he failed to provide an alternative to natural selection as a mechanism of adaptation.[9] Price claimed Goodwin's \"discussion of evolution is biased, insufficiently developed and poorly informed\", and that he misrepresented Darwinism, used straw man arguments and ignored research from population genetics.[9]/nThe evolutionary biologist G\u00fcnter P. Wagner described Goodwin's structuralism as \"a fringe movement in evolutionary biology\".[10]", "4476957": "Paul Althaus Smith (May 18, 1900\u00a0\u2013 June 13, 1980) was an American mathematician.

There is reason to believe, on the evidence of two pay-bills, that for a short time in 1755 and 1756 Hutton worked in the colliery at Old Long Benton. Following Ivison's promotion to a church living, Hutton took over the Jesmond school, which, in consequence of his increasing number of pupils, he relocated to nearby Stotes Hall, since demolished. While he taught during the day at Stotes Hall, which overlooked Jesmond Dene, he studied mathematics in the evening at a school in Newcastle. In 1760 he married, and began teaching on a larger scale in Newcastle, where his pupils included John Scott, later Lord Eldon, who became Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.[3]/nIn 1764 Hutton published his first work, The Schoolmasters Guide, or a Complete System of Practical Arithmetic, which was followed by his Treatise on Mensuration both in Theory and Practice in 1770.[3] At around this time he was employed by the mayor and corporation of Newcastle to make a survey of the town and its environs. He drew up a map for the corporation; a smaller one, of the town only, was engraved and published.[4] In 1772 he brought out a tract on The Principles of Bridges, a subject suggested by the destruction of the sole Newcastle bridge by the Great Flood of 1771.[3]/nHutton left Newcastle in 1773, following his appointment as professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.[3] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in July, 1774[5] He was asked by the society to perform the calculations necessary to work out the mass and density of the earth from the results of the Schiehallion experiment \u2013 a set of observations of the gravitational pull of a mountain in Perthshire made by the Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne,[6] in 1774\u201376.[3] Hutton's results appeared in the society's Philosophical Transactions for 1778, and were later reprinted in the second volume of Hutton's Tracts on Mathematical and Philosophical Subjects. His work on the question procured for him the degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He became the foreign secretary of the Royal Society in 1779. His resignation from the society in 1783 was brought about by tensions between its president Sir Joseph Banks and the mathematicians amongst its members.[3] He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788.[7]/nWhile working on the Schiehallion experiment, Hutton recorded 23 Gaelic place-names on or near his measurement contour.

His Mathematical and Philosophical Dictionary, a valuable contribution to scientific biography, was published in 1795 and the four volumes of Recreations in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, mostly translated from the French, in 1803. One of his most laborious works was the abridgment, in conjunction with G. Shaw and R. Pearson, of the Royal Society's Philosophical Transactions. This undertaking, the mathematical and scientific parts of which fell to Hutton, was completed in 1809, and filled 18 quarto volumes.[3] From 1764 he contributed to The Ladies' Diary (a poetical and mathematical almanac established in 1704), and became its editor in 1773\u20134, retaining the post until 1817.[9] He had previously begun a small periodical called Miscellane Mathematica, of which only 13 numbers appeared; he subsequently published five volumes of The Diarian Miscellany which contained substantial extracts from the Diary.[3]/nDue to ill health, Hutton resigned his professorship in 1807,[3] although he served as the principal examiner of the Royal Military Academy, and also to the Addiscombe Military Seminary for some years after his retirement.

Let [him] investigate and measure the terrain, pin down the routes that should be followed, establish a platform [for cannon] at each juncture and then, with the cost of one platform as a base of reference for the others, the entrances to the passes will be rock-safe!... Let Yuanhua teach the tactics to the generals and commanders, [since] only the people who actually make the cannon can teach how to operate cannon.\"[7] Hou was dismissed because of a memorial against Shen Que and the \"Eunuch Party\" but not before his proposals regarding Sun were put into practice. The war minister and grand secretary Sun Chengzong offered Sun Yuanhua a place on the ministry staff but acceded to his demands to take up responsibility in the war zone, making him a \"military commissioner responsible for armament in the field\".[7] A general modernization program was delayed, however, when a 1623 demonstration of foreign artillery at Beijing went awry and a piece exploded, killing a Portuguese artillerist and three Chinese.[8] Though subdued, official interest continued: Yuan Chonghuan began supporting Sun's policies in 1626.[1]/nAn important meeting was held at Sun's Jiading estate around 1627, where Andrea Palmeiro, Xu, Sun, Yang, and eleven Jesuit missionaries planned the future of Christian expansion in China, including the status of Chinese rites and which Chinese name should be used for the Christian God.[9]/nFollowing Xu and Li's 1629 memorials, the Portuguese captain Gon\u00e7alo Teixeira Corr\u00eaa was permitted to bring ten artillery pieces and four \"excellent bombards\" across China to begin the training of Ming troops in European-style cannon.[10] Further reinforcements were turned back at Nanchang in Jiangxi,[11] owing to an outpouring of official complaints when a sudden illness removed the threat of a Manchu assault on Beijing.[12] The merchants in Guangzhou were anxious lest their special monopolies on Portuguese trade be curtailed[12] but a memorials of Lu Zhaolong singled Sun Yuanhua out for particular condemnation because of his overly fond treatment of the foreigners.[13]/nIn 1630, Sun received the title of Shandong's Assistant Surveillance Commissioner for \"having penetrated deep into the camp of the enemy\".[14] Liang Tingdong, the minister of war, offered him the post of governor of Denglai (t \u767b\u840a, s \u767b\u83b1, D\u0113ngl\u00e1i) in northern Shandong, but Sun was hesitant.[14] He composed a memorial stating/nI believe the Court formerly made Denglai into a kind of commission and the Dongjiang Islands into a kind of military post. You now want your servant to fill this vacancy but if the Ministry of Personnel does not provide full pay for its soldiers, the Ministry of Works its necessary equipment, and the Ministry of War its horses then from a military perspective this is all vacuous... Moreover, even disregarding the rebelliousness of the general of the islands, it is not easy to carry out orders there. Your servant could not accept the position even if he were not ill. How much worse is it that he is now ill, unable to straddle a saddle or hold a brush.[14]/nRather than assuage Sun's concerns, he was ultimately ordered to take up the post at Dengzhou (now Penglai)[8] with a force of 8000 Liaoning conscripts and the Portuguese instructors.[14] There, Sun worked with Gon\u00e7alo and his translator, the elderly Jesuit Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues, to train Ming troops to repel the continuing Manchu invasion. He also began manufacturing his own cannon in the Portuguese style.[15] In a report to the capital, Sun complained of the Liaoning refugees who had fled to his district in the hundreds of thousands[3] that they \"had seen few wars\" and were thus \"weak, deceitful, and completely unreliable\".[3]/nIn early 1631,[16] the Korean diplomat Jeong Duwon visited Dengzhou while traveling to Beijing by sea, war having blocked the usual overland route from Seoul.[17] Sun introduced him to Rodrigues,[16] whose interviews and gifts on the occasion have been credited with the introduction of western religion, science, geography, firearms, and jurisprudence to Korea.[18][19][20][21]/nOn 19 January 1632, Governor Sun's subordinates Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming mutinied.[1] Both had previously served together under Mao Wenlong, a Ming general executed for using his post overseeing the Yellow Sea to support and conduct smuggling throughout northern China. Rather than immediately attacking Kong and Geng, Sun attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution of their differences. This proved futile[1] and, on 11 February, their forces besieged Dengzhou. When the city fell a little over a week later, Captain Corr\u00eaa and 11 other Portuguese were killed in battle, 15 escaped only with serious injury, and Rodrigues survived only by jumping from the high city wall into the sea.[8] Sun was spared by Kong and Geng for his earlier leniency but, for the same reason, he was then condemned and arrested by the Ming government.[1] Xu, despite now holding some of the highest posts in China for his work reforming the calendar, was unable to secure clemency through memorials absolving Sun for Kong and Geng's actions. Sun's court martial condemned him to death and he was executed shortly thereafter on 7\u00a0September 1632.[1]/nSun assisted his mentor Paul Xu with the editing of his trigonometry textbook Principles of Right Triangles (t \u53e5\u80a1\u7fa9, s \u52fe\u80a1\u4e49, G\u014dug\u01d4 Y\u00ec).[5] Like Xu, Sun also wrote his own treatises on military science and geometry, incorporating the European knowledge being introduced by their Jesuit instructors.[1]/nThe mathematical works included the Miscellanea on Western Learning (Xixue Zazhu), How to Do Geometry (t \u5e7e\u4f55\u7528\u6cd5, s \u51e0\u4f55\u7528\u6cd5, J\u01d0h\u00e9 Y\u00f2ngf\u01ce), and Western Calculation (\u592a\u897f\u7b97\u8981, T\u00e0ix\u012b Su\u00e0ny\u0101o).[5]/nOne military work was his Jingwu Quanbian.[5] His 1632 Western-style Masterpieces (t \u897f\u6cd5\u795e\u6a5f, s \u897f\u6cd5\u795e\u673a, X\u012bf\u01ce Sh\u00e9nj\u012b)[22] became famous,[4] advocating for the use of modernized fortifications as well as firearms. Sun was particularly impressed by the angled bastions (t \u92b3\u89d2, s \u9510\u89d2, ru\u00ecji\u01ceo) of Renaissance Europe's star forts, writing that, \"with the angled bastion, the enemy is kept out beyond the walls and, when subjected to our attack, there is nowhere our guns cannot reach and the enemy has no way to approach.\"[4] His efforts to construct them in the 1620s were apparently neutralized by factional feuds within the Ming government and turnover of the responsible officials, however, and they did not become widely employed in China.[4]/nKong and Geng, after considering their options, threw in their lot with Manchuria and rose to prominence under the Qing Empire it established. The Manchu welcomed their captured artillery: Despite continuing to call them hongyipao, they adjusted one of the name's characters to make them \"red-coated cannon\".[23]/nThe Xu and Sun families remained close. Sun Yuanhua's niece Ms Wang later married Xu's grandson Erdou.[5][c] A detailed Biography of Vice-Censor-in-Chief Sun was composed by Gui Zhuang (1613\u20131673). Gui knew Sun Yuanhua's grandson Sun Zhimi and wrote the preface for his 1671 Jiangxing Zashi.[24]/nSun is the tragic protagonist[25] of Ling Li's 1996 novel Qingcheng Qingguo.[26]", "872484": "Richard Peirce Brent is an Australian mathematician and computer scientist.

He was interested in mathematics from an early age, and studied under the Osaka-based physician and astronomer Asada Goryu in 1787. At the time, the Japanese were using the  lunisolar H\u014dryaku calendar, which had become increasing inaccurate, and which had missed the forecast of a solar eclipse in 1763. On the other hand, this solar eclipse was predicted by several astronomers in the field, one of whom was Asada Goryu. After that, Goryu read Chinese and Western astronomy and created his own calendar, \"Ephemeris Time,\" which took into account his own theories. The new calendar was well received, but Takahashi was not convinced it was a complete solution. Together with fellow mathematician and astronomer Hazama Shigetomi, he exhaustively studied Chinese and Western calendars as well as the previous Japanese J\u014dky\u014d calendar. He reached the conclusion that a source of inaccuracy of previous lunisolar calendars was based on an assumption that celestial bodies rotated in circular orbits, as postulated in the West by Tycho Brahe, whereas their actual orbits were elliptical, as advocated by Johannes Kepler. Together with Asada and Hazama, he developed a new calendar theory, and his reputation as an astronomer became unrivaled in Japan at the time./nIn 1795, Takahashi was ordered to Edo where he established the Shogunate Astronomical Observatory. Also while in Edo, he was approached by In\u014d Tadataka, who despite being 19 years senior in age, asked to become his disciple. In\u014d was interested in the problem of determining the true length of a Meridian arc, and walked the distance from his home in Fukagawa to Takahashi's observatory in Asakusa to obtain the data necessary for a rough calculation. Takahashi advised that the number was hopelessly inaccurate over a short distance, and calculated that measurements would need to be made over a distance roughly between Edo and the northern island of Ezo in order to obtain an accurate value. This was one of the main objectives of In\u014d's subsequent surveying expeditions./nIn 1796, Takahashi received official approval for his new calendar, and was ordered make astronomical observations between Edo and Kyoto, where he had to convince the influential Tsuchimikado clan, a clan of court nobility who advised the Emperor of Japan on ceremonies tied to the calendar dates, on the validity of his reforms. In 1797, the new calendar was formally adopted as the Kansei calendar[1] The new calendar proved to be quickly popular and Takahashi gained great trust from the Shogunate. On the other hand, he was aware that the calendar still had a few shortcomings and between staying up all night for astronomical observations and travels to Kyoto to speak with the Tsuchimikado clan, his health deteriorated and he developed tuberculosis. A solar eclipse in 1802 revealed a 15-minute discrepancy in the calendar which needed additional observations, calculations and corrections. In 1803, Takahashi obtained a copy of a book by the French astronomer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande, in which the movements of five major planets was described. This work was an eye-opener for Takahashi, as it filled in a major gap in his own calendar theories.

In 1957 he moved to the University of Leeds to join Stephen Toulmin in the establishment of a centre in the History and Philosophy of Science.  He stayed at Leeds, eventually becoming a Reader, until taking early retirement in 1983.  Since then he has been an independent scholar./nHe has visited at Utrecht University, Harvard University, the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Santa Cruz, Fudan University (Shanghai), the University of Texas at Dallas, the Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Luxembourg. Over the years he has worked closely with colleagues at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy./nRavetz's earliest research, after mathematics, was in the history of the mathematical sciences, with works on Copernicus and Fourier.[1][2]\nIn the sixties Ravetz, focused on contradictions in the functioning of science and its image, between a narrative of progress and one of depredation science.[3] He had proposed an unusual approach to study these contradictions. He highlighted the craft character of scientific knowledge, a set of procedures and evaluations that are part of the social activity of science. The quality of research, according to Ravetz, is influenced by this social component of scientific knowledge, which is strongly influenced by the professional models communicated through teaching. Due to this, the standard of adequacy is set by norms culturally stablished and shared./nHis influential book Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems went through several English language editions, plus German and Japanese translations, and was republished in 1996. This book raises issues of uncertainty and ethics in the social practice of science. It was an early attempt to recast the philosophy of science for the conditions of 'industrialised science' and to shift the philosophy of science from epistemology to the social and ethical aspects of science. In it he proposed a 'critical science' for a new version of the idealism that had characterised science in the pre-industrial age./nIn the years around 1970 he was an active member of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science./nFrom 1973 to 1976 he was Executive Secretary of the Council for Science and Society[4] in London, whose founder was the law reformer Paul Sieghart.[5] He drafted its report on 'The Acceptability of Risks'.  From 1977 to 1978, he was a member of the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group, regulating research in recombinant DNA.\nWorking with Silvio Funtowicz in Leeds [6] he created the NUSAP notational system, described in their book Uncertainty and Quality in Science for Policy (Reidel 1990). This was the stimulus for the development of the 'Guidance' for managing uncertainty, at the Netherlands Environment Agency.[7] \nThey also created the theory of Post-normal science, which applies when 'Facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent.'[8][9][10][11][12][13] A collection of his essays, The merger of knowledge with power: essays in critical science was also published in 1990.  With Zia Sardar he co-authored Cyberfutures: Culture and Politics on the Information Superhighway in 1996.[2] His most recent book is The No nonsense guide to science (New Internationalist 2006).\nHis research continues in two main directions:   new trends in the social practice of science; and new approaches to the management of uncertainty.  On the former, he has co-authored (with Silvio Funtowicz) chapters on 'Science, New Forms of'  and 'Peer Review and Quality Control' for the International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences (2015).[14][15]  On the latter he is concerned with the analysis of ignorance and the representation and manipulation of quantitative information where there is 'not even one significant digit'. He has also recently written \non the quality control crisis of science.[16][17]/nHe is currently an Associate Fellow at the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society at the University of Oxford. His research focus is on the impacts of technological progress on science, and new forms of science governance necessary for the protection of society, the environment and science itself.  Ravetz studies new institutional models and collective behaviors that rehabilitate the function of science as a solver of the problem of the sustainability of contemporary material society that derives from the ongoing technological development.[18]/nHe was interviewed by the Great Transition Initiative's blog [19] in June 2016. On May 31, 2019, the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society in Oxford has devoted a seminar [20] to honour his 90th birthday. He published a World View piece in the journal Nature on November 19, 2019, entitled Stop the science training that demands \u2018don\u2019t ask\u2019.[21] \nScience governance, unknown unknowns, science as a solver of the problem of the sustainability of society are tackled in the context of present debates.[22]  \nTogether with other scholars, Ravetz has contributed to the debate on the COVID-19 pandemic \n[23] and use of mathematical models.[24]/n\"The activity of modern natural science has transformed our knowledge and control of the world about us; but in the process it has also transformed itself; and it has created problems that natural science alone cannot solve\".

Ravetz with Philip Mirowski and Andrea Saltelli.", "61886551": "V\u011bra \u0160ediv\u00e1-Trnkov\u00e1 (March 16, 1934 \u2013\u00a027 May 2018) was a Czech mathematician known for her work in topology and in category theory.[1][2]/nTrnkov\u00e1 was born on March 16, 1934, in Berehove, then in Czechoslovakia and now in Ukraine; her father was a forester. By the time she was in high school, her family lived in Prague, and she went to Charles University for study in mathematics. There, she worked with Miroslav Kat\u011btov on general topology, earning a master's degree in 1957 with the thesis Collectionwise normal and strongly paracompact spaces on strengthened definitions for normal spaces.[1]/nShe continued her work on topology at Charles University as a doctoral student of Eduard \u010cech, earning a candidate's degree (the Czech equivalent of a Ph.D.) in 1961 with the dissertation Non-F-Topologies.[1][3] Much later, in 1989, she was also given the Dr.Sc. degree, corresponding to a habilitation.[1]/nIn 1960, while still a student, Trnkov\u00e1 became an assistant professor at Charles University. She was promoted to docent (associate professor), senior researcher, and full professor in 1967, 1986, and 1991, respectively.[1][4]/nShe retired in 1999,[4] and died on 27 May 2018.[2]/nDespite beginning her career working in general topology, Trnkov\u00e1 shifted as early as 1962 to category theory. Her work in this area included studied of formal completions of categories, the embeddings of categories into categories of topological spaces, category-theoretic automata theory, and the isomorphism of product objects in categories.[1]/nShe became the author of over 100 research papers and two monographs:[1]"}
