He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1978, a Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2005, and an Abel Prize in 2020, becoming the fifth mathematician to receive the three prizes. In 1991, he joined the faculty of Yale University, where he is currently the Erastus L. De Forest Professor of Mathematics.[3]/nMargulis was born to a Russian family of Lithuanian Jewish descent in Moscow, Soviet Union. At age 16 in 1962 he won the silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad. He received his PhD in 1970 from the Moscow State University, starting research in ergodic theory under the supervision of Yakov Sinai. Early work with David Kazhdan produced the Kazhdan\u2013Margulis theorem, a basic result on discrete groups. His superrigidity theorem from 1975 clarified an area of classical conjectures about the characterisation of arithmetic groups amongst lattices in Lie groups./nHe was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978, but was not permitted to travel to Helsinki to accept it in person, allegedly due to antisemitism against Jewish mathematicians in the Soviet Union.[4] His position improved, and in 1979 he visited Bonn, and was later able to travel freely, though he still worked in the Institute of Problems of Information Transmission, a research institute rather than a university. In 1991, Margulis accepted a professorial position at Yale University./nMargulis was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2001.[5] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6]/nIn 2005, Margulis received the Wolf Prize for his contributions to theory of lattices and applications to ergodic theory, representation theory, number theory, combinatorics, and measure theory./nIn 2020, Margulis received the Abel Prize jointly with Hillel Furstenberg \"For pioneering the use of methods from probability and dynamics in group theory, number theory and combinatorics.\"[7]/nMargulis's early work dealt with Kazhdan's property (T) and the questions of rigidity and arithmeticity of lattices in semisimple algebraic groups of higher rank over a local field. It had been known since the 1950s (Borel, Harish-Chandra) that a certain simple-minded way of constructing subgroups of semisimple Lie groups produces examples of lattices, called arithmetic lattices. It is analogous to considering the subgroup SL(n,Z) of the real special linear group SL(n,R) that consists of matrices with integer entries. Margulis proved that under suitable assumptions on G (no compact factors and split rank greater or equal than two), any (irreducible) lattice \u0393 in it is arithmetic, i.e. can be obtained in this way. Thus \u0393 is commensurable with the subgroup G(Z) of G, i.e. they agree on subgroups of finite index in both. Unlike general lattices, which are defined by their properties, arithmetic lattices are defined by a construction. Therefore, these results of Margulis pave a way for classification of lattices. Arithmeticity turned out to be closely related to another remarkable property of lattices discovered by Margulis. Superrigidity for a lattice \u0393 in G roughly means that any homomorphism of \u0393 into the group of real invertible n \u00d7 n matrices extends to the whole G. The name derives from the following variant:/n(The case when f is an isomorphism is known as the strong rigidity.) While certain rigidity phenomena had already been known, the approach of Margulis was at the same time novel, powerful, and very elegant./nMargulis solved the Banach\u2013Ruziewicz problem that asks whether the Lebesgue measure is the only normalized rotationally invariant finitely additive measure on the n-dimensional sphere. The affirmative solution for n \u2265 4, which was also independently and almost simultaneously obtained by Dennis Sullivan, follows from a construction of a certain dense subgroup of the orthogonal group that has property (T)./nMargulis gave the first construction of expander graphs, which was later generalized in the theory of Ramanujan graphs./nIn 1986, Margulis gave a complete resolution of the Oppenheim conjecture on quadratic forms and diophantine approximation. This was a question that had been open for half a century, on which considerable progress had been made by the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method; but to reduce the number of variables to the point of getting the best-possible results, the more structural methods from group theory proved decisive.

He was a young native of the planet Alzarius, which exists in the parallel universe of E-Space. A companion of the Fourth and Fifth Doctors, he was a regular in the programme from 1980 to 1982 and appeared in 11 stories (40 episodes). The name Adric is an anagram derived from the physicist Paul Dirac./nAdric first appears in the Fourth Doctor serial Full Circle. Attempting to escape from the mistfall threatening his community, he stumbles across and finds refuge in the TARDIS, which has been drawn into E-Space via a wormhole-like phenomenon known as a Charged Vacuum Emboitment. He stows away[1] when the Doctor, Romana and K-9 Mark II leave Alzarius and becomes a companion in the following serial, State of Decay, accompanying them on the rest of their adventures in E-Space. He remains with the Doctor when Romana and K-9 leave and the TARDIS finds its way back into its own universe./nWith a brilliant mathematical mind and wearing a star-shaped badge for mathematical excellence, Adric is well aware of his own intelligence. This, coupled with his relative immaturity, leads to a personality that is abrasive and occasionally crosses over into arrogance.[1] As a result, Adric is one of the least popular, or even \"most hated\", of the Doctor's companions among fans of the programme.[2][3] However, Adric also seeks validation from the Doctor and those around him, and is often hurt and resentful if he feels he is being sidelined or unable to contribute. As an Alzarian, Adric is a member of a highly adaptable species, theoretically capable of genetically evolving to suit any environment, although it is unknown whether his particular substrain is capable of this. It is known that he possesses an inhumanly rapid rate of healing, though not to the extent he can regenerate amputated body parts./nAdric is present when, during the events of Logopolis, the Fourth Doctor falls from the Pharos Project radio telescope and regenerates into his fifth incarnation. He continues to travel in the TARDIS along with new companions Nyssa and Tegan, but his travels come to an end in Earthshock when he tries to stop a Cyberman-controlled freighter from crashing into Earth. The navigational controls are locked by logic codes, and Adric is entering the solution to the last code when the computer is destroyed by a dying Cyberman. He dies in the crash, while his crewmates watch in horror on the TARDIS viewscreen. His last words before the explosion kills him are \"Now I'll never know if I was right.\" Adric dies not knowing that the freighter he was trying to stop would become the \"meteor\" that would wipe out the dinosaurs[3] and lead to the rise of mammals and eventually humans (see Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event and Alvarez hypothesis)./nAdric's death affects his companions deeply. In Time-Flight, Tegan tries to persuade the Doctor to go back in time and save him, but the Doctor refuses to break the Laws of Time,[4] even though it obviously pains him. In an effort to stop Nyssa and Tegan from travelling further, the Xeraphin try to use an illusion of Adric,[4] pleading that if they travelled further they would kill him. They see through the deception when they realise Adric is still wearing his badge (which the Doctor had destroyed in order to kill the Cyber Leader) and travel forth, giving Adric another illusory death scene. Adric also appears as a hallucination at the end of The Caves of Androzani, and his name is the last word that the Fifth Doctor says before regenerating into the Sixth Doctor./nDecades later, in The Power of the Doctor, Tegan works to help UNIT fight back an invasion of Cybermen. An artificial intelligence projection of the Thirteenth Doctor appears before assuming the form of the Fifth Doctor. The two reconcile, with the Doctor assuring Tegan he has not forgotten about any of his companions. Tegan asks what the Doctor thinks is on her mind when surrounded by Cybermen. \"Adric,\" the Doctor responds./nAdric's sole appearance in the Virgin Missing Adventures range was in the Lance Parkin novel Cold Fusion, during which he meets the Seventh Doctor, who treats Adric warmly despite the future Doctor's distaste for his past self, with the Seventh's companion Roz comparing the Doctor's interaction with Adric to a grandfather complimenting a grandson. Adric also appears in the Past Doctor Adventures novel Divided Loyalties, which pits the Doctor against his old foe the Celestial Toymaker. Adric's image also appears as a manifestation of the Doctor's guilt in the Virgin New Adventures novel Timewyrm: Revelation by Paul Cornell, and a ghost of Adric features in the novel Empire of Death by David Bishop./nAdric appears in the Big Finish Productions audio drama The Boy That Time Forgot, portrayed by Andrew Sachs. In the story, he is unintentionally saved by Block Transfer Computations subconsciously sent to him by the Doctor during a 'seance'; this caused him to be sent into a pocket dimension, based on an Aztec jungle and populated primarily by giant scorpions and insects. Kept alive for centuries by the computations, Adric is eventually reunited with the Doctor and Nyssa when they seek the TARDIS after its theft by Thomas Brewster (\"The Haunting of Thomas Brewster\"). Driven insane by centuries of isolation and bitterness, Adric refuses to accept the Doctor's opinion that he is now essentially just an elderly teenager having tantrums when he doesn't get his way, and attempts to force Nyssa to become his bride. The Doctor admits that he permitted Adric to die, only for Adric to forgive him and use the last of his strength to send his friends home and recover the TARDIS, before dying himself./nIn the IDW Publishing comic Doctor Who: The Forgotten by Tony Lee, a manifestation of Adric appears in the TARDIS Matrix, saving the Tenth Doctor's life and, in the process, dying a second time. This time, however, Adric is aware of his sacrifice, stating that \"it's not a pointless death\"./nAdric appears in Magic: the Gathering's Universes Beyond: Doctor Who as \"Adric, Mathematical Genius.\" He is identified as a human, and the card references his \"ultimate sacrifice.\"[5]/nA vision of Adric is seen, along with every other companion aside from Leela, on the scanner screen in Resurrection of the Daleks.[6]/nAdric's death is discussed between an older Tegan and a hologram projection of the Fifth Doctor in \"The Power of the Doctor\" after the former is reunited with the Cybermen./nAdric's death is mentioned by the Fifteenth Doctor in the 60th Anniversary Specials as he and the Fourteenth Doctor discuss Fourteen retiring./nDuring the production of Doctor Who's eighteenth season it became clear that Romana (Lalla Ward) and K9 would be leaving the series and that Tom Baker would depart his role as the Doctor at the conclusion of the season. To give viewers a sense of continuity it was decided that new companions should be introduced during the series, with the first, Adric being added as early as possible so he would be well established by the season's climax.[7] He was described as a \"cosmic Artful Dodger\" by producer John Nathan-Turner who intended him to be \"a roguish roughneck\", whose charm would offset the criminal tendencies which emerged from his upbringing. However Waterhouse later noted that the Adric was written differently in each story and thus the character suffered from a lack of development.[8]/nUnimpressed by Waterhouse's acting ability, Tom Baker suggested that, \"Because of his amazing appearance, Matthew should have played Adric like Sabu \u2013 a little wild boy who couldn't speak. I would talk to him rather like Basil Fawlty talks to Manuel, and he'd just nod or shake his head. But John [Nathan-Turner] didn't like that idea.\"[9] Andrew Sachs, who played Manuel, would later portray Adric in a single story for Big Finish Productions.", "45112397": "Anna Katharina Wienhard (born 1977)[1] is a German mathematician whose research concerns differential geometry, and especially the use of higher Teichm\u00fcller spaces to study the deformation theory of symmetric geometric structures.[1] She is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences.[2]/nWienhard did her undergraduate studies at the University of Bonn, earning a double degree in theology and mathematics.[1] Continuing at Bonn, she earned a doctorate in 2004 under the joint supervision of Hans Werner Ballmann and Marc Burger.[3]/nAfter holding temporary positions at the University of Basel, Institute for Advanced Study, and University of Chicago, she took a faculty position at Princeton University in 2007.

While working on his D.Phil. in computational and engineering mathematics under the supervision of Sir Richard Southwell he was also engaged in highly secret war work. He worked on the numerical solution of partial differential equations at a time when numerical linear algebra was performed on a desk calculator. Computational efficiency and accuracy was thus even more important than in the days of electronic computers.  Some of this work was published after the end of the Second World War jointly with his supervisor Richard Southwell./nOn gaining his doctorate in 1942, Fox joined the Admiralty Computing service. Following World War II in 1945, he went to work in the mathematics division of the National Physical Laboratory. He left the National Physical Laboratory in 1956 and spent a year at the University of California. In 1957 Fox took up an appointment at Oxford University where he set up the Oxford University Computing Laboratory. In 1963, Fox was appointed as Professor of Numerical Analysis at Oxford and Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford./nFox's laboratory at Oxford was one of the founding organisations of the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG), and Fox was also a dedicated supporter of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA). The Leslie Fox Prize for Numerical Analysis of the IMA is named in his honour./nA detailed description of Fox's mathematical research can be found in obituaries[1]\n[2] and is summarised here. His early work with Southwell was concerned with the numerical solution of partial differential equations arising in engineering problems that, due to the complexity of their geometry, did not have analytical solutions. Southwell's group developed efficient and accurate relaxation methods, which could be implemented on desk calculators. Fox's contributions were particularly notable because he combined practical skills with theoretical advances in relaxation methods,[3] which were to become important areas of research in numerical analysis. During the 1950 automatic electronic computers were replacing manual electro-mechanical devices. This led to different problems in the implementation of numerical algorithms; however, the approach of approximating a partial differential equation by finite difference method and thus reducing the problem to a system of linear equations was the same. Careful analysis of the errors was a theme of many of Fox's early papers. His work at the Admiralty Computing Service and the National Physical Laboratory led to an interest in the computation of special functions, and his calculations were used in published tables. The techniques applied to the computation of special functions had much wider applicability including interpolation, stability of recurrence relations and asymptotic behaviour./nDuring the 1950s, the group at the National Physics Laboratory worked on numerical linear algebra, which led to the publication of algorithms by Wilkinson and others. While not directly involved in development of numerical software, he supported others in this endeavour. Fox worked on procedures for solving differential equations in which the accuracy of the solution is estimated using asymptotic estimates. Fox's paper on this in 1947[4] led to the work of Victor Pereyra error-correcting algorithms for boundary-value problems and Stetter's results on defect correction and the resulting order of convergence./nFox was also interested in the treatment of singularities in partial differential equations, the Stefan problem and other cases of free and moving boundaries. Many of these problems arose from his collaboration with mathematicians in industry through the Oxford Study Groups./nWhile Fox influenced the development of numerical analysis through his undergraduate teaching and postgraduate supervision (he supervised around 19 doctoral students), industrial collaboration he also made significant contributions to course material for the Open University. He lectured widely on 'meaningless answers', describing some of the pitfalls of numerical computation from the uncritical use of simple methods/nFox played a significant part in the early days of the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG), which set out as a collaborative venture between Oxford, Nottingham and Manchester to provide a reliable and well-tested mathematical subroutine library. The Oxford University Computing Laboratory was one of the founder members of NAG when it started in 1970; Fox supported it strongly and he became a member of its council when the Group was incorporated in 1976 continuing in this capacity until 1984./nFox was an active member of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications from its beginnings, as a member of the Council and as an editor first of the main IMA Journal and later the specialised Journal of Numerical Analysis, started in 1981. The IMA marked his retirement from Oxford in 1983 by a special IMA symposium on 'The contributions of Leslie Fox to numerical analysis'./nHis interests extended to mathematics in schools and he participated the development of the School Mathematics Project, and was active in the local branch of the Mathematical Association, of which he was President in 1964. The first winner of the IMA's Leslie Fox prize for Numerical Analysis in 1985, Lloyd N. Trefethen, went on to be appointed to the chair in Numerical Analysis at Oxford that was created for Leslie Fox in 1963./nLeslie Fox's mother was Annie Vincent and his father was Job Senior Fox who was a coalminer.[citation needed] Leslie Fox won a scholarship to Wheelwright Grammar School in Dewsbury, which produced several notable scientists from the same period as Fox.[citation needed]/nFox was a keen sportsman and played football for the university Football Club as well as for Oxford City Football Club. At the National Physical Laboratory he was club tennis champion and captain of the cricket team, he also distinguished himself as a sprinter in the civil service championships.[citation needed]/nFox, who had enjoyed good health up to 1981, suffered from heart problems during his retirement and died from a ruptured aneurysm in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, in 1992.[citation needed]", "23747676": "Roger Joseph Boscovich SJ (Croatian: Ru\u0111er Josip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107; pronounced [r\u00fbd\u0361\u0291er j\u01d2sip b\u00f4\u0283ko\u028bit\u0361\u0255]; Italian: Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich;[2] Latin: Rogerius (Iosephus) Boscovicius;[3] 18 May 1711\u00a0\u2013 13 February 1787) was a physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian, Jesuit priest, and a polymath from the Republic of Ragusa.[4] He studied and lived in Italy and France where he also published many of his works.[5]/nBoscovich produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy, including the first geometric procedure for determining the equator of a rotating planet from three observations of a surface feature and for computing the orbit of a planet from three observations of its position. In 1753 he also discovered the absence of an atmosphere on the Moon.[6]/nBoscovich was born on 18 May 1711 in Dubrovnik,  Republic of Ragusa, to Paola Bettera (1674\u20131777), daughter of a local nobleman of Italian origin, and Nikola Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, a Ragusan merchant. Boscovich's father was most likely an ethnic Croat.[7] He was baptised on 26 May 1711 by Marinus Carolis, curatus et sacristia. The name Ru\u0111er/Ruggiero may have been given to him because both his maternal great-grandfather, Agostino Bettera, and his mother's brother were called Ruggiero; his godfather was his uncle, Ruggiero Bettera. He was the seventh child of the family and the second youngest. His father was born in the village of Orahov Do near Ravno, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina).[8][9]/nHis uncle, Don Ilija Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, was killed by Uskok bandits while celebrating Mass in 1692.[10] While his father, Nikola, had once been a prolific trader who traveled through the Ottoman Empire, Ru\u0111er only knew him  as a bedridden invalid; he died when his son was 10 years old. Boscovich's mother Paola, nicknamed \"Pavica\", was a member of a cultivated Italian merchant family established in Dubrovnik since the early 17th century, when her ancestor, Pietro Bettera, settled from Bergamo in northern Italy. She was described as a robust and active woman with a happy temperament who lived to 103.[5]/nPaola Bettera Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 left nothing in writing but her sister wrote poetry in Italian. Ru\u0111er's cousins and playmates, Antun Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and Franjo Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, grew up into good Latinists. His brothers and sisters were all older than himself, except his sister Anica Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (1714\u20131804), two years his junior. His eldest sister, Mare Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, nineteen years his senior, was the only member of the family to marry. His second sister, Marija Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, became a nun in the Ragusa Convent of St Catherine. His eldest brother, Bo\u017eo Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 (Bo\u0161ko, called Natale by Roger in private correspondence[11]), thirteen years older, joined the service of the Ragusa Republic. Another brother, Bartolomej Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, born in 1700 and educated at the Jesuit school in Dubrovnik, left home when Ru\u0111er was 3 to become a scholar and a Jesuit priest in Rome. He also wrote verse in both Latin and \"Illyrian\" (the Renaissance era name for Serbo-Croatian), but eventually burnt some of his manuscripts out of a scrupulous modesty. Another brother, Ivan (\u0110ivo) Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, became a Dominican in a sixteenth-century monastery in Dubrovnik, whose church Ru\u0111er knew as a child with its rich treasures and paintings by Titian and Vasari, still there today. Another brother, Petar (Pero) Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, six years his senior, became a poet like his grandfather. He was schooled by the Jesuits, then served as an official of the Republic and made his reputation as a translator of Ovid, Corneille's Cid, and of Moli\u00e8re. A volume of his religious verse, Hvale Duhovne, was published in Venice in 1729./nAt the age of 8 or 9, after acquiring the rudiments of reading and writing from Father Nicola Nicchei of the Church of St Nicholas, Ru\u0111er was sent for schooling to the local Jesuit Collegium Ragusinum. During his early studies, Boscovich showed a distinct propensity for further intellectual development. He gained a reputation at school for having an easy memory and a quick, deep mind./nOn 16 September 1725, Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 left Dubrovnik for Rome. He was in the care of two Jesuit priests who took him to the Society of Jesus, famous for its education of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. We learn nothing from Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the Collegium Romanum but in Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.[8]/nHe was especially appropriate for this post due to his acquaintance with recent advances in science, and his skill in a classical severity of demonstration, acquired by a thorough study of the works of the Greek geometers. Several years before this appointment he had made a name for himself with an elegant solution of the problem of finding the Sun's equator and determining the period of its rotation by observation of the spots on its surface./nNotwithstanding the arduous duties of his professorship, he found time for investigation in various fields of physical science, and he published a very large number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometer , and various problems of spherical trigonometry.[citation needed]/nIn 1742, he was consulted, with other men of science, by Pope Benedict XIV, as to the best means of securing the stability of the dome of St. Peter's, Rome, in which a crack had been discovered. His suggestion of placing five concentric iron bands was adopted./nIn 1744, he was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood.[12]/nIn 1745, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 published De Viribus Vivis in which he tried to find a middle way between Isaac Newton's gravitational theory and Gottfried Leibniz's metaphysical theory of monad-points. He developed a concept of \"impenetrability\" as a property of hard bodies which explained their behaviour in terms of force rather than matter. Stripping atoms of their matter, impenetrability is disassociated from hardness and then put in an arbitrary relationship to elasticity. Impenetrability has a Cartesian sense that more than one point cannot occupy the same location at once.[13]/nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 visited his hometown only once, in 1747, never to return. He agreed to take part in the Portuguese expedition for the survey of Brazil and the arc measurement of a degree of latitude (meridian arc), but was persuaded by the Pope to stay in Italy and to undertake a similar task there with Christopher Maire, an English Jesuit who measured an arc of two degrees between Rome and Rimini. The operation began at the end of 1750, and was completed in about two years. An account was published in 1755, under the name De Litteraria expeditione per pontificiam ditionem ad dimetiendos duos meridiani gradus a PP. Maire et Boscovicli. The value of this work was increased by a carefully prepared map of the States of the Church. A French translation appeared in 1770 which incorporated, as an appendix, some material first published in 1760 outlining an objective procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters of the fitted model from a greater number of observations. An unconstrained variant of this fitting procedure is now known as the L1-norm or Least absolute deviations procedure and serves as a robust alternative to the familiar L2-norm or Least Squares procedure./nA dispute arose between Francis the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Republic of Lucca with respect to the drainage of a lake. As agent of Lucca, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was sent, in 1757, to Vienna and succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory arrangement in the matter./nIn Vienna in 1758, he published the first edition of his famous work, Philosophi\u00e6 naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium (Theory of Natural philosophy derived to the single Law of forces which exist in Nature), containing his atomic theory and his theory of forces.[14]/nA second edition was published in 1763 in Venice and a third again in Vienna in 1764. In 1922, it was published in London, and in 1966, in the United States. Another edition was published in Zagreb in 1974./nAnother occasion to exercise his diplomatic ability soon arose. The British government suspected that warships had been fitted out in Dubrovnik for the service of France, and that therefore the neutrality of the republic had been violated. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was selected to undertake an ambassadorship to London in 1760, to convince the British that nothing of the sort had occurred and provide proof of Ragusa's neutrality. This mission proved to be a complete success \u2013 a credit to him and a delight to his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society./nIn 1761, astronomers were preparing to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. Under the influence of the Royal Society, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 decided to travel to Constantinople. He arrived late and then travelled to Poland via Bulgaria and Moldavia then proceeding to Saint Petersburg where he was elected as a member of Russian Academy of Sciences. Ill health compelled him soon to return to Italy./nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 visited Laibach, the capital of Carniola (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), at least in 1757, 1758, and 1763, and made contact with the Jesuits and the Franciscan friars in the town. The Jesuits incorporated his teachings into their lectures at the Laibach Jesuit College. His physics became the foundation of physical lectures as well in other parts of the Habsburg monarchy, and influenced the thought of, among others, Gabriel Gruber and Jurij Vega, prominent physicists of the period. Both Vega and the Rationalist philosopher Franz Samuel Karpe educated their students in Vienna about the ideas of Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 and in the spirit of his thought.[15]/nIn 1764, he was called to serve as the chair of mathematics at the University of Pavia, and for six years he held this post with the directorship of the observatory of Brera in Milan, That is where Charles Burney met him; since Burney's Italian was not very good at that time, Boscovich obliged him speaking French./nHe was invited by the Royal Society of London to undertake an expedition to California to observe the transit of Venus in 1769 again, but this was prevented by the recent decree of the Spanish government expelling Jesuits from its dominions. Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 had many enemies and he was driven to frequent changes of residence. About 1777, he returned to Milan, where continued to teach and direct and the Brera observatory./nDeprived of his post by the intrigues of his associates, he was about to retire to Dubrovnik when in 1773, the news of the suppression of his order in Italy reached him. Uncertainty led him to accept an invitation from the King of France to come to Paris where he was appointed director of optics for the navy, with a pension of 8,000  livres and a position was created for him./nHe naturalised in France and stayed ten years, but his position became irksome, and at length intolerable. He, however, continued to work in the pursuit of science knowledge, and published many remarkable works. Among them was an elegant solution of the problem to determine the orbit of a comet from three observations, and works on micrometer and achromatic telescopes./nIn 1782, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was one of the founders of the Accademia nazionale delle scienze detta dei XL (National Association of the Sciences), with the name of \"Societ\u00e0 Italiana\" (Italian Association): this learned society gathered forty members representing the most important Italian scientists of the period.[16]/nIn 1783, he returned to Italy and spent two years at Bassano, occupying himself with the publication of his Opera pertinentia ad opticam et astronomiam, etc., published in 1785 in five volumes quarto./nAfter a visit of some months to the convent of Vallombrosa, he went to Brera in 1786 and resumed his work. At that time his health was failing, his reputation was on the wane, his works did not sell, and he gradually fell prey to illness and disappointment. He died in Milan and was buried in the church of St. Maria Podone./nIn philosophy and physics, Laplace's demon is a thought experiment supporting the concept of determinism.  It suggests that if someone (the Demon) knew the precise location and momentum of every particle in the universe, he could in principle calculate the history and future of every particle./nWhile Laplace's version of determinism is based on general terms, Boscovich's uses physical terms, like position, velocity, direction and centre of mass. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with Leibniz's metaphysics.[17]/nKnowing with complete accuracy both the location and velocity of a particle violates the uncertainty principle of modern quantum mechanics, so it is unclear if this is physically possible./nIn addition to the works already mentioned Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 published course material he had prepared for his pupils in mathematics.[18][19] He also published accounts of his travels from Constantinople to Poland,[20] in several expanded editions[21] and translated into French.[22]/nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 applied himself to practical engineering projects, including several discussions of architectural repair or stability, including repairs to St Peter's Dome,[23][24] the stability of the Duomo of Milan,[25] repairs to the library of Cesarea di Vienna,[26] and a report on the damage to sectors of Rome in June 1749 due to a whirlwind.[27]/nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 was also consulted on civil works concerning ports and rivers: Ivica Martinovic[28] has shown the extent to which Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 applied himself to such works, and lists 13 major works:/nMartinovic's paper[28] includes an extensive annotated bibliography on such works./nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 was a Roman Catholic priest, and in expressing his religious views was straightforward. In his most famous book A Theory of Natural Philosophy (1758) he says: \"Regarding the nature of the Divine Creator, my theory is extraordinarily illuminating, and the result from it is a necessity to recognize Him.\u00a0... Therefore vain dreams of those who believe that the world was created by accident, or that it could be built as a fatal necessity, or that it was there for eternity lining itself along his own necessary laws are completely eliminated.\"[29]/nBo\u0161kovi\u0107 also composed poetry with many religious and astronomical allusions. In his Marian devotion, he wrote hexameter verses on the Virgin Mary.[30]/nIn the same dome of St. Peter in Rome, whose cupola he saved from ruin, he worked as a confessor administering the Sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation./nIn 1873, Nietzsche wrote a fragment called 'Time Atom Theory', which was a reworking of Boscovich's Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium. In general, Boscovich's ideas were a large influence on Nietzsche's ideas of force and the will to power.[31][32]/nIn the 1930s, by Werner Heisenberg nicknamed Boscovich the Croatian Leibniz.[33] In 1935, a lunar crater \u2013 the Boscovich crater \u2013 was named after him for his contributions to astronomy. The largest Croatian institute of natural sciences and technology, based in Zagreb, is called \"Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute\" since 1950.

For this reason the attribution of a definite \"nationality\" to personalities of the previous centuries, living in ethnically mixed regions, is often indeterminable; Bo\u0161kovi\u0107's legacy is consequently celebrated in Croatia, Italy and Serbia.[8] His ethnicity is also part of the Serb-Croat distinctions in self-identification of the Western South Slavic enlighteners, that was one of the major problems in 20th century Yugoslavia.[38]/nA number of sources state that he referred to his Croatian identity.[39] In writings to his sister Anica (Anna), he told her he had not forgotten the Croatian language.[39] In a letter to his brother from 1757, he describes the encounter with Croatian soldiers in Vienna and remarks at the end of the letter: \"Eviva Haddick e i nostri Croati!\" (\"Long life to Hadik and to our Croats!\").[40] While living in Paris and attending to a military parade where he saw a Croatian unit from Ragusa, his words were: \"there are my brave Croats\".[41]/nItalian sources claim that Boscovich was remembered as an Italian. According to Italian sources, he was born in a city with mixed cultures, Croatian and Italian, and the higher social strata of Dubrovnik were under Italian influence (Roman-Dalmatian influence). His mother's family came from Italy, and his life and career had strong Italian influences. He moved to Italy at age 14, where he spent most of his life. In some encyclopaedias he is described as an Italian scientist. He used the Italian language in private, including in correspondence with his brother Baro,[42] and Voltaire wrote to Boscovich in Italian \"as a sign of respect\"./nThe Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts ranks him among the 100 most prominent Serbs,[43][44] According to one source, branches of the brotherhood are said to have settled the surroundings of Stolac.[45] A number of sources claim that Boscovich is a Serbian scientist or state that he is of Serbian paternal origin.[46]/nBoscovich himself was proud of his Dalmatian identity. When d'Alembert in his Opuscule math\u00e9matiques... called him \"an Italian mathematician\",[47] he shot back that he was \"a Dalmatian from Dubrovnik, and not an Italian\".[41] However, he added that he had been living in Italy for a long time since his first youth, so \"he can in some way be called Italian\".[48][49]/nBoscovich published eight scientific dissertations prior to his 1744 ordination as a priest and appointment as a professor and another 14 afterwards.

All high school and college students from around the world with advanced background of mathematics are encouraged to participate. Older participants are welcomed to participate as mentors and encouraged not to post solutions to the problems.

The first thread, which was carried out in the comments of Gowers's blog, would continue with the original goal of finding a combinatorial proof.  The second thread, which was carried out in the comments of Terence Tao's blog, focused on calculating bounds on density of Hales\u2013Jewett numbers and Moser numbers for low dimensions./nAfter seven weeks, Gowers announced on his blog that the problem was \"probably solved\",[7] though work would continue on both Gowers's thread and Tao's thread well into May 2009, some three months after the initial announcement.

He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. He has been described as one of The Martians.[1]/nBorn in Hungary into a Jewish family, Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated.

According to a different version, his father was a melamed, at a primary religious school (kheder), and that the family was of modest means: according to the same source, Zalman was the youngest of five children.[citation needed] His first wife was Victoria Isaevna Libina: Mikhlin's book (Mikhlin 1965) is dedicated to her memory. She died of peritonitis in 1961 during a boat trip on Volga. In 1940 they adopted a son, Grigory Zalmanovich Mikhlin, who later emigrated to  Haifa, Israel. His second wife was Eugenia Yakovlevna Rubinova, born in 1918, who was his companion for the rest of his life./nHe graduated from a secondary school in Gomel in 1923 and entered the State Herzen Pedagogical Institute in 1925.[citation needed] In 1927 he was transferred to the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Leningrad State University as a second year student, passing all the exams of the first year without attending lectures.[citation needed] Among his university professors there were Nikolai Maximovich G\u00fcnther and Vladimir Ivanovich Smirnov. The latter became his master thesis supervisor: the topic of the thesis was the convergence of double series,[3] and was defended in 1929. Sergei Lvovich Sobolev studied in the same class as Mikhlin. In 1930 he started his teaching career, working in some Leningrad institutes for short periods, as Mikhlin himself records on the document (Mikhlin 1968). In 1932 he got a position at the Seismological Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where he worked till 1941: in 1935 he got the degree \"Doktor nauk\" in Mathematics and Physics, without having to earn the \"kandidat nauk\" degree, and finally in 1937 he was promoted to the rank of professor. During World War II he became professor at the  Kazakh University in Alma Ata. Since 1944 S.G. Mikhlin has been professor at the Leningrad State University. From 1964 to 1986 he headed the Laboratory of Numerical Methods at the Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the same university: since 1986 until his death he was a senior researcher at that laboratory./nHe received the order of the Badge of Honour (Russian: \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043a \u041f\u043e\u0447\u0451\u0442\u0430) in 1961:[4] the name of the recipients of this prize was usually published in newspapers. He was awarded of the Laurea honoris causa by the Karl-Marx-Stadt (now Chemnitz) Polytechnic in 1968 and was elected member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in 1970 and of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1981. As Fichera (1994, p.\u00a051) states, in his country he did not receive honours comparable to his scientific stature, mainly because of the racial policy of the communist regime, briefly described in the following section./nHe lived in one of the most difficult periods of contemporary Russian history. The state of mathematical sciences during this period is well described by Lorentz (2002): marxist ideology rise in the USSR universities and Academia was one of the main themes of that period. Local administrators and communist party functionaries interfered with scientists on either ethnical or ideological grounds.  As a matter of fact, during the war and during the creation of a new academic system, Mikhlin did not experience the same difficulties as younger Soviet scientists of Jewish origin: for example he was included in the Soviet delegation in 1958, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh.[5] However, Fichera (1994, pp.\u00a056\u201360), examining the life of Mikhlin, finds it surprisingly similar to the life of Vito Volterra under the fascist regime. He notes that antisemitism in communist countries took different forms compared to his nazist counterpart: the communist regime aimed not to the brutal homicide of Jews, but imposed on them a number of constrictions, sometimes very cruel, in order to make their life difficult. During the period from 1963 to 1981, he met Mikhlin attending several conferences in the Soviet Union, and realised how he was in a state of isolation, almost marginalized inside his native community: Fichera describes several episodes revealing this fact.[6] Perhaps, the most illuminating one is the election of Mikhlin as a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei: in June 1981, Solomon G. Mikhlin was elected Foreign Member of the class of mathematical and physical sciences of the Lincei. At first time, he was proposed as a winner of the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize, but the almost sure confiscation of the prize by the Soviet authorities induced the Lincei members to elect him as a member: they decided to honour him in a way that no political authority could alienate.[7] However, Mikhlin was not allowed to visit Italy by the Soviet authorities,[8] so Fichera and his wife brought the tiny golden lynx, the symbol of the Lincei membership, directly to Mikhlin's apartment in Leningrad on 17 October 1981: the only guests to that \"ceremony\" were Vladimir Maz'ya and his wife Tatyana Shaposhnikova./nThey just have power, but we have theorems. Therefore we are stronger!/nAccording to Fichera (1994, pp.\u00a060\u201361), which refers a conversation with Mark Vishik and Olga Oleinik, on 29 August 1990 Mikhlin left home to buy medicines for his wife Eugenia. On a public transport, he suffered a lethal stroke. He had no documents with him, therefore he was identified only some time after his death: this may be the cause of the difference in the death date reported on several biographies and obituary notices.[9] Fichera also writes that Mikhlin's wife Eugenia survived him only a few months./nHe was author of monographs and textbooks which become classics for their style. His research is devoted mainly to the following fields.[10]/nIn mathematical elasticity theory, Mikhlin was concerned by three themes: the plane problem (mainly from 1932 to 1935), the theory of shells (from 1954) and the Cosserat spectrum (from 1967 to 1973).[11] Dealing with the plane elasticity problem, he proposed two methods for its solution in multiply connected domains. The first one is based upon the so-called complex Green's function and the reduction of the related boundary value problem to integral equations. The second method is a certain generalization of the classical Schwarz algorithm for the solution of the Dirichlet problem in a given domain by splitting it in simpler problems in smaller domains whose union is the original one. Mikhlin studied its convergence and gave applications to special applied problems. He proved existence theorems for the fundamental problems of plane elasticity involving inhomogeneous anisotropic media: these results are collected in the book (Mikhlin 1957). Concerning the theory of shells, there are several Mikhlin's articles dealing with it. He studied the error of the approximate solution for shells, similar to plane plates, and found out that this error is small for the so-called purely rotational state of stress. As a result of his study of this problem, Mikhlin also gave a new (invariant) form of the basic equations of the theory. He also proved a theorem on perturbations of positive operators in a Hilbert space which let him to obtain an error estimate for the problem of approximating a sloping shell by a plane plate.[12] Mikhlin studied also the spectrum of the operator pencil of the classical linear elastostatic operator or Navier\u2013Cauchy operator/nwhere \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n is the displacement vector, \n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\Delta _{2}}\n\n is the vector laplacian, \n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\nabla }\n\n is the gradient, \n\n\n\n\n\u2207\n\u22c5\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\nabla \\cdot }\n\n is the divergence and \n\n\n\n\u03c9\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\omega }\n\n is a Cosserat eigenvalue. The full description of the spectrum and the proof of the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions are also due to Mikhlin, and partly to V.G. Maz'ya in their only joint work.[13]/nHe is one of the founders of the multi-dimensional theory of singular integrals, jointly with Francesco Tricomi and Georges Giraud, and also one of the main contributors. By singular integral we mean an integral operator of the following form/nwhere \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n\u2208\u211dn is a point in the n-dimensional euclidean space, \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n=|\n\n\n\ny\n\u2212\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y-x}\n\n| and  \n\n\n\n\n\n\u03b8\n\n=\n\n\n\n\ny\n\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\boldsymbol {\\theta }}={\\frac {{\\boldsymbol {y}}-{\\boldsymbol {x}}}{r}}}\n\n are the hyperspherical coordinates (or the polar coordinates or the spherical coordinates respectively when \n\n\n\nn\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=2}\n\n or \n\n\n\nn\n=\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=3}\n\n) of the point \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n with respect to the point \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n. Such operators are called singular since the singularity of the kernel of the operator is so strong that the integral does not exist in the ordinary sense, but only in the sense of Cauchy principal value.[14] Mikhlin was the first to develop a theory of singular integral equations as a theory of operator equations in function spaces. In the papers (Mikhlin 1936a) and (Mikhlin 1936b) he found a rule for the composition of double singular integrals (i.e. in 2-dimensional euclidean spaces) and introduced the very important notion of symbol of a singular integral. This enabled him to show that the algebra of bounded singular integral operators is isomorphic to the algebra of either scalar or matrix-valued functions. He proved the Fredholm's theorems for singular integral equations and systems of such equations under the hypothesis of non-degeneracy of the symbol: he also proved that the index of a single singular integral equation in the euclidean space is zero. In 1961  Mikhlin developed a theory of multidimensional singular integral equations on Lipschitz spaces. These spaces are widely used in the theory of one-dimensional singular integral equations: however, the direct extension of the related theory to the multidimensional case meets some technical difficulties, and Mikhlin suggested another approach to this problem. Precisely, he obtained the basic properties of this kind of singular integral equations as a by-product of the  Lp-space theory of these equations. Mikhlin also proved[15] a now classical theorem on multipliers of Fourier transform in the Lp-space, based on an analogous theorem of J\u00f3zef Marcinkiewicz on Fourier series. A complete collection of his results in this field up to the 1965, as well as the contributions of other mathematicians like Tricomi, Giraud, Calder\u00f3n and Zygmund,[16] is contained in the monograph (Mikhlin 1965).[17]/nA synthesis of the theories of singular integrals and linear partial differential operators was accomplished, in the mid sixties of the 20th century, by the theory of pseudodifferential operators: Joseph J. Kohn, Louis Nirenberg, Lars H\u00f6rmander and others operated this synthesis, but this theory owe his rise to the discoveries of Mikhlin, as is universally acknowledged.[2] This theory has numerous applications to mathematical physics. Mikhlin's multiplier theorem is widely used in different branches of mathematical analysis, particularly to the theory of differential equations. The analysis of Fourier multipliers was later forwarded by Lars H\u00f6rmander, Walter Littman, Elias Stein, Charles Fefferman and others./nIn four papers, published in the period 1940\u20131942, Mikhlin applies the potentials method to the mixed problem for the wave equation. In particular, he solves the mixed problem for the two-space dimensional wave equation in the half plane by reducing it to the planar Abel integral equation. For plane domains with a sufficiently smooth curvilinear boundary he reduces the problem to an integro-differential equation, which he is also able to solve when the boundary of the given domain is analytic. In 1951 Mikhlin proved the convergence of the Schwarz alternating method for second order elliptic equations.[18] He also applied the methods of functional analysis, at the same time as Mark Vishik but independently of him, to the investigation of boundary value problems for degenerate second order elliptic partial differential equations./nHis work in this field can be divided into several branches:[19] in the following text, four main branches are described, and a sketch of his last researches is also given. The papers within the first branch are summarized in the monograph (Mikhlin 1964), which contain the study of convergence of variational methods for problems connected with positive operators, in particular, for some problems of mathematical physics. Both \"a priori\" and \"a posteriori\" estimates of the errors concerning the approximation given by these methods are proved. The second branch deals with the notion of stability of a numerical process introduced by Mikhlin himself. When applied to the variational method, this notion enables him to state necessary and sufficient conditions in order to minimize errors in the solution of the given problem when the error arising in the numerical construction of the algebraic system resulting from the application of the method itself is sufficiently small, no matter how large is the system's order. The third branch is the study of variational-difference and finite element methods. Mikhlin studied the completeness of the coordinate functions used in this methods in the Sobolev space W1,p, deriving the order of approximation as a function of the smoothness properties of the functions to be approximation of functions approximated. He also characterized the class of coordinate functions which give the best order of approximation, and has studied the stability of the variational-difference process and the growth of the condition number of the variation-difference matrix. Mikhlin also studied the finite element approximation in weighted Sobolev spaces related to the numerical solution of degenerate elliptic equations. He found the optimal order of approximation for some methods of solution of variational inequalities. The fourth branch of his research in numerical mathematics is a method for the solution of Fredholm integral equations which he called resolvent method: its essence rely on the possibility of substituting the kernel of the integral operator by its variational-difference approximation, so that the  resolvent of the new kernel can be expressed by simple recurrence relations. This eliminates the need to construct and solve large systems of equations.[20] During his last years, Mikhlin contributed to the theory of errors in numerical processes,[21] proposing the following classification of errors./nThis classification is useful since enables one to develop computational methods adjusted in order to diminish the errors of each particular type, following the divide et impera (divide and rule) principle./nHe was the \"kandidat nauk\" advisor of Tatyana O. Shaposhnikova. He was also mentor and friend of Vladimir Maz'ya: he was never his official supervisor, but his friendship with the young undergraduate Maz'ya had a great influence on shaping his mathematical style.", "8477832": "Sibt al-Maridini, full name Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn A\u1e25mad Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Badr [Shams] al\u2010D\u012bnal\u2010Mi\u1e63r\u012b al\u2010Dimashq\u012b (1423 \u2013 1506 AD), was an Egyptian-born[citation needed] astronomer and mathematician.

His doctorate was awarded at the University of G\u00f6ttingen under the supervision of David Hilbert, whom he greatly admired./nIn September 1913, in G\u00f6ttingen, Weyl married Friederike Bertha Helene Joseph (March 30, 1893[10] \u2013 September 5, 1948[11]) who went by the name Helene (nickname \"Hella\"). Helene was a daughter of Dr. Bruno Joseph (December 13, 1861 \u2013 June 10, 1934), a physician who held the position of Sanit\u00e4tsrat in Ribnitz-Damgarten, Germany. Helene was a philosopher (she was a disciple of phenomenologist Edmund Husserl) and a translator of Spanish literature into German and English (especially the works of Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset).[12]  It was through Helene's close connection with Husserl that Hermann became familiar with (and greatly influenced by) Husserl's thought. Hermann and Helene had two sons, Fritz Joachim Weyl (February 19, 1915 \u2013 July 20, 1977) and Michael Weyl (September 15, 1917 \u2013 March 19, 2011),[13] both of whom were born in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland.

Einstein had a lasting influence on Weyl, who became fascinated by mathematical physics. In 1921, Weyl met Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, a theoretical physicist who at the time was a professor at the University of Z\u00fcrich. They were to become close friends over time.  Weyl had some sort of childless love affair with Schr\u00f6dinger's wife Annemarie (Anny) Schr\u00f6dinger (n\u00e9e Bertel), while at the same time Anny was helping raise an illegitimate daughter of Erwin's named Ruth Georgie Erica March, who was born in 1934 in Oxford, England.[18][19]/nWeyl was a Plenary Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1928 at Bologna[20] and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1936 at Oslo.

Robertson.[26]/nWeyl left Z\u00fcrich in 1930 to become Hilbert's successor at G\u00f6ttingen, leaving when the Nazis assumed power in 1933, particularly as his wife was Jewish. He had been offered one of the first faculty positions at the new Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, but had declined because he did not desire to leave his homeland. As the political situation in Germany grew worse, he changed his mind and accepted when offered the position again. He remained there until his retirement in 1951. Together with his second wife Ellen, he spent his time in Princeton and Z\u00fcrich, and died from a heart attack on December 8, 1955, while living in Z\u00fcrich./nWeyl was cremated in Z\u00fcrich on December 12, 1955.[27] His ashes remained in private hands[unreliable source?] until 1999, at which time they were interred in an outdoor columbarium vault in the Princeton Cemetery.[28] The remains of Hermann's son Michael Weyl (1917\u20132011) are interred right next to Hermann's ashes in the same columbarium vault./nWeyl was a pantheist.[29]/nIn 1911 Weyl published \u00dcber die asymptotische Verteilung der Eigenwerte (On the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues) in which he proved that the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the compact domain are distributed according to the so-called Weyl law. In 1912 he suggested a new proof, based on variational principles. Weyl returned to this topic several times, considered elasticity system and formulated the Weyl conjecture. These works started an important domain\u2014asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues\u2014of modern analysis./nIn 1913, Weyl published Die Idee der Riemannschen Fl\u00e4che (The Concept of a Riemann Surface), which gave a unified treatment of Riemann surfaces. In it Weyl utilized point set topology, in order to make Riemann surface theory more rigorous, a model followed in later work on manifolds. He absorbed L. E. J. Brouwer's early work in topology for this purpose./nWeyl, as a major figure in the G\u00f6ttingen school, was fully apprised of Einstein's work from its early days. He tracked the development of relativity physics in his Raum, Zeit, Materie (Space, Time, Matter) from 1918, reaching a 4th edition in 1922. In 1918, he introduced the notion of gauge, and gave the first example of what is now known as a gauge theory. Weyl's gauge theory was an unsuccessful attempt to model the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field as geometrical properties of spacetime. The Weyl tensor in Riemannian geometry is of major importance in understanding the nature of conformal geometry.  In 1929, Weyl introduced the concept of the vierbein into general relativity.[30]/nHis overall approach in physics was based on the phenomenological philosophy of Edmund Husserl, specifically Husserl's 1913 Ideen zu einer reinen Ph\u00e4nomenologie und ph\u00e4nomenologischen Philosophie. Erstes Buch: Allgemeine Einf\u00fchrung in die reine Ph\u00e4nomenologie  (Ideas of a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy. First Book: General Introduction). Husserl had reacted strongly to Gottlob Frege's criticism of his first work on the philosophy of arithmetic and was investigating the sense of mathematical and other structures, which Frege had distinguished from empirical reference.[citation needed]/nFrom 1923 to 1938, Weyl developed the theory of compact groups, in terms of matrix representations. In the compact Lie group case he proved a fundamental character formula./nThese results are foundational in understanding the symmetry structure of quantum mechanics, which he put on a group-theoretic basis. This included spinors. Together with the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, in large measure due to John von Neumann, this gave the treatment familiar since about 1930. Non-compact groups and their representations, particularly the Heisenberg group, were also streamlined in that specific context, in his 1927 Weyl quantization, the best extant bridge between\nclassical and quantum physics to date. From this time, and certainly much helped by Weyl's expositions, Lie groups and Lie algebras became a mainstream part both of pure mathematics and theoretical physics./nHis book The Classical Groups reconsidered invariant theory. It covered symmetric groups, general linear groups, orthogonal groups, and symplectic groups and results on their invariants and representations./nWeyl also showed how to use exponential sums in diophantine approximation, with his criterion for uniform distribution mod 1, which was a fundamental step in analytic number theory. This work applied to the Riemann zeta function, as well as additive number theory. It was developed by many others./nIn The Continuum Weyl developed the logic of predicative analysis using the lower levels of Bertrand Russell's ramified theory of types. He was able to develop most of classical calculus, while using neither the axiom of choice nor proof by contradiction, and avoiding Georg Cantor's infinite sets. Weyl appealed[clarification needed] in this period to the radical constructivism of the German romantic, subjective idealist Fichte./nShortly after publishing The Continuum Weyl briefly shifted his position wholly to the intuitionism of Brouwer. In The Continuum, the constructible points exist as discrete entities. Weyl wanted a continuum that was not an aggregate of points. He wrote a controversial article proclaiming, for himself and L. E. J. Brouwer, a \"revolution.\"[31] This article was far more influential in propagating intuitionistic views than the original works of Brouwer himself./nGeorge P\u00f3lya and Weyl, during a mathematicians' gathering in Z\u00fcrich (9 February 1918), made a bet concerning the future direction of mathematics. Weyl predicted that in the subsequent 20 years, mathematicians would come to realize the total vagueness of notions such as real numbers, sets, and countability, and moreover, that asking about the truth or falsity of the least upper bound property of the real numbers was as meaningful as asking about truth of the basic assertions of Hegel on the philosophy of nature.[32] Any answer to such a question would be unverifiable, unrelated to experience,  and therefore senseless./nHowever, within a few years Weyl decided that Brouwer's intuitionism did put too great restrictions on mathematics, as critics had always said. The \"Crisis\" article had disturbed Weyl's formalist teacher Hilbert, but later in the 1920s Weyl partially reconciled his position with that of Hilbert./nAfter about 1928 Weyl had apparently decided that mathematical intuitionism was not compatible with his enthusiasm for the phenomenological philosophy of Husserl, as he had apparently earlier thought. In the last decades of his life Weyl emphasized mathematics as  \"symbolic construction\" and moved to a position closer not only to Hilbert but to that of Ernst Cassirer. Weyl however rarely refers to Cassirer, and wrote only brief articles and passages articulating this position./nBy 1949, Weyl was thoroughly disillusioned with the ultimate value of intuitionism, and wrote: \"Mathematics with Brouwer gains its highest intuitive clarity. He succeeds in developing the beginnings of analysis in a natural manner, all the time preserving the contact with intuition much more closely than had been done before. It cannot be denied, however, that in advancing to higher and more general theories the inapplicability of the simple laws of classical logic eventually results in an almost unbearable awkwardness. And the mathematician watches with pain the greater part of his towering edifice which he believed to be built of concrete blocks dissolve into mist before his eyes.\" As John L Bell puts it: \"It seems to me a great pity that Weyl did not live to see the emergence in the 1970s of smooth infinitesimal analysis, a mathematical framework within which his vision of a true continuum, not \u201csynthesized\u201d from discrete elements, is realized. Although the underlying logic of smooth infinitesimal analysis is  intuitionistic \u2014 the law of excluded middle not being generally affirmable \u2014 mathematics developed within avoids the \u201cunbearable awkwardness\u201d to which Weyl refers above.\"/nIn 1929, Weyl proposed an equation, known as Weyl equation, for use in a replacement to Dirac equation. This equation describes massless fermions. A normal Dirac fermion could be split into two Weyl fermions or formed from two Weyl fermions. Neutrinos were once thought to be Weyl fermions, but they are now known to have mass. Weyl fermions are sought after for electronics applications. Quasiparticles that behave as Weyl fermions were discovered in 2015, in a form of crystals known as Weyl semimetals, a type of topological material.[33][34][35]", "15883418": "Earle Raymond Hedrick (September 27, 1876 \u2013  February 3, 1943), was an American mathematician and a vice-president of the University of California./nHedrick was born in Union City, Indiana.\nAfter undergraduate work at the University of Michigan, he obtained a Master of Arts from Harvard University.

Denying either is a barren approach.\"[41]/nIn 1990, Nowak and Robert May proposed a mathematical model which explained the puzzling delay between HIV infection and AIDS in terms of the evolution of different strains of the virus during individual infections, to the point where the genetic diversity of the virus reaches a threshold whereby the immune system can no longer control it.[42] This detailed quantitative approach depended on assumptions about the biology of HIV which were subsequently confirmed by experiment.[43]/nIn a paper in Science in 2006, Nowak enunciated and unified the mathematical rules for the five understood bases of the evolution of cooperation (kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection). Nowak suggests that evolution is constructive because of cooperation, and that we might add \u201cnatural cooperation\u201d as a third fundamental principle of evolution beside mutation and natural selection.[44]/nIn a paper featured on the front cover of Nature in 2007, Nowak and colleagues demonstrated that the transition of irregular verbs to regular verbs in English over time obeys a simple inverse-square law, thus providing one of the first quantitative laws in the evolution of language.[45]/nIn 2010 a paper by Nowak, E.\u00a0O. Wilson, and Corina Tarnita, in Nature, argued that standard natural selection theory represents a simpler and superior approach to kin selection theory in the evolution of eusociality.[46] This work has led to many comments including strong criticism from proponents of inclusive fitness theory.[47][48][49][50] Nowak maintains that the findings of the paper are conclusive and that the field of social evolution should move beyond inclusive fitness theory.[51]/nHe has over 300 scientific publications, of which 40 are in Nature and 15 in Science.[52]/nNowak's research interests include:/nIn 2011, Nowak\u2019s book Supercooperators: The Mathematics of Evolution, Altruism and Human Behaviour (Or, Why We Need Each Other to Succeed) was published, co-authored with Roger Highfield.[53]/nThis book is partly an autobiography and partly a popular presentation of his work in mathematical biology on the evolution of cooperation, the origin of life and the evolution of language.\nIn the book, Nowak argues that cooperation is the third fundamental principle of evolution next to mutation and selection. Nowak writes extensively about his collaborators and mentors over the years, including his PhD advisor Karl Sigmund and his postdoctoral advisor Robert May; the book is dedicated \"To Karl and Bob\".\nThe book is inspired from academic lectures given by Nowak. In particular, the five rules for the evolution of cooperation were first presented at a lecture given in Oxford in 2006. Other topics were covered at the Templeton lectures, delivered in 2010 at Johns Hopkins University./nNowak argues that natural selection opposes cooperation unless certain mechanisms favour cooperation over defection. He distinguishes five such mechanisms: direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, spatial selection, group selection and kin selection. Direct reciprocity is based on repeated interactions: people help those who help them. Indirect reciprocity uses reputation: people help those who help others. Spatial selection enable cliques of cooperators to thrive: people help their friends. Group selection recognizes that competition between groups can favour more cooperative groups, while competition within groups opposes cooperation. Kin selection can establish cooperation between close genetic relatives. Nowak holds that kin selection is a valid mechanism for evolution of cooperation, although the concepts of inclusive fitness and Hamilton's rule are misleading./nSuperCooperators talks about Nowak's theory of prelife which posits that mutation, selection and cooperation preceded reproduction and led to the origin of life. The book discusses Nowak's work on the evolution of language, which he began with David Krakauer, who was his postdoc in Oxford and Princeton, and continued with Partha Niyogi and Natalia Komarova. In SuperCooperators, Nowak also argues that punishment is not a useful tool for promoting cooperation. The idea that \"Winners don't punish\" is based on collaboration with Anna Dreber, Drew Fudenberg and David Rand. The book discusses cooperation among cells and cancer as a breakdown of such cooperation. \nSupercooperators includes autobiographical elements. Nowak writes about his love for the music of Gustav Mahler and the works of Goethe. Each chapter begins with a quote from classic literature, including quotes by Shakespeare, Ovid, Goethe and George Orwell./nSupercooperators has attracted many positive reviews./nOren Harman wrote in the New York Times that \u201cNowak [...] has devoted a brilliant career to show that Darwin, and particularily his followers, batted two for three.\", since Nowak had proposed that cooperationm should be regarded as a third fundamental principle of evolution beside mutation and selection./nManfred Milinski in Nature describes the book as \"part autobiography, part textbook, and reads like a best-selling novel\" and suggests that whereas Nowak is right that the theories of kin selection and punishment need revisiting, it is too soon to tell whether his bold ideas will hold up to empirical testing.

Byrd of Smith College, Mary Watson Whitney of Vassar, Ellen Hayes of Wellesley, and Amy Rayson, who taught mathematics and physics at a private school in New York City.[5] Cunningham was also a member of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific as early as 1891.[6]  She was also a founder member of the British Astronomical Association in 1890, resigned 1908 September.\nShe was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1901.[7]/nCunningham died on January 24, 1921, from heart failure.

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1938 with a degree in mathematics and also graduated from the physics department at the University of Tokyo in 1941. During the war years he worked in isolation, but was able to master Hodge theory as it then stood.  He obtained his PhD from the University of Tokyo in 1949, with a thesis entitled Harmonic fields in Riemannian manifolds.[2] He was involved in cryptographic work from about 1944, while holding an academic post in Tokyo./nIn 1949 he travelled to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey at the invitation of Hermann Weyl. He was subsequently also appointed Associate Professor at Princeton University in 1952 and promoted to Professor in 1955.  At this time the foundations of Hodge theory were being brought in line with contemporary technique in operator theory. Kodaira rapidly became involved in exploiting the tools it opened up in algebraic geometry, adding sheaf theory as it became available. This work was particularly influential, for example on Friedrich Hirzebruch./nIn a second research phase, Kodaira wrote a long series of papers in collaboration with Donald C. Spencer, founding the deformation theory of complex structures on manifolds. This gave the possibility of constructions of moduli spaces, since in general such structures depend continuously on parameters. It also identified the sheaf cohomology groups, for the sheaf associated with the holomorphic tangent bundle, that carried the basic data about the dimension of the moduli space, and obstructions to deformations. This theory is still foundational, and also had an influence on the (technically very different) scheme theory of Grothendieck. Spencer then continued this work, applying the techniques to structures other than complex ones, such as G-structures./nIn a third major part of his work, Kodaira worked again from around 1960 through the classification of algebraic surfaces from the point of view of birational geometry of complex manifolds. This resulted in a typology of seven kinds of two-dimensional compact complex manifolds, recovering the five algebraic types known classically; the other two being non-algebraic. He provided also detailed studies of elliptic fibrations of surfaces over a curve, or in other language elliptic curves over algebraic function fields, a theory whose arithmetic analogue proved important soon afterwards. This work also included a characterisation of K3 surfaces as deformations of quartic surfaces in P3, and the theorem that they form a single diffeomorphism class. Again, this work has proved foundational.  (The K3 surfaces were named after Ernst Kummer, Erich K\u00e4hler, and Kodaira)./nKodaira left Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in 1961, and briefly served as chair at the Johns Hopkins University and Stanford University.  In 1967, returned to the University of Tokyo. He was awarded a Wolf Prize in 1984/5. He died in Kofu on 26 July 1997./nHe was honoured with the membership of the Japan Academy, the Mathematical Society of Japan and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. He was the foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1975, member of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences in 1974 and honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1979.

Lemniscate elliptic functions); this seems also to have been in his own estimation his most important work, since he had the figure of the lemniscate with the inscription \"Multifariam divisa atque dimensa Deo veritatis gloria\" engraved on the title-page of his Produzioni Matematiche,[3] which he published in two volumes (Pesaro, 1750), and dedicated to Pope Benedict XIV. The same figure and words \"Deo veritatis gloria\" also appear on his tomb./nFailing to rectify the ellipse or hyperbola, Fagnano attempted to determine arcs whose difference is rectifiable.\nThe word \"rectifiable\" meant at that time that the length can be found explicitly, which is different from its modern meaning. He also pointed out the remarkable analogy existing between the integrals which represent the arc of a circle and the arc of a lemniscate.

He earned a BSc from the University of Chicago in 1955 and his PhD from Princeton University in 1959. He is one of many logicians to have studied with Alonzo Church.[1]/nHe was born on May 25, 1919, in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His father was Isidore Smullyan, a Russian-born businessman who emigrated to Belgium when young and graduated from the University of Antwerp, his native language being French. His mother was Rosina Smullyan (n\u00e9e Freeman), a painter and actress born and raised in London.[4] Both parents were musical, his father playing the violin and his mother playing the piano.[5] He was the youngest of three children. His eldest brother, Emile Benoit Smullyan, later became an economist under the name of Emile Benoit. His sister was Gladys Smullyan, later Gladys Gwynn.[6] His cousin was the philosopher Arthur Francis Smullyan (1912-1998).[7] In Far Rockaway he was a grade school classmate of Richard Feynman.[5]/nSmullyan showed musical talent from a young age, playing both violin and piano. He studied with pianist Grace Hofheimer in New York.[8] He had perfect pitch.[5] He started his interest in logic at the age of 5.[9] In 1931 he won a gold medal in the piano competition of the New York Music Week Association when he was aged 12 (the previous year he had won the silver medal).[5] After graduating from grade school, the Depression forced his family to move to Manhattan, and he attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in The Bronx. He played violin in the school orchestra but devoted more time to playing the piano. At high school he fell in love with mathematics when he took a class in geometry. Apart from his classes in geometry, physics, and chemistry, however, he was dissatisfied with his high school, and dropped out. He studied mathematics on his own, including analytic geometry, calculus, and modern higher algebra - particularly group theory and Galois theory. He sat in on a course taught by Ernest Nagel at Columbia University that was being taken by his cousin, Arthur Smullyan, and independently discovered Boolean rings. He also spent a year at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.[5] He did not graduate with a high school diploma, but he took the College Board exams to get into college.[5] He studied mathematics and music at Pacific University in Oregon for one semester, and at Reed College for less than a semester, before following the pianist Berhard Abramowitsch to San Francisco.[5] He audited classes at the University of California, Berkeley, before returning to New York, where he continued his independent study of modern abstract algebra. At this time he composed a number of chess problems which were published many years later; he also learned magic./nAt the age of 24, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for three semesters, because he wanted to study modern algebra with a professor whose book he had read.[10] He later transferred to the University of Chicago and majored in mathematics. After a break in which he worked as a magician in New York and met his first wife, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he also worked as a magician at night and taught piano on the faculty at Roosevelt University. While at Chicago he took three courses with the philosopher Rudolf Carnap, for which he wrote three term papers. Carnap recommended that he send the first term paper to Willard Van Orman Quine, which he did. Quine replied that he should tinker with his idea about what makes quantification theory tick. Of the other two term papers, one, entitled \"Languages in which Self-Reference is Possible\" (which Carnap showed to Kurt G\u00f6del), was later published in 1957. The other was later published in his 1961 book Theory of Formal Systems. While still a student at the University of Chicago, on the basis of a recommendation from Carnap, he was hired by John G. Kemeny, the chair of the mathematics department at Dartmouth College. He taught at Dartmouth for two years. During that time he separated from his first wife, from whom he later divorced. He also used to visit his friends Gloria and Marvin Minsky (Gloria Minsky was his cousin) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[5] The University of Chicago, after a battle between the faculty and administration, agreed to award Smullyan a bachelor of science degree in mathematics in 1955 based partly on courses he had taught at Dartmouth (although he had not taken them at Chicago). Both Carnap and Kemeny helped him to get accepted to the graduate program in mathematics at Princeton University.[11] He received a PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1959. He completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \"Theory of formal systems\", under the supervision of Alonzo Church, which was published in 1961.[12] While a graduate student at Princeton he met his second wife, Blanche, a pianist and teacher, born in Belgium, to whom he was married for 48 years until she died in 2006./nWhile a PhD student, his term paper for Carnap, \"Languages in which Self-Reference is Possible\", was published in 1957 in the Journal of Symbolic Logic,[13] showing that G\u00f6delian incompleteness held for formal systems considerably more elementary than that of Kurt G\u00f6del's 1931 landmark paper. The contemporary understanding of G\u00f6del's theorem dates from this paper. Smullyan later made a compelling case that much of the fascination with G\u00f6del's theorem should be directed at Tarski's theorem, which is much easier to prove and equally disturbing philosophically.[14]/nAfter getting his PhD from Princeton, he taught at Princeton for two years. He subsequently taught at New York University, at the State University of New York at New Paltz, at Smith College, and at the Belfer Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University, before becoming professor of mathematics and computer science at Lehman College in the Bronx, where he taught undergraduate students from 1968 to 1984.[15] He was also a professor of philosophy at the CUNY Graduate Center from 1976 to 1984, where he taught graduate students.[16] He was subsequently a professor of philosophy at Indiana University, where he taught both undergraduate and graduate students. He was also an amateur astronomer, using a six-inch reflecting telescope for which he ground the mirror.[1] Fellow mathematician Martin Gardner was a close friend./nSmullyan wrote many books about recreational mathematics and recreational logic. Most notably, one is titled What Is the Name of This Book? ISBN\u00a00139550623. His A Beginner's Further Guide to Mathematical Logic ISBN\u00a0978-981-4730-99-0, published in 2017, was his final book./nMany of his logic problems are extensions of classic puzzles. Knights and Knaves involves knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). This is based on a story of two doors and two guards, one who lies and one who tells the truth. One door leads to heaven and one to hell, and the puzzle is to find out which door leads to heaven by asking one of the guards a question. One way to do this is to ask, \"Which door would the other guard say leads to hell?\". Unfortunately, this fails, as the liar can answer, \"He would say the door to paradise leads to hell,\" and the truth-teller would answer, \"He would say the door to paradise leads to hell.\" You must point at one of the doors as well as simply stating a question. For example, as philosopher Richard Turnbull has explained, you could point at either door and ask, \"Will the other guard say this is the door to paradise?\" The truth-teller will say \"No, \" if it is in fact the door to paradise, as will the liar. So you pick that door. The truth-teller will answer \"Yes,\" if it is the door to Hell, as will the liar, so you pick the other door. Note also that we are not told anything about the goals of either guard: for all we know, the liar may want to help us and the truth-teller not help us,  or both are indifferent, so there's no reason to think either one will phrase answers such as to provide us with the most optimally available kind of comprehension. This is behind the crucial role of actually pointing at a door directly while asking the question.   This idea was famously used in the 1986 film Labyrinth./nIn more complex puzzles, he introduces characters who may lie or tell the truth (referred to as \"normals\"), and furthermore instead of answering \"yes\" or \"no\", use words which mean \"yes\" or \"no\", but the reader does not know which word means which. The puzzle known as \"the hardest logic puzzle ever\" is based on these characters and themes. In his Transylvania puzzles, half of the inhabitants are insane, and believe only false things, whereas the other half are sane and believe only true things. In addition, humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie. For example, an insane vampire will believe a false thing (2 + 2 is not 4) but will then lie about it, and say that it is false. A sane vampire knows 2 + 2 is 4, but will lie and say it is not. And mutatis mutandis for humans. Thus everything said by a sane human or an insane vampire is true, while everything said by an insane human or a sane vampire is false./nHis book Forever Undecided popularizes G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems by phrasing them in terms of reasoners and their beliefs, rather than formal systems and what can be proved in them. For example, if a native of a knight/knave island says to a sufficiently self-aware reasoner, \"You will never believe that I am a knight\", the reasoner cannot believe either that the native is a knight or that he is a knave without becoming inconsistent (i.e., holding two contradictory beliefs). The equivalent theorem is that for any formal system S, there exists a mathematical statement that can be interpreted as \"This statement is not provable in formal system S\". If the system S is consistent, neither the statement nor its opposite will be provable in it. See also Doxastic logic./nInspector Craig is a frequent character in Smullyan's \"puzzle-novellas.\"  He is generally called into a scene of a crime that has a solution that is mathematical in nature.  Then, through a series of increasingly harder challenges, he (and the reader) begin to understand the principles in question. Finally the novella culminates in Inspector Craig (and the reader) solving the crime, utilizing the mathematical and logical principles learned. Inspector Craig generally does not learn the formal theory in question, and Smullyan usually reserves a few chapters after the Inspector Craig adventure to illuminate the analogy for the reader.

His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He described an early practical design for the reflecting telescope \u2013 the Gregorian telescope \u2013 and made advances in trigonometry, discovering infinite series representations for several trigonometric functions./nIn his book Geometriae Pars Universalis (1668)[1] Gregory gave both the first published statement and proof of the fundamental theorem of the calculus (stated from a geometric point of view, and only for a special class of the curves considered by later versions of the theorem), for which he was acknowledged by Isaac Barrow.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]/nGregory was born in 1638. His mother Janet was the daughter of Jean and David Anderson and his father was John Gregory,[9] an Episcopalian Church of Scotland minister, James was youngest of their three children and he was born in the manse at Drumoak, Aberdeenshire, and was initially educated at home by his mother, Janet Anderson (~1600\u20131668).  It was his mother who endowed Gregory with his appetite for geometry, her uncle \u2013 Alexander Anderson (1582\u20131619) \u2013 having been a pupil and editor of French mathematician Vi\u00e8te. After his father's death in 1651 his elder brother David took over responsibility for his education. He attended Aberdeen Grammar School, and then Marischal College  from 1653\u20131657, graduating AM in 1657./nIn 1663 he went to London, meeting John Collins and fellow Scot Robert Moray, one of the founders of the Royal Society. In 1664 he departed for the University of Padua, in the Venetian Republic, passing through Flanders, Paris and Rome on his way.  At Padua he lived in the house of his countryman James Caddenhead, the professor of philosophy, and he was taught by Stefano Angeli./nUpon his return to London in 1668 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, before travelling to St Andrews in late 1668 to take up his post as the first Regius Professor of Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, a position created for him by Charles II, probably upon the request of Robert Moray. There at the University of St Andrews, he laid the first meridian line across the floor of his lab in 1673, which was 200 years prior to the Greenwich Meridian being established, and thus \"arguably making St Andrews the place where time began\".[10][11]/nHe was successively professor at the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh./nHe had married Mary, daughter of George Jameson, painter, and widow of John Burnet of Elrick, Aberdeen; their son James was Professor of Physics at King's College, Aberdeen. He was the grandfather of John Gregory (FRS 1756); uncle of David Gregorie (FRS 1692) and brother of David Gregory (1627\u20131720), a physician and inventor./nAbout a year after assuming the Chair of Mathematics at Edinburgh, James Gregory suffered a stroke while viewing the moons of Jupiter with his students.  He died a few days later at the age of 36./nIn the Optica Promota, published in 1663, Gregory described his design for a reflecting telescope, the \"Gregorian telescope\". He also described the method for using the transit of Venus to measure the distance of the Earth from the Sun, which was later advocated by Edmund Halley and adopted as the basis of the first effective measurement of the Astronomical Unit./nBefore he left Padua, Gregory published Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura (1667) in which he approximated the areas of the circle and hyperbola with convergent series:/n\"The first proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus and the discovery of the Taylor series can both be attributed to him.\"[13][14]/nThe book was reprinted in 1668 with an appendix, Geometriae Pars, in which Gregory explained how the volumes of solids of revolution could be determined./nIn his 1663 Optica Promota, James Gregory described his reflecting telescope which has come to be known by his name, the Gregorian telescope. Gregory pointed out that a reflecting telescope with a parabolic mirror would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refracting telescopes. In his design he also placed a concave secondary mirror with an elliptical surface past the focal point of the parabolic primary mirror, reflecting the image back through a hole in the primary mirror where it could be conveniently viewed. According to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of actually constructing one.[15]/nThe telescope design attracted the attention of several people in the scientific establishment such as Robert Hooke, the Oxford physicist who eventually built the telescope 10 years later, and Sir Robert Moray, polymath and founding member of the Royal Society./nThe Gregorian telescope design is rarely used today, as other types of reflecting telescopes are known to be more efficient for standard applications. Gregorian optics are also used in radio telescopes such as Arecibo, which features a \"Gregorian dome\".[16]/nThe following excerpt is from the Pantologia.

Mally was one of the founders of deontic logic and is mainly known for his contributions in that field of research. In metaphysics, he is known for introducing a distinction between two kinds of predication, better known as the dual predication approach.[7]/nMally was born in the town of Kranj (German: Krainburg) in the Duchy of Carniola, Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). His father was of Slovene origin, but identified himself with Austrian German culture (he also Germanized the orthography of his surname, originally spelled Mali, a common Slovene surname of Upper Carniola). After his death, the family moved to the Carniolan capital of Ljubljana (German: Laibach). There, Ernst attended the prestigious Ljubljana German-language Gymnasium. Already at a young age, Mally became a fervent supporter of the Pan-German nationalist movement of Georg von Sch\u00f6nerer. In the same time, he developed an interest in philosophy./nIn 1898, he enrolled in the University of Graz, where he studied philosophy under the supervision of Alexius Meinong, as well as physics and mathematics, specializing in formal logic. He graduated in 1903 with a doctoral thesis entitled Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des Messens (Investigations in the Object Theory of Measurement). In 1906 he started teaching at a high school in Graz, at the same time collaborating with Adalbert Meingast and working as Meinong's assistant at the university.

He used five axioms, which are given below. They form a first-order theory that quantifies over propositions, and there are several predicates to understand first. !x means that x ought to be the case. Ux means that x is unconditionally obligatory, i.e. that !x is necessarily true. \u2229x means that x is unconditionally forbidden, i.e. U(\u00acx). A f B is the binary relation A requires B, i.e. A materially implies !B. (All entailment in the axioms is material conditional.)

Meanwhile, axiom 5 lacks an object to which the predicates apply, a typo. However, it turns out these are the least of Mally's worries (see below)./nTheorem: This axiomatization of deontic logic implies that !x if and only if x is true, OR !x is unsatisfiable. (This makes it useless to deontic logicians.)\nProof: Using axiom III, axiom I may be rewritten as (!(A \u2192 B) & (B \u2192 C)) \u2192\u00a0!(A \u2192 C). Since B \u2192 C holds whenever C holds, one immediate consequence is that (!(A \u2192 B) \u2192 (C \u2192\u00a0!(A \u2192 C))). In other words, if A requires B, it requires any true statement. In the special case where A is a tautology, the theorem has consequence (!B \u2192 (C \u2192 !C)). Thus, if at least one statement ought be true, every statement must materially entail it ought be true, and so every true statement ought be true. As for the converse (i.e. if some statement ought be true then all statements that ought be true are true), consider the following logic: ((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)) \u2192 (U \u2192\u00a0!\u2229) is a special case of axiom I, but its consequent contradicts axiom V, and so \u00ac((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)). The result !A \u2192 A can be shown to follow from this, since !A implies that U \u2192 !A and \u00acA implies that A \u2192 \u2229; and, since these are not both true, we know that !A \u2192 A./nMally thought that axiom I was self-evident, but he likely confused it with an alternative in which the implication B \u2192 C is logical, which would indeed make the axiom self-evident. The theorem above, however, would then not be demonstrable. The theorem was proven by Karl Menger, the next deontic logician. Neither Mally's original axioms nor a modification that avoids this result remains popular today. Menger did not suggest his own axioms. (See also deontic logic for more on the subsequent development of this subject.)/nIn metaphysics, Mally is known for introducing a distinction between two kinds of predication, a strategy better known as the dual predication approach, for solving the problem of nonexistent objects (Mally 1912).[7] He also introduced a similar strategy, the dual property strategy, but did not endorse it.[2] The dual property strategy was eventually adopted by Meinong.[2]/nMally developed a realistic approach to ontology (Mally 1935) and saw himself in opposition to the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists.[1]/nMally's metaphysical work influences some contemporary metaphysicians and logicians working in abstract object theory, especially Edward Zalta.[9]/nThe analytic philosopher David Kellogg Lewis argued forcefully that the name of the fictional Australian poet Ern Malley, created by James McAuley and Harold Stewart, was an allusion to Mally.[10]", "26467605": "Stefan Andrus Burr (born 1940) is a mathematician and computer scientist.

He was born in the town of Szepesb\u00e9la in the Kingdom of Hungary (in German: Zipser Bela, now Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Bel\u00e1 in Slovakia).[1][2][3][6]/nPetzval studied and later lectured at the Institutum Geometricum (currently Budapest University of Technology and Economics) in Buda (today part of Budapest). He headed the Institute of Practical Geometry and Hydrology/Architecture between 1841 and 1848. Later in life, he accepted an appointment to a chair of mathematics at the University of Vienna. Petzval became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1873./nPetzval is considered to be one of the main founders of geometrical optics, modern photography and cinematography. Among his inventions are the Petzval portrait lens and opera glasses, both still in common use today. He is also credited with the discovery of the Laplace transform[citation needed] and is also known for his extensive work on aberration in optical systems./nIn 1801, Joseph Petzval's father married the Zipser-German Susanne Kreutzmann, who was born in Szepesb\u00e9la, Kingdom of Hungary, a daughter of the previous teacher at the same school in Szepesb\u00e9la. The couple brought up six children: Gust\u00e1v Adolf (1800\u20131803), who died prematurely; Nestor Aemilianus (1804\u20131806); Joseph Maximili\u00e1n (1807 - 1891); Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r (1809\u20131889); and three daughters. In 1810, the family moved to K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk (in German: K\u00e4smark, today Ke\u017emarok, Slovakia) and in 1819 to L\u0151cse (in German: Leutschau, today Levo\u010da, Slovakia)./nThe entire family shared an aptitude for technology. Joseph's father worked as a teacher at the evangelical school in Szepesb\u00e9la, as well as an organist in Szepesb\u00e9la and later in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk. He was also a conductor and a geodesist in L\u0151cse. He had a reputation as an outstanding musician and composer, who was also gifted mechanically. In 1824, he was awarded two patents: one for improvements to the pendulum clock and the other for a \"polygraph\" (typewriter). Petzval's brother, Petrol Baltaz\u00e1r Petzval, was a well-respected mathematician, engineer and astronomer./nJoseph Petzval attended elementary school in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk, and began his secondary school studies in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk and Podolin (in German: Pudlein, now Podol\u00ednec, Slovakia). On 1 October 1819 he returned to his family in L\u0151cse, and entered high school. Both in elementary school and high school he ranked among the best in his class in the subjects of Latin (the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary) and religion; however, he struggled with his Hungarian. Before arriving at L\u0151cse, he was also very weak in mathematics. In L\u0151cse, however, he clearly improved in this discipline./nOne anecdote told about Petzval is as follows: When his family had already decided to make a shoemaker out of Petzval, he read the book Analytic Paper on the Elements of Mathematics by the German mathematician Hauser over the summer holidays, just after completing his fourth class in elementary school. He was preparing to undergo a repeat class in mathematics. After Petzval finished the book, the child who had been a weak math pupil swiftly became a math genius./nAfter finishing high school, Petzval decided to move to the Institutum Geometricum, the engineering faculty of the Pester University. Before that, he had to complete a two-year lyceum, which he attended from 1823 to 1825 in Kassa (in German: Kaschau, today Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia). When he arrived there in 1823, Petzval was already well-versed in the subjects of Latin, mathematical analysis, classical literature and stylistics. In addition to his Slovak he was able to speak perfectly in Czech, German and Hungarian. With his father's assistance, he also learned French and English.[7]/nAfter completing the Lyceum, Petzval worked for a year as an educator for Count Alm\u00e1ssy in the Heves county. In addition to bringing in some urgently needed money, this experience also provided him with important social contacts./nFrom 1826 to 1828, Petzval studied at the Institutum Geometricum in Buda, and earned an engineering diploma in 1828. In the same year, he joined the graduate degree program of the university, and became the self-appointed adjunct chair for the Physics Department (in 1831). From 1828 to 1835, Petzval simultaneously worked as an urban engineer for the city of Buda\u2014particularly as a specialist in flood abatement and sewers\u2014and studied mathematics, mechanics and practical geometry. He authored an unrealized plan to build a navigation channel around Buda. In 1830, his dam computations saved the city from an inundation caused by the flooding of the Danube. After he received his Ph.D. in 1832, he taught as an associate professor at the university. During this period, he also received a degree in mathematics. In 1835, he was appointed a university professor in higher mathematics./nAfter being invited to the University of Vienna in 1836, Petzval accepted a position of the chair of mathematics there in 1837, and worked until 1877 as a professor of mathematics. Apart from mathematics, he was also concerned with mechanics, ballistics, optics, and acoustics. His lectures on the theory of algebraic equations, which integrated linear and differential equations with constant and variable coefficients, ballistics, acoustic theory, and other areas were high quality and became well attended./nPetzval moved into a rented abandoned monastery at Kahlenberg mountain. He founded his own glass-sharpening workshop there. His lenses became world-famous because Petzval was also a skillful lens sharpener and precision mechanic./nIn 1840, he designed his famous portrait lens. 1845 brought disputes with the entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtl\u00e4nder (1812\u20131878) over who had the right to produce Petzval's lenses. In 1859, Petzval's home was broken into, and his manuscripts \u2014 a result of many years of research \u2014 were destroyed. Petzval never managed to reconstruct the lost documents. His most refined technical book on optics, lost with his manuscripts, would never appear in print. From then on, he primarily concerned himself with acoustics and began to withdraw from society. His enterprise with Carl Dietzler failed in 1862 (see further below); Dietzler died in 1872./nIn 1869, at the age of 62, Petzval married his housekeeper, but she died four years later. In 1877, he stopped lecturing, withdrew to a monastery on Kahlenberg, and became a hermit./nPetzval died in Vienna in 1891, nearly forgotten, embittered, and destitute. His grave is in the Viennese central cemetery. His bitterness at the end of his life can probably be traced, on the one hand, to his continuing controversy with Voigtl\u00e4nder, the loss of his manuscripts, and his business failure; and on the other hand, to the fact that he was never really acknowledged for his lifelong work in the field of optics. Just before his death, Petzval was reported to have said:/nPetzval was a good sportsman and rider. As a young child, he often traveled with his family to the High Tatras, and was also a dedicated athlete. In Vienna, he was for a long time the best fencer and ring fighter in the city. He also inherited an excellent talent for music from his father. Allegedly, while he was a lecturer in Vienna, he always rode to his lectures on a black Arabian horse./nPetzval never wanted to communicate anything about his private life, and was therefore relatively inscrutable to others during his lifetime. As Dr. Ermenyi described in his book, Dr. Josef Petzval's Life/nAt the end of his life he lived in increasingly greater isolation in his \"castle\" on Kahlenberg, with only his horse for company, although several academies and scholarly societies appointed him a member (member of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1846/1849), external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1873), honorary member of the Union of the Czech mathematicians and physicists (1881), carriers of the French Charles Chevalier Platinmedaille, and others)./nPetzval placed very high requirements on himself and others. That was probably connected with his critical, contentious and sarcastic nature, which brought him many conflicts, particularly in the field of mathematics./nPetzval had a controversy with Christian Doppler over problems of acoustics, and Doppler responded in 1852 with a book entitled \"Remarks Over the Objections Stated by Professor Petzval Against the Correctness of My Theory\"./nIn particular he was involved in lengthy disputes with the entrepreneur Voigtl\u00e4nder. These began in 1845, when Petzval raised the issue of fraud for the first time. Because Petzval only held a patent in Austria, Voigtl\u00e4nder shifted his production to Braunschweig in Germany, where he produced about 60,000 Petzval lenses in the following 20 years. Petzval for his part co-operated since 1854 with the Austrian optics producer Dietzler. The latter's lenses were marketed in Austria as the \"photographic Dialyt\", while Voigtl\u00e4nder marketed the lenses in Germany and Austria as the \"Voightl\u00e4nder Orthoskop\". After further interference by Voigtl\u00e4nder, Dietzler went bankrupt in 1862. When Petzval threatened legal action, Voigtl\u00e4nder closed his Austrian plant in 1866. Petzval could have then transferred the marketing, but he had renounced working with optics after his home was robbed in 1859 and worked instead on acoustics. In 1862, he also stopped lecturing on optics./nPetzval's greatest achievements lie in his work with geometric optics. In 1839, Louis Daguerre presented the Daguerreotype, the first commercially successful photographic process. Fox Talbot's calotype was discovered earlier but did not enjoy commercial success. Petzval learned of the invention from his friend, Viennese professor Andreas von Ettingshausen. The daguerreotype was problematic in that it required exposure times as long as 30 minutes to create a portrait. With Ettingshausen's urging, Petzval set up a workshop and laboratory at Kahlenberg in Vienna and, after six months of complex computations, produced designs for improved objective lenses for both portraiture and landscape photography. Because the artillery was one of the few occupations that used advanced mathematical computations at the time, Archduke Ludwig lent eight artillery cannoneers and three corporals to the computational efforts. The calculations these men carried out in tandem with each other have been regarded as an early (albeit human) example of a parallel computer./nPetzval's portrait objective lens (Petzval Portr\u00e4tobjektiv) was an almost distortionless Anachromatischer vierlinser (double achromatic objective lens, with four lenses in three groups). The luminous intensity of this flat \"portrait lens\" was substantially higher than the daguerre standard of 1839, the Wollaston Chevalier lens (f/16). The screen f/3.6 with a focal length of 160\u00a0mm made crucially shorter exposure times possible \u2014 using exposures of only about 15 to 30 seconds compared to the 10 minutes previously. Thus, snapshots became possible for the first time./nThe portrait objective lens consisted of a cemented double lens in front (f/5) and a double lens with a gap in the back. The rear double lens was necessary for the correction of spherical and coma errors. The Chevalier lens used two cemented double lenses, but was immediately replaced by the Petzval lens, so that the Petzval Portr\u00e4tlinse was the first cemented lens in widespread use. The first portrait objective lenses were rather small and had a diameter of 2.6\u00a0cm. The 1856 Petzval lenses produced by Dietzler had a diameter of 15\u00a0cm and a weight of 15\u00a0kg, with which one could make portraits measuring 33 by 42\u00a0cm. [1]/nIn 1840, Petzval allowed the Viennese entrepreneur Peter Wilhelm Friedrich von Voigtl\u00e4nder to produce the lens for a one-time payment of 2,000 guldens, without a patent or a contract, which led later to a lasting controversy between Petzval and Voigtl\u00e4nder. Voigtl\u00e4nder, who had confirmed the process through his own calculations, produced a prototype in May 1840 and began production of the lens for the daguerrotype cameras in 1841, making a fortune in the process. The thermionic cameras were made from brass, using round daguerreotype plates which exposed a diameter of 8\u00a0cm. In 1841, 600 of these cameras were manufactured and sold at a price of 120 guldens. Voigtl\u00e4nder received a medal at the world exhibition in Paris for this achievement. These first metal-body cameras were prototypes of today's modern cameras. It took another 50 years until an improved camera became available. Petzval's portrait objective lens was used into the 1920s (often under other names) in cameras and is used today in projectors. The lens played an important role in the development of photography and cinematography./nEven with all its apparent improvements, Petzval was dissatisfied with the lens and, after some improvements, left it for others to produce and patent. The camera with the new landscape objective, produced by Dietzler, possessed a light foldable chamber with double bellows. Petzval never made a commercial profit from the lens./nAmong Petzval's other works are the invention of opera glasses, lens system calculations that led to the perfection of a telescope and microscope (1843), computations for efficient binoculars, and construction of new floodlights (1847). His plan for the construction of lighting systems for ships on the Danube could not be carried out, however. His special mirror lamp (Petzval lamp), which made possible a maximum utilization of light energy, was used particularly for the bright projectors developed by Petzval. Petzval can also be regarded as the inventor of the modern unastigmatic lens system, based on records from his estate. Around 1860, Petzval conducted photogrammetric  measurements using equipment he had designed. He also proved scientifically that glowing solid compounds emit more light than burning gases. Carl Freiherr Auer von Welsbach later applied this principle to the gas lamp he designed./nPetzval's achievements are used today in cinematography, astronomy, and meteorology. The Astro-Petzval-Objektiv lens is used in astronomy. This objective made a distortion-free illustration of a large part of the sky, as well as permitting photographing of galaxies and star fields. German optics companies (T\u00f6pfer, Voigtl\u00e4nderkorrigie, Zeiss) produced the Petzval objective lens until the 1940s. Petzval's largest contributions to optics are his theoretical bases for the construction and correction of optical lens systems. He carried out fundamental work for the theory of aberration in optical systems. A few central terms of this field were later named after Petzval:/nTo the regret of physicists, Petzval never released a prepared multi-volume optical work./nIn mathematics, Petzval stressed practical applicability. He said, \"Mankind does not exist for science's sake, but science should be used to improve the conditions of mankind.\" He worked on applications of the Laplace transformation. His work was very thorough, but not completely satisfying, since he could not use an edge integration in order to invert the transformation. Petzval wrote a paper in two volumes as well as a long work on this subject. A controversy with the student Simon Spritzer, who accused Petzval of plagiarism of Pierre-Simon Laplace, led the Spritzer-influenced mathematicians George Boole and Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 to later name the transformation after Laplace. Petzval tried to represent practically everything in his environment mathematically. Thus he tried to mathematically model fencing or the course of the horse. His obsession with mathematics finally led to the discovery of the portrait objective./nIn the study of acoustics, Petzval was particularly concerned with string oscillations, differential equations of the string oscillations, and the mathematical theory of musical instruments. He designed a piano with three key sequences. Petzval developed a theory of the oscillations of strained strings as well as his own theory of tone systems./nThe Jozef Maximili\u00e1n Petzval Museum of the History of Photography and Cinematography, part of the Slovak Technical Museum of Ko\u0161ice, is located in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Bel\u00e1, in the house where Petzval was born. The crater Petzval on the far side of the Moon is named after him, as are roads and statues in modern Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary./nIn 1980 a planetoid (3716 Petzval, 1980 TG) was named after Petzval upon the request of the astronomical institute in Tatransk\u00e1 Lomnica and Czech scientists; Petzval's portrait objective lens made possible the discovery of many planetoids at the end of the 19th century. The Austrian Board of Education has bestowed the \"Petzval Medal\" for special achievements in the area of scientific photography since 1928./nThe Magyar Tudom\u00e1nyos Akad\u00e9mia Acta technica, Volume 25, 1959 notes a dispute over the ethnicity of Petzval. According to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences:/n\"The Austrians declared Petzval to having been an Austrian, the Czechs tried to prove his Bohemian origin, the Slovaks claiming to the fact that the County of Szepes, where Petzval was born, is now in Slovakia, so he must have been a Slovak.\"/nThe same publication also cites Petzval's expressed claim to being Hungarian and a \"...loyal son of the fatherland\"[9]\nAs mentioned earlier, he struggled with Hungarian language while at school, since it was not his mother tongue. \nPetzvals contemporaries widely accepted that he was Hungarian, as Petzval always proclaimed. \"He lived 54 years of his life in Vienna, but could not become, and did not become a Viennese - devotedly to his native country, he remained a Hungarian.\" - told Lueger, mayor of Vienna, at Petzval's burial.[10]", "34299169": "Friedrich Otto Rudolf Sturm (6 January 1841 \u2013 12 April 1919) was a German mathematician.

He is most noted for his work on the analysis and synthesis of electrical filters and his work marked the beginning of the field of network synthesis.  Prior to his work, electronic filter design used techniques which accurately predicted filter behaviour only under unrealistic conditions. This required a certain amount of experience on the part of the designer to choose suitable sections to include in the design. Cauer placed the field on a firm mathematical footing, providing tools that could produce exact solutions to a given specification for the design of an electronic filter./nCauer initially specialised in general relativity but soon switched to electrical engineering.  His work for a German subsidiary of the Bell Telephone Company brought him into contact with leading American engineers in the field of filters.  This proved useful when Cauer was unable to feed his children during the German economic crisis of the 1920s and he moved to the US.   He studied early computer techniques in the US prior to returning to Germany. According to Wilhelm Cauer's son Emil the rise of Nazism in Germany stifled Cauer's career[2] because he had a remote Jewish ancestor.  Cauer was murdered during the fall of Berlin by Soviet soldiers./nThe manuscripts for some of Cauer's most important unpublished works were destroyed during the war.  However, his family succeeded in reconstructing much of this from his notes and volume II of Theorie der linearen Wechselstromschaltungen was published after his death.  Cauer's legacy continues today, with network synthesis being the method of choice for network design./nWilhelm Adolf Eduard Cauer was born in Berlin, Germany, on 24 June 1900.  He came from a long line of academics. His early grammar school (gymnasium) was the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium, an institution founded by his great-grandfather, Ludwig Cauer.  This school was located on Cauerstrasse, named after Ludwig, in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin.[3]  The building still exists, but is now a primary school, the Ludwig Cauer Grundschule.[4]  He later attended the Mommsen Gymnasium, Berlin.  His father, also Wilhelm Cauer, was a Privy Councillor and a professor of railway engineering at the Technical University of Berlin.  Cauer became interested in mathematics at the age of thirteen and continued to demonstrate that he was academically inclined as he grew.[5]/nBriefly, Cauer served in the German army in the final stages of World War I.  He married Karoline Cauer (a relation)[6] in 1925 and eventually fathered six children.[5][7]/nCauer started off in a field completely unrelated to filters; from 1922 he worked with Max von Laue on general relativity, and his first publication (1923) was in this field.  For reasons that are not clear, he changed his field after this to electrical engineering.  He graduated in applied physics in 1924 from the Technical University of Berlin.[5]/nHe then spent a period working for Mix & Genest, a branch of the Bell Telephone Company, applying probability theory to telephone switching.  He also worked on timer relays.  He had two telecommunications-related publications during this period on \"Telephone switching systems\" and \"Losses of real inductors\".[5]/nThe relationship of Mix & Genest with Bell gave Cauer an easy path to collaboration with AT&T's engineers at Bell Labs in the US which must have been of enormous help when Cauer embarked on a study of filter design.  Bell were at the forefront of filter design at this time with the likes of George Campbell in Boston and Otto Zobel in New York making major contributions.[8]  However, it was with Ronald M. Foster that Cauer had much correspondence and it was his work that Cauer recognised as being of such importance.  His paper, A reactance theorem,[9] is a milestone in filter theory and inspired Cauer to generalise this approach into what has now become the field of network synthesis.[5]/nIn June 1926 Cauer presented his thesis paper, The realisation of impedances of specified frequency dependence[a], at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics of the Technical University of Berlin.[5]  This paper is the beginning of modern network synthesis.[10]/nIn 1927 Cauer went to work as a research assistant at Richard Courant's Institute of Mathematics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.  In 1928 he obtained his habilitation and became an external university lecturer.[5]/nCauer found that he could not support his family during the economic crisis of the 1920s and in 1930 took his family to the USA where he had obtained a scholarship (a Rockefeller fellowship) to study at MIT and Harvard University.  He worked with Vannevar Bush who was building machines for the solution of mathematical problems. Essentially, these were what we would now call analogue computers: Cauer was interested in using them to solve linear systems to aid in filter designs.  His work on Filter circuits[b] was completed in 1931 while still in the US.[5]/nCauer met, and had strong contacts with, many of the key researchers in the field of filter design at Bell Labs.  These included Hendrik Bode, George Campbell, Sidney Darlington, Foster and Otto Zobel.[11]/nFor a short while, Cauer worked for the Wired Radio Company in Newark, New Jersey but then returned to G\u00f6ttingen with the intention of building a fast analogue computer there.  However, he was unable to obtain funding due to the depression.[5]/nCauer seems to have got on very poorly with his German colleagues.  According to Rainer Pauli, his correspondence with them was usually brief and business-like, rarely, if ever, discussing issues in depth.  By contrast, his correspondence with his American and European acquaintances was warm, technically deep and often included personal family news and greetings.[12]  This correspondence went beyond his American contacts and included A.C. Bartlett of the General Electric Company in Wembley, Roger Julia of Lignes T\u00e9l\u00e9graphiques et T\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques in Paris, mathematicians Gustav Herglotz, Georg Pick and Hungarian graph theorist D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig.[11]/nAfter leaving the Technical Institute for Mix & Genest, Cauer sought to become active in  the Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker (VDE, the German Electrical Engineers Society).  He left the VDE, however, in 1942 after a serious falling out with Wagner, previously his PhD supervisor and ally.[12]/nIn November 1933 Cauer signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State./nThe rising force of Nazism became a major obstacle to Cauer's work from 1933 onwards.  The anti-Jewish hysteria of the time forced many academics to leave their posts, including the director of the Mathematics Institute, Richard Courant.  Although Cauer was not Jewish, it became known that he had a Jewish ancestor, Daniel Itzig, who had been a banker to Frederick II of Prussia.  While this revelation was not sufficient to have Cauer removed under the race laws, it stifled his future career.  Thus he gained the title of professor but was never given a chair.[7]/nBy 1935 Cauer had three children whom he was finding increasingly difficult to support,  which prompted him to return to industry.  In 1936 he temporarily worked for the aircraft manufacturer Fieseler at their Fi 156 Storch works in Kassel and then became director of the laboratory of Mix & Genest in Berlin.  Nevertheless, he did continue to lecture at the Technical University in Berlin from 1939.[7]/nIn 1941, the first volume of his main work, Theory of Linear AC Circuits was published.[e]  The original manuscript to the second volume was destroyed as a result of the war.  Although Cauer was able to reproduce this work, he was not able to publish it and it too was lost during the war.  Some time after his death, however, his family arranged for the publication of some of his papers as the second volume,[f] based on surviving descriptions of the intended contents of volume II.[7]/nAfter taking his children to stay with relatives in Witzenhausen (in Hesse) to protect them from the expected fall of Berlin to the Russians, Cauer, against advice, returned to Berlin.  His body was located after the end of the war in a mass grave of victims of Russian executions. Cauer had been shot dead in Berlin-Marienfelde by Soviet soldiers[13] as a hostage.[1] Soviet intelligence was actively looking for scientists they could use in their own researches and Cauer was on their list of people to find but it would seem that this was unknown to his executioners.[7]/nThe major part of Cauer's legacy is his contribution to the network synthesis of passive networks. He is considered the founder of the field and the publication of his principal work in English was enthusiastically greeted, even though this did not happen until seventeen years later (in 1958).[14][15]  Prior to network synthesis, networks, especially filters, were designed using the image impedance method.  The accuracy of predictions of response from such designs depended on accurate impedance matching between sections.  This could be achieved with sections entirely internal to the filter but it was not possible to perfectly match to the end terminations.  For this reason, image filter designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response.  The choice of form of such sections was more a matter of designer experience than design calculation.  Network synthesis entirely did away with the need for this.  It directly predicted the response of the filter and included the terminations in the synthesis.[16]/nCauer treated network synthesis as being the inverse problem of network analysis.  Whereas network analysis asks what is the response of a given network, network synthesis on the other hand asks what are the networks that can produce a given desired response.  Cauer solved this problem by comparing electrical quantities and functions to their mechanical equivalents.  Then, realising that they were completely analogous, applying the known Lagrangian mechanics to the problem.[17]/nAccording to Cauer, there are three major tasks that network synthesis has to address.  The first is the ability to determine whether a given transfer function is realisable as an impedance network.  The second is to find the canonical (minimal) forms of these functions and the relationships (transforms) between different forms representing the same transfer function.  Finally, it is not, in general, possible to find an exact finite-element solution to an ideal transfer function - such as zero attenuation at all frequencies below a given cutoff frequency and infinite attenuation above.  The third task is therefore to find approximation techniques for achieving the desired responses.[17]/nInitially, the work revolved around one-port impedances.  The transfer function between a voltage and a current amounting to the expression for the impedance itself.  A useful network can be produced by breaking open a branch of the network and calling that the output.[10]/nCauer's work was initially ignored because his canonical forms made use of ideal transformers.  This made his circuits of less practical use to engineers.  However, it was soon realised that Cauer's Tchebyscheff approximation could just as easily be applied to the rather more useful ladder topology and ideal transformers could be dispensed with.  From then on network synthesis began to supplant image design as the method of choice.[10]/nMost of the above work is contained in Cauer's first[b] and second[e] monographs and is largely a treatment of one-ports.  In his habilitation thesis[c] Cauer begins to extend this work by showing that a global canonical form cannot be found in the general case for three-element kind multiports (that is, networks containing all three R, L and C elements) for the generation of realisation solutions, as it can be for the two-element kind case.[23]/nCauer extended the work of Bartlett and Brune on geometrically symmetric 2-ports to all symmetric 2-ports, that is 2-ports which are electrically symmetrical but not necessarily topologically symmetrical, finding a number of canonical circuits.  He also studied antimetric 2-ports.  He also extended Foster's theorem to 2-element LC n-ports (1931) and showed that all equivalent LC networks could be derived from each other[d] by linear transformations.[10]", "63724852": "Jan S.

A canonical election seems to have taken place in October, 1264, but the successful candidate was not present in Perugia.  Cardinal Guy Folques (Fulcoldi) was in northern France.  He had been appointed Apostolic Legate to England, with powers to intervene in the baronial war between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort, but his entry into England had been blocked.[9]  He did not reach Perugia to accept the papal throne until 5 February 1265.[10]/nOn 16 June 1265, Cardinal Guillaume of S.

Gertrude in Cologne.[11]/nAt Perugia on 21 May 1265, Pope Clement IV confirmed a judgment made by Cardinal Guillaume of S. Marco and Cardinal Ottavio Ubaldini of S. Maria in Via lata, on a dispute involving members of the Roman Curia and the townspeople of Perugia regarding the paying of rents for domiciles when they were absent from the Curia or when no audiences were being held.[12]/nOn 4 February 1266, Cardinal Guillaume subscribed a bull in favor of the Abbey of Cluny.[13]  Next day he subscribed a bull in favor of the Hospital of S. Pietro in Prato.[14]  In December, 1266, Pope Clement granted Cardinal Guillaume the privilege of disposing of prebendaries in the dioceses of Laon and Reims, which had been granted to Archbishop-elect Jean de Courtenai.[15]/nIn the summer of 1267, Guillaume de Bray was Auditor (Judge) in the case of a disputed election at the Monstery of S. Pierre de Altovillari in the diocese of Reims;  his decision was confirmed by the Pope on 21 August 1267.[16]  Pope Clement IV  confirmed a judgment of Cardinal Guillaume in favor of the Preceptor of the Knights of the Order of S. John of Jerusalem in Germany against a monastery in the diocese of Constanz on 23 December 1267.[17]/nOn 5 January 1268, the Pope confirmed a judgment made by Cardinal Odo of Chateauroux and Cardinal Guillaume de Bray in the matter of a contested election for the position of Abbot of a monastery in the diocese of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne.[18]/nPope Clement IV died in Viterbo on 29 November 1268. At his own request he was buried in the Dominican church, S. Maria in Gradi, though his body was transferred, during the Sede Vacante, to the Cathedral of S. Lorenzo.  The act was carried out by the Bishop, Archpriest and Canons of the Cathedral, anticipating that popular enthusiasm which began to see miracles at the dead pope's body might lead to a canonization. They preferred that the Cathedral should benefit rather than the Dominicans./nThe vacancy in the Holy See lasted two years, nine months and two days.  Since the cardinals were absolutely unable to agree on one of themselves as a possible pope, they decided to follow a different sanctioned procedure for electing a pope, called the \"Way of Compromise\".  Each of the cardinals, including Guillaume de Bray, signed a document entrusting the choice of a pope to a committee of six cardinals, providing that five of the six had to agree on the candidate for a successful election.  But Cardinal Guillaume was not a member of the Committee of Compromise.[19] After the Election had taken place on September 1, 1271, and an outsider, a non-cardinal had been elected,[20]  while the Cardinals were awaiting the arrival of the pope-elect, Teobaldo Visconti, from the Holy Land, on 23 November 1271, they ordered an inquiry into the removal of the Pope's body, and placed Cardinal Guillaume de Bray of S. Marco and Cardinal Uberto de Coconato of S. Eustachio in charge.  They ordered that the body and its monument be returned to the Church of S. Maria in Gradi.[21]/nIn 1272, Guillaume de Bray was named Chamberlain of the College of Cardinals.[22]/nUnder Pope Gregory X,  Cardinal Guillaume was named Auditor (judge) in the case of a monastery election in the diocese of Agen; the case was still active on 15 February 1278 under Pope Nicholas III.[23]  He was also Auditor in the case of a double election in the diocese of Monopoli after the death of Bishop Giulio.[24]/nHe was present at the opening ceremonies of the Second Council of Lyon on 1 May 1274.[25]  On 6 June 1274, a Consistory was held in Lyons, and Cardinal Guillaume de Bray is listed on a document as one of thirteen cardinals in attendance on that day.[26]/nHe was one of the cardinals who accompanied Pope Gregory X on his return trip from Lyon in 1275.  He was present at Lausanne on 20 October 1275, when the German King Rudolf I of Habsburg swore his oath of fealty to the Roman Church, in anticipation of his being crowned Emperor by the Pope.[27]/nCardinal Guillaume de Bray was one of the twelve (or thirteen) cardinals who participated in the papal Conclave of 20\u201321 January 1276, at Arezzo, where Gregory X had died, in which Pierre de Tarentaise, OP, of Savoy, was elected and chose the name Innocent V.[28]  He was also one of thirteen cardinals who took part in the Conclave of July, 1276, which was held in Rome, where Innocent V had died. The Conclave began on 2 July and concluded on 11 July with the election of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi of Genoa, who took the name Adrian V.  King Charles of Sicily, the Senator of Rome, acted as governor of the Conclave. His administration of the Conclave was exceedingly rigorous, though unfair in his favoring the French faction. It is no surprise that one of his supporters was chosen pope. Adrian immediately ratified the peace treaty which had been worked out by the Genoese (or at least the pro-French Genoese) and King Charles.[29]  Ultimately King Charles' manipulations came to nothing, when Adrian died thirty nine-days later, on August 18.  Before he died, however, he did one important act.  He suspended the papal Constitution \"Ubi Periculum\", which had been drawn up by Pope Gregory X and ratified by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274.  This constitution provided the rules and regulations for the operation of a Conclave.  Adrian and the Cardinals agreed that it did not work well, and that it needed revisions.  Cardinal Guillaume of S. Marco is specifically mentioned as not having been present,  due to illness,  at the discussions which lead to the suspension of \"Ubi Periculum\".[30]  Adrian was planning these revisions during a trip to Viterbo when he suddenly died.  He had not been ordained, consecrated or crowned. The Conclave of September, 1276, in Viterbo, therefore, was the scene of considerable disorder both in the Roman Curia and in the townspeople.  Once the disorders were quelled, the election was quick.  The eleven Cardinals who were present agreed on Cardinal Peter of Lisbon, who became Pope John XXII.[31]/nCardinal Guillaume de Bray had been one of the episcopal examiners appointed by Pope Innocent V in the case of the election of Bishop Henri of Therouane, approval of which had been refused by the Archbishop of Reims under Pope Gregory X.  An appeal had been lodged with Pope Gregory, and Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini had been assigned as Auditor.  But Gregory had died in January, 1276, and the opponents to the appeal withdrew their objections, and so Cardinal Guillaume and his colleagues were appointed by Pope Innocent V to  proceed to the examination of the election itself and the candidate.  Then Innocent V died, and shortly after that Adrian V as well, and it was finally John XXI who accepted the examiners' judgment and ratified the election.[32]  On 27 March, 1277, the election of an Archimandrite (Abbot) of the Basilian monastery of Cardona was confirmed by Pope John XXI on the recommendation of a committee of cardinals which included Guillaume of S. Marco.[33]/nCardinal Guillaume de Bray was one of the cardinals who sat in Consistory at S. Peter's on 4 May 1278, when King Rudolf's ambassador, Fr. Conradus, O.Min., publicly ratified the agreements reached between the King and the late Pope Gregory X at Lausanne on 20 October 1275.[34]  On 3 February 1279, he was one of nine cardinals who subscribed the new Constitution for the Canons and Beneficiati of S. Peter's Basilica.[35]/nOn March 12, 1278, Pope Nicholas III (Orsini) created nine new cardinals, most of whom were not of the French or Angevin faction.[36]  This was a challenge to King Charles I of Naples, who had been the principal political factor in Roman and Italian politics since 1265.  Nicholas manipulated Charles into resigning the Senatorship, which Nicholas took into his own hands.  He also required Charles to resign his post as Rector of Tuscany, where the Pope placed two of his nephews instead.[37]  This ensured a continuous struggle during Nicholas' reign between Guelfs and Ghibbelines, French and Romans.  It furthermore ensured that the future Conclave on his death would pit the Imperial party and French party against each other./nEarly in the year 1278, Cardinal Guillaume was a member of a committee of three cardinals who examined the canonical election and the personal character of Arnoldus de Villa, Bishop of Dax.  The appointment was approved on their recommendation by Pope Nicholas.[38]  A similar case, that of Giovanni Boccamazza, the Archbishop-elect of Monreale (and future cardinal), was handled in the summer of 1278.[39]/nOn 18 March 1279, he and nine other cardinals subscribed two bulls for the benefit of the Monastery of Cluny,[40] and yet another on 7 May 1279.[41] In the spring of 1279 he sat on a cardinalatial committee that advised the Pope on the disputed election to the See of Sorrento.[42]  In September, he was a member of the committee that examined the election of William Wickwane, Archbishop-elect of York; a technical defect in the canonical election was found, and the election overturned.  But Pope Nicholas then immediately provided (appointed) William Wickwane as Archbishop anyway.[43]/nAnother case concerned the Church of Vannes.  When Bishop Guy died in October, 1270,  the Cathedral Chapter split into two parties and engaged in a double election.  Both sides appealed to Pope Gregory X, who appointed an examination committee.  The case was still pending when Gregory died, and John XXI appointed another committee, of which Cardinal Guillaume de Bray was a member.  But then Pope John died on 20 May 1277, and it was only on 12 December 1279, that the election was settled by Pope Nicholas III.[44]/nEarly in 1280 Cardinal Guillaume was Auditor (judge) in the case of a disputed election in the monastery of S. Launomarius Blesensis in the Diocese of Chartres.[45]/nPope Nicholas III died at his summer retreat at Soriano near Viterbo on 22 August 1280.[46] Guillaume de Bray was one of thirteen cardinals alive at the time of the Pope's death.  His party, the French-Angevin, had sufficient votes to exclude any candidate they considered unfriendly, but the Roman party led by the Orsini was also in the same position.  With a two-thirds vote required for a canonical election, a bitter struggle was inevitable.[47]  The struggle began in Rome as soon as the death was known, with a revolt against the Orsini faction by a pro-Angevin faction headed by Riccardo Annibaldi. When the revolt failed, the Annibaldi fled the city, but then managed to get the people of Viterbo, where the Conclave was meeting, to revolt against their Podest\u00e0 (Governor), another Orsini papal nephew named Orso Orsini.  Annibaldi became the \"Protector of the Conclave\", and managed the city for the benefit of the French faction.  There were three Orsini cardinals, however, and with only a little support from two or three of their uncle's cardinals, the French faction could get nowhere. That situation continued for some five months./nBut suddenly, on 2 February 1281, the Conclave was invaded by a mob led by Riccardo Annibaldi and six of his captains, and the three Orsini cardinals were seized.  Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini was released, but the other two were hauled off to imprisonment.  Three days later, the late Pope's brother, Cardinal Giordano Orsini, was released and allowed to rejoin his colleagues in Conclave.  But Cardinal Matteo Rosso Orsini was held until after the Conclave had concluded.  Even with this degree of intimidation, though, it took the cardinals to agree on a French candidate, Cardinal Simon de Brion, who had been Papal Legate in France for more than a decade, and who had been the leading figure in bringing Charles of Anjou to Italy in the first place.[48]  He chose to be called Martin IV.[49]/nHe immediately approached the Roman leaders, hoping to be crowned at S. Peter's, according to tradition.  He was flatly refused. The Romans wanted nothing to do with the puppet of Charles I and the Annibaldi.  He would not be crowned in Viterbo, since the city was under Interdict and Excommunication for their actions against the Cardinals in Conclave.  Martin IV and the Papal Curia therefore moved to Orvieto, where he was crowned in the Cathedral of S. Pietro on Sunday, March 23, 1281, and where he resided for the next fifteen months. On June 27, 1284, Martin IV was forced to leave Orvieto because of the hostility of Raynerius, the Captain of the People. On October 4, 1284, he arrived in Perugia, where he died on March 28, 1285./nUnder Martin IV (Simon de Brion), Cardinal Guillaume continued to be appointed to episcopal and abbatial examination committees.  Early in 1282, he was one of the examiners of the election of the monk Jacobus de Roma to be abbot of S. Paul's Outside the Walls' but, before the examination was concluded, Jacobus resigned the election, and the Pope appointed Bartholomeo, Abbot of S. Gregorio in Clivo Scauri instead.[50]  He was also a member of a committee of cardinals who had been appointed by Pope Nicholas IV to examine the election of an Abbess of the monastery of S. Victorino in Benevento, but then Nicholas died and the examination continued under Martin IV, but Cardinal Guillaume of S. Marco died before the final papal decision, which was given on 23 November 1282.[51]/nCardinal Guillaume de Bray died in Orvieto on 29 April 1282,[52] and was buried in the Church of the Dominicans, with a monument designed by Arnolfo di Cambio, that is his first signed work.

Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Paris. He was educated there in engineering at the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, but emigrated to the US in 1905./nHe was badly injured in an industrial accident in 1907, losing both hands.[6] He moved towards mathematics, receiving a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1911.[7] He then took positions in University of Nebraska and University of Kansas, moving to Princeton University in 1924, where he was soon given a permanent position. He remained there until 1953./nIn the application of topology to algebraic geometry, he followed the work of Charles \u00c9mile Picard, whom he had heard lecture in Paris at the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris. He proved theorems on the topology of hyperplane sections of algebraic varieties, which provide a basic inductive tool (these are now seen as allied to Morse theory, though a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections is a more subtle system than a Morse function because hyperplanes intersect each other). The Picard\u2013Lefschetz formula in the theory of vanishing cycles is a basic tool relating the degeneration of families of varieties with 'loss' of topology, to monodromy. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg.[8] His book L'analysis situs et la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique from 1924, though opaque foundationally given the current technical state of homology theory, was in the long term very influential (one could say that it was one of the sources for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures, through SGA 7  also for the study of Picard groups of Zariski surface).

He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1925 and the American Philosophical Society in 1929.[9][10]/nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, now a basic result of topology, was developed by him in papers from 1923 to 1927, initially for manifolds. Later, with the rise of cohomology theory in the 1930s, he contributed to the intersection number approach (that is, in cohomological terms, the ring structure) via the cup product and duality on manifolds. His work on topology was summed up in his monograph Algebraic Topology (1942). From 1944 he worked on differential equations./nHe was editor of the Annals of Mathematics from 1928 to 1958. During this time, the Annals became an increasingly well-known and respected journal, and Lefschetz played an important role in this.[11]/nIn 1945 he travelled to Mexico for the first time, where he joined the Institute of Mathematics at the National University of Mexico as a visiting professor.

Shoda graduated at Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science at Tokyo University in 1925 and continued his graduate study under Takagi's supervision./nIn 1925, in his second year at the Graduate School of Tokyo University, Shoda got a scholarship which allowed him to study in Germany. With an interest in group theory, he went to Berlin to work with Issai Schur. After one year in Berlin, Shoda went to G\u00f6ttingen to study with Emmy Noether. Noether's school brought a mathematical growth to him. In 1929 he returned to Japan. Soon afterwards, he began to write Abstract Algebra, his mathematical textbook in Japanese for advanced learners. It was published in 1932 and soon recognised as a significant work for mathematics in Japan. It became a standard textbook and was reprinted many times. In 1931 he defended his thesis, titled \"\u00dcber direkt zerlegbare Gruppen\".[1]/nIn 1933, Shoda was appointed as professor in the Faculty of Science at Imperial Osaka University, which was founded in 1931, as the eighth Imperial University of Japan and hence the second one in the Kansai region, to promote industries in Osaka, therefore focusing on natural science, engineering and medicine in particular./nThe decades from the 1930s were a hard time for Japanese researchers. However, Shoda continued to apply himself to learning. After World War II, he was elected the first Chairman of the Mathematical Society of Japan in 1946, when the predecessor was divided into the Mathematical Society of Japan and the Physical Society of Japan.[2][3] In this role he managed to reconstruct Japanese mathematics both theoretically and organisationally. Also, he was eager to attempt to keep the educational standard at Osaka University as its faculty staff. In this period, he published General Algebra, another textbook in Japanese. In 1949 Shoda was awarded the Japan Academy Prize in recognition of his fine achievements. Also that year he was elected the Dean of the Faculty of Science at Osaka University./nIn 1955, Shoda was appointed as President of Osaka University, a role in which he remained for six years. His achievements as president include foundations of two new faculties: the Faculty of Letters and the Faculty of Engineering Science, both based at Toyonaka, Osaka. The Faculty of Engineering Science was an ambitious attempt to synthesise two traditional disciplines: science and engineering. Some criticise the Faculty of Engineering Science as being nothing less than a duplicate of the Faculty of Engineering, while others recognise it as having helped to promote academic collaboration between multiple disciplines, including science, engineering and sometimes medical science./nShoda is remembered by the students and alumni of Osaka University as the founder of the Shoda Cup, which is given for the winning team of five people in an athletics contest. Shoda worried that most students were lacking in physical education and paid too little attention to it. With this Cup, he attempted to invoke interest for sporting activities among students. It succeeded and the Shoda Cup has been contested yearly by many students./nWhen his term as president ended in 1961, Shoda left Osaka University but suddenly returned as a professor in the Faculty of Engineering Science founded that year, and was appointed its first dean. After retirement from Osaka University, he still worked to improve the Japanese educational system in this field. He taught in Musashi University in Tokyo and became its president. In 1969, he was awarded the Order of Culture, and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1974./nOn March 20, 1977, Shoda died unexpectedly while driving with his family. He was posthumously raised to the second degree in the official order of precedence, and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun./nKenjiro Shoda married twice. His first wife was Tami Hirayama, the daughter of astronomer Shin Hirayama. He fathered one son and two daughters during this marriage. After the death of his first wife, Shoda married Sadako Ito, daughter of Eisaburo Ito, an engineering scientist and professor at Kyushu University. The remarried couple had one son./nAfter his death, his family contributed a part of his legacy to some academic institutions including Osaka University. Osaka University used the money to make a small garden near to two of his former workplaces: the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Engineering Science and named it after him. \"Shoda Garden\", a silent cozy space, is at the corner of main street of the campus, beside the building of the Cyber Media Center at Toyonaka, backed by dense bamboo woods. Sometimes people at Toyonaka hold their parties there, like a welcoming party for freshmen, or a barbecue just for fun and communication./nEmpress Michiko is one of his nieces.", "69492125": "Celia Margaret Theodora Greenwood is a Canadian biostatistician specializing in statistical genetics.

The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the Almagest, although it was originally entitled the Math\u0113matik\u0113 Syntaxis or Mathematical Treatise, and later known as The Greatest Treatise. The second is the Geography, which is a thorough discussion on maps and the geographic knowledge of the Greco-Roman world. The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day. This is sometimes known as the Apotelesmatika (lit. \"On the Effects\") but more commonly known as the Tetr\u00e1biblos, from the Koine Greek meaning \"Four Books\", or by its Latin equivalent Quadripartite./nUnlike most Greek mathematicians, Ptolemy's writings (foremost the Almagest) never ceased to be copied or commented upon, both in Late Antiquity and in the Middle Ages.[3] However, it is likely that only a few truly mastered the mathematics necessary to understand his works, as evidenced particularly by the many abridged and watered-down introductions to Ptolemy's astronomy that were popular among the Arabs and Byzantines.[4][5]/nPtolemy lived in or around the city of Alexandria, in the Roman province of Egypt under Roman rule,[6] had a Latin name, which is generally taken to imply he was also a Roman citizen,[7] cited Greek philosophers, and used Babylonian observations and Babylonian lunar theory. In half of his extant works, Ptolemy addresses a certain Syrus, a figure of whom almost nothing is known but who likely shared some of Ptolemy's astronomical interests.[8]/nThe 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou (\u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u0390\u03c2 \u1f19\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5) in the Thebaid (\u0398\u03b7\u03b2\u1fb1\u0390\u03c2). This attestation is quite late, however, and there is no evidence to support it.[9]/nClaudius Ptolemy died in Alexandria c.\u2009168.[10]:\u200a311/nPtolemy's Greek name, Ptolemaeus (\u03a0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, Ptolema\u00eeos), is an ancient Greek personal name. It occurs once in Greek mythology and is of Homeric form.[11] It was common among the Macedonian upper class at the time of Alexander the Great and there were several of this name among Alexander's army, one of whom made himself pharaoh in 323 BC: Ptolemy I Soter, the first pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Almost all subsequent pharaohs of Egypt, with a few exceptions, were named Ptolemies until Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC, ending the Macedonian family's rule.[12][13]/nThe name Claudius is a Roman name, belonging to the gens Claudia; the peculiar multipart form of the whole name Claudius Ptolemaeus is a Roman custom, characteristic of Roman citizens. Several historians have made the deduction that this indicates that Ptolemy would have been a Roman citizen.[15] Gerald Toomer, the translator of Ptolemy's Almagest into English, suggests that citizenship was probably granted to one of Ptolemy's ancestors by either the emperor Claudius or the emperor Nero.[16]/nThe 9th century Persian astronomer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi mistakenly presents Ptolemy as a member of Ptolemaic Egypt's royal lineage, stating that the descendants of the Alexandrine general and Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter were wise \"and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the Almagest\". Abu Ma'shar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line \"composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy\". We can infer historical confusion on this point from Abu Ma'shar's subsequent remark: \"It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the Almagest. The correct answer is not known.\"[17] Not much positive evidence is known on the subject of Ptolemy's ancestry, apart from what can be drawn from the details of his name, although modern scholars have concluded that Abu Ma'shar's account is erroneous.[18] It is no longer doubted that the astronomer who wrote the Almagest also wrote the Tetrabiblos as its astrological counterpart.[19] In later Arabic sources, he was often known as \"the Upper Egyptian\",[20] suggesting he may have had origins in southern Egypt.[21] Arabic astronomers, geographers, and physicists referred to his name in Arabic as Ba\u1e6dlumyus (Arabic: \u0628\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0645\u0652\u064a\u0648\u0633).[22]/nPtolemy wrote in Koine Greek,[23] and can be shown to have utilized Babylonian astronomical data.[24][25] He might have been a Roman citizen, but was ethnically either a Greek[1][26][27] or at least a Hellenized Egyptian.[26][28][29]/nAstronomy was the subject to which Ptolemy devoted the most time and effort; about half of all the works that survived deal with astronomical matters, and even others such as the Geography and the Tetrabiblos have significant references to astronomy.[5]/nPtolemy's Math\u0113matik\u0113 Syntaxis (Koine Greek: \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03a3\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, lit. \"Mathematical Systematic Treatise\"), better known as the Almagest, is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy. Although Babylonian astronomers had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating and predicting astronomical phenomena, these were not based on any underlying model of the heavens; early Greek astronomers, on the other hand, provided qualitative geometrical models to \"save the appearances\" of celestial phenomena without the ability to make any predictions.[30]/nThe earliest person that attempted to merge these two approaches was Hipparchus, who produced geometric models that not only reflected the arrangement of the planets and stars but could be used to calculate celestial motions.[31] Ptolemy, following Hipparchus, derived each of his geometrical models for the Sun, Moon, and the planets from selected astronomical observations done in the spanning of more than 800 years; however, many astronomers have for centuries suspected that some of his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations.[32]/nPtolemy presented his astronomical models alongside convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets.[33] The Almagest also contains a star catalogue, which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations but, unlike the modern system, they did not cover the whole sky (only what could be seen with the naked eye in the northern hemisphere).[34] For over a thousand years, the Almagest was the authoritative text on astronomy across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.[35]/nThe Almagest was preserved, like many extant Greek scientific works, in Arabic manuscripts; the modern title is thought to be an Arabic corruption of the Greek name H\u0113 Megist\u0113 Syntaxis (lit. \"The greatest treatise\"), as the work was presumably known in Late Antiquity.[36] Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and translated twice into Latin in the 12th century, once in Sicily and again in Spain.[37] Ptolemy's planetary models, like those of the majority of his predecessors, were geocentric and almost universally accepted until the reappearance of heliocentric models during the scientific revolution./nUnder the scrutiny of modern scholarship, and the cross-checking of observations contained in the Almagest against figures produced through backwards extrapolation, various patterns of errors have emerged within the work.[38][39] A prominent miscalculation is Ptolemy's use of measurements that he claimed were taken at noon, but which systematically produce readings now shown to be off by half an hour, as if the observations were taken at 12:30pm.[38]/nThe overall quality of Claudius Ptolemy's scholarship and place as \"one of the most outstanding scientists of antiquity\" has been challenged by several modern scientists, but prominently by Robert R. Newton in the 1977 book The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy, which asserted that the scholar fabricated his observations to fit his theories.[40] Newton accused Ptolemy of systematically inventing data or doctoring the data of earlier astronomers, and labelled him \"the most successful fraud in the history of science\".[38] One striking error noted by Newton was an autumn equinox said to have been observed by Ptolemy and \"measured with the greatest care\" at 2pm on 25 September 132, when the equinox should have been observed around 9:55am the day prior.[38]/nThe charges laid by Newton have been described as \"erudite and imposing\", but there has also been significant pushback against the findings.[38] Owen Gingerich, while agreeing that the Almagest contains \"some remarkably fishy numbers\",[38] including in the matter of the 30-hour displaced equinox, which he noted aligned perfectly with predictions made by Hipparchus 278 years earlier,[41] rejected the qualification of fraud.[38] Objections were also raised by Bernard Goldstein, who questioned Newton's findings and suggested that he had misunderstood the secondary literature, while noting that issues with the accuracy of Ptolemy's observations had long been known.[40] Other authors have pointed out that instrument warping or atmospheric refraction may explain Ptolemy's observation at a wrong time.[42][43]/nOthers found Newton's reassessment compelling, including Herbert Lewis, who, in attempting to disprove Newton, found himself agreeing that \"Ptolemy was an outrageous fraud.\"[39] In reworking Ptolemy's calculations, he found that \"all those result capable of statistical analysis point beyond question towards fraud and against accidental error\".[39]/nThe Handy Tables (Koine Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2) are a set of astronomical tables, together with canons for their use. To facilitate astronomical calculations, Ptolemy tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and eclipses of the Sun and Moon, making it a useful tool for astronomers and astrologers. The tables themselves are known through Theon of Alexandria's version. Although Ptolemy's Handy Tables do not survive as such in Arabic or in Latin, they represent the prototype of most Arabic and Latin astronomical tables or z\u012bjes.[44]/nAdditionally, the introduction to the Handy Tables survived separately from the tables themselves (apparently part of a gathering of some of Ptolemy's shorter writings) under the title Arrangement and Calculation of the Handy Tables.[45]/nThe Planetary Hypotheses (Koine Greek: \u1f59\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, lit. \"Hypotheses of the Planets\") is a cosmological work, probably one of the last written by Ptolemy, in two books dealing with the structure of the universe and the laws that govern celestial motion.[46] Ptolemy goes beyond the mathematical models of the Almagest to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres,[47] in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii (now known to actually be ~23,450 radii), while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth.[48]/nThe work is also notable for having descriptions on how to build instruments to depict the planets and their movements from a geocentric perspective, much like an orrery would have done for a heliocentric one, presumably for didactic purposes.[49]/nThe Analemma is a short treatise where Ptolemy provides a method for specifying the location of the Sun in three pairs of locally-oriented coordinate arcs as a function of the declination of the Sun, the terrestrial latitude, and the hour. The key to the approach is to represent the solid configuration in a plane diagram that Ptolemy calls the analemma.[50]/nIn another work, the Phaseis (Risings of the Fixed Stars), Ptolemy gave a parapegma, a star calendar or almanac, based on the appearances and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year.[51]/nThe Planisphaerium (Koine Greek: \u1f0d\u03c0\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03af\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, lit. 'Simplification of the Sphere') contains 16 propositions dealing with the projection of the celestial circles onto a plane. The text is lost in Greek (except for a fragment) and survives in Arabic and Latin only.[52]/nPtolemy also erected an inscription in a temple at Canopus, around 146\u2013147 AD, known as the Canobic Inscription. Although the inscription has not survived, someone in the sixth century transcribed it and manuscript copies preserved it through the Middle Ages. It begins: \"To the saviour god, Claudius Ptolemy (dedicates) the first principles and models of astronomy\", following by a catalogue of numbers that define a system of celestial mechanics governing the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars.[53]/nIn 2023, archaeologists have deciphered a manuscript which is a manual and describe how to construct a meteoroscope (\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd or \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd), an instrument used to trace distances and study the stars. Researchers strongly believe that the text belongs to Ptolemy. The manuscript was originally discovered in 1819 by Angelo Mai, who found it in a library at Bobbio Abbey.[54][55]/nPtolemy's second most well-known work is his Geographike Hyphegesis (Koine Greek: \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f59\u03c6\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2; lit. \"Guide to Drawing the Earth\"), known as the Geography, a handbook on how to draw maps using geographical coordinates for parts of the Roman world known at the time.[56][57] He relied on previous work by an earlier geographer, Marinus of Tyre, as well as on gazetteers of the Roman and ancient Persian Empire.[57][56] He also acknowledged ancient astronomer Hipparchus for having provided the elevation of the north celestial pole[58] for a few cities. Although maps based on scientific principles had been made since the time of Eratosthenes (c.\u2009276\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009195 BC), Ptolemy improved on map projections./nThe first part of the Geography is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. Ptolemy notes the supremacy of astronomical data over land measurements or travelers' reports, though he possessed these data for only a handful of places. Ptolemy's real innovation, however, occurs in the second part of the book, where he provides a catalogue of 8,000 localities he collected from Marinus and others, the biggest such database from antiquity.[59] About 6,300 of these places and geographic features have assigned coordinates so that they can be placed in a grid that spanned the globe.[5] Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as climata, the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc: the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the polar circle.[60] One of the places Ptolemy noted specific coordinates for was the now-lost Stone Tower which marked the midpoint on the ancient Silk Road, and which scholars have been trying to locate ever since.[61]/nIn the third part of the Geography, Ptolemy gives instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (oikoumen\u0113) and of the Roman provinces, including the necessary topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His oikoumen\u0113 spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the Atlantic Ocean to the middle of China, and about 80 degrees of latitude from Shetland to anti-Meroe (east coast of Africa); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean.[56][57]/nIt seems likely that the topographical tables in the second part of the work (Books 2\u20137) are cumulative texts, which were altered as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy.[62] This means that information contained in different parts of the Geography is likely to be of different dates, in addition to containing many scribal errors. However, although the regional and world maps in surviving manuscripts date from c.\u20091300 AD (after the text was rediscovered by Maximus Planudes), there are some scholars who think that such maps go back to Ptolemy himself.[59]/nPtolemy wrote an astrological treatise, in four parts, known by the Greek term Tetrabiblos (lit. \"Four Books\") or by its Latin equivalent Quadripartitum.[63] Its original title is unknown, but may have been a term found in some Greek manuscripts, Apotelesmatik\u00e1 (bibl\u00eda), roughly meaning \"(books) on the Effects\" or \"Outcomes\", or \"Prognostics\".[64] As a source of reference, the Tetrabiblos is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".[65] It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain.[66]/nMuch of the content of the Tetrabiblos was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized. It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the Almagest was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the sublunary sphere.[4][18] Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the planets, based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying.[67] Ptolemy dismisses other astrological practices, such as considering the numerological significance of names, that he believed to be without sound basis, and leaves out popular topics, such as electional astrology (interpreting astrological charts to determine courses of action) and medical astrology, for similar reasons.[68]/nThe great popularity that the Tetrabiblos did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology, and as a compendium of astrological lore, rather than as a manual. It speaks in general terms, avoiding illustrations and details of practice./nA collection of one hundred aphorisms about astrology called the Centiloquium, ascribed to Ptolemy, was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew scholars, and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the Tetrabiblos as a kind of summation.[5] It is now believed to be a much later pseudepigraphical composition. The identity and date of the actual author of the work, referred to now as Pseudo-Ptolemy, remains the subject of conjecture.[69]/nPtolemy wrote a work entitled Harmonikon (Koine Greek: \u1f09\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd), known as the Harmonics, on music theory and the mathematics behind musical scales in three books.[70] It begins with a definition of harmonic theory, with a long exposition on the relationship between reason and sense perception in corroborating theoretical assumptions. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argues for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of Aristoxenus), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the overly theoretical approach of the Pythagoreans).[71][72]/nPtolemy introduces the harmonic canon, an experimental apparatus that would be used for the demonstrations in the next chapters, then proceeds to discuss Pythagorean tuning. Pythagoreans believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3:2, whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve tetrachords and octaves.[73] He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. The book ends with a more speculative exposition of the relationships between harmony, the soul (psyche), and the planets (harmony of the spheres).[74]/nAlthough Ptolemy's Harmonics never had the influence of his Almagest or Geography, it is nonetheless a well-structured treatise and contains more methodological reflections than any other of his writings.[75][76] During the Renaissance, Ptolemy's ideas inspired Kepler in his own musings on the harmony of the world (Harmonice Mundi, Appendix to Book V).[77]/nThe Optica (Koine Greek: \u1f48\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac), known as the Optics, is a work that survives only in a somewhat poor Latin version, which, in turn, was translated from a lost Arabic version by Eugenius of Palermo (c.\u20091154). In it, Ptolemy writes about properties of sight (not light), including reflection, refraction, and colour. The work is a significant part of the early history of optics and influenced the more famous and superior 11th-century Book of Optics by Ibn al-Haytham.[78] Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour, size, shape, movement, and binocular vision. He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgmental factors. He offered an obscure explanation of the Sun or Moon illusion (the enlarged apparent size on the horizon) based on the difficulty of looking upwards.[79][80]/nThe work is divided into three major sections. The first section (Book II) deals with direct vision from first principles and ends with a discussion of binocular vision. The second section (Books III-IV) treats reflection in plane, convex, concave, and compound mirrors.[81] The last section (Book V) deals with refraction and includes the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water, for which the values (with the exception of the 60\u00b0 angle of incidence) show signs of being obtained from an arithmetic progression.[82] However, according to Mark Smith, Ptolemy's table was based in part on real experiments.[83]/nPtolemy's theory of vision consisted of rays (or flux) coming from the eye forming a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer's intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation.[78][84] This was one of the early statements of size-distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy, a view supported by the Stoics.[85]/nAlthough mainly known for his contributions to astronomy and other scientific subjects, Ptolemy also engaged in epistemological and psychological discussions across his corpus.[86] He wrote a short essay entitled On the Criterion and Hegemonikon (Koine Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u039a\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f29\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fe1), which may have been one of his earliest works. Ptolemy deals specifically with how humans obtain scientific knowledge (i.e., the \"criterion\" of truth), as well as with the nature and structure of the human psyche or soul, particularly its ruling faculty (i.e., the hegemonikon).[74] Ptolemy argues that, to arrive at the truth, one should use both reason and sense perception in ways that complement each other. On the Criterion is also noteworthy for being the only one of Ptolemy's works that is devoid of mathematics.[87]/nElsewhere, Ptolemy affirms the supremacy of mathematical knowledge over other forms of knowledge. Like Aristotle before him, Ptolemy classifies mathematics as a type of theoretical philosophy; however, Ptolemy believes mathematics to be superior to theology or metaphysics because the latter are conjectural while only the former can secure certain knowledge. This view is contrary to the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, where theology or metaphysics occupied the highest honour.[86] Despite being a minority position among ancient philosophers, Ptolemy's views were shared by other mathematicians such as Hero of Alexandria.[88]/nThere are several characters or items named after Ptolemy, including:", "35216813": "Karl Joseph Bobek (1855\u20131899) was a German mathematician working on elliptic functions and geometry./n/n/nThis article about a German mathematician is a stub.

With help from E. T. Whittaker, whose son J. M. Whittaker was a college friend, he then took the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. At Cambridge he fell under the influence of the geometer H. F. Baker. He gained a Cambridge BA degree in 1925, receiving the MA in 1930 and the Doctor of Science (ScD) degree in 1950.[9]/nIn 1926 he took up a teaching position at the University of Bristol, and began work on the interface between the Italian school of algebraic geometry, particularly problems posed by Francesco Severi, and the topological methods of Solomon Lefschetz. This made his reputation, but led to some initial scepticism on the part of Lefschetz. According to Atiyah's memoir, Lefschetz and Hodge in 1931 had a meeting in Max Newman's rooms in Cambridge, to try to resolve issues. In the end Lefschetz was convinced.[2]\nIn 1928 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, Charles Glover Barkla, and Sir Charles Galton Darwin. He was awarded the Society's Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for the period 1964 to 1968.[10]/nIn 1930 Hodge was awarded a Research Fellowship at St. John's College, Cambridge. He spent the year 1931\u20132 at Princeton University, where Lefschetz was, visiting also Oscar Zariski at Johns Hopkins University. At this time he was also assimilating de Rham's theorem, and defining the Hodge star operation. It would allow him to define harmonic forms and so refine the de Rham theory./nOn his return to Cambridge, he was offered a University Lecturer position in 1933. He became the Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge, a position he held from 1936 to 1970. He was the first head of DPMMS./nHe was the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1958 to 1970, and vice-president of the Royal Society from 1959 to 1965.  He was knighted in 1959. Amongst other honours, he received the Adams Prize in 1937 and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1974./nHe died in Cambridge on 7 July 1975./nThe Hodge index theorem was a result on the intersection number theory for curves on an algebraic surface: it determines the signature of the corresponding quadratic form. This result was sought by the Italian school of algebraic geometry, but was proved by the topological methods of Lefschetz./nThe Theory and Applications of Harmonic Integrals[11] summed up Hodge's development during the 1930s of his general theory. This starts with the existence for any K\u00e4hler metric of a theory of Laplacians \u2013 it applies to an algebraic variety V (assumed complex, projective and non-singular) because projective space itself carries such a metric. In de Rham cohomology terms, a cohomology class of degree k is represented by a k-form \u03b1 on V(C). There is no unique representative; but by introducing the idea of harmonic form (Hodge still called them 'integrals'), which are solutions of Laplace's equation, one can get unique \u03b1. This has the important, immediate consequence of splitting up/ninto subspaces/naccording to the number p of holomorphic differentials dzi wedged to make up \u03b1 (the cotangent space being spanned by the dzi and their complex conjugates). The dimensions of the subspaces are the Hodge numbers./nThis Hodge decomposition has become a fundamental tool. Not only do the dimensions hp,q refine the Betti numbers, by breaking them into parts with identifiable geometric meaning; but the decomposition itself, as a varying 'flag' in a complex vector space, has a meaning in relation with moduli problems. In broad terms, Hodge theory contributes both to the discrete and the continuous classification of algebraic varieties./nFurther developments by others led in particular to an idea of mixed Hodge structure on singular varieties, and to deep analogies with \u00e9tale cohomology./nThe Hodge conjecture on the 'middle' spaces Hp,p is still unsolved, in general. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems set up by the Clay Mathematics Institute./nHodge also wrote, with Daniel Pedoe, a three-volume work Methods of Algebraic Geometry, on classical algebraic geometry, with much concrete content \u2013 illustrating though what \u00c9lie Cartan called 'the debauch of indices' in its component notation. According to Atiyah, this was intended to update and replace H. F. Baker's Principles of Geometry./nIn 1929 he married Kathleen Anne Cameron.[12]", "14343599": "Harley M.

Ford at the Illinois Institute of Technology and asked for more challenging reading. Ford recommended A Course in Mathematical Analysis[2] by Edouard Goursat, translated by Earle Hedrick, which included challenging exercises.

He joined the faculty at University of California at Berkeley. In 1955 Flanders heard Charles Loewner speak there on continuous groups.

With prompting from editor Griewank, Flanders included application of the algorithm to automatic differentiation of implicit functions.[8] Recalling his early exposure to the formula of Faa di Bruno, Flanders wrote, \"I think Faa's formula is quite inefficient for the practical computation of numerical (not symbolic) derivatives.\"[3]/nHarley Flanders died July 26, 2013, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[1]/nFlanders is known for advancing an approach to multivariate calculus that is independent of coordinates through treatment of differential forms.\nAccording to Shiing-Shen Chern, \"an affine connection on a differentiable manifold gives rise to covariant differentiations of tensor fields.

He was the first person to demonstrate that the Moon moved around the Earth in an elliptical orbit; and he was the only person to predict the transit of Venus of 1639, an event which he and his friend William Crabtree were the only two people to observe and record. Most remarkably, Horrocks correctly asserted that Jupiter was accelerating in its orbit while Saturn was slowing and interpreted this as due to mutual gravitational interaction, thereby demonstrating that gravity's actions were not limited to the Earth, Sun, and Moon.[3]/nHis early death and the chaos of the English Civil War nearly caused the loss to science of his treatise on the transit, Venus in sole visa; but for this and his other work he is acknowledged as one of the founding fathers of British astronomy./nJeremiah Horrocks was born at Lower Lodge Farm in Toxteth Park, a former royal deer park near Liverpool, Lancashire.[4] His father James had moved to Toxteth Park to be apprenticed to Thomas Aspinwall, a watchmaker, and subsequently married his master's daughter Mary. Both families were well educated Puritans; the Horrocks sent their younger sons to the University of Cambridge and the Aspinwalls favoured Oxford.[5] For their unorthodox beliefs the Puritans were excluded from public office, which tended to push them towards other callings; by 1600 the Aspinwalls had become a successful family of watchmakers.[4] Jeremiah was introduced early to astronomy; his boyhood chores included measuring the local noon used to set local clocks,[6] and his Puritan upbringing instilled an enduring suspicion of astrology, witchcraft and magic.[7]/nIn 1632, Horrocks matriculated at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge as a sizar. At Cambridge he associated with the mathematician John Wallis and the platonist John Worthington. At that time he was one of only a few at Cambridge to accept Copernicus's revolutionary heliocentric theory, and he studied the works of Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe and others.[8]/nIn 1635, for reasons not clear, Horrocks left Cambridge without graduating.[9] Marston suggests that he may have needed to defer the extra cost this entailed until he was employed,[2] whilst Aughton speculates that he may have failed his exams due to concentrating too much on his own interests, or that he did not want to take Anglican orders, and so a degree was of limited use to him.[10]/nNow committed to the study of astronomy, Horrocks began to collect astronomical books and equipment; by 1638 he owned the best telescope he could find. Liverpool was a seafaring town so navigational instruments such as the astrolabe and cross staff were easy to find. But there was no market for the very specialised astronomical instruments he needed, so his only option was to make his own. He was well placed to do this; his father and uncles were watchmakers with expertise in creating precise instruments. Apparently he helped with the family business by day and, in return, the watchmakers in his family supported his vocation by assisting in the design and construction of instruments to study the stars at night.[11]/nHorrocks owned a three-foot radius astronomicus \u2013 a cross staff with movable sights used to measure the angle between two stars \u2013 but by January 1637 he had reached the limitations of this instrument and so built a larger and higher precision version.[12] While a youth he read most of the astronomical treatises of his day and marked their weaknesses; by the age of seventeen he was suggesting new lines of research./nTradition has it that after he left home he supported himself by holding a curacy in Much Hoole, near Preston in Lancashire, but there is little evidence for this.[2] According to local tradition in Much Hoole, he lived at Carr House, within the Bank Hall Estate, Bretherton. Carr House was a substantial property owned by the Stones family who were prosperous farmers and merchants, and Horrocks was probably a tutor for the Stones' children.[13]/nHorrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth, and he posited that comets followed elliptical orbits. He supported his theories by analogy to the motions of a conical pendulum, noting that after a plumb bob was drawn back and released it followed an elliptical path, and that its major axis rotated in the direction of revolution as did the apsides of the Moon's orbit.[14] He anticipated Isaac Newton in suggesting the influence of the Sun as well as the Earth on the Moon's orbit. In the Principia[15] Newton acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to his theory of lunar motion. In the final months of his life Horrocks made detailed studies of tides in attempting to explain the nature of lunar causation of tidal movements.[16]/nJohannes Kepler had published his Rudolphine Tables in 1627. Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De raris mirisque Anni 1631, which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761.[17] Horrocks' own observations, combined with those of his friend and correspondent William Crabtree, had convinced him that Kepler's Rudolphine tables, although more accurate than the commonly used tables produced by Philip Van Lansberg, were still in need of some correction. Kepler's tables had predicted a near-miss of a transit of Venus in 1639 but, having made his own observations of Venus for years, Horrocks predicted a transit would indeed occur.[18]/nHorrocks made a simple helioscope by focusing the image of the Sun through a telescope onto a plane surface, whereby an image of the Sun could be safely observed. From his location in Much Hoole he calculated the transit would begin at approximately 3:00\u00a0pm on 24 November 1639, Julian calendar (or 4 December in the Gregorian calendar). The weather was cloudy but he first observed the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15\u00a0pm; and he continued to observe for half an hour until the Sun set. The 1639 transit was also observed by William Crabtree from his home in Broughton near Manchester./nHorrocks' observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess as to the size of Venus\u2014previously thought to be larger and closer to Earth\u2014and to estimate the distance between the Earth and the Sun, now known as the astronomical unit (AU). His figure of 95\u00a0million kilometres (59\u00a0million miles, 0.63\u00a0AU) was far from the 150\u00a0million kilometres (93\u00a0million miles) known today, but it was more accurate than any suggested up to that time./nA treatise by Horrocks on the study of the transit, Venus in sole visa (Venus seen on the Sun), was later published by the Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius at his own expense; it caused great excitement when revealed to members of the Royal Society in 1662, some 20 years after it was written. It presented Horrocks' enthusiastic and romantic nature, including humorous comments and passages of original poetry. When speaking of the century separating Venusian transits, he rhapsodised:/nIt was a time of great uncertainty in astronomy, when the world's astronomers could not agree amongst themselves and theologians fulminated against claims that contradicted Scripture. Horrocks, although a pious young man, came down firmly on the side of scientific determinism.[19]/nIt is wrong to hold the most noble Science of the Stars guilty of uncertainty on account of some people's uncertain observations. Through no fault of its own it suffers these complaints which arise from the uncertainty and error not of the celestial motions but of human observations . . . I do not consider that any imperfections in the motions of the stars have so far been detected, nor do I believe that they are ever to be found. Far be it from me to allow that God has created the heavenly bodies more imperfectly than man has observed them.  \u2013 Jeremiah Horrocks[19]/nHorrocks returned to Toxteth Park sometime in mid-1640 and died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, at the age of 22. As expressed by Crabtree, \"What an incalculable loss!\"[20] He has been described as a bridge which connected Newton with Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe and Kepler.[21]/nIt is believed that Horrocks was buried at Toxteth Unitarian Chapel, but there is seemingly no proof of this./nHorrocks is remembered on a plaque in Westminster Abbey[22] and the lunar crater Horrocks is named after him. In 1859, a marble tablet and stained-glass windows commemorating him were installed in the Parish Church of St Michael, Much Hoole.[13] Toxteth Unitarian Chapel contains a memorial plaque commemorating his achievements.[23] Horrocks Avenue in Garston, Liverpool, is also named after him./nIn 1927, the Jeremiah Horrocks Observatory was built at Moor Park, Preston.[24]/nThe 2012 transit of Venus was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website.[25]/nHorrocks and the transit of Venus feature in an episode (\"Dark Matter\") of the British television series Lewis.[26]/nIn 2011, a sculpture by Andy Plant, titled Heaven and Earth, was installed at Dock Head in Liverpool to celebrate Horrock's work on the transit of Venus. It consists of a telescope looking at a working orrery which has the planet Venus replaced by a figure of the astronomer depicted as an angel.[27]/nIn 2023 a new play, Horrox on Horrocks' short life and overlooked achievements, by playwright David Sear, was staged in Cambridge\u2019s ADC Theatre from 28 March to 1 April as part of the Cambridge festival.[28]/nThe Jeremiah Horrocks Institute for Astrophysics and Supercomputing was established in 1993 at the University of Central Lancashire.[29] In 2012 it was renamed the Jeremiah Horrocks Institute for Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy.", "8838575": "Nicholas Kratzer (1487? \u2013 1550), also known as Nicolaus Kratzer and Nicholas Crutcher, was a German mathematician, astronomer, and horologist. Much of Kratzer's professional life was spent in England, where he was appointed as astronomer to King Henry VIII./nBorn in Munich in 1486 or 1487,[1] Kratzer was the son of a saw-smith, and was educated at the Universities of Cologne (B.A. 1509) and Wittenberg. He came to England in 1516 and established himself as part of the artistic and scientific circle around Sir Thomas More.[2] Kratzer tutored More's children in mathematics and astronomy and More introduced him at court in much the same way as he had their mutual friend Hans Holbein, who produced a portrait of Kratzer. In the same manner as Holbein, Kratzer's talents obtained him a court position as astronomer and clock maker to the king./nKratzer also collaborated with Holbein on producing maps, and in return the artist produced a portrait of Kratzer in 1528 that now hangs in the Louvre; it depicts the craftsman surrounded by the tools of his trade, and with an unfinished polyhedral sundial. His close relationship with Holbein and More also may be observed in his annotations of Holbein's draft for his portrait of the More family.[4] Kratzer identifies the various family members and their ages for the benefit of More's friend, the theologian Erasmus./nKratzer (under the name Nich. Cratcherus) is recorded as a reader of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he is presumed to have taught mathematics.[3] He designed at least two fixed sundials in Oxford, neither of which now exist. One was in St Mary's churchyard,[5] the other in the garden of Corpus Christi.[3] He also designed a portable dial for Cardinal Wolsey, which is now in the History of Science Museum, Oxford.[6] Another dial attributed to Kratzer was found at Acton Court, near Bristol, in the 1980s.[7][8]/nPeter Drinkwater has presented a critical evaluation of the sundials attributed to Kratzer, in particular the one in the Holbein portrait.[9] He comments that \"Kratzer triumphed, not through genius or creativity, but through having learned what others had discovered and invented, and by being the first to apply that learning in England\". John North concurs: \"Kratzer doubtless had nothing new to offer of a fundamental kind. Many of his dials were unusual, but his favorite polyhedral dial was perhaps more useful as a repository of verses [...] than for actually announcing the time with any accuracy\". Nonetheless, Kratzer brought useful German skills and knowledge to the English court and was well-regarded over a period of nearly 30 years.[2]", "48258489": "Frank Merle (born 22 November 1962, in Marseille) is a French mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations and mathematical physics./nAfter graduation from the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS), Merle received in 1987 his Ph.D. from the University of Paris VI under Henri Berestycki with thesis Contributions a l'etude de certaines equations aux derivees partielles non lineaires de la physique mathematique.[1][2] He became a researcher for CNRS at ENS.

Mkhitar Djrbashian created some well-known mathematical theories (see, e.g.[5][6][7]) and did everything possible for the development of Armenian Mathematical School to the high international standards in many branches of mathematics./nDjrbashian was born to an old Van family, established before the fourteenth century, long before the rise of the Ottoman Empire, by a successful merchant who returned to his homeland from Iran and bought a piece of land in the Aygestan (Armenian: \u0531\u0575\u0563\u0565\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576, i.e. gardens) district of Van. The community water source was in his land, and his family got the obligation to make a fair distribution of the scarce water among the channels to Aygestan gardens for many centuries, according to quotas established by the community. This was the origin of the family name Jerbashkhian (Armenian: \u054b\u0580\u0562\u0561\u0577\u056d\u0575\u0561\u0576, i.e. water distributor). Mkhitar Djrbashian's father Mkrtich was one of the seven founders of the Van Guild of Merchants, which anticipated the possibility of Turkish military actions against the civilian population of their town and started collecting weapons for self-defense. In June 1915, he participated as a soldier in people's volunteer corps against the Turkish regular army sent to massacre all Armenian inhabitants and surrounding villages. Thanks to the offensive of the Russian Army or, more exactly, its Armenian volunteer unit, the inhabitants of Van and some villagers of the Vaspurakan Province were saved and then migrated with the Russian Army to the Erivan Governorate of Russian Empire. In the first years of the Soviet regime, Mkrtich Jerbashkhian continued importing European goods and selling them in the shops of his commercial company in Yerevan, Tiflis, and Baku. For this reason, he was deprived of voting rights in the Soviet Union and his elder son Mkhitar was excluded from the last year of school. Mkrtich Jerbashkhian kept secret his fluency in French and German languages and his political views to avoid NKVD repression./nOther branches of the Jerbashkhian family also were forced to leave their fatherland.

The family name Jerbashkhian later was simplified to Jerbashian, and it appears as Dzhrbashjan or Djrbashian in many mathematical publications in accordance with the Russian spelling./nMkhitar Djrbashian was born in Yerevan on September 11, 1918. Being deprived of continuing his secondary education in Yerevan, he accomplished his school education in Tiflis in 1936, thanks to the assistance of his uncle's family.

Over the next nearly seven years, Rejewski and fellow mathematician-cryptologists Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski developed and used techniques and equipment to decrypt the German machine ciphers, even as the Germans introduced modifications to their equipment and encryption procedures. Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II in Europe, the Poles shared their technological achievements with the French and British at a conference in Warsaw, thus enabling Britain to begin reading German Enigma-encrypted messages, seven years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of the machine. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code-named Ultra and contributed\u2014perhaps decisively\u2014to the defeat of Nazi Germany.[Note 1]/nIn 1929, while studying mathematics at Pozna\u0144 University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course conducted by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski to work on the problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His own contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb./nFive weeks before the Nazi German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rejewski and colleagues presented their achievements to French and British intelligence representatives summoned to Warsaw. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists were evacuated to France, where they continued breaking Enigma-enciphered messages. They and their support staff were again compelled to evacuate after the fall of France in June 1940, and they resumed work undercover a few months later in Vichy France. After the French \"Free Zone\" was occupied by Nazi Germany in November 1942, Rejewski and Zygalski fled via Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar to Britain. There they enlisted in the Polish Armed Forces and were put to work solving low-grade German ciphers./nIn the aftermath of World War II, Rejewski reunited with his family in Poland and worked as an accountant. For two decades, he remained silent about his prewar and wartime cryptologic work to avoid adverse attention from the country's Soviet-dominated government; he broke his silence in 1967 when he provided to the Polish Military Historical Institute his memoirs of his work in the Cipher Bureau. He died at age 74 of a heart attack and was interred with military honors at Warsaw's Pow\u0105zki Military Cemetery.[7]/nMarian Rejewski was born 16 August 1905 in Bromberg in the Prussian Province of Posen (now Bydgoszcz, Poland)[9] to J\u00f3zef and Matylda, n\u00e9e Thoms.[10]  After completing secondary school, he studied mathematics at Pozna\u0144 University's Mathematics Institute, housed in Pozna\u0144 Castle.[11]/nIn 1929, shortly before graduating from university, Rejewski began attending a secret cryptology course which opened on 15 January,[12] organized for select German-speaking mathematics students by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau with the help of the Mathematics Institute's Professor Zdzis\u0142aw Krygowski.  The course was conducted off-campus at a military facility[13] and, as Rejewski would discover in France in 1939, \"was entirely and literally based\" on a 1925 book by French colonel Marcel Givierge\u00a0[fr], Cours de cryptographie (Cryptography Course).[14]  Rejewski and fellow students Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki were among the few who could keep up with the course while balancing the demands of their normal studies.[15]/nOn 1 March 1929 Rejewski graduated with a Master of Philosophy degree in mathematics.[16] A few weeks after graduating, and without having completed the Cipher Bureau's cryptology course, he began the first year of a two-year actuarial statistics course at G\u00f6ttingen, Germany. He did not complete the statistics course, because while home for the summer of 1930, he accepted an offer, from Professor Krygowski, of a mathematics teaching assistantship at Pozna\u0144 University.[17] He also began working part-time for the Cipher Bureau, which by then had set up an outpost at Pozna\u0144 to decrypt intercepted German radio messages.[17] Rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near the Mathematics Institute in an underground vault referred to puckishly as the \"Black Chamber\".[18]/nThe Pozna\u0144 branch of the Cipher Bureau was disbanded in the summer of 1932. In Warsaw, on 1 September 1932, Rejewski, Zygalski, and R\u00f3\u017cycki joined the Cipher Bureau as civilian employees working at the General Staff building (the Saxon Palace).[19] Their first assignment was to solve a four-letter code used by the Kriegsmarine (German Navy). Progress was initially slow, but sped up after a test exchange\u2014consisting of a six-group signal, followed by a four-group response\u2014was intercepted. The cryptologists guessed correctly that the first signal was the question, \"When was Frederick the Great born?\" followed by the response, \"1712.\"[20]/nOn 20 June 1934 Rejewski married Irena Maria Lewandowska, daughter of a prosperous dentist.  The couple eventually had two children:  a son, Andrzej (Andrew), born in 1936; and a daughter, Janina (Joan), born in 1939.  Janina would later become a mathematician like her father.[7]/nThe Enigma machine was an electromechanical device, equipped with a 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (rotors and a reflector) that scrambled the input. The machine used a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, and the encipherment varied from one key press to the next.[21] For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily,[Note 2] so the machine code had to be \"broken\" anew each day.[23]/nBefore 1932, the Cipher Bureau had succeeded in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard,[Note 3] but had been unsuccessful with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use.[25][26] In late October or early November 1932, the head of the Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ci\u0119\u017cki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine for a couple of hours per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.[25]/nTo decrypt Enigma messages, three pieces of information were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau.[23]/nFirst Rejewski tackled the problem of discovering the wiring of the rotors. To do this, according to historian David Kahn, he pioneered the use of pure mathematics in cryptanalysis.[27] Previous methods had largely exploited linguistic patterns and the statistics of natural-language texts\u2014letter-frequency analysis. Rejewski applied techniques from group theory\u2014theorems about permutations\u2014in his attack on Enigma. These mathematical techniques, combined with material supplied by Gustave Bertrand,[Note 4] chief of French radio intelligence, enabled him to reconstruct the internal wirings of the machine's rotors and nonrotating reflector. \"The solution\", writes Kahn, \"was Rejewski's own stunning achievement, one that elevates him to the pantheon of the greatest cryptanalysts of all time.\"[29] Rejewski used a mathematical theorem\u2014that two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure\u2014that mathematics professor and Cryptologia co-editor Cipher A. Deavours describes as \"the theorem that won World War II\".[30]/nBefore receiving the French intelligence material, Rejewski had made a careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day.[25] For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form\u2014a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators.[31] The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.[32]/nFor example, suppose the operator chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors to the ground setting, which might be GBL on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited to break into the cipher.[31]/nRejewski studied these related pairs of letters. For example, if there were four messages that had the following indicators on the same day: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, then by looking at the first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. B was related to T, L was related to B, E was related to L, and T was related to E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter B was related to T, which was related to E, which was related to L, which was related to B (see diagram). This was a \"cycle of 4\", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be A\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n\nF\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n\nW\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rightarrow }\n\nA, or a \"cycle of 3\". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.[33]/nEnigma operators also had a tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators, such as girlfriends' initials or a pattern of keys that they saw on the Enigma keyboard. These became known to the allies as \"Cillies\" (\"Sillies\" misspelled). Using the data thus gained from the study of cycles and the use of predictable indicators, Rejewski was able to deduce six permutations corresponding to the encipherment at six consecutive positions of the Enigma machine. These permutations could be described by six equations with various unknowns, representing the wiring within the entry drum, rotors, reflector, and plugboard.[34]/nAt this point, Rejewski ran into difficulties due to the large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was solvable without further data.[35] But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932,[36][Note 5] the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him to reduce the number of unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.[38]/nThere was another obstacle to overcome, however. The military Enigma had been modified from the commercial Enigma, of which Rejewski had had an actual example to study. In the commercial machine, the keys were connected to the entry drum in German keyboard order (\"QWERTZU...\"). However, in the military Enigma, the connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order: \"ABCDEF...\" This new wiring sequence foiled British cryptologists working on Enigma, who dismissed the \"ABCDEF...\" wiring as too obvious. Rejewski, perhaps guided by an intuition about a German fondness for order, simply guessed that the wiring was the normal alphabetic ordering. He later recalled that, after he had made this assumption, \"from my pencil, as by magic, began to issue numbers designating the connections in rotor N. Thus the connections in one rotor, the right-hand rotor, were finally known.\"[35]/nThe settings provided by French Intelligence covered two months that straddled a changeover period for the rotor ordering. A different rotor happened to be in the right-hand position for the second month, and so the wirings of two rotors could be recovered by the same method.[Note 6]  Rejewski later recalled: \"Finding the [wiring] in the third [rotor], and especially... in the [reflector], now presented no great difficulties. Likewise there were no difficulties with determining the correct torsion of the [rotors'] side walls with respect to each other, or the moments when the left and middle drums turned.\"  By year's end 1932, the wirings of all three rotors and the reflector had been recovered. A sample message in an Enigma instruction manual, providing a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext produced using a stated daily key and message key, helped clarify some remaining details.[35]/nThere has been speculation as to whether the rotor wirings could have been solved without the documents supplied by French Intelligence. Rejewski recalled in 1980 that another way had been found that could have been used to solve the wirings, but that the method was \"imperfect and tedious\" and relied on chance.  In 2005, mathematician John Lawrence claimed that it would have taken four years for this method to have had a reasonable likelihood of success.[39] Rejewski had earlier written that \"the conclusion is that the intelligence material furnished to us should be regarded as having been decisive to solution of the machine.\"[35]/nAfter Rejewski had determined the wiring in the remaining rotors, he was joined in early 1933 by R\u00f3\u017cycki and Zygalski in devising methods and equipment to break Enigma ciphers routinely. Rejewski later recalled:/nNow we had the machine, but we didn't have the keys and we couldn't very well require Bertrand to keep on supplying us with the keys every month ... The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but we hadn't had the machine\u2014we solved the machine; now we had the machine but we didn't have the keys. We had to work out methods to find the daily keys.[40]/nA number of methods and devices had to be invented in response to continual improvements in German operating procedure and to the Enigma machine itself. The earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was the \"grill\", based on the fact that the plugboard's connections exchanged only six pairs of letters, leaving fourteen letters unchanged.[22] Next was R\u00f3\u017cycki's \"clock\" method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at the right-hand side of the Enigma machine on a given day.[41]/nAfter 1 October 1936, German procedure changed, and the number of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective.[22] However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's \"cyclometer\", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day.[22]/nThe cyclometer comprised two sets of Enigma rotors, and was used to determine the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12\u201320 minutes.[22][42] However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch.[22] Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%.[43]/nIn 1937 Rejewski, along with the German section of the Cipher Bureau, transferred to a secret facility near Pyry in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw. On 15 September 1938, the Germans introduced new rules for enciphering message keys (a new \"indicator procedure\"), making the Poles' earlier techniques obsolete.[Note 7] The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's bomba, an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which solved the daily keys within about two hours. Six bombas were built and were ready for use by mid-November 1938.[46] The bomba exploited the fact that the plugboard connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on 1 January 1939, increasing the number of plugboard connections, the usefulness of the bombas was greatly reduced. The British bombe, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish bomba, though the cryptologic methods embodied in the two machines were different.[47]/nAround the same time as Rejewski's bomba, a manual method was invented by Henryk Zygalski, that of \"perforated sheets\" (\"Zygalski sheets\"), which was independent of the number of plugboard connections.  Rejewski describes the construction of the Zygalski mechanism and its manipulation:/nFairly thick paper sheets, lettered \"a\" through \"z\", were prepared for all twenty-six possible positions of rotor L [the left-hand Enigma rotor] and a square was drawn on each sheet, divided into 51 by 51 smaller squares.  The sides, top, and bottom of each large square (it could as well be a rectangle) were lettered \"a\" through \"z\" and then again \"a\" through \"y\".  This was, as it were, a system of coordinates in which the abscissas and ordinates marked successive possible positions of rotors M [the middle Enigma rotor] and N [the right-hand Enigma rotor], and each little square marked permutations, with or without constant points, corresponding to those positions.  Cases with constant points were perforated.[48]\n[E]ach constant point had to be perforated as many as four times.  [...]  When the sheets were superposed and moved in the proper sequence and the proper manner with respect to each other, in accordance with a [precisely] defined program, the number of visible apertures gradually decreased.  And, if a sufficient quantity of data was available, there finally remained a single aperture, probably corresponding to the right case, that is, to the solution.  From the position of the aperture one could calculate the order of the rotors, the setting of their rings, and, by comparing the letters of the cipher keys with the letters in the machine, likewise permutation S; in other words, the entire cipher key.[49]/nHowever, application of both the bomba and Zygalski sheets was complicated by yet another change to the Enigma machine on 15 December 1938. The Germans had supplied Enigma operators with an additional two rotors to supplement the original three, and this increased the complexity of decryption tenfold.  Building ten times as many bombas (60 would now be needed) was beyond the Cipher Bureau's ability\u2014that many bombas would have cost fifteen times its entire annual equipment budget.[50]/nTwo and a half weeks later, effective 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plug connections to 7\u201310, which, writes Rejewski, \"to a great degree, decreased the usefulness of the bombs.\"   Zygalski's perforated (\"Zygalski\") sheets, writes Rejewski, \"like the card-catalog method, was independent of the number of plug connections.  But the manufacture of these sheets, [...] in our [...] circumstances, was very time-consuming, so that by 15 December 1938, only one-third of the whole job had been done.  [T]he Germans' [introduction of rotors] IV and V [...] increased the labor of making the sheets tenfold [since 60, or ten times as many, sets of sheets were now needed], considerably exceeding our [...] capacities.\"[51]/nAs it became clear that war was imminent and that Polish financial resources were insufficient to keep pace with the evolution of Enigma encryption (e.g., due to the prohibitive expense of an additional 54 bombas and due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in timely fashion the full 60 series of 26 \"Zygalski sheets\"[52]), the Polish General Staff and government decided to initiate their Western allies into the secrets of Enigma decryption.[53] The Polish methods were revealed to French and British intelligence representatives in a meeting at Pyry, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force cryptologist Captain Henri Braqueni\u00e9; Britain, by Government Code and Cypher School chief Alastair Denniston, veteran cryptologist Alfred Dillwyn Knox, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief Gwido Langer, the Bureau's German-Section chief Maksymilian Ci\u0119\u017cki, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor Stefan Mayer, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, R\u00f3\u017cycki and Zygalski.[54]/nThe Poles' gift of Enigma decryption to their Western allies, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Knowledge that the cipher was crackable was a morale boost to Allied cryptologists.[Note 8]  The British were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets\u2014they sent one to PC Bruno, outside Paris,[57] in mid-December 1939\u2014and began reading Enigma within months of the outbreak of war.[Note 9]/nWithout the Polish assistance, British cryptologists would, at the very least, have been considerably delayed in reading Enigma. Hugh Sebag-Montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British would have occurred only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly into Naval Enigma only after late 1942.[59]/nIntelligence gained from solving high-level German ciphers\u2014intelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans\u2014came chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that \"it is widely believed that Ultra saved the world at least two years of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning.\"[60]  The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having \"shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years\".[61]  The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes:  \"Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\"[62][Note 10]/nOn 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau began preparations to evacuate key personnel and equipment from Warsaw.  Soon a special evacuation train, the Echelon F, transported them eastward, then south.  By the time the Cipher Bureau was ordered to cross the border into allied Romania on 17 September, they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck. The vehicle was confiscated at the border by a Romanian officer, who separated the military from the civilian personnel. Taking advantage of the confusion, the three mathematicians ignored the Romanian's instructions. They anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by the Romanian security police, in which the German Abwehr and SD had informers.  The mathematicians went to the nearest railroad station, exchanged money, bought tickets, and boarded the first train headed south. After a dozen or so hours, they reached Bucharest, at the other end of Romania. There they went to the British embassy. Told by the British to \"come back in a few days\", they next tried the French embassy, introducing themselves as \"friends of Bolek\" (Bertrand's Polish code name) and asking to speak with a French military officer. A French Army colonel telephoned Paris and then issued instructions for the three Poles to be assisted in evacuating to Paris.[64]/nOn 20 October 1939 the three Polish cryptologists resumed work on German ciphers at a joint French\u2013Polish\u2013(anti-fascist) Spanish radio-intelligence unit stationed at Gretz-Armainvilliers, forty kilometers northeast of Paris, and housed in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vignolles (code-named PC Bruno).[65]/nAs late as 3\u20137 December 1939, when Lt. Col. Langer and French Air Force Capt. Henri Braqueni\u00e9 visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be made available to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish Army in exile was forming\u2014on French soil.[66]/nOn 17 January 1940 the Poles found the first Enigma key to be solved in France, one for 28 October 1939.[67] The PC Bruno staff collaborated by teleprinter with counterparts at Bletchley Park in England. For their mutual communications security, the Polish, French, and British cryptologic agencies used the Enigma machine itself.  Bruno closed its Enigma-encrypted messages to Britain with an ironic \"Heil Hitler!\"[68]/nIn the first months of 1940, Alan Turing\u2014principal designer of the British cryptological Bombe, elaborated from the Polish bomba\u2014would visit Bruno to confer about Enigma decryption with the three Polish cryptologists.[69]/nOn 24 June 1940, after Germany's victory in the Battle of France, Gustave Bertrand flew Bruno's international personnel\u2014including fifteen Poles, and seven Spaniards who worked on Italian ciphers[70]\u2014in three planes to Algeria.[71]/nSome three months later, in September 1940, they returned to work covertly in unoccupied southern, Vichy France. Rejewski's cover was as Pierre Ranaud, a lyc\u00e9e professor from Nantes. A radio-intelligence station was set up at the Ch\u00e2teau des Fouzes, code-named Cadix, near Uz\u00e8s.  Cadix began operations on 1 October. Rejewski and his colleagues solved German telegraph ciphers, and also the Swiss version of the Enigma machine (which had no plugboard).[72]  Rejewski may have had little or no involvement in working on German Enigma at Cadix.[Note 11]/nIn early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski were asked to try solving messages enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine based on the same cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.[75]/nThe youngest of the three Polish mathematicians who had worked together since 1929\u2014Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki\u2014died in the sinking of a French passenger ship on 9 January 1942, as he was returning  to Cadix from a stint in Algeria.[76] By summer 1942 work at Cadix was becoming dangerous, and plans for evacuation were drawn up. Vichy France was liable to be occupied by German troops, and Cadix's radio transmissions were increasingly at risk of detection by the German Funkabwehr, a unit tasked with locating enemy radio transmitters. Indeed, on 6 November a pickup truck equipped with a circular antenna arrived at the gate of the Ch\u00e2teau des Fouzes where the cryptologists were operating. The visitors, however, did not enter, and merely investigated nearby farms, badly frightening their occupants. Nonetheless, at Bertrand's suggestion French intelligence ordered the evacuation of Cadix.  The order was carried out on 9 November, the day after the Allied \"Operation Torch\" landings in North Africa. Three days later, on 12 November, the Germans occupied the chateau.[77]/nThe Poles were split into groups of two and three. On 11 November 1942 Rejewski and Zygalski were sent to Nice, in the Italian-occupied zone.  After coming under suspicion there, they had to flee again, moving or hiding constantly.  Their trek took them to Cannes, Antibes, back to Nice, then on to Marseilles, Toulouse, Narbonne, Perpignan, and Ax-les-Thermes, near the Spanish border.[78]  On 29 January 1943, accompanied by a local guide, Rejewski, and Zygalski, bound for Spain, began a climb over the Pyrenees, avoiding German and Vichy patrols. Near midnight, close to the Spanish border, the guide pulled out a pistol and demanded that they hand over their remaining money.[79]/nAfter being robbed, Rejewski and Zygalski succeeded in reaching the Spanish side of the border, only to be arrested within hours by security police.[80]  They were sent first to a prison in La Seu d'Urgell, then on 24 March transferred to a prison at Lerida. On 4 May 1943, after having spent over three months in Spanish prisons, on intervention by the Polish Red Cross the pair were released and sent to Madrid.[81] Leaving there on 21 July,[82] they made it to Portugal; from there, aboard HMS Scottish, to Gibraltar; and then by air to RAF Hendon in north London, arriving on 3 August 1943.[83]/nRejewski and Zygalski were inducted as privates into the Polish Armed Forces on 16 August 1943 and were posted to a Polish Army facility in Boxmoor, cracking German SS and SD hand ciphers. The ciphers were usually based on the Doppelkassettenverfahren (\"double Playfair\") system, which the two cryptologists had already worked on in France.[84] British cryptologist Alan Stripp suggests that \"Setting them to work on the Doppelkassetten system was like using racehorses to pull wagons.\"[85] On 10 October 1943, Rejewski and Zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants;[86] on 1 January 1945 Rejewski, and presumably also Zygalski, were promoted to lieutenant.[87] When Gustave Bertrand fled to England in June 1944, he and his wife were provided with a house in Boxmoor, a short walk from the Polish radio station and cryptology office, where it seems likely that his collaboration with Rejewski and Zygalski continued.[77]/nEnigma decryption, however, had become an exclusively British and American domain; the Polish mathematicians who had laid the foundations for Allied Enigma decryption were now excluded from making further contributions in this area.[88]  By that time, at Bletchley Park, \"very few even knew about the Polish contribution\" because of the strict secrecy and the \"need-to-know\" principle.[85]/nAfter the Germans suppressed the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, they sent Rejewski's wife and children west, along with other Warsaw survivors; the family eventually found refuge with her parents in Bydgoszcz.[7]  Rejewski was discharged from the Polish Army in Britain on 15 November 1946. Six days later, he returned to Poland to be reunited with his wife and family.[7] On his return, he was urged by his old Pozna\u0144 University professor, Zdzis\u0142aw Krygowski, to take a university mathematics post at Pozna\u0144 or Szczecin, in western Poland. Rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages as a result of the war. However, he was still recovering from rheumatism, which he had contracted in the Spanish prisons. Soon after his return to Poland, in the summer of 1947, his 11-year-old son Andrzej died of polio after only five days' illness.  After his son's death, Rejewski did not want to part, even briefly, with his wife and daughter, so they lived in Bydgoszcz with his in-laws.[7] He took a position in Bydgoszcz as director of the sales department at a cable-manufacturing company, Kabel Polski (Polish Cable).[citation needed]/nBetween 1949 and 1958 Rejewski was repeatedly investigated by the Polish Office of Public Security, who suspected he was a former member of the Polish Armed Forces in the West.[89] He retired in 1967, and moved with his family back to Warsaw in 1969, to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father-in-law.[7]/nRejewski had written a \"Report of Cryptologic Work on the German Enigma Machine Cipher\" in 1942.[90]  Before his 1967 retirement, he began writing his \"Memoirs of My Work in the Cipher Bureau of Section II of the [Polish] General Staff\", which were purchased by the Polish Military Historical Institute\u00a0[pl], in Warsaw.[7]  Rejewski had often wondered what use Alan Turing (who in early 1940 had visited the Polish cryptologists at PC Bruno outside Paris[69]) and the British at Bletchley Park had ultimately made of the Polish discoveries and inventions. For nearly three decades after the war, little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.[91]  In a 1967 book[92] W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kozaczuk, associated with the Military Historical Institute, disclosed Poland's breaking of the German Enigma ciphers./nUntil 1974, the scant information published concerning Enigma decryption attracted little attention. Ladislas Farago's 1971 best-seller The Game of the Foxes presented a garbled account of Ultra's origins: \"Commander Denniston went clandestinely to a secluded Polish castle [sic] on the eve of the war [to pick up an Enigma, 'the Wehrmacht's top system' during World War II]. Dilly Knox later solved its keying [sic]...\"[93] Still, this was marginally closer to the truth than many British and American best-seller accounts that would follow after 1974. Their authors were at a disadvantage: they did not know that the founder of Enigma decryption, Rejewski, was still alive and alert, and that it was reckless to fabricate stories out of whole cloth.[Note 12]/nWith Gustave Bertrand's 1973 publication of his Enigma, substantial information about the origins of Ultra began to seep out; and with F. W. Winterbotham's 1974 best-seller, The Ultra Secret, the dam began to burst. Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) fight to get the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil.[95]/nRejewski maintained a lively correspondence with his wartime French host, General Gustave Bertrand, and at the General's bidding he began translating Bertrand's Enigma into Polish.[95] In 1976, at the request of the J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski Institute of America, Rejewski broke enciphered correspondence of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski and his fellow Polish Socialist conspirators from 1904.[96] On 12 August 1978 he received from a grateful Polish people the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.[95]/nRejewski, who had been suffering from heart disease, died of a heart attack on 13 February 1980, aged 74, after returning home from a shopping trip. He was buried with military honors at Warsaw's Pow\u0105zki Military Cemetery.[7]/nOn 21 July 2000, Poland's President Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski posthumously awarded Poland's second-highest civilian decoration, the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, to Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski.[1]  In July 2005 Rejewski's daughter, Janina Sylwestrzak, received on his behalf the War Medal 1939\u20131945 from the British Chief of the Defence Staff.[2] On 1 August 2012 Marian Rejewski posthumously received the Knowlton Award of the U.S. Military Intelligence Corps Association;[97] his daughter Janina accepted the award at his home town, Bydgoszcz, on 4 September 2012. Rejewski had been nominated for the Award by NATO Allied Command Counterintelligence.[3]/nIn 2009, the Polish Post issued a series of four commemorative stamps, one of which pictured Rejewski and fellow mathematician-cryptologists Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski.[98]/nOn 5 August 2014 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) honored Rejewski, R\u00f3\u017cycki, and Zygalski with its prestigious Milestone Award, which recognizes achievements that have changed the world.[4][5]/nA three-sided bronze monument was dedicated in 2007 in front of the Imperial Castle in Pozna\u0144.

He came under the influence of Gaspard Monge, the Director of the new \u00c9cole polytechnique in Paris./nIn 1810, in response to difficulties he encountered in trying to publish his work, Gergonne founded his own mathematics journal, officially named the Annales de math\u00e9matiques pures et appliqu\u00e9es but generally referred to as the Annales de Gergonne. The most common subject of articles in his journal was geometry, Gergonne's specialty. Over a period of 22 years, the Annales de Gergonne published about 200 articles by Gergonne himself, and other articles by many distinguished mathematicians, including Poncelet, Servois, Bobillier, Steiner, Pl\u00fccker, Chasles, Brianchon, Dupin, Lam\u00e9, even Galois./nGergonne was appointed to the chair of astronomy at the University of Montpellier in 1816. In 1830, he was appointed Rector of the University of Montpellier, at which time he ceased publishing his journal. He retired in 1844./nGergonne was among the first mathematicians to employ the word polar. In a series of papers beginning in 1810, he contributed to elaborating the principle of duality in projective geometry, by noticing that every theorem in the plane connecting points and lines corresponds to another theorem in which points and lines are interchanged, provided that the theorem embodied no metrical notions. Gergonne was an early proponent of the techniques of analytical geometry and in 1814, he devised an elegant coordinate solution to the classical problem of Apollonius: to find a circle which touches three given circles, thus demonstrating the power of the new methods./nIn 1813, Gergonne wrote the prize-winning essay for the Bordeaux Academy, Methods of synthesis and analysis in mathematics, unpublished to this day and known only via a summary. The essay is very revealing of Gergonne's philosophical ideas. He called for the abandonment of the words analysis and synthesis, claiming they lacked clear meanings. Surprisingly for a geometer, he suggested that algebra is more important than geometry at a time when algebra consisted almost entirely of the elementary algebra of the real field. He predicted that one day quasi-mechanical methods would be used to discover new results./nIn 1815, Gergonne wrote the first paper on the optimal design of experiments for polynomial regression. According to S. M. Stigler, Gergonne is the pioneer of optimal design as well as response surface methodology./nHe published his \"Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des d\u00e9finitions\" (An essay on the theory of definition) in his Annales in 1818. This essay is generally credited for first recognizing and naming the construct of implicit definition.[1][2]", "1465866": "Kelly Miller (July 18, 1863 \u2013 December 29, 1939) was an American mathematician, sociologist, essayist, newspaper columnist, author, and an important figure in the intellectual life of black America for close to half a century.  He was known as \"the Bard of the Potomac\".[1]/nKelly Miller was the third of six children born to Elizabeth Miller and Kelly Miller Sr. His mother was a former slave and his father was a freed black man who was conscripted into the Winnsboro Regiment of the Confederate Army. Miller was born in Winnsboro, South Carolina, where he would attend local primary and grade school./nFrom 1878 to 1880, Miller attended the Fairfield Institute.[2] Based on his achievements, he was offered a scholarship to Howard University, a historically black college. Miller finished the preparatory department's three-year curriculum in Latin and Greek, then mathematics, in two years. After finishing one department, he quickly moved on to the next one. Miller attended the College Department at Howard from 1882 to 1886./nIn 1886, Miller was given the opportunity to study advanced mathematics with Captain Edgar Frisby. Frisby was an English mathematician working at the US Naval Observatory. Frisby's assistant, Simon Newcomb, noticed Miller's intellectual ability and recommended that he study at Johns Hopkins University. Miller spent the following two years at Johns Hopkins University (1887-1889) and became the first African-American student to attend the university. Miller studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy.[3] He was the first African American to study graduate mathematics in the United States.[4]/nMiller was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[5]/nUnable to continue attending Johns Hopkins University due to financial limitations, Miller taught mathematics at the M Street High School in Washington, D.C. from 1889 to 1890. Appointed professor of mathematics at Howard in 1890, Miller introduced sociology (the development, structure, and functioning of human society) into the curriculum in 1895, serving as professor of sociology from 1895 to 1934. Miller graduated from Howard University School of Law in 1903.[6] In 1907, Miller was appointed dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.[6]/nHis deanship lasted twelve years, and in that time, the college changed significantly. The old classical curriculum was modernized and new courses in the natural sciences and the social sciences were added. Miller was an avid supporter of Howard University and actively recruited students to the school. In 1914, he planned a Negro-American Museum and Library. He persuaded Jesse E. Moorland to donate his large private library on blacks in Africa and the United States to Howard University and it  became the foundation for his Negro-Americana Museum and Library center.[3]/nHe was a participant in the March 5, 1897 meeting to celebrate the memory of Frederick Douglass, which founded the American Negro Academy led by Alexander Crummell.[7]  Until the organization was discontinued in 1928, Miller remained one of the most active members of this first major African American learned society, refuting racist scholarship, promoting black claims to individual, social, and political equality, and publishing early histories and sociological studies of African American life.[8]/nMiller gained his well-known national importance from his involvement in another movement led by W. E. B. Du Bois. He showed intellectual leadership during the conflict between the \"accommodations\" of Booker T. Washington and the \"radicalism\" of the growing civil rights. Miller was known in two ways to the public./nOn African-American education policy, Miller aligned himself with neither the \"radicals\" \u2014 Du Bois and the Niagara Movement \u2014 nor the \"conservatives\" \u2014 the followers of Booker T. Washington.[citation needed] Miller sought a middle way, a comprehensive education system that would provide for \"symmetrical development\" of African-American citizens by offering both vocational and intellectual instruction.[9]/nIn February 1924, Miller was elected chairman of the Negro Sanhedrin, a civil rights conference held in Chicago that brought together representatives of 61 African-American organizations to forge closer ties and attempt to craft a common program for social and political reform.[10]/nHe believed that blacks should favor free market rather than government or union power, stating:/nThe capitalist has but one dominating motive, the production and sale of goods. The race or color of the producer counts but little.... The capitalist stands for an open shop which gives to every man the unhindered right to work according to his ability and skill. In this proposition the capitalist and the Negro are as one.[11]/nHe was critical of racially biased policing, saying in 1935 that police violence harmed community trust: \"Too often the policeman's club is the only instrument of the law with which the Negro comes into contact. This engenders in him a distrust and resentful attitude toward all public authorities and law officers\".[12]/nMiller was a prolific writer of articles and essays which were published in major newspapers, magazines, and several books, including Out of the House of Bondage. Miller  assisted W. E. B. Du Bois in editing The Crisis, the official journal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[6] Miller started off publishing his articles anonymously in the Boston Transcript. He wrote about both radical and conservative groups. Miller also shared his views in the Educational Review, Dial, Education, and the Journal of Social Science. His anonymous articles later became subject for his lead essay in his book Race Adjustment published in 1908. Miller suggested that African Americans had the right to protest against the unjust circumstances that came with the rise of white supremacy in the South. Miller supported racial harmony, thrift, and institution building.[3]/nIn 1917, Miller published an open letter to President Woodrow Wilson in the Baltimore Afro-American against lynching, which he called \"national in its range and scope,\" and called the government's failure to stop it \"the disgrace of democracy.\"[13] He also stated \"It is but hollow mockery of the Negro when he is beaten and bruised in all parts of the nation and flees to the national government for asylum, to be denied relief on the basis of doubtful jurisdiction. The black man asks for protection and is given a theory of government.\"[3]/nIt was circulated as a pamphlet in the camp libraries of the US armed forces for about a year until \"the department of military censorship\" ordered it removed because it \"tended to make the soldier who read [it] a less effective fighter against the German.\"[14] Miller published Kelly Miller's History of the World War for Human Rights which included \"A wonderful Array of Striking Pictures Made from Recent Official Photographs, Illustrating and Describing the New and Awful Devices Used in the Horrible Methods of Modern Warfare, together with Remarkable Pictures of the Negro in Action in Both Army and Navy\" in 1919./nAfter the First World War, Miller's life became difficult. He was demoted in 1919 to dean of a new junior college after J. Stanley Durkee was appointed as president of Howard in 1918 and built a new central administration. Miller continued to publish articles and weekly columns in black presses. His views were published in more than 100 newspapers.[citation needed]/nMiller died in 1939, on Howard's campus. He was survived by his wife Annie May Butler, four of his five children: Kelly the III, May, Irene, and Paul. His son, Isaac Newton, preceded him in death.[15]/nA 160-unit housing development in LeDroit Park, constructed in 1941, was named in his honor, as was Kelly Miller Middle School in Washington, DC.[16]", "2481674": "William Prager, (before 1940) Willy Prager, (May 23, 1903 in Karlsruhe \u2013 March 17, 1980 in Zurich) was a German-born US applied mathematician.

The authors set up the so-called chromatic spectral sequence relating this \n\n\n\n\nE\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle E^{2}}\n\n-term to the cohomology of the Morava stabilizer group, which exhibits certain periodic phenomena in the Adams\u2013Novikov spectral sequence and can be seen as the beginning of chromatic homotopy theory. Applying this, the authors compute the second line of the Adams\u2013Novikov spectral sequence and establish the non-triviality of a certain family in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. In all of this, the authors use work by Jack Morava and themselves on Brown\u2013Peterson cohomology and Morava K-theory./nIn the second paper, Ravenel expands these phenomena to a global picture of stable homotopy theory leading to the Ravenel conjectures. In this picture, complex cobordism and Morava K-theory control many qualitative phenomena, which were understood before only in special cases.

In the teaching and examining of the infinitesimal calculus, the notations and ideas of Gottfried Leibniz were introduced, alongside those traditionally taught of Isaac Newton.[13]/nAs a tutor, Hustler diverted George Airy away from applying to Peterhouse, which had been recommended by Thomas Clarkson, a friend of Hustler's, and taught him at Trinity.[14] Airy had been taught by a master at his school in Colchester, Thomas Rogers (1789\u20131860), a graduate from Sidney Sussex College in 1811, covering the university topics to fluxions and the Principia. Hustler and his tutorial assistant George Peacock were in 1819 passed work by Airy.[15][16] In 1820, Hustler arranged an exhibition (minor scholarship) for Airy, via the Norwich Member of Parliament William Smith.[17]/nPeacock then gave Airy special teaching in the contemporary calculus methods, and Airy responded by working over results of Samuel Vince and Robert Woodhouse.[15] When Airy began experimenting with the Argand diagram in 1820, Peacock encouraged him in linking it to trigonometry, but Hustler disapproved.[17]/nIn 1822, Hustler intervened to place Airy and some of his peers, ahead of the usual schedule, in the \"questionist\" group of those being prepared for the final stage of the Mathematical Tripos.

In 1554 he left his home country and travelled to Turin, where he enjoyed the patronage of the powerful Duke of Savoy./nStadius subsequently worked in Cologne, Brussels and Paris.  In Paris, he debated with the trigonometrist Maurice Bressieu of Grenoble and made astrological predictions for the French court.  In his Tabulae Bergenses (1560), Stadius calls himself both royal mathematician (of Philip II of Spain) and mathematician to the Duke of Savoy.[1]/nDuring his stay in Brussels Stadius published his first work, the Ephemerides novae et auctae, first published by the publisher Arnold Birckmann of Cologne in 1554.  An ephemeris (plural: ephemerides) (from the Greek word ephemeros, \"daily\") was, traditionally, a table providing the positions (given in a Cartesian coordinate system, or in right ascension and declination or, for astrologers, in longitude along the zodiacal ecliptic), of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets in the sky at a given moment in time; the astrological positions are usually given for either noon or midnight depending on the particular ephemeris that is used./nThis work posited a link between mathematics and medicine and was influential on Tycho Brahe and Nostradamus.  Stadius had been encouraged to publish the Ephemerides by his old teacher Gemma Frisius.  Frisius had in a letter written in 1555 urged Stadius not to be afraid of being accused of believing in a moving earth and a stationary sun (i.e. the theory of Copernicus) or of abandoning the medieval Alfonsine Tables in favor of his own observations.   In this letter Frisius further wrote that the system devised by Copernicus gave a better understanding of planetary distances, as well as of certain features of retrograde motion. Frisius' letter was published in several editions of the Ephemerides./nStadius died in Paris where he is buried.  The inscription on his epitaph states that he died on 17 June 1579 and that he had lived for nearly 52 years and 2 months. Stadius' estimated birth date of 1 May 1527 is based on this inscription.[1]/nThe lunar crater Stadius is named after Stadius./nMedia related to Joannes Stadius at Wikimedia Commons", "68869852": "Angela Bacelar Mariotto is a statistician who researches the development and improvement of cancer progress measures.

In 1995 he proposed that the energy-density of the universe was dominated by the energy of empty space.[25]  In 1998 this prediction was confirmed by two observational collaborations and in 2011 the Nobel Prize was awarded for their discovery.  Krauss has formulated a model in which the Universe could have potentially come from \"nothing\", as outlined in his 2012 book A Universe from Nothing. He explains that certain arrangements of relativistic quantum fields might explain the existence of the Universe as we know it while disclaiming that he \"has no idea if the notion [of taking quantum mechanics for granted] can be usefully dispensed with\".[26] As his model appears to agree with experimental observations of the Universe (such as its shape and energy density), it is referred to by some as a \"plausible hypothesis\".[27][28] His model has been criticized by cosmologist and theologian George Ellis,[29] who said it \"is not tested science\" but \"philosophical speculation\"./nInitially, Krauss was skeptical of the existence of the Higgs boson.[30] However, after it was detected by CERN, he has been researching the implications of the Higgs field on the nature of dark energy.[31]/nKrauss has argued that public policy debates in the United States should have a greater focus on science.[32][33][34][35] He criticized Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson's statements on science, writing that Carson's remarks \"suggest he never learned or chooses to ignore basic, well-tested scientific concepts\".[36][37]/nKrauss has described himself as an antitheist[38] and takes part in public debates on religion. Krauss is featured in the 2013 documentary The Unbelievers, in which he and Richard Dawkins travel across the globe speaking publicly about the importance of science and reason as opposed to religion and superstition.[39] He has participated in many debates with religious apologists, including William Lane Craig[40] and John Lennox.[41]/nIn his book A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing (2012), Krauss discusses the premise that something cannot come from nothing, which has often been used as an argument for the existence of a prime mover. He has since argued in a debate with John Ellis and Don Cupitt that the laws of physics allow for the Universe to be created from nothing. \"What would be the characteristics of a universe that was created from nothing, just with the laws of physics and without any supernatural shenanigans? The characteristics of the universe would be precisely those of the ones we live in.\"[42] In an interview with The Atlantic, however, he states that he has never claimed that \"questions about origins are over\". According to Krauss, \"I don't ever claim to resolve that infinite regress of why-why-why-why-why; as far as I'm concerned it's turtles all the way down\".[43]/nSince 2020, Krauss has devoted much of his public writing and speaking to combatting attempts to inject ideology into science[44] and to defending free speech and free inquiry in science, and in academia more generally.  He has written extensively on these issues[45] and has appeared alongside numerous other free speech advocates including Anna Krylov and Jordan Peterson in addressing this issue.[46]/nHe has been invited to speak on this issue by numerous groups, as diverse as the National Association of Scholars[47] and Forbes.[48] A recent survey article by numerous academics highlighting these problems in Science,[49] referenced several of his articles on the subject.

In 2012, he was awarded the National Science Board's Public Service Medal for his contributions to public education in science and engineering in the United States.[51]/nKrauss helped to organize a 2006 conference on gravity, funded by Jeffrey Epstein's science foundation. The conference was held on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.[52]/nKrauss defended Epstein after his 2008 guilty plea of procuring for prostitution a girl below age 18. In 2011, Krauss told an interviewer, \"As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people...I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\"[53][54]/nHarvard Professor Steven Pinker said that Krauss was one of several colleagues who invited him to \"salons and coffee klatsches\" that included Epstein.[55]/nIn a February 2018 article describing allegations that \"range from offensive comments to groping and non-consensual sexual advances\",[56] BuzzFeed reported a variety of sexual misconduct claims against Krauss, including two complaints from his years at Case Western Reserve University.[57] Krauss responded that the article was \"slanderous\" and \"factually incorrect\".[56] In a public statement, he apologized to anyone he made feel intimidated or uncomfortable, but stated that the BuzzFeed article \"ignored counter-evidence, distorted the facts and made absurd claims about [him].\"[58][59]/nASU stated that they had not received complaints from faculty, staff, or students before the BuzzFeed article but subsequently began an internal investigation regarding an accusation that Krauss grabbed a woman's breast while at a convention in Australia.[4] Investigators interviewed two eyewitnesses, and two other witnesses who immediately spoke with the unnamed woman. The witnesses described the woman as troubled and shocked. The woman told investigators that \"she did not feel victimized, felt it was a clumsy interpersonal interaction and thought she had handled it in the moment.\"[4] ASU found that the preponderance of evidence suggested that Krauss had violated the university's policy against sexual harassment by grabbing a woman's breast without her permission.[60][61] As a result, Krauss was not renewed as director of the Origins Project and the university moved its staff to a project run by planetary scientist Lindy Elkins-Tanton, formally ending the Origins project.[62]/nIn response to the university determination, Krauss produced a 51-page appeal document responding to the allegations, including a counter-claim that a photo claimed to be of Krauss grabbing a woman's breast was actually showing his hand moving away from the woman.[63][third-party source needed]/nSeveral organizations also canceled scheduled talks by Krauss.[56] Krauss resigned from the position of chair of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Board of Sponsors when informed that its other members felt his presence was distracting \"from the ability of the Bulletin to effectively carry out [its] work\".[64][65]/nKrauss retired from ASU at the end of the 2018\u20132019 academic year.[66]/nKrauss has authored or co-authored more than three hundred scientific studies and review articles on cosmology and theoretical physics.", "745193": "Herbert Ellis Robbins (January 12, 1915 \u2013 February 12, 2001) was an American  mathematician and statistician.

His 1982 book[11][12] with H. Peyton Young[13] has had direct practical application in apportioning the seats of assemblies to regions in several countries (including the UK). He conceived and developed with others \"biproportional apportionment\" that has been adopted (as of 2014) in five of Switzerland's cantonal elections. His 2010 book with Rida Laraki[14] proposes a new theory and method of voting called \"majority judgment\" where voters evaluate the merit of each candidate in a well-defined ordinal scale (instead of voting for one or several candidates, or rank-ordering them) and majorities determine society's evaluation of each candidate and thereby its rank-ordering of them all.

His 1670 book, the Observationes diametrorum solis et lunae apparentium, proposed a natural standard of length based on the circumference of the Earth, divided decimally. It was influential in the adoption of the metric system in 1799./nBased on the measurements of the size of the Earth conducted by Riccioli of Bologna (at 321,815 Bologna feet to the degree), Mouton proposed a decimal system of measurement based on the circumference of the Earth, explaining the advantages of a system based on nature./nHis suggestion was a unit, the milliare, that was defined as a minute of arc along a meridian arc, and a system of sub-units, dividing successively by factors of ten into the centuria, decuria, virga, virgula, decima, centesima, and millesima.[1] The virga, 1/1000 of a minute of arc, corresponding to 64.4 Bologna inches, or ~2.04 m, was reasonably close to the then current unit of length, the Parisian toise (~1.95 m) \u2013 a feature which was meant to make acceptance of the new unit easier./nAs a practical implementation, Mouton suggested that the actual standard be based on pendulum movement, so that a pendulum located in Lyon of length one virgula (1/10 virga) would change direction 3959.2 times in half an hour. The resulting pendulum would have a length of ~20.54\u00a0cm./nHis ideas attracted interest at the time, and were supported by Jean Picard as well as Huygens in 1673, and also studied at Royal Society in London.[clarification needed] In 1673, Leibniz independently made proposals similar to those of Mouton./nIt would be over a century later, however, that the French Academy of Sciences weights and measures committee suggested the decimal metric system that defined the Metre as, at least initially, a division of the circumference of the Earth. The first official adoption of this system occurred in France in 1791./nBy today's measures, his milliare corresponds directly to a nautical mile, and his virga would by definition have been 1.852 m.", "646931": "Richard Lawrence Taylor (born 19 May 1962) is a British[2] mathematician working in the field of number theory.[3] He is currently the Barbara Kimball Browning Professor in Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University.[4]/nTaylor received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics  \"for numerous breakthrough results in the theory of automorphic forms, including the Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture, the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups, and the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture.\"[5] He also received the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences for his work on the Langlands program with Robert Langlands.

Decades later, Burks and his wife Alice Burks outlined their case for the subject matter of the ENIAC having been derived from John Vincent Atanasoff.  Burks was also for several decades a faculty member at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor./nBurks was born in Duluth, Minnesota.  He earned his B.A. in mathematics and physics from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, in 1936 and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1937 and 1941, respectively.[citation needed]/nThe summer after obtaining his Ph.D., Burks moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and enrolled in the national defense electronics course offered by the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Electrical Engineering; his laboratory teaching assistant was J. Presper Eckert, a graduate student at the Moore School; a fellow student was John Mauchly, the chairman of the physics department at Ursinus College in nearby Collegeville, Pennsylvania.  Both Burks and Mauchly sought and obtained teaching positions at the Moore School the following fall, and roomed together throughout the academic year.[citation needed]/nWhen Mauchly and Eckert's proposed concept for an electronic digital computer was funded by the U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory in June 1943, Burks was added to the design team.  Among his principal contributions to the project was the design of the high-speed multiplier unit.  (Also during this time, Burks met and married Alice Rowe, a human computer employed at the Moore School.)/nIn April 1945, with John Grist Brainerd, Burks was charged with writing the technical reports on the ENIAC for publication.  Also during 1945 Burks assisted with the preliminary logical design of the EDVAC in meetings attended by Mauchly, Eckert, John von Neumann, and others./nBurks also took a part-time position as a philosophy instructor at Swarthmore College during 1945\u20131946./nOn March 8, 1946, Burks accepted an offer by von Neumann to join the computer project at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and joined full-time the following summer.  (Already on the project was another member of the ENIAC team, Herman Goldstine. Together, Goldstine and Burks gave nine of the Moore School Lectures in Summer 1946.)  During his time at the IAS, Burks worked to expand von Neumann's theory of automata.[citation needed]/nAfter working on this project, Burks relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1946 to join the faculty of the University of Michigan, first as an assistant professor of philosophy, and as a full professor by 1954. With Irving Copi he sketched the necessary design for general purpose computing.[1]/nBurks helped found the university's computer science department, first as the Logic of Computers group in 1956, of which he was the director, then as a graduate program in 1957, and then as an undergraduate program within the new Department of Computer and Communication in 1967, which he chaired until 1971.

In the book, he notes how his parents were keen for their children to have an English education, yet to speak Armenian at home. Dikran was christened by Bishop Tourian in the Holy Trinity Armenian Church in Manchester, and his first name Dikran was shortened to Dick. He never forgot his Armenian roots. In his childhood, he would visit his relatives in Istanbul every other year.[1]/nFrom Rossall School, in Fleetwood, Lancashire, Dikran gained a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1946.

In 1955, he moved to teach mathematics at St Albans School, Hertfordshire, where the young Stephen Hawking was a pupil. When asked later to name a teacher who had inspired him, Hawking named \"Mr Tahta\".[3] Tahta remained at St Albans for six years before taking up the post of lecturer in mathematics education at St Luke's College, Exeter, in 1961. By 1974, he was a Mathematics tutor at the University of Exeter's School of Education at Thornlea, on the New North Road. In 1978, the School of Education merged with St Luke's College to form the University's Department of Education. He remained there until his retirement in late 1981./nIn the 1970s Tahta was involved in the ATV television programme of mathematics for schools entitled 'Leapfrogs' (produced and directed by Paul Martin), promoting visual approaches to mathematics. His paper \"On Geometry\" argued that geometrical approaches to mathematics could not be reduced to algebraic approaches. In line with this thinking, he produced the ATM book Geometric Images, and co-authored Images of Infinity with Ray Hemmings. The Leapfrogs group of Tahta and Hemmings, together with David Sturgess, Leo Rogers and Derick Last also produced hands-on teaching materials including workbooks for the polycube.

His most famous work is his autobiography, Vida, ascendencia, nacimiento, crianza y aventuras del Doctor Don Diego de Torres Villarroel (first published 1743)./nVillarroel was born in Salamanca and baptised on 18 June 1694. His father was a poor bookseller and his mother was a draper's daughter. After an elementary education he went on to study Latin under Juan Gonz\u00e1lez de Dios, who later became professor of humanities at the University of Salamanca. Villarroel was then enrolled at the Colegio Triling\u00fce in Salamanca. However, at this stage the young Villarroel had little love for learning and his wayward and disruptive behaviour led to trouble with the authorities. It was only when he began to read the books in his father's shop that he discovered a fondness for mathematics and astrology./nVillarroel was in such disgrace with the college authorities that he decided to flee to Portugal where he led an adventurous life in which he was successively a hermit, a dancing-master, an alchemist, a mathematician, a soldier, a bullfighter, a student of medicine and an astrologer. On his return to Salamanca, he settled down to a serious programme of reading books on science, magic and mathematics, while earning his living by publishing almanacs and annual predictions under the pseudonym of \"The Great Piscator of Salamanca\". In 1724, he successfully predicted the death of the young King Luis I./nIn 1723 he moved to Madrid where he made many influential friends. He studied medicine and graduated in the city of \u00c1vila. Back in Madrid, he became so poor that he decided to take up smuggling to make money but he was saved by the patronage of the Countess of Arcos, whose house he had tried to rid of a poltergeist./nAfter a few years, Villarroel once more returned to Salamanca where he learned that the chair of mathematics at the university was empty and decided to apply for the post. He easily defeated his only rival and was made professor, even though his knowledge of the subject was still rudimentary./nIn 1732 Villarroel was banished from Spain for helping his friend Don Juan de Salazar in a dispute which had turned violent. The two had tried to escape to France but had returned to Spain to face the consequences. Villarroel spent his exile in Coimbra, Portugal until a royal decree allowed him back to Salamanca in 1734. From then on he dedicated his time to his post at the university, to writing various works and paying frequent visits to Madrid, where he made the acquaintance of the Duchess of Alba. In 1743 he published the first four chapters of his autobiography, which enjoyed a tremendous success (chapter five appeared some time before 1752 and chapter six in 1758)./nIn 1750 he was allowed to retire on a pension by royal decree. His life became much quieter and in 1752 he published a complete edition of his works by public subscription. This was highly unusual for the time and attests to Villarroel's popularity as an author. He died on 19 June 1770 at the age of 77./nTorres Villarroel used elements of the Leonese language in several of his works.[1] Indeed, Leonese language prefixes like \"peri\" (more), palatalizations (llo, lla, llas), verbal forms like \"jicioren\" (they made, in Spanish \"hicieron\"), \"salioren\" (they went out, Spanish \"salieron\") or \"dixioren\" (they said, Spanish \"dijeron\") often appear in his works.[2]/nVillarroel had a poor opinion of his own knowledge of mathematics and science, a result of the low quality of education available in the Spain of his era. As he wrote: \"I knew well my ignorance and blindness as I went groping down the alleyways of my profession. But I also knew that I was in the land of the blind, for Spain lay in the grip of a darkness so fearsome that in no school, college or university in any one of its cities was there an individual capable of lighting a lamp whereby one might seek out the elements of these sciences. In the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king\" (quoted by Atkinson, page 24)./nToday Villarroel is more famous as a writer. In twenty years he received more than 2,000 ducados per year.

Francisco de Quevedo por Madrid(1727\u20131751)./nHe wrote Los desdichados del mundo y la gloria (1737),  He also wrote poems and plays, but his most important work is his picaresque account of his own life  entitled Vida, ascendencia, nacimiento, crianza y aventuras del doctor don Diego de Torres Villarroel, (1743, with further additions later), divided into six chapters, each dealing with a decade of his life./nHe also wrote scientific works such as Anatom\u00eda de lo visible e invisible de ambas esferas (1738) and works about the lives of saints (e.g. Vida de Sor Gregoria de Santa Teresa) and poets (Vida de Gabriel \u00c1lvarez de Toledo)./nVillarroel was a favourite author of the young Jorge Luis Borges./nPoetry/nSonnets", "57433897": "Sylvie Corteel is a French mathematician at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Paris Diderot University and the University of California, Berkeley, who was an editor-in-chief of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A.[1] Her research concerns the enumerative combinatorics and algebraic combinatorics of permutations, tableaux, and partitions./nAfter earning an engineering degree in 1996 from the University of Technology of Compi\u00e8gne, Corteel worked with Carla Savage at North Carolina State University, where she earned a master's degree in 1997.[2] She completed her Ph.D. in 2000 at the University of Paris-Sud under the supervision of Dominique Gouyou-Beauchamps,[2][3] and earned a habilitation in 2010 at Paris Diderot University.[2]/nShe worked as a maitresse de conf\u00e9rences and then as a CNRS charg\u00e9e de recherche at the Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University from 2000 to 2005, also doing postdoctoral studies at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al in 2001.

Even though he tries to motivate the people of Germany with words, Abbt is convinced that we have no one in Germany who equals his talent or can not even compare someone else to his writing. As he was concerned between the human heart and social utility, Abbt continued his word and his patriotism had a way to a fairly wide range of philosophy. He insisted on grounding moral discussion in the common understanding of the mass of human kind.[3]/nAbbt's writing is much different from normal writing, everything he writes, he has a goal within it to send a message. He envisions a type of writing that leaves a lasting impression on the reader, as he tries to make the reader go into his or her resolution and action. His writing is clear that he writes with the literature of an awakening, as he tries to motivate his readers to make a lasting and meaningful impact on the world, which is a big part on why he wrote \"On Dying for the Fatherland\".[3]/nIn his writings he likes to express that there is an enlightened judgement for moral behavior and discussion. Within moral behavior, comes equality and Abbt emphasizes how the great women of the world are made of the same stuff as the great men. He believes that women should be relevant members of the informal public sphere, as it will bring good-heartedness and good-will. This is where here pushes for equality as he believes all help is needed, no matter what gender. Abbt also emphasizes that true religion is very strong, not a weakness, which will help transition things into a common good. As he believes that greatness is generally \"in-born\", it makes him less interested in reducing everyone to the same level, and would rather show how everyone can contribute.[3]/nHe argued that patriotism in modern monarchies could be grounded in an aesthetic passion of enthusiasm generated through sensuous examples of great virtue. As Abbt believes this, he wants people in Germany to love their country and defend it as he wants everyone to do something good and impactful to benefit their homeland or \"fatherland\".[4]/nAbbt was a different type of writer in his time, his primary audience was the middle and higher orders in Germany. After his death in 1770, he was honored for his writing on \"Problem of Publikum\", where he described and taught pure virtue along with innocence. This writing of his began to evolve as it was looked at as a vision which seemed to hold unlimited promise. In understanding Abbts writing, it is important to realize that there was a relationship between the German public sphere and the Enlightenment discourse within it. His vision of the informal public sphere existing more or less independently of government based on natural, human impulses, resonates with Shaftesbury in this regard.[3]/nIn Abbt's book \"On Dying for the Fatherland\", he attempts to show a sense of public-spiritedness among his fellowship in every order. The love for a Fatherland is a big message that Abbt writes, where he writes for a stronger impetus to sacrifice, then it is a desire for honor, and Abbt tries to show how that is possible. It is hard to pick up certain points in his writing, as explained, but Abbt makes connections by numerous rhetorical flourishes and examples drawn from history within social orders in monarchical society, reorienting citizenship around a political virtue. He wants his readers to be able to take what he is saying from this book and take action in becoming a stronger community or whole. Abbt argues that love of fatherland is a greater spring to action in polity; to enable souls in a polity by honoring the love of fatherland. With more souls taking actions, the stronger and more love the fatherland will feel, which could lead them to be more successful. This was a main message throughout the book, as he wanted to show a new way of thinking between individuals and society.[3]/nThe example of King fighting for his country on the battlefield that Abbt wrote about was to inspire monarchical subjects to follow his example as well as regenerate patriotism. He wrote as a pervasive patriotic culture of remembrance and emulation of dead heroes.[4]/nAufkl\u00e4rer like Abbt were concerned with nurturing a healthy social organism with their own individual development and emancipation. Other writers and philosophers such as Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant tried tying \"Enlightenment\" directly to \"Problem of Publikum\", but found difficulty in the isolated individual. This project was begun by Abbt, which was carried on by Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottfried Herder who had different thoughts on it. Herder differed from Kant's more rationalist project, but the statues of the \"Problem of Publikum\" was a problem of the Aufkl\u00e4rer and of modern German history.[3]/nIn the early 1760s Abbt and Moses Mendelssohn had been engaged in a translation of Shaftesbury, as they express their interest in the \"public\" as the measure of all \"true\" virtue. Alexander Pope has an impact on Abbt through his visions of world and society as an ordered whole, which helped influence him to write \"On Dying for the Fatherland\". Abbt argues that Pope's teaching point to him was \"the principle that makes us obedient to the creator, and into citizens of the whole world\". Certain principles that Abbt wanted to take away from Pope were that he wanted the German people to either take leadership or make sure they obey their leader, in the good for their country. In Abbt's short life, the figure of Frederick the Great looms over the text in this regard as Abbt admired him very much. He was then able to rise to the top of German academic life, to a position of an enlightened administration, as he \"died for Germany and for his language too early\" as he was looked at as a true positive influential model to the German society.[3]/nBetween Abbt's two famous works of \"On Dying for the Fatherland (1761) and \"On Merit\" (1765), he tries to \"overcome the basic German problem of a fragmented public sphere with enlightened argument designed to lead readers to locate themselves and their well-being in an enlarged societal frame.\"[3] As he tried to fix this German problem within the public, his enlightened argument is pointed at people in leadership positions or people that have the opportunity to make a difference, in doing something positive for their community around them./nAbbt wrote that Germans lack a common interest, as he asks about the \"volk\" even though you are not supposed to ask about the \"volk\" as you are supposed to let it be as it has to pay for its dues. But, he wanted to show his readers what not to do by mentioning them.[3]/nThe main message he wanted to get to his readers in \"On Dying for the Fatherland\", was to rouse fellow-citizenship to sacrificial duty for their Fatherland. Just like \"The Merit\", this novel brings readers a sense of their place or role in a larger society. Abbt emphasizes the equality of all members of society, as it is a common theme that also leads into \"The Merit\". He keeps this common theme present because he believes that the characteristics of great women, are found in great men as well, which helps influence his readers to take positive actions. Another main message from the novel of \"On Dying for the Fatherland\" was to sacrifice duty to their fatherland, reading in context of the Seven Years' War. This war had a large impact on Abbt, as it occurred while he made his most famous wiritngs, and was a present event for a quarter of his lifetime. The Seven Years' War was also an event that influenced Abbt's writing, especially \"On Dying for the Fatherland\", which is why he discusses protecting your homeland so much, along with encouraging people to take action in making positive impacts. He wanted to bring his readers to a sense of their place or role in the larger societal whole, by inspiring virtuous action based. Abbt's purpose was to help the reader see the presence of a fatherland in \"well-ordered monarchies\".[3]/nAs Abbt reassures the reader that there is no reason to worry about dissolution of the corporate orders in the novel, \"On Dying for the Fatherland\" the readers have their own reasons for being that will continue to justify their existence. He also touches base a lot on citizenship, as he describes that in a state of war that nothing during the war takes away from their bonds. Abbt, Moses Mendelssohn, and Shaftesbury wanted to emphasize the social solidarity to the readers to make sure that if their readers are taking their writing seriously, that they will take action in creating a psychological sense of unity in groups or classes.[3]/nAbbt was honored for being the writer of \"The Publikum\" and a teacher of virtue and innocence, where people understood his points and listened to them. He took Professorship in Philosophy in 1760, which is when he wrote famous novel, \"On Dying for the Fatherland\", brought Abbt a lot of instant recognition. After writing it, he came into contact with Aufkl\u00e4rer and Moses Mendelssohn, who asked him to become a regular contributor to the \"letters concerning the newest literature\". In accepting this offer, Abbt's work became more public and often more present to readers eyes, where he could have easier access in influencing people. This novel also gave him the title of a full professorship in mathematics at the University of Rinteln.[3]/nIn 1765, when Abbt published his famous and most important work of \"The Merit\", it brought interest from Margrave of Schaumburg-Lippe the enlightened Prince at the time offered Abbt a position in court. He accepted this offer and spent the last year of his life working with the Prince.[3] The Prince bestowed on him the office on counsellor of the court, regency, and consistory of Buckeburgh. The Margrave of Schaumburg-Lippe caused Abbt to be interred, with great pomp, in his private chapel, and honoured his tomb by an affecting epitaph from his own pen.[5]/nIn Abbt's life he rose to the top of German academics at such a young age which moved to a position of enlightened administration and free scholarly activity. He had so much going for him at the age of 28 as he could have influenced so many more people and learned much more if it were not for the sudden illness that led to his death.[3]/n.", "3235670": "Louis Marcel Brillouin (French pronunciation: [lwi ma\u0281s\u025bl b\u0281ijw\u025b\u0303]; 19 December 1854 \u2013 16 June 1948) was a French physicist and mathematician./nBorn in Saint-Martin-l\u00e8s-Melle,[1] Deux-S\u00e8vres, France, his father was a painter who moved to Paris when Marcel was a boy.

He is mentioned as one of the famous Chaldean mathematicians and astronomer-astrologers by later Roman writers like Strabo (Geographia 16:1\u20136)./nLike his predecessor Berossos, Sudines moved from Babylonia and established himself among the Greeks; he was an advisor to King Attalus I (Attalos Soter) of Pergamon. He is said (e.g., by Roman astronomer/astrologer Vettius Valens) to have published tables to compute the motion of the Moon; said to have been used by the Greeks, until superseded by the work of Hipparchus and later by Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaios). Sudines may have been important in transmitting the astronomical knowledge of the Babylonians to the Greeks, but little is known about his work and nothing about his life. He is also said to have been one of the first to assign astrological meaning to gemstones./nWhile other Chaldean astronomers have been tentatively identified in the cuneiform record, no Akkadian texts have yet been unearthed that reference Sudines.[1] Stevens suggest that his name, however, looks Akkadian, with attestations of similar names like \u0160um(a)-iddin \"He gave the name\" or \u0160um(a)-iddina \"He gave me a name\" in the cuneiform record from the Neo-Assyrian and Hellenistic periods.[1]/nThe 2nd century CE Greek author Polyaenus mentions an extispicer named Sudines, a job that this Sudines supposedly performed for King Attalus I of Pergamon, lending credence to the association between the astronomer Sudines and the attested diviner.[2] However, while practitioners of astronomical science in Babylonia frequently also worked with astrological methods of celestial divination, the combination of astronomer and liver omen reader is rare, suggesting that Polyaenus' and King Attalus' Sudines is potentially different from the astronomer Sudines.[2] Given the wide array of knowledge assigned to and associated with people named Sudines, it is unclear whether they all refer to the same person. The lack of biographical information about Sudines only adds to this difficulty./nSudines is associated with computations for predicting lunar eclipses, with authors such as Vettius Valens claiming that he used Sudines to compute lunar eclipses.[2] The \"use\" of Sudines in Valens' Anthologies suggests that he was perhaps the author of a table of data relating to lunar eclipses, recording the dates, times, or circumstances of previous ones that later authors could use to inform their theories. Such tables are attested in the cuneiform record, where observations of lunar eclipses were recorded for the greater part of the first millennium BCE and tables made of both observed and predicted eclipses.[3] While no table authored by Sudines has been found or is mentioned in other sources, the abundance of Babylonian tables that have survived suggests that they were an integral component of astronomical practice in this Mesopotamian culture. As a Babylonian, it is not unlikely that Sudines collaborated in the construction of astronomical tables. Moreover, other astronomers listed alongside Sudines have astronomical tables attributed to them that are not extant. Hipparchus, a foundational figure in Greek astronomy whose work became the basis for Ptolemy's Almagest, is credited as authoring a solar table that has not survived and has been the topic of much speculation.[4]/nSudines is also credited with a particular value for the length of the solar year. Neugebauer lists Sudines' solar year length as 365 1/4 \u03b3' \u03b5',[5] which Rochberg interprets as 365 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/5, a value that she describes as making no astronomical sense.[2] Valens references Sudines as a table author immediately after describing various values of year lengths, including two attributed separately to the Chaldeans and the Babylonians (Anthologies 9.12). Neither the Chaldean year length of 365 1/4 1/207 nor the Babylonian year length of 365 1/4 1/144 agrees with Sudines' value./nIn a 3rd century CE papyrus fragment containing a summary of a commentary on Plato's Timaeus, the Stoic philosopher Posidonius is listed as crediting Sudines with describing the planet Venus as the destroyer of women.

Furthermore, Aumann has introduced the first purely formal account of the notion of common knowledge in game theory. He collaborated with Lloyd Shapley on the Aumann\u2013Shapley value. He is also known for Aumann's agreement theorem, in which he argues that under his given conditions, two Bayesian rationalists with common prior beliefs cannot agree to disagree.[3]/nAumann and Maschler used game theory to analyze Talmudic dilemmas.[4] They were able to solve the mystery about the \"division problem\", a long-standing dilemma of explaining the Talmudic rationale in dividing the heritage of a late husband to his three wives depending on the worth of the heritage compared to its original worth.[5] The article in that matter was dedicated to a son of Aumann, Shlomo, who was killed during the 1982 Lebanon War, while serving as a tank gunner in the Israel Defense Forces's armored corps./nAumann's Ph.D. students include:\nBezalel Peleg, David Schmeidler, Shmuel Zamir, Elon Kohlberg, Zvi Artstein, Benyamin Shitovitz, Eugene Wesley,\nSergiu Hart, Abraham Neyman, Yair Tauman, Dov Samet, Ehud Lehrer, Yossi Feinberg, Itai Arieli, Uri Weiss and Yosef Zohar./nAumann has entered the controversy of Bible codes research.

In 1968, he created the Centre de G\u00e9ostatistique et de Morphologie Math\u00e9matique at the Paris School of Mines in Fontainebleau. He is known for his contributions on Kriging and mathematical morphology. His seminal work is posted for study and review to the Online Library of the Centre de G\u00e9ostatistique, Fontainebleau, France./nMatheron graduated from \u00c9cole Polytechnique and later Ecole des Mines de Paris, where he studied mathematics, physics and probability theory (as a student of Paul L\u00e9vy)./nFrom 1954 to 1963, he worked with the French Geological Survey in Algeria and France, and was influenced by the works of Krige, Sichel, and de Wijs, from the South African school, on the gold deposits of the Witwatersrand. This influence led him to develop the major concepts of the theory for estimating resources he named Geostatistics./nMatheron\u2019s [Formule des Minerais Connexes] became his Note Statistique No 1.  In this paper of 25 November 1954, Matheron derived the degree of associative dependence between lead and silver grades of core samples. In his Rectificatif of 13 January 1955, he revised the arithmetic mean lead and silver grades because his core samples varied in length. He did derive the length-weighted average lead and silver grades but failed to derive the variances of his weighted averages. Neither did he derive the degree of associative dependence between metal grades of ordered core samples as a measure for spatial dependence between ordered core samples. He did not disclose his primary data set and worked mostly with symbols rather than real measured values such test results for lead and silver in Matheron's core samples. Matheron's Interpr\u00e9tations des corr\u00e9lations entre variables al\u00e9atoires lognormales of 29 November 1954 was marked Note statistisque No 2. In this paper, Matheron explored lognormal variables and set the stage for statistics by symbols. Primary data would have allowed him to assess whether or not lead and silver grades departed from the lognormal distribution, or displayed spatial dependence along core samples in his borehole./nMatheron coined the eponym krigeage (Kriging) for the first time in his 1960 Krigeage d\u2019un Panneau Rectangulaire par sa P\u00e9riph\u00e9rie. In this Note g\u00e9ostatistique No 28, Matheron derived k*, his estimateur and a precursor to the kriged estimate or kriged estimator. In mathematical statistics, Matheron\u2019s k* is the length-weighted average grade of a single panneau in his set. What Matheron failed to derive in this paper was var(k*), the variance of his estimateur. Matheron presented his Stationary Random Function at the first colloquium on geostatistics in the USA. He called on Brownian motion to conjecture the continuity of his  Riemann integral but did not explain what Brownian motion and ore deposits have in common. Matheron, unlike John von Neumann in 1941 and Anders Hald in 1952, never worked with Riemann sums. It was not Professor Dr Georges Matheron but Dr Frederik P Agterberg who derived the distance-weighted average of a set of measured values determined in samples selected at positions with different coordinates in a sample space. What Agterberg did not do was derive the variance of this function./nMatheron did indeed derive length-weighted average grades of core samples and ore blocks but did not derive the variance of these functions. In time, the length-weighted average grade for Matheron's three-dimensional block grade was replaced with the distance-weighted average grade for Agterberg's zero-dimensional point. Both central values turned into honorific kriged estimates or kriged estimators. An infinite set of Agterberg's zero dimensional points fits within any ore block, along any borehole, or inside any sampling unit or sample space. Matheron's block grades and Agterberg's point grades are unique because both are functions without variances./nIn 1964, Matheron was supervising the PhD thesis of Jean Serra, dedicated to quantifying the ore properties of the iron deposit of Lorraine. Serra came up with the idea of using structuring elements for the analysis, which led to the concept of hit-or-miss transform. The theoretical analysis of this transform led Matheron to derive and investigate the concepts of erosion, dilation, opening and closing, which became known later as the basic morphological operators. He also developed a tool for granulometry, i.e., the computation of a \"size distribution\", where he mathematically characterizes the concept of size. In December 1964, Matheron and Serra, together with Philippe Formery[permanent dead link], named this approach mathematical morphology. It has since evolved into a theory and method that is applied in a variety of image processing problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide[1] (main article: Mathematical morphology). Matheron continued to contribute to mathematical morphology during the years, his best-known contribution being the morphological filtering theory, which he developed with Serra in the 1980s./nThe Georges Matheron Lectureship was established [2] by the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (IAMG). This award was named after Georges Matheron. Matheron Lecturers will be selected by a small committee chaired by the IAMG Vice President. The Georges Matheron Lectures will be held annually during IAMG Conferences and during International Geological Congresses. Each year IAMG selects a Georges Matheron Lecturer who is a scientist with proven research ability in the field of spatial statistics or mathematical morphology. Beginning at IAMG\u20192006 in Li\u00e8ge, Jean Serra was the first recipient of this award in 2006, delivered the first Georges Matheron\nLecture./nIn 1968, the Paris School of Mines created the Centre de Morphologie Math\u00e9matique, located in Fontainebleau, France, and named Matheron its first director. In 1979, the center was renamed Centre de G\u00e9ostatistique et de Morphologie Math\u00e9matique, and, in 1986, the latter was split into two separate centers: Centre de G\u00e9ostatistique, directed by Matheron, and Centre de Morphologie Math\u00e9matique, directed by Serra.", "2252716": "Michel Flor\u00e9al Chasles (French pronunciation: [mi\u0283\u025bl fl\u0254\u0281eal \u0283al]; 15 November 1793 \u2013 18 December 1880) was a French mathematician./nHe was born at \u00c9pernon in France and studied at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris under Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson. In the War of the Sixth Coalition he was drafted to fight in the defence of Paris in 1814. After the war, he gave up on a career as an engineer or stockbroker in order to pursue his mathematical studies./nIn 1837 he published the book Aper\u00e7u historique sur l'origine et le d\u00e9veloppement des m\u00e9thodes en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (\"Historical view of the origin and development of methods in geometry\"), a study of the method of reciprocal polars in projective geometry. The work gained him considerable fame and respect and he was appointed Professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1841, then he was awarded a chair at the Sorbonne in 1846. A second edition of this book was published in 1875. In 1839, Ludwig Adolph Sohncke (the father of Leonhard Sohncke) translated the original into German as Geschichte der geometrie, hauptsachlich mit bezug auf die neueren methoden.[2][3][4] Shortly thereafter, in 1841, Charles Graves published an English version as Two Geometrical Memoirs on the General Properties of Cones of the Second Degree and on the Spherical Conics, adding a significant amount of original material./nJakob Steiner had proposed Steiner's conic problem of enumerating the number of conic sections tangent to each of five given conics and had answered it incorrectly. Chasles developed a theory of characteristics that enabled the correct enumeration of the conics (there are 3264) (see enumerative geometry). He established several important theorems (all called Chasles's theorem). In kinematics, Chasles's description of a Euclidean motion in space as screw displacement was seminal to the development of the theories of dynamics of rigid bodies./nChasles was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1864.[5] In 1865 he was awarded the Copley Medal./nAs described in A Treasury of Deception, by Michael Farquhar (Peguin Books, 2005), between 1861 and 1869 Chasles purchased some of the 27,000 forged letters from Frenchman Denis Vrain-Lucas.  Included in this trove were letters from Alexander the Great to Aristotle, from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar, and from Mary Magdalene to a revived Lazarus, all in a fake medieval French. In 2004, the journal Critical Inquiry published a recently \"discovered\" 1871 letter written by Vrain-Lucas (from prison) to Chasles, conveying Vrain-Lucas's perspective on these events,[6] itself an invention.[7]/nIn 1986, Alexander Jones published a commentary on Book 7 of the Collection of Pappus of Alexandria, which Chasles had referred to in his history of geometric methods.

He taught in gymnasia (secondary schools) from 1868 to 1872. In 1875, he married Anna Commer, who was the daughter of a music lecturer. He became a professor at the seminary college Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg (now Braniewo). He took holy orders in order to take his teaching position. He became rector of the college and chair of the town council. As a professor and administrator Killing was widely liked and respected. Finally, in 1892 he became a professor at the University of M\u00fcnster.[1]/nIn 1886, Killing and his wife entered the Third Order of Franciscans.[1]/nIn 1878 Killing wrote on space forms in terms of non-Euclidean geometry in Crelle's Journal, which he further developed in 1880 as well as in 1885.[2] Recounting lectures of Weierstrass, he there introduced the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry described by Weierstrass coordinates.[3] He is also credited with formulating transformations mathematically equivalent to Lorentz transformations in n dimensions in 1885,.[4]/nKilling invented Lie algebras independently of Sophus Lie around 1880. Killing's university library did not contain the Scandinavian journal in which Lie's article appeared. (Lie later was scornful of Killing, perhaps out of competitive spirit and claimed that all that was valid had already been proven by Lie and all that was invalid was added by Killing.) In fact Killing's work was less rigorous logically than Lie's, but Killing had much grander goals in terms of classification of groups, and made a number of unproven conjectures that turned out to be true. Because Killing's goals were so high, he was excessively modest about his own achievement.[citation needed]/nFrom 1888 to 1890, Killing essentially classified the complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras, as a requisite step of classifying Lie groups, inventing the notions of a Cartan subalgebra and the Cartan matrix. He thus arrived at the conclusion that, basically, the only simple Lie algebras were those associated to the linear, orthogonal, and symplectic groups, apart from a small number of isolated exceptions. \u00c9lie Cartan's 1894 dissertation was essentially a rigorous rewriting of Killing's paper.  Killing also introduced the notion of a root system. He discovered the exceptional Lie algebra g2 in 1887; his root system classification showed up all the exceptional cases, but concrete constructions came later./nAs A. J. Coleman says, \"He exhibited the characteristic equation of the Weyl group when Weyl was 3 years old and listed the orders of the Coxeter transformation 19 years before Coxeter was born.\"[5]/nMedia related to Wilhelm Killing (mathematician) at Wikimedia Commons", "47013811": "Theodore Strong (July 26, 1790 \u2013 February 1, 1869) was an American mathematician./nStrong was born in South Hadley, Massachusetts on July 26, 1790.

He submitted it to the American Mathematical Monthly (AMM) and it was published as \"Advanced Problem 5304\" in the following form:/nIt was then called the Kolakoski sequence as mathematicians investigated it further./nDespite the simplicity with which the sequence can be described and generated, it poses several interesting and complex mathematical problems, some of which remain unsolved after more than fifty years of analysis. Until almost the end of his life, Kolakoski himself was not aware of how much attention it had received from professional mathematicians after he had published notice of it in the AMM.

The letter prompted Loretta Kolakoski to ask her husband's friend Mike Vargo, a writer who had first met him at CIT, to carry out further research when Kolakoski was in hospital during his final illness. Vargo discovered many references to the Kolakoski sequence on the internet and was able to inform his friend before Kolakoski died. Vargo felt that Kolakoski had been quietly pleased by the news, feeling that it vindicated his belief in the importance and beauty of the sequence.[2]/nBecause he had schizophrenia, Kolakoski was preoccupied with the topics of free will and determinism throughout his life. Despite his high intelligence and ability to master many different skills with little effort, his illness was, in the words of Mike Vargo, \"this thing living within him that was always threatening to literally take over his mind and transport it into regions of chaos and delusion.\" While wanting to feel himself free, Kolakoski was well aware that he could not control his own brain without pharmaceutical help and was forced to accept determinism. Vargo therefore deduced that his friend searched for a benevolent order in the universe, of which the Kolakoski sequence was one possible expression.

Riesz theorem, which implies, in particular, that if \u03bc is a complex measure on the unit circle such that/nthen the variation |\u03bc| of \u03bc and the Lebesgue measure on the circle are mutually absolutely continuous.[5][7]/nPart of the analytic work of Riesz in the 1920s used methods of functional analysis./nIn the early 1920s, he worked on the moment problem, to which he introduced the operator-theoretic approach by proving the Riesz extension theorem (which predated the closely related Hahn\u2013Banach theorem).[8][9]/nLater, he devised an interpolation theorem to show that the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator in Lp (1 < p < \u221e). The generalisation of the interpolation theorem by his student Olaf Thorin is now known as the Riesz\u2013Thorin theorem.[2][10]/nRiesz also established, independently of Andrey Kolmogorov, what is now called the Kolmogorov\u2013Riesz compactness criterion in Lp: a subset K\u00a0\u2282Lp(Rn) is precompact if and only if the following three conditions hold: (a) K is bounded;/n(b) for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists R > 0 so that/nfor every f \u2208 K;/n(c) for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03c1 > 0 so that/nfor every y \u2208 Rn with |y|\u00a0<\u00a0\u03c1, and every f \u2208 K.[11]/nAfter 1930, the interests of Riesz shifted to potential theory and partial differential equations. He made use of \"generalised potentials\", generalisations of the  Riemann\u2013Liouville integral.[2] In particular, Riesz discovered the Riesz potential, a generalisation of the Riemann\u2013Liouville integral to dimension higher than one.[3]/nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Riesz worked on Clifford algebras. His 1958 lecture notes, the complete version of which was only published in 1993 (Riesz (1993)), were dubbed by the physicist David Hestenes \"the midwife of the rebirth\" of Clifford algebras.[12]/nRiesz's doctoral students in Stockholm include Harald Cram\u00e9r and Einar Carl Hille.[3] In Lund, Riesz supervised the theses of Otto Frostman, Lars G\u00e5rding, Lars H\u00f6rmander, and Olof Thorin.[2]", "41934830": "Charlotte Kipling was born on 7 June 1919 in Toxteth Park, Liverpool, Lancashire, England. She was a statistician and ichthyologist. Starting in 1941 she was employed by the British Navy as a cipher officer in Liverpool. She was associated with the Navy until 1946. In 1947 she was hired by the Freshwater Biological Association in Windermere, Cumbria. She collected data on the changes in the char, pike, and perch populations in the Windermere lake. She was a member of the Royal Statistical Society and the Institute of Biology. She died in 1992 in Millerground Windermere, Cumbria, England.[1]/nKipling attended Liverpool College, Juyton and St. Leonard School, St. Andrews before studying economics at Newnham College Cambridge from 1937-1940.[2] She studied at Newnham during a period where women were allowed to attend classes, but were not made full members of the university or granted degrees. This was changed in 1948.[3] There is evidence found in International Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary to 1950, that would imply Kipling received an M.A. from Newnham in that same year. From 1946-1947 she studied statistics at University College, London before moving to Windermere.[2]/nKipling was hired as a statistician by the Freshwater Biological Association at Ferry House in 1947.[2] While in this position she extensively tracked the diminishing fish populations within the Windermere lake. She developed methodology to help track this data alongside Winifred E. Frost. These methodologies were used to help determine the most efficient ways to gather as much data as possible on the different species within the lake.[4] Most of this research was used within the \"Windermere Perch and Pike Project\" (Le Cren 2001),[5] which long-term data collected on the Windermere lake by Kipling and her colleagues was used to analyse the ways the different fish populations reacted to their changing environment, as well as the effects of overfishing.[2] The long term data conducted by Kipling was essential to this project and is cited extensively throughout. Most of her publications are similar long-term studies of freshwater fish populations within the Windermere lake (see below)./nCraig, J. F. & Kipling, C. (1983).

Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux./nDe Moivre wrote a book on probability theory, The Doctrine of Chances, said to have been prized by gamblers. De Moivre first discovered Binet's formula, the closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers linking the nth power of the golden ratio \u03c6 to the nth Fibonacci number. He also was the first to postulate the central limit theorem, a cornerstone of probability theory./nAbraham de Moivre was born in Vitry-le-Fran\u00e7ois in Champagne on 26 May 1667. His father, Daniel de Moivre, was a surgeon who believed in the value of education. Though Abraham de Moivre's parents were Protestant, he first attended Christian Brothers' Catholic school in Vitry, which was unusually tolerant given religious tensions in France at the time. When he was eleven, his parents sent him to the Protestant Academy at Sedan, where he spent four years studying Greek under Jacques du Rondel. The Protestant Academy of Sedan had been founded in 1579 at the initiative of Fran\u00e7oise de Bourbon, the widow of Henri-Robert de la Marck./nIn 1682 the Protestant Academy at Sedan was suppressed, and de Moivre enrolled to study logic at Saumur for two years. Although mathematics was not part of his course work, de Moivre read several works on mathematics on his own, including \u00c9l\u00e9ments des math\u00e9matiques by the French Oratorian priest and mathematician Jean Prestet and a short treatise on games of chance, De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae, by Christiaan Huygens the Dutch physicist, mathematician, astronomer and inventor. In 1684, de Moivre moved to Paris to study physics, and for the first time had formal mathematics training with private lessons from Jacques Ozanam./nReligious persecution in France became severe when King Louis XIV issued the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, which revoked the Edict of Nantes, that had given substantial rights to French Protestants. It forbade Protestant worship and required that all children be baptised by Catholic priests. De Moivre was sent to Prieur\u00e9 Saint-Martin-des-Champs, a school that the authorities sent Protestant children to for indoctrination into Catholicism./nIt is unclear when de Moivre left the Prieure de Saint-Martin and moved to England, since the records of the Prieure de Saint-Martin indicate that he left the school in 1688, but de Moivre and his brother presented themselves as Huguenots admitted to the Savoy Church in London on 28 August 1687./nBy the time he arrived in London, de Moivre was a competent mathematician with a good knowledge of many of the standard texts.[1] To make a living, de Moivre became a private tutor of mathematics, visiting his pupils or teaching in the coffee houses of London. De Moivre continued his studies of mathematics after visiting the Earl of Devonshire and seeing Newton's recent book, Principia Mathematica. Looking through the book, he realised that it was far deeper than the books that he had studied previously, and he became determined to read and understand it. However, as he was required to take extended walks around London to travel between his students, de Moivre had little time for study, so he tore pages from the book and carried them around in his pocket to read between lessons./nAccording to a possibly apocryphal story, Newton, in the later years of his life, used to refer people posing mathematical questions to him to de Moivre, saying, \"He knows all these things better than I do.\"[2]/nBy 1692, de Moivre became friends with Edmond Halley and soon after with Isaac Newton himself. In 1695, Halley communicated de Moivre's first mathematics paper, which arose from his study of fluxions in the Principia Mathematica, to the Royal Society. This paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions that same year. Shortly after publishing this paper, de Moivre also generalised Newton's noteworthy binomial theorem into the multinomial theorem. The Royal Society became apprised of this method in 1697, and it elected de Moivre a Fellow on 30 November 1697./nAfter de Moivre had been accepted, Halley encouraged him to turn his attention to astronomy. In 1705, de Moivre discovered, intuitively, that \"the centripetal force of any planet is directly related to its distance from the centre of the forces and reciprocally related to the product of the diameter of the evolute and the cube of the perpendicular on the tangent.\" In other words, if a planet, M, follows an elliptical orbit around a focus F and has a point P where PM is tangent to the curve and FPM is a right angle so that FP is the perpendicular to the tangent, then the centripetal force at point P is proportional to FM/(R*(FP)3) where R is the radius of the curvature at M. The mathematician Johann Bernoulli proved this formula in 1710./nDespite these successes, de Moivre was unable to obtain an appointment to a chair of mathematics at any university, which would have released him from his dependence on time-consuming tutoring that burdened him more than it did most other mathematicians of the time. At least a part of the reason was a bias against his French origins.[3][4][5]/nIn November 1697 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society[6] and in 1712 was appointed to a commission set up by the society, alongside MM. Arbuthnot, Hill, Halley, Jones, Machin, Burnet, Robarts, Bonet, Aston, and Taylor to review the claims of Newton and Leibniz as to who discovered calculus. The full details of the controversy can be found in the Leibniz and Newton calculus controversy article./nThroughout his life de Moivre remained poor. It is reported that he was a regular customer of old Slaughter's Coffee House, St. Martin's Lane at Cranbourn Street, where he earned a little money from playing chess./nDe Moivre continued studying the fields of probability and mathematics until his death in 1754 and several additional papers were published after his death. As he grew older, he became increasingly lethargic and needed longer sleeping hours. It is a common claim that De Moivre noted he was sleeping an extra 15 minutes each night and correctly calculated the date of his death as the day when the sleep time reached 24 hours, 27 November 1754.[7] On that day he did in fact die, in London and his body was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, although his body was later moved. The claim of him predicting his own death, however, has been disputed as not having been documented anywhere at the time of its occurrence.[8]/nDe Moivre pioneered the development of analytic geometry and the theory of probability by expanding upon the work of his predecessors, particularly Christiaan Huygens and several members of the Bernoulli family. He also produced the second textbook on probability theory, The Doctrine of Chances: a method of calculating the probabilities of events in play. (The first book about games of chance, Liber de ludo aleae (On Casting the Die), was written by Girolamo Cardano in the 1560s, but it was not published until 1663.) This book came out in four editions, 1711 in Latin, and in English in 1718, 1738, and 1756. In the later editions of his book, de Moivre included his unpublished result of 1733, which is the first statement of an approximation to the binomial distribution in terms of what we now call the normal or Gaussian function.[9] This was the first method of finding the probability of the occurrence of an error of a given size when that error is expressed in terms of the variability of the distribution as a unit, and the first identification of the calculation of probable error. In addition, he applied these theories to gambling problems and actuarial tables./nAn expression commonly found in probability is n! but before the days of calculators calculating n! for a large n was time-consuming. In 1733 de Moivre proposed the formula for estimating a factorial as n!\u00a0=\u00a0cn(n+1/2)e\u2212n. He obtained an approximate expression for the constant c but it was James Stirling who found that c was \u221a2\u03c0.[10]/nDe Moivre also published an article called \"Annuities upon Lives\" in which he revealed the normal distribution of the mortality rate over a person's age. From this he produced a simple formula for approximating the revenue produced by annual payments based on a person's age. This is similar to the types of formulas used by insurance companies today./nSome results on the Poisson distribution were first introduced by de Moivre in De Mensura Sortis seu; de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, p.\u00a0219.[11] As a result, some authors have argued that the Poisson distribution should bear the name of de Moivre.[12][13]/nIn 1707, de Moivre derived an equation from which one can deduce:/nwhich he was able to prove for all positive integers\u00a0n.[14][15] In 1722, he presented equations from which one can deduce the better known form of de Moivre's Formula:/nIn 1749 Euler proved this formula for any real n using Euler's formula, which makes the proof quite straightforward.[18] This formula is important because it relates complex numbers and trigonometry. Additionally, this formula allows the derivation of useful expressions for cos(nx) and sin(nx) in terms of cos(x) and sin(x)./nDe Moivre had been studying probability, and his investigations required him to calculate binomial coefficients, which in turn required him to calculate factorials.[19][20] In 1730 de Moivre published his book Miscellanea Analytica de Seriebus et Quadraturis [Analytic Miscellany of Series and Integrals], which included tables of log (n!).[21]  For large values of n, de Moivre approximated the coefficients of the terms in a binomial expansion.  Specifically, given a positive integer n, where n is even and large, then the coefficient of the middle term of (1\u00a0+\u00a01)n is approximated by the equation:[22][23]/nOn June 19, 1729, James Stirling sent to de Moivre a letter, which illustrated how he calculated the coefficient of the middle term of a binomial expansion (a + b)n for large values of n.[24][25]  In 1730, Stirling published his book Methodus Differentialis [The Differential Method], in which he included his series for log(n!):[26]/nso that for large \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n, \n\n\n\nn\n!\n\u2248\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nn\ne\n\n\n)\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n!\\approx {\\sqrt {2\\pi }}\\left({\\frac {n}{e}}\\right)^{n}}\n\n./nOn November 12, 1733, de Moivre privately published and distributed a pamphlet \u2013 Approximatio ad Summam Terminorum Binomii (a + b)n in Seriem expansi [Approximation of the Sum of the Terms of the Binomial (a + b)n expanded into a Series] \u2013 in which he acknowledged Stirling's letter and proposed an alternative expression for the central term of a binomial expansion.[27]/nOn 25 November 2017, a colloquium was organised in Saumur by Dr Conor Maguire, with the patronage of the French National Commission of UNESCO, to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the birth of de Moivre and the fact that he studied for two years at the Academy of Saumur. The colloquium was titled Abraham de Moivre\u00a0: le Math\u00e9maticien, sa vie et son \u0153uvre and covered De Moivre's important contributions to the development of complex numbers, see De Moivre's formula, and to probability theory, see De Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem. The colloquium traced De Moivre's life and his exile in London where he became a highly respected friend of Isaac Newton. Nonetheless, he lived on modest means which he generated partly by his sessions advising gamblers in the Old Slaughter's Coffee House on the probabilities associated with their endeavours! On 27 November 2016, Professor Christian Genest of the McGill University (Montreal) marked the 262nd anniversary of the death of de Moivre with a colloquium in Limoges titled Abraham de Moivre\u00a0: G\u00e9nie en exil which discussed De Moivre's famous approximation of the binomial law which inspired the central limit theorem.", "40394737": "Ernst Ferdinand Peschl  (1 September 1906 \u2013 9 June 1986) was a German mathematician./nErnst Peschl came from a family of brewery owners.

It shows that the evolution problem for a perfectly plastic elastic body admits a solution in speed (of displacement) in this space under a safe loading condition. It shows that there can be an infinite number of solutions, regular or non-regular.[4][5]/nThe framework of generalized standard environments, due to Helphen and Nguyen Quoc Son, allows an easy writing of the laws of macroscopic behaviour.[6] In 1982, Pierre Suquet[7] established homogenization results for environments characterized by 2 potentials (free energy and dissipation potentials) and showed in particular that the generalized standard structure is preserved by changing scales when geometric variations are neglected.[8] He notes that the homogenization of short-memory viscoelastic composites can lead to the appearance of long memory effects (an effect already noted by J. & E. Sanchez-Palencia in 1978). More recently, properties of these long memories have been established in relation to order moments 1 and 2 of the local fields./nIn 1983, Pierre Suquet[9] gave a first upper bound of the resistance domain of a heterogeneous medium by solving a boundary analysis problem on a base cell. This result is improved by Bouchitte and Suquet[10] who show that the homogenized analysis problem is divided into two sub-problems, one purely volumetric for which the resistance domain is that given by the boundary analysis of a base cell, the second, surface area for which a surface homogenization problem (and not on unit cell) must be solved./nIn 1993, Pierre Suquet[11] proposed a series of bollards for non-linear phase composites, using a method different from those available at the time (Willis, 1988, Ponte Casta\u00f1eda, 1991), then showed in 1995[12][13] that Ponte Casta\u00f1eda's (1991) variational method is a secant method using the second moment by phase of local fields./nIn 1994, H. Moulinec and P. Suquet[14][15][16][17] introduced a numerical method using massively the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using only a pixelized image of the study microstructure (without mesh size). By introducing a homogeneous reference medium, the heterogeneity of the medium is transformed into a polarization constraint. The Green operator of the reference medium, known explicitly in Fourier space, can be used to iteratively update the polarization field. Several improvements and accelerations have been made to this method, which is now used internationally in dedicated codes./nSince 2003, J.C. Michel and P. Suquet[18][19] have been developing a method to reduce the number of internal variables of homogenized behavioural laws. This Nonuniform Transformation Field Analysis (NTFA) model uses the structuring of microscopic plastic deformation fields.

He endorsed and promoted study of Moorish and Greco-Roman arithmetic, mathematics and astronomy, reintroducing to Europe the abacus and armillary sphere, which had been lost to Latin Europe since the end of the Greco-Roman era. He is said to be the first in Europe to introduce the decimal numeral system using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. He is credited with the invention of the first mechanical clock in 996./n/nGerbert was born about 946,[2] or at any rate between 945 and 950.[3] His exact birthplace is unknown, but it must have been in what was then the Duchy of Aquitaine, part of the Kingdom of France.[4] More precise proposals include the town of Belliac, near the present-day commune of Saint-Simon, Cantal,[2] or Aurillac.[5] Another speculated location is the province of Auvergne.[6] Gerberts parents, wanting him to have a quality education, took him to receive instruction at the nearby Benedictine Abbey.[7] Here, Gerbert became a pupil of a monk named Raimund, who admired his desire of knowledge and assisted him in his studies.[8]/nAround 963, he entered the Monastery of St. Gerald of Aurillac. In 967, Count Borrell II of Barcelona (947\u2013992) visited the monastery, and the abbot asked the count to take Gerbert with him so that the lad could study mathematics in Catalonia and acquire there some knowledge of Arabic learning. While away from the monastery, Gerbert pursued studies in Barcelona, and also received Arabic instruction at Seville and C\u00f3rdoba.[9]/nGerbert studied under the direction of Bishop Atto of Vich, some 60\u00a0km north of Barcelona, and probably also at the nearby Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll.[10] Like all Catalan monasteries, it contained manuscripts from Moslem Spain and especially from Cordoba, one of the intellectual centres of Europe at that time: the library of al-Hakam II, for example, had thousands of books (from science to Greek philosophy). This is where Gerbert was introduced to mathematics and astronomy.[11] Borrell II was facing major defeat from the Andalusian powers so he sent a delegation to C\u00f3rdoba to request a truce. Bishop Atto was part of the delegation that met with al-\u1e24akam II, who received him with honour. Gerbert was fascinated by the stories of the Mozarab Christian bishops and judges who dressed and talked like the Moors, well-versed in mathematics and natural sciences like the great teachers of the Islamic madrasahs. This sparked Gerbert's veneration for the Moors and his passion for mathematics and astronomy./nGerbert learned of Hindu\u2013Arabic digits and applied this knowledge to the abacus, but probably without the numeral zero.[n 2] According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got the idea of the computing device of the abacus from a Moorish scholar[13] from University of Al-Qarawiyyin.[14] The abacus that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an empty column) and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims.[15][16][17] According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his abacus that were extremely difficult for people in his day to think through using only Roman numerals.[15] Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the abacus became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.[17]/nBernelinus of Paris, who was a supposed pupil of Gerbert, wrote a book called the Liber Abaci where he discussed the abacus' design.[18] In this book, he individually introduced each symbol the abacus used and related them to the more common Latin numerical nouns.[19] Bernelinus' Liber Abaci was just one of 11 manuscripts making up the full series, and comparisons between the other volumes show the evolution of the Arabic figures over the course of the 11th and 12th centuries.[20] In particular, Bernelinus' figure for 3 differs from other volumes, as he used the Tironian note resembling \"ter\" in place of the Arabic symbol.[21] The reasoning for this is not known, but it is speculated that Bernelinus did not want to use an \"unbeliever\" symbol to indicate the number that represents the Holy Trinity.[22]/nAlthough lost to Europe since the terminus of the Greco-Roman era, Gerbert reintroduced the astronomical armillary sphere to Latin Europe via the Islamic civilization of Al-Andalus, which was at that time at the \"cutting edge\" of civilization.[23][24] The details of Gerbert's armillary sphere are revealed in letters from Gerbert to his former student and monk Remi of Tr\u00e8ves and to his colleague Constantine, the abbot of Micy, as well as the accounts of his former student and French nobleman Richer, who served as a monk in Rheims.[25] Richer stated that Gerbert discovered that stars coursed in an oblique direction across the night sky.[26] Richer described Gerbert's use of the armillary sphere as a visual aid for teaching mathematics and astronomy in the classroom./nHistorian Oscar G. Darlington asserts that Gerbert's division by 60 degrees instead of 360 allowed the lateral lines of his sphere to equal to six degrees.[27] By this account, the polar circle on Gerbert's sphere was located at 54 degrees,  several degrees off from the actual 66\u00b0 33'.[27] His positioning of the Tropic of Cancer at 24 degree was nearly exact, while his positioning of the equator was correct by definition.[27] Richer also revealed how Gerbert made the planets more easily observable in his armillary sphere:/nHe succeeded equally in showing the paths of the planets when they come near or withdraw from the earth. He fashioned first an armillary sphere. He joined the two circles called by the Greeks coluri and by the Latins incidentes because they fell upon each other, and at their extremities he placed the poles. He drew with great art and accuracy, across the colures, five other circles called parallels, which, from one pole to the other, divided the half of the sphere into thirty parts. He put six of these thirty parts of the half-sphere between the pole and the first circle; five between the first and the second; from the second to the third, four; from the third to the fourth, four again; five from the fourth to the fifth; and from the fifth to the pole, six. On these five circles he placed obliquely the circles that the Greeks call loxos or zoe, the Latins obliques or vitalis (the zodiac) because it contained the figures of the animals ascribed to the planets. On the inside of this oblique circle he figured with an extraordinary art the orbits traversed by the planets, whose paths and heights he demonstrated perfectly to his pupils, as well as their respective distances.[28]/nRicher wrote about another of Gerbert's last armillary spheres, which had sighting tubes fixed on the axis of the hollow sphere that could observe the constellations, the forms of which he hung on iron and copper wires.[29] This armillary sphere was also described by Gerbert in a letter to his colleague Constantine.[30] Gerbert instructed Constantine that, if doubtful of the position of the pole star, he should fix the sighting tube of the armillary sphere into position to view the star he suspected was it, and if the star did not move out of sight, it was thus the pole star.[31] Furthermore, Gerbert instructed Constantine that the north pole could be measured with the upper and lower sighting tubes, the Arctic Circle through another tube, the Tropic of Cancer through another tube, the equator through another tube, and the Tropic of Capricorn through another tube.[31]/nIn late 984, Gerbert sent a letter to abbot Eberhard of Tours concerning the foundation of a large scientific library.[32] He dedicated immense sums of money to establishing the library and purchasing texts from a wide variety of western European authors.[33]  He wrote to many monks and abbots in Europe requesting classical literature from their monasteries.[34] Gerbert was also able to acquire some work from earlier era authors such as Cicero and Statius.[35] Two specific requests Gerbert made that documentation exists for are letters sent to Lupitis of Barcelona and Bishop Mir\u00f3 Bonfill of Girona, asking the former for an astrology book and the latter for an arithmetic book.[36] It can be inferred from this that the library contained many volumes of books covering a wide variety of topics, but the exact size and influence the library had is seemingly unknown./nIn 969, Borrell II made a pilgrimage to Rome, taking Gerbert with him. There Gerbert met Pope John XIII and Emperor Otto I. The pope persuaded Otto I to employ Gerbert as a tutor for his young son, Otto II. Some years later, Otto I gave Gerbert leave to study at the cathedral school of Rheims where he was soon appointed a teacher by Archbishop Adalberon in 973. He remained in this position until 989, with the only gap being his time as the head of the monastery of Bobbio from 981 to 983.[37] When Otto II became sole emperor in 973, he appointed Gerbert the abbot of the monastery of Bobbio and also appointed him as count of the district, but the abbey had been ruined by previous abbots, and Gerbert soon returned to Rheims. After the death of Otto II in 983, Gerbert became involved in the politics of his time. In 985, with the support of his archbishop, he opposed King Lothair of France's attempt to take Lorraine from Emperor Otto III by supporting Hugh Capet. Hugh became king of France, ending the Carolingian line of kings in 987./nAdalberon died on 23 January 989.[38] Gerbert was a natural candidate for his succession,[15] but King Hugh appointed Arnulf, an illegitimate son of King Lothair, instead. Arnulf was deposed in 991 for alleged treason against Hugh, and Gerbert was elected his successor. There was so much opposition to Gerbert's elevation to the See of Rheims, however, that Pope John XV (985\u2013996) sent a legate to France who temporarily suspended Gerbert from his episcopal office. Gerbert sought to show that this decree was unlawful, but a further synod in 995 declared Arnulf's deposition invalid. Gerbert then became the teacher of Otto III, and Pope Gregory V (996\u2013999), Otto III's cousin, appointed him archbishop of Ravenna in 998./nWith imperial support, Gerbert was elected to succeed Gregory V as pope in 999. Gerbert took the name of Sylvester II, alluding to Sylvester I (314\u2013335),[citation needed] the advisor to Emperor Constantine I (324\u2013337). Soon after he became pope, Sylvester II confirmed the position of his former rival Arnulf as archbishop of Rheims. As pope, he took energetic measures against the widespread practices of simony and concubinage among the clergy, maintaining that only capable men of spotless lives should be allowed to become bishops. In 1001, the Roman populace revolted, forcing Otto III and Sylvester II to flee to Ravenna. Otto III led two unsuccessful expeditions to regain control of the city and died on a third expedition in 1002. Sylvester II returned to Rome soon after the emperor's death, although the rebellious nobility remained in power, and died a little later. Sylvester is buried in St. John Lateran./nGerbert of Aurillac was a noted humanist. He read Virgil, Cicero and Boethius; he studied Latin translations of Porphyry and Aristotle. He had a very accurate classification of the different disciplines of philosophy. He was the first French pope./nGerbert was said to be one of the most noted scientists of his time. Gerbert wrote a series of works dealing with matters of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music), which he taught using the basis of the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric). In Rheims, he constructed a hydraulic-powered organ with brass pipes that excelled all previously known instruments,[39] where the air had to be pumped manually. In a letter of 984, Gerbert asks Lupitus of Barcelona for a book on astrology and astronomy, two terms historian S. Jim Tester says Gerbert used synonymously.[40] Gerbert may have been the author of a description of the astrolabe that was edited by Hermannus Contractus some 50 years later. Besides these, as Sylvester II he wrote a dogmatic treatise, De corpore et sanguine Domini\u2014On the Body and Blood of the Lord./nThe legend of Gerbert grows from the work of the English monk William of Malmesbury in De Rebus Gestis Regum Anglorum and a polemical pamphlet, Gesta Romanae Ecclesiae contra Hildebrandum, by Cardinal Beno, a partisan of Emperor Henry IV who opposed Pope Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy.[citation needed] According to the legend, Gerbert, traveled to Spain in order to further his knowledge of the lawful arts, as defined by the quadrivium. Gerbert quickly became more knowledgeable than anyone around him in mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. This is the point in William of Malmesbury's testimony where Gerbert is said to have begun learning the dark arts.[41] During Gerberts time in Spain, he was said to live with a Saracen philosopher, who was responsible for giving this knowledge to Sylvester. This knowledge was first obtained through using money and promises as bartering chips for the philosoper's books, which Gerbert translated and learned from.[41] Despite his efforts, there was one book that Gerbert was not able to coax from the philosopher.[41] This book was said to contain all of the knowledge the Saracen philosopher had on the dark arts. After resorting to using wine, and intimacy with his daughter, Gerbert was able to steal the book from under the philosopher's pillow while he slept.[41] Gerbert fled, pursued by the victim, who could trace the thief by the stars, but Gerbert was aware of the pursuit, and hid hanging from a wooden bridge, where, suspended between heaven and earth, he was invisible to the magician.[42]/nGerbert was supposed to have built a brazen head. This \"robotic\" head would answer his questions with \"yes\" or \"no\".  He was also reputed to have had a pact with a female demon called Meridiana, who had appeared after he had been rejected by his earthly love, and with whose help he managed to ascend to the papal throne (another legend tells that he won the papacy playing dice with the Devil).[43]/nAccording to the legend, Meridiana (or the bronze head) told Gerbert that if he should ever read a Mass in Jerusalem, the Devil would come for him. Gerbert then cancelled a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but when he read Mass in the church Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (\"Holy Cross of Jerusalem\") in Rome, he became sick soon afterwards and, dying, he asked his cardinals to cut up his body and scatter it across the city.  In another version, he was even attacked by the Devil while he was reading the Mass, and the Devil mutilated him and gave his gouged-out eyes to demons to play with in the Church. Repenting, Sylvester II then cut off his hand and his tongue./nThe inscription on Gerbert's tomb reads in part Iste locus Silvestris membra sepulti venturo Domino conferet ad sonitum (\"This place will yield to the sound [of the last trumpet] the limbs of buried Sylvester II, at the advent of the Lord\", mis-read as \"will make a sound\") and has given rise to the curious legend that his bones will rattle in that tomb just before the death of a pope.[44]/nThe story of the crown and papal legate authority allegedly given to Stephen I of Hungary by Sylvester in the year 1000 (hence the title 'apostolic king') is noted by the 19th-century historian Lewis L. Kropf as a possible forgery of the 17th century.[45] Likewise, the 20th-century historian Zoltan J. Kosztolnyik states that \"it seems more than unlikely that Rome would have acted in fulfilling Stephen's request for a crown without the support and approval of the emperor.\"[46]/nThough the testimony of William of Malmesbury did much to discredit and defame Gerbert, there were many important intellectual distinctions made from it.[47] For example, the legend of Gerbert of Aurilac's talking head helped to describe the line between prohibited and permitted knowledge. Gerbert did work in music theory, mathematics, geometry, and several other fields accepted and taught in the quadrivium.[47] All of the works he did related to these subjects were not brought into question and were accepted as well as appreciated. But works done outside of the accepted liberal arts was condemned, including things learned from bird's songs and flight patterns, as well as the necromancy he was rumored to have taken part in.[47]/nHungary issued a commemorative stamp honouring Pope Sylvester II on 1 January 1938,[48] and France honoured him in 1964 by issuing a postage stamp.[49]/nGerbert's writings were printed in volume 139 of the Patrologia Latina. Darlington notes that Gerbert's preservation of his letters might have been an effort of his to compile them into a textbook for his pupils that would illustrate proper letter writing.[27] His books on mathematics and astronomy were not research-oriented; his texts were primarily educational guides for his students.[27]", "64413735": "Christian Reinsch (born 1934 in Chemnitz, died on October 8, 2022) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of numerical analysis./nReinsch began studying physics in 1953 at the Technical University of Munich, graduating in 1958.

He was born in Acireale, and died in Rome./nHe was born in Acireale, a town near Catania in Sicily, the elder of the four sons of Giuseppe Fichera and Marianna Abate.[1] His father Giuseppe was a professor of mathematics and influenced the young Gaetano starting his lifelong passion. In his young years he was a talented football player. On 1 February 1943 he was in the Italian Army and during the events of September 1943 he was taken prisoner by the Nazist troops, kept imprisoned in Teramo and then sent to Verona: he succeeded in escaping from there and reached the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, spending with partisans the last year of war. After the war he was first in Rome and then in Trieste, where he met Matelda Colautti, who became his wife in 1952./nAfter graduating from the liceo classico in only two years, he entered the University of Catania at the age of 16, being there from 1937 to 1939 and studying under Pia Nalli. Then he went to the university of Rome, where in 1941 he earned his laurea with magna cum laude under the direction of Mauro Picone, when he was only 19. He was immediately appointed by Picone as an assistant professor to his chair and as a researcher at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo, becoming his pupil. After the war he went back to Rome working with Mauro Picone: in 1948 he became \"Libero Docente\" (free professor) of mathematical analysis and in 1949 he was appointed as full professor at the University of Trieste. As he remembers in (Fichera 1991b, p.\u00a014), in both cases one of the members of the judging commission was Renato Caccioppoli, which become a close friend of him. From 1956 onward he was full professor at the University of Rome in the chair of mathematical analysis and then at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in the chair of higher analysis, succeeding to Luigi Fantappi\u00e8. He retired from university teaching in 1992,[2] but was professionally very active until his death in 1996: particularly, as a member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei and first director of the journal Rendiconti Lincei \u2013 Matematica e Applicazioni,[3] he succeeded in reviving its reputation.[4]/nHe was member of several academies, notably of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Accademia Nazionale delle Scienze detta dei XL and of the Russian Academy of Science./nHis lifelong friendship with his teacher Mauro Picone is remembered by him in several occasions. As recalled by Colautti Fichera (2006, pp.\u00a013\u201314), his father Giuseppe was an assistant professor to the chair of Picone while he was teaching at the University of Catania: they become friends and their friendship lasted even when Giuseppe was forced to leave the academic career for economic reasons, being already the father of two sons, until Giuseppe's death. The young, in effect child, Gaetano, was kept by Picone in his arms. From 1939 to 1941 the young Fichera developed his research directly under the supervision of Picone: as he remembers, it was a time of intense work. But also, when he was back from the front in April 1945[5] he met Picone while he was in Roma in his way back to Sicily, and his advisor was so happy to see him as a father can be seeing its living child. Another mathematician Fichera was influenced by and acknowledged as one of his teachers and inspirators was Pia Nalli: she was an outstanding analyst, teaching for several years at the University of Catania, being his teacher of mathematical analysis from 1937 to 1939. Antonio Signorini and Francesco Severi were two of Fichera's teachers of the Roman period: the first one introduced him and inspired his research in the field of linear elasticity while the second inspired his research in the field he taught him i.e. the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables. Signorini had a strong long-time friendship with Picone: on a wall of the apartment building where they lived, in Via delle Tre Madonne, 18 in Rome, a memorial tablet which commemorates the two friends is placed, as Fichera (1995b, p.\u00a047) recalls. The two great mathematicians extended their friendship to the young Fichera, and as a consequence this led to the solution of the Signorini problem and the foundation of the theory of variational inequalities. Fichera's relations with Severi were not as friendly as with Signorini and Picone: nevertheless, Severi, which was one of the most influential Italian mathematicians of the first half of the 20th century, esteemed the young mathematician. During a course on the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables taught at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica from the fall of 1956 and the beginning of the 1957, whose lectures were collected in the book (Severi 1958), Severi posed the problem of generalizing his theorem on the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic function of several variables, as Fichera (1957, p.\u00a0707) recalls: the result was the paper (Fichera 1957), which is a masterpiece, although not generally acknowledged for various reasons described by Range (2002, pp.\u00a06\u201311). Other scientists he had as teachers during the period 1939\u20131941 were Enrico Bompiani, Leonida Tonelli and Giuseppe Armellini: he remembered them with great respect and admiration, even if he did not share all their opinions and ideas, as Colautti Fichera (2006, p.\u00a016) recalls./nA complete list of Fichera's friends includes some of the best scientists and mathematicians of the 20th century: Olga Oleinik, Olga Ladyzhenskaya, Israel Gel'fand, Ivan Petrovsky, Vladimir Maz'ya, Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, Ilia Vekua, Richard Courant, Fritz John, Kurt Friedrichs, Peter Lax, Louis Nirenberg, Ronald Rivlin, Hans Lewy, Clifford Truesdell, Edmund Hlawka, Ian Sneddon, Jean Leray, Alexander Weinstein, Alexander Ostrowski, Renato Caccioppoli, Solomon Mikhlin, Paul Naghdi, Marston Morse were among his friends, scientific collaborators and correspondents, just to name a few. He built up such a network of contacts being invited several times to lecture on his research by various universities and research institutions, and also participating to several academic conferences, always upon invitation. This long series of scientific journeys started in 1951, when he went to the USA together with his master and friend Mauro Picone and Bruno de Finetti in order to examine the capabilities and characteristics of the first electronic computers and purchase one for the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo: the machine they advised to purchase was the first computer ever working in Italy. The most complete source about his friends and collaborators is the book (Colautti Fichera 2006) by his wife Matelda: in those reference it is also possible to find a fairly complete description of Gaetano Fichera's scientific journeys./nThe close friendship between Angelo Pescarini and Fichera has not his roots in their scientific interests: it is another war story. As Oleinik (1997, p.\u00a012) recalls, Gaetano, being escaped from Verona and hidden in a convent in Alfonsine, tried to get in touch with the local group of partisans in order to help the people of that town who had been so helpful with him: they were informed about an assistant professor to the chair of higher analysis in Rome who was trying to reach them. Angelo, which was a student of mathematics at the University of Bologna under Gianfranco Cimmino, a former pupil of Mauro Picone, was charged of the task of testing the truth of Gaetano's assertions, examining him in mathematics: his question was:\u2013 \"Mi sai dire una condizione sufficiente per scambiare un limite con un integrale (Can you give me a sufficient condition for interchanging limit and integration)?\"\u2013. Gaetano quickly answered:\u2013 \"Non solo ti dar\u00f2 la condizione sufficiente, ma ti dar\u00f2 anche la condizione necessaria e pure per insiemi non-limitati (I can give you not only a sufficient condition, but also a necessary condition, and not only for bounded domains, but also for unbounded domains)\"\u2013. In effect, Fichera proved such a theorem in the paper (Fichera 1943), his latest paper written in while he was in Rome before joining the army: from that moment on he often used to joke saying that good mathematicians can always have a good application, even for saving one's life./nOne of his best friends and appreciated scientific collaborator was Olga Arsenievna Oleinik: she cured the redaction of his last posthumous paper (Fichera 1997), as Colautti Fichera (2006, pp.\u00a0202\u2013204) recalls. Also, she used to discuss his work with Gaetano, as he did with her: sometimes their discussion become lively, but nothing more, since they were extremely good friends and estimators of each one's work./nHe is the author of more than 250 papers and 18 books (monographs and course notes): his work concerns mainly the fields of pure and applied mathematics listed below. A common characteristic to all of his research is the use of the methods of functional analysis to prove existence, uniqueness and approximation theorems for the various problems he studied, and also a high consideration of the analytic problems related to problems in applied mathematics./nHis work in elasticity theory includes the paper (Fichera 1961c), where Fichera proves the \"Fichera's maximum principle\", his work on variational inequalities. The work on this last topic started with the paper (Fichera 1963), where he announced the existence and uniqueness theorem for the Signorini problem, and ended with the following one (Fichera 1964a),[6] where the full proof was published: those papers are the founding works of the field of variational inequalities, as remarked by Stuart Antman in (Antman 1983, pp.\u00a0282\u2013284).[7] Concerning the Saint-Venant's principle, he was able to prove it using a variational approach and a slight variation of a technique employed by Richard Toupin to study the same problem: in the paper (Fichera 1979a)[8] there is a complete proof of the principle under the hypothesis that the base of the cylinder is a set with piecewise smooth boundary. Also he is known for his researches in the theory of hereditary elasticity: the paper (Fichera 1979b) emphasizes the necessity of analyzing very well the constitutive equations of materials with memory in order to introduce models where an existence and uniqueness theorems can be proved in such a way that the proof does not rely on an implicit choice of the topology of the function space where the problem is studied. At last, it is worth to mention that Clifford Truesdell invited him to write the contributions (Fichera 1972a) and (Fichera 1972b) for Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge's Handbuch der Physik./nHe was one of the pioneers in the development of the abstract approach through functional analysis in order to study general boundary value problems for linear partial differential equations proving in the paper (Fichera 1955a) a theorem similar in spirit to the Lax\u2013Milgram theorem. He studied deeply the mixed boundary value problem i.e. a boundary value problem where the boundary has to satisfy a mixed boundary condition: in his first paper on the topic, (Fichera 1949), he proves the first existence theorem for the mixed boundary problem for self-adjoint operators of n\u00a0>\u00a02 variables, while in the paper (Fichera 1955a, pp.\u00a022\u201329) he proves the same theorem dropping the hypothesis of self-adjointness. He is, according to Oleinik (1997), the founder of the theory of partial differential equations of non-positive characteristics: in the paper (Fichera 1956) he introduced the now called Fichera's function, in order to identify subsets of the boundary of the domain where the boundary value problem for such kind of equations is posed, where it is necessary or not to specify the boundary condition: another account of the theory can be found in the paper (Fichera 1960), which is written in English and was later translated in Russian and Hungarian.[9]/nHis contributions to the calculus of variation are mainly devoted to the proof of existence and uniqueness theorems for maxima and minima of functionals of particular form, in conjunction with his studies on variational inequalities and linear elasticity in theoretical and applied problems: in the paper (Fichera 1964a) a semicontinuity theorem for a functional introduced in the same paper is proved in order to solve the Signorini problem, and this theorem was extended in (Fichera 1964c) to the case where the given functional has general linear operators as arguments, not necessarily partial differential operators./nIt is difficult to single out his contributions to functional analysis since, as stated at the beginning of this section, the methods of functional analysis are ubiquitous in his research: however, it is worth to remember paper (Fichera 1955a), where an important existence theorem is proved.[10]/nHis contributions in the field of eigenvalue theory began with the paper (Fichera 1955b), where he formalizes a method developed by Mauro Picone for the approximation of eigenvalues of operators subject only to the condition that their inverse is compact: however, as he admits in (Fichera 1974a, pp.\u00a013\u201314), this method does not give any estimate on the approximation error on the value of the calculated (approximated) eigenvalues./nHe contributed also to the classical eigenvalue problem for symmetric operators, introducing the method of orthogonal invariants.[11]/nHis work in this field is mainly related to the study of systems of functions, possibly being particular solutions of a given partial differential equation or system of such equations, in order to prove their completeness on the boundary of a given domain. The interest of this research is obvious: given such a system of functions, every solution of a boundary value problem can be approximated by an infinite series or Fourier type integral in the topology of a given function space. One of the most famous examples of this kind of theorem is Mergelyan's theorem, which completely solves the problem in the class of holomorphic functions for a compact set in the complex plane. In his paper (Fichera 1948), Fichera studies this problem for harmonic functions,[12] relaxing the smoothness requirements on the boundary in the already cited work (Fichera 1955a): a survey on his and others' work in this area, including contributions of Mauro Picone, Bernard Malgrange, Felix Browder and a number of other mathematicians, is contained in the paper (Fichera 1979c). Another branch of his studies on approximation theory is strictly tied to complex analysis in one variable, and to the already cited Mergelyan's theorem: he studied the problem of approximating continuous functions on a compact set (and analytic on its interior if this is non-void) of the complex plane by rational functions with prescribed poles, simple or not. The paper (Fichera 1974b) surveys the contribution to the solution of this and related problems by Sergey Mergelyan, Lennart Carleson, G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151 as well as others, including his own./nHis contributions to potential theory are very important. The results of his paper (Fichera 1948) occupy paragraph 24 of chapter II of the textbook (G\u00fcnther 1967, pp.\u00a0108\u2013117), as remarked by in Oleinik (1997, p.\u00a011). Also, his researches (Fichera 1975) and (Fichera 1976) on the asymptotic behaviour of the electric field near singular points of the conducting surface, widely known among the specialists (as several works of V.G. Maz'ya, S.A. Nazarov, B.A. Plamenevsky, B.W. Schulze and others testify) can be included in between his works in potential theory./nHis main contributions to those topics and are the papers (Fichera 1943) and (Fichera 1954). In the first one he proves that a condition on a sequence of integrable functions previously introduced by Mauro Picone is both necessary and sufficient in order to assure that limit process and the integration process commute, both in bounded and unbounded domains: the theorem is similar in spirit to the dominated convergence theorem, which however only states a sufficient condition. The second paper contains an extension of the Lebesgue's decomposition theorem to finitely additive measures: this extension required him to generalize the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative, requiring it to be a set function belonging to a given class and minimizing a particular functional./nHe contributed to both the classical topic of complex analysis in one variable and the more recent one of complex analysis in several variables. His contributions to complex analysis in one variable are essentially approximation results, well described in the survey paper (Fichera 1974b).[13] In the field of functions of several complex variables, his contributions were outstanding,[according to whom?] but also not generally acknowledged.[14] Precisely, in the paper (Fichera 1957) he solved the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic function of several variables under the hypothesis that the boundary of the domain \u2202\u03a9 has a H\u00f6lder continuous normal vector (i.e. it belongs to the C{1,\u03b1}  class) and the Dirichlet boundary condition is a function belonging to the Sobolev space H1/2(\u2202\u03a9) satisfying the weak form of the tangential Cauchy\u2013Riemann condition,[15][16] extending a previous result of Francesco Severi: this theorem and the Lewy\u2013Kneser theorem on the local Cauchy problem for holomorphic functions of several variables, laid the foundations of the theory of CR-functions. Another important result is his proof in (Fichera 1983) of an extension of Morera's theorem to functions of several complex variables, under the hypothesis that the given function f is only locally integrable: previous proofs under more restrictive assumptions were given by Francesco Severi in (Severi 1931) and Salomon Bochner in (Bochner 1953). He also studied the properties of the real part and imaginary part of functions of several complex variables, i.e. pluriharmonic functions: starting from the paper (Amoroso 1912) he gives a trace condition analogous to the tangential Cauchy\u2013Riemann condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for pluriharmonic functions in the paper (Fichera 1982a), and generalizes a theorem of Luigi Amoroso to the complex vector space \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\nR\n\n\n2\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}\\equiv \\mathbb {R} ^{2n}}\n\n for n\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 complex variables in the paper (Fichera 1982b). Also he was able to prove that an integro-differential equation defined on the boundary of a smooth domain by Luigi Amoroso in his cited paper, the Amoroso integro-differential equation, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for pluriharmonic functions when this domain is the sphere in \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2261\n\n\nR\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{2}\\equiv \\mathbb {R} ^{4}}\n\n.[17]/nHis contributions to the theory of exterior differential forms started as a war story:[18] having read a famous memoir of Enrico Betti (where Betti numbers were introduced) just before joining the army, he used this knowledge in order to develop a theory of exterior differential forms while he was kept prisoner in Teramo jail.[19] When he was back in Rome in 1945, he discussed his discovery with Enzo Martinelli, who very tactfully informed him that the idea was already developed by mathematicians \u00c9lie Cartan and Georges de Rham. However, he continued work on this theory, contributing with several papers, and also advised all of his students to study it, despite from the fact of being an analyst, as he remarks: his main results are collected in the papers (Fichera 1961a) and (Fichera 1961b). In the first one he introduced k-measures, a concept less general than currents but easier to work with: his aim was to clarify the analytic structure of currents and to prove all relevant results of the theory i.e. the three theorems of de Rham and Hodge theorem on harmonic forms in a simpler, more analytic way. In the second one he developed an abstract Hodge theory, following the axiomatic method, proving an abstract form of Hodge theorem./nAs noted in the \"Functional analysis and eigenvalue theory\" section, his main direct contribution to the field of numerical analysis is the introduction of the method of orthogonal invariants for the calculus of eigenvalues of symmetric operators: however, as already remarked, it is hard to find something in his works which is not related to applications. His works on partial differential equations and linear elasticity have always a constructive aim: for example, the results of paper (Fichera 1975), which deals with the asymptotic analysis of the potential, were included in the book (Fichera 1978a) and led to the definition of the Fichera corner problem as a standard benchmark problem for numerical methods.[20] Another example of his work on quantitative problems is the interdisciplinary study (Fichera, Sneider & Wyman 1977), surveyed in (Fichera 1978b), where methods of mathematical analysis and numerical analysis are applied to a problem posed by biological sciences.[21][22]/nhis work in this field occupy all the volume (Fichera 2002). He wrote bibliographical sketches for a number of mathematicians, both teachers, friends and collaborators, including Mauro Picone, Luigi Fantappi\u00e8, Pia Nalli, Maria Adelaide Sneider, Renato Caccioppoli, Solomon Mikhlin, Francesco Tricomi, Alexander Weinstein, Aldo Ghizzetti. His historical works contain several observations against the so-called historical revisitation: the meaning of this concept is clearly stated in the paper (Fichera 1996). He identifies with the word revisitation the analysis of historical facts basing only on modern conceptions and points of view: this kind of analysis differs from the \"true\" historical one since it is heavily affected by the historian's point of view.

His name is firmly associated with l'H\u00f4pital's rule for calculating limits involving indeterminate forms 0/0 and \u221e/\u221e. Although the rule did not originate with l'H\u00f4pital, it appeared in print for the first time in his 1696 treatise on the infinitesimal calculus, entitled Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes.[3] This book was a first systematic exposition of differential calculus. Several editions and translations to other languages were published and it became a model for subsequent treatments of calculus./nL'H\u00f4pital was born into a military family. His father was Anne-Alexandre de l'H\u00f4pital, a Lieutenant-General of the King's army, Comte de Saint-Mesme and the first squire of Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. His mother was Elisabeth Gobelin, a daughter of Claude Gobelin, Intendant in the King's Army and Councilor of the State./nL'H\u00f4pital abandoned a military career due to poor eyesight and pursued his interest in mathematics,[4] which was apparent since his childhood. For a while, he was a member of Nicolas Malebranche's circle in Paris and it was there that in 1691 he met young Johann Bernoulli, who was visiting France and agreed to supplement his Paris talks on infinitesimal calculus with private lectures to l'H\u00f4pital at his estate at Oucques. In 1693, l'H\u00f4pital was elected to the French academy of sciences and even served twice as its vice-president.[5] Among his accomplishments were the determination of the arc length of the logarithmic graph,[6] one of the solutions to the brachistochrone problem, and the discovery of a turning point singularity on the involute of a plane curve near an inflection point.[7]/nL'H\u00f4pital exchanged ideas with Pierre Varignon and corresponded with Gottfried Leibniz, Christiaan Huygens, and Jacob and Johann Bernoulli.

This was the first textbook on infinitesimal calculus and it presented the ideas of differential calculus and their applications to differential geometry of curves in a lucid form and with numerous figures; however, it did not consider integration./nThe history leading to the book's publication became a subject of a protracted controversy. In a letter from 17 March 1694, l'H\u00f4pital made the following proposal to Johann Bernoulli: in exchange for an annual payment of 300 Francs, Bernoulli would inform l'H\u00f4pital of his latest mathematical discoveries, withholding them from correspondence with others, including Varignon. Bernoulli's immediate response has not been preserved, but he must have agreed soon, as the subsequent letters show. L'H\u00f4pital may have felt fully justified in describing these results in his book, after acknowledging his debt to Leibniz and the Bernoulli brothers, \"especially the younger one\" (Johann). Johann Bernoulli grew increasingly unhappy with the accolades bestowed on l'H\u00f4pital's work and complained in private correspondence about being sidelined. After l'H\u00f4pital's death, he publicly revealed their agreement and claimed credit for the statements and portions of the text of Analyse, which were supplied to l'H\u00f4pital in letters. Over a period of many years, Bernoulli made progressively stronger allegations about his role in the writing of Analyse, culminating in the publication of his old work on integral calculus in 1742: he remarked that this is a continuation of his old lectures on differential calculus, which he discarded since l'H\u00f4pital had already included them in his famous book. For a long time, these claims were not regarded as credible by many historians of mathematics, because l'H\u00f4pital's mathematical talent was not in doubt, while Bernoulli was involved in several other priority disputes. For example, both H. G. Zeuthen and Moritz Cantor, writing at the cusp of the 20th century, dismissed Bernoulli's claims on these grounds. However, in 1921 Paul Schafheitlin discovered a manuscript of Bernoulli's lectures on differential calculus from 1691 to 1692 in the Basel University library. The text showed remarkable similarities to l'H\u00f4pital's writing, substantiating Bernoulli's account of the book's origin./nL'H\u00f4pital's pedagogical brilliance in arranging and presenting the material remains universally recognized.[citation needed] Regardless of the exact authorship (the book was first published anonymously), Analyse was remarkably successful in popularizing the ideas of differential calculus stemming from Leibniz.[citation needed]/nL'H\u00f4pital married Marie-Charlotte de Romilley de La Chesnelaye, also a mathematician and a member of the nobility, and inheritor of large estates in Brittany.

Zacuto first fled to Tunis and later moved to Jerusalem.[2] He probably died in 1515 in Jerusalem; however, other reports indicate his final home was the Jewish community in Damascus and his death occurred in 1520.[2] However, in a similar vein to other giants of the Jewish faith, such as Saadia Gaon, Maimonides and the Vilna Gaon, he followed the Jewish custom (believed to have begun in the Babylonian captivity) of being buried as close to Jerusalem as possible. Zacuto had announced his wish to make his death pilgrimage at a Passover gathering.[citation needed]/nAbraham Zacuto developed a new type of astrolabe, specialised for practical determination of latitude while at sea, in contrast to earlier multi-purpose devices intended for use ashore. Zacuto's principal claim to fame is the great astronomical treatise, written in Hebrew while he was in Salamanca,  with the title Ha-\u1e25ibbur ha-gadol (\"The Great Book\").  It was begun around 1470 and completed in 1478.[4] It was composed of 65 detailed astronomical tables (ephemerides), with radix set for the year 1473 and with the meridian at Salamanca, charting the positions of the Sun, Moon and five planets.[4]  The calculations were based on the Alfonsine Tables and the works of earlier astronomers (notably of the 14th-century Majorcan school).  Zacuto set out the data in a simple \"almanac\" format, with the positions of a planet easily interpolated between entries, making it quite easy to use.[4]/nThe first Castilian translation was undertaken in 1481 by Juan de Salaya.[4]  Zacuto's Portuguese disciple Joseph Vizinus (Mestre Jos\u00e9 Vizinho, the much-valued physician and advisor of John II of Portugal) translated it into Latin, under the title Tabulae tabularum Celestium motuum sive Almanach perpetuum (\"Book of Tables on the celestial motions or the Perpetual Almanac\"), along with a new Castilian translation, and arranged for its publication in 1496 by Samuel d'Ortas in Leiria, Portugal.[4] (one of the first books published in Portugal with a movable type printing press).[citation needed]/nZacuto's Almanach perpetuum (or Biur lu\u1e25ot) revolutionised ocean navigation.  Prior to the Almanach, navigators seeking to determine their position on the high seas had to correct for \"compass error\" (the deviation of the magnetic north from the true north) by recourse to the quadrant and the Pole Star. But this proved less useful as they approached the equator and the Pole Star began to disappear under the horizon. Zacuto's Almanach supplied the first accurate table of solar declination, allowing navigators to use the sun instead.[5]  As the quadrant could not be used to look directly at the sun, Portuguese navigators began using the astrolabe on board (an old land-based instrument to measure the height of the sun indirectly). Zacuto's tables in conjunction with the new metal nautical astrolabe allowed navigators to take accurate readings anywhere.  Already in 1497, Vasco da Gama took Zacuto's tables and the astrolabe with him on his maiden trip to India.[6]  It continued to be used by Portuguese ships thereafter to reach far-off destinations such as Brazil and India.[7]/nVasco da Gama and his crew underwent a thorough briefing and preparation by Zacuto.  They learnt how to use the new instruments which he had developed for their trip before they set off on their voyage to India in 1496. Prior to that, Zacuto had further improved existing astronomical tables, mostly those prepared under King Alphonso X of Castille. Already Columbus had used Zacuto's tables. The story is that on one of his voyages, when attacked by the natives, Columbus noted that Zacuto had predicted an eclipse for that day, and used this information to threaten the natives and convince them that he could extinguish the Sun and Moon and deprive them of all light. Based on this story, Zacuto's work saved the Admiral's life and that of his crew.[8]/nIn 1504, while in Tunisia, Abraham Zacuto wrote a history of the Jewish people, Sefer yu\u1e25asin, starting with the Creation of the World and going to 1500,[9][10] and several other astronomical/astrological treatises. The History was highly regarded and was reprinted in Cracow in 1581, in Amsterdam in 1717, and in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1857, while a complete, uncensored,[11] edition was published by Herschell Filipowski in London in 1857.[12]/nAbraham Zacuto might have an uncredited appearance in Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es's 1572 epic poem, Os Lus\u00edadas, as \"the Old Man of Restelo\", a Cassandra-like character that comes forward just before Vasco da Gama's departure to chide the vanity of fame and warn of the travails that await him  (Canto IV, v.94-111). This may be Cam\u00f5es' poetic interpretation of an alleged meeting reported by Gaspar Correia between Vasco da Gama and the old Abraham Zacuto at a monastery near Bel\u00e9m beach just before his fleet's departure, in which Zacuto reportedly gave Gama some final navigational tips and warned him of the dangers to avoid.[13]/nThe small Abraham Zacuto Portuguese Jewish Museum (Portuguese: Museu Luso-Hebraico Abra\u00e3o Zacuto), founded in 1939 and located in the former Synagogue of Tomar, is named after Zacuto.[14][15]/nThe crater Zagut on the Moon is named after him.", "2252908": "Jacques Philippe Marie Binet (French: [bin\u025b]; 2 February 1786 \u2013 12 May 1856) was a French mathematician, physicist and astronomer born in Rennes; he died in Paris, France, in 1856.

After his studies at the University of Dorpat (where his father was a professor), he moved to Erlangen to become a student of Felix Klein. He published his Ph.D. thesis in 1875 and received the right to teach (venia legendi) at the University of Leipzig the same year. One year later he accepted a position at the Technical University of Darmstadt. In 1877 he married Elisabeth von \u00d6ttingen, and they moved to Dresden, where he acquired a professorship in the Polytechnikum, which became a technical university in 1890. Harnack suffered from health problems from 1882 onwards, forcing him to spend long periods in a sanatorium. He published 29 scientific articles and was a well-known mathematician at the time of his death./nThe various Harnack inequalities in harmonic analysis and in related discrete and probabilistic contexts are named after him, as are Harnack's curve theorem and Harnack's principle.

He was brought up in Oxford, went to Eton and read mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford. After a year working as a stockbroker, at Buckmaster & Moore, he started a PhD in 1929 at Princeton University. His thesis, titled The representation of projective spaces, was written under the direction of Oswald Veblen in 1930. While in Princeton, he also worked with Solomon Lefschetz./nHe became a fellow of Balliol in 1933.

In 1936, he co-founded The Invariant Society, the student mathematics society at Oxford.[2]/nDuring the Second World War he worked on operations research for submarine warfare. Later, he joined the codebreakers at Bletchley Park, and by 1945 was one of some fifteen mathematicians working in the \"Newmanry\", a section headed by Max Newman and responsible for breaking a German teleprinter cipher using machine methods.[3] Those methods included the Colossus machines, early digital electronic computers.[3]/nFrom 1947 to 1960 he was the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford./nHe became president of the London Mathematical Society (LMS) in 1953, a post he held until 1955.[4] The LMS established two prizes in memory of Whitehead. The first is the annually awarded, to multiple recipients, Whitehead Prize; the second a biennially awarded Senior Whitehead Prize.[5]/nJoseph J.

He introduced the idea of simple homotopy theory, which was later much developed in connection with algebraic K-theory. The Whitehead product is an operation in homotopy theory. The Whitehead problem on abelian groups was solved (as an independence proof) by Saharon Shelah.[8] His involvement with topology and the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture led to the creation of the Whitehead manifold.

He has been called \"one of the finest mathematicians of the nineteenth century\".[1] He was the father of Emmy Noether./nMax Noether was born in Mannheim in 1844, to a Jewish family of wealthy wholesale hardware dealers. His grandfather, Elias Samuel, had started the business in Bruchsal in 1797. In 1809 the Grand Duchy of Baden established a \"Tolerance Edict\", which assigned a hereditary surname to the male head of every Jewish family which did not already possess one. Thus the Samuels became the Noether family, and as part of this Christianization of names, their son Hertz (Max's father) became Hermann. Max was the third of five children Hermann had with his wife Amalia W\u00fcrzburger.[2]/nAt 14, Max contracted polio and was afflicted by its effects for the rest of his life. Through self-study, he learned advanced mathematics and entered the University of Heidelberg in 1865. He served on the faculty there for several years, then moved to the University of Erlangen in 1888. While there, he helped to found the field of algebraic geometry.[3]/nIn 1880 he married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of another wealthy Jewish merchant family. Two years later they had their first child, named Amalia (\"Emmy\") after her mother. Emmy Noether went on to become a central figure in abstract algebra. In 1883 they had a son named Alfred, who later studied chemistry before dying in 1918. Their third child, Fritz Noether, was born in 1884, and like Emmy, found prominence as a mathematician; he was executed in the Soviet Union in 1941. Little is known about their fourth child, Gustav Robert, born in 1889; he suffered from continual illness and died in 1928.[4]/nNoether served as an Ordinarius (full professor) at Erlangen for many years, and died there on 13 December 1921./nBrill and Max Noether developed alternative proofs using algebraic methods for much of Riemann's work on Riemann surfaces.

His 1930 monograph, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, is considered to be one of the most influential texts on quantum mechanics.[19]/nDirac's contributions were not only restricted to quantum mechanics. He contributed to the Tube Alloys project, the British programme to research and construct atomic bombs during World War II.[20][21] Furthermore, Dirac made fundamental contributions to the process of uranium enrichment and the gas centrifuge,[22][23][24][21] and whose work was deemed to be \"probably the most important theoretical result in centrifuge technology\".[25] He also contributed to cosmology, putting forth his large numbers hypothesis.[26][22][27][28][29] Dirac is also seen as having anticipated string theory well before its inception, with his work on the Dirac membrane and Dirac\u2013Born\u2013Infeld action, amongst other contributions.[30][31]/nDirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote of a Dirac paper, \"I  am toiling over Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.\" In another letter concerning the Compton effect he wrote, \"I don't understand the details of Dirac at all.\"[32] In 1987, Abdus Salam stated that \"Dirac was undoubtedly one of the greatest physicists of this or any century . . . No man except Einstein has had such a decisive influence, in so short a time, on the course of physics in this century.\"[33] In 1995, Stephen Hawking stated that \"Dirac has done more than anyone this century, with the exception of Einstein, to advance physics and change our picture of the universe\".[34] Antonino Zichichi asserted that Dirac had a greater impact on modern physics than Einstein.[14] His achievements are said to be on par with Sir Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell and Einstein.[35][36][37]/nPaul Adrien Maurice Dirac was born at his parents' home in Bristol, England, on 8 August 1902,[38] and grew up in the Bishopston area of the city.[39] His father, Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac, was an immigrant from Saint-Maurice, Switzerland, of French descent,[6] who worked in Bristol as a French teacher. His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, n\u00e9e Holten, was born to a Cornish Methodist family in Liskeard, Cornwall.[40][41] She was named after Florence Nightingale by her father, a ship's captain, who had met Nightingale while he was a soldier during the Crimean war.[42] His mother moved to Bristol as a young woman, where she worked as a librarian at the Bristol Central Library; despite this she still considered her identity to be Cornish rather than English.[43] Paul had a younger sister, B\u00e9atrice Isabelle Marguerite, known as Betty, and an older brother, Reginald Charles F\u00e9lix, known as Felix,[44][45] who died by suicide in March 1925.[46] Dirac later recalled: \"My parents were terribly distressed. I didn't know they cared so much ... I never knew that parents were supposed to care for their children, but from then on I knew.\"[47]/nCharles and the children were officially Swiss nationals until they became naturalised on 22 October 1919.[48] Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian, although he disapproved of corporal punishment.[49] Dirac had a strained relationship with his father, so much so that after his father's death, Dirac wrote, \"I feel much freer now, and I am my own man.\" Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French so that they might learn the language. When Dirac found that he could not express what he wanted to say in French, he chose to remain silent.[50][51]/nDirac was educated first at Bishop Road Primary School[52] and then at the all-boys Merchant Venturers' Technical College (later Cotham School), where his father was a French teacher.[53] The school was an institution attached to the University of Bristol, which shared grounds and staff.[54] It emphasised technical subjects like bricklaying, shoemaking and metalwork, and modern languages.[55] This was unusual at a time when secondary education in Britain was still dedicated largely to the classics, and something for which Dirac would later express his gratitude.[54]/nDirac studied electrical engineering on a City of Bristol University Scholarship at the University of Bristol's engineering faculty, which was co-located with the Merchant Venturers' Technical College.[56] Shortly before he completed his degree in 1921, he sat for the entrance examination for St John's College, Cambridge. He passed and was awarded a \u00a370 scholarship, but this fell short of the amount of money required to live and study at Cambridge. Despite his having graduated with a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, the economic climate of the post-war depression was such that he was unable to find work as an engineer. Instead, he took up an offer to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics at the University of Bristol free of charge. He was permitted to skip the first year of the course owing to his engineering degree.[57] Under the influence of Peter Fraser, whom Dirac called the best mathematics teacher, he had the most interest in projective geometry, and began applying it to the geometrical version of relativity Minkowski developed.[58]/nIn 1923, Dirac graduated, once again with first class honours, and received a \u00a3140 scholarship from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.[59] Along with his \u00a370 scholarship from St John's College, this was enough to live at Cambridge. There, Dirac pursued his interests in the theory of general relativity, an interest he had gained earlier as a student in Bristol, and in the nascent field of quantum physics, under the supervision of Ralph Fowler.[60] From 1925 to 1928 he held an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.[61] He completed his PhD in June 1926 with the first thesis on quantum mechanics to be submitted anywhere.[62] He then continued his research in Copenhagen and G\u00f6ttingen.[61] In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.[63][64]/nIn 1937, Dirac married[65] Margit Wigner, a sister of physicist Eugene Wigner[66] and a divorcee.[67] Dirac raised Margit's two children, Judith and Gabriel, as if they were his own.[68] Paul and Margit Dirac also had two daughters together, Mary Elizabeth and Florence Monica.[69]/nMargit, known as Manci, had visited her brother in 1934 in Princeton, New Jersey, from their native Hungary and, while at dinner at the Annex Restaurant, met the \"lonely-looking man at the next table\". This account from a Korean physicist, Y. S. Kim, who met and was influenced by Dirac, also says: \"It is quite fortunate for the physics community that Manci took good care of our respected Paul A. M. Dirac. Dirac published eleven papers during the period 1939\u201346. Dirac was able to maintain his normal research productivity only because Manci was in charge of everything else\".[70]/nDirac was known among his colleagues for his precise and taciturn nature. His colleagues in Cambridge jokingly defined a unit called a \"dirac\", which was one word per hour.[71] When Niels Bohr complained that he did not know how to finish a sentence in a scientific article he was writing, Dirac replied, \"I was taught at school never to start a sentence without knowing the end of it.\"[72] He criticised the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's interest in poetry: \"The aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible.\"[73]/nDirac himself wrote in his diary during his postgraduate years that he concentrated solely on his research, and stopped only on Sunday when he took long strolls alone.[74]/nAn anecdote recounted in a review of the 2009 biography tells of Werner Heisenberg and Dirac sailing on an ocean liner to a conference in Japan in August 1929. \"Both still in their twenties, and unmarried, they made an odd couple. Heisenberg was a ladies' man who constantly flirted and danced, while Dirac\u2014'an Edwardian geek', as biographer Graham Farmelo puts it\u2014suffered agonies if forced into any kind of socializing or small talk. 'Why do you dance?' Dirac asked his companion. 'When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,' Heisenberg replied. Dirac pondered this notion, then blurted out: 'But, Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?'\"[75]/nMargit Dirac told both George Gamow and Anton Capri in the 1960s that her husband had said to a house visitor, \"Allow me to present Wigner's sister, who is now my wife.\"[76][77]/nAnother story told of Dirac is that when he first met the young Richard Feynman at a conference, he said after a long silence, \"I have an equation. Do you have one too?\"[78]/nAfter he presented a lecture at a conference, one colleague raised his hand and said: \"I don't understand the equation on the top-right-hand corner of the blackboard\". After a long silence, the moderator asked Dirac if he wanted to answer the question, to which Dirac replied: \"That was not a question, it was a comment.\"[79][80]/nDirac was also noted for his personal modesty. He called the equation for the time evolution of a quantum-mechanical operator, which he was the first to write down, the \"Heisenberg equation of motion\". Most physicists speak of Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics for half-integer-spin particles and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics for integer-spin particles. While lecturing later in life, Dirac always insisted on calling the former \"Fermi statistics\". He referred to the latter as \"Bose statistics\" for reasons, he explained, of \"symmetry\".[81]/nHeisenberg recollected a conversation among young participants at the 1927 Solvay Conference about Einstein and Planck's views on religion between Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac. Dirac's contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which Bohr regarded as quite lucid when hearing it from Heisenberg later.[82] Among other things, Heisenberg imagined that Dirac might say:/nI don't know why we are discussing religion. If we are honest\u2014and scientists have to be\u2014we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as to why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich, and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards\u2014in heaven if not on earth\u2014all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.[83]/nHeisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: \"Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God, and Paul Dirac is His prophet.'\" Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter.[84][85]/nLater in life, Dirac wrote an article mentioning God that appeared in the May 1963 edition of Scientific American, Dirac wrote:/nIt seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.[86]/nIn 1971, at a conference meeting, Dirac expressed his views on the existence of God.[87] Dirac explained that the existence of God could be justified only if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past:/nIt could be that it is extremely difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start a life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance of life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10\u2212100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connection between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.[88]/nDirac did not commit himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for scientifically answering the question of God.[88]/nDirac established the most general theory of quantum mechanics and discovered the relativistic equation for the electron, which now bears his name. The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle \u2013 e.g. the positron as antiparticle to the electron \u2013 stems from his equation. He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or \"elementary\" particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature. He proposed and investigated the concept of a magnetic monopole, an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to James Clerk Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. He is credited as being the one to create quantum field theory, alongside creating quantum electrodynamics and coining the term.[10][12] Dirac also coined the terms \"fermion\" and \"boson\".[89]/nThroughout his career, Dirac was motivated by the principles of mathematical beauty,[90] with Peter Goddard stating that \"Dirac cited mathematical beauty as the ultimate criterion for selecting the way forward in theoretical physics\".[91] Dirac was recognized for being mathematically gifted, as during his time in university, academics had affirmed that Dirac had an \"ability of the highest order in mathematical physics\",[92] with Ebenezer Cunningham stating that Dirac was \"quite the most original student I have met in the subject of mathematical physics\".[93] Therefore, Dirac was known for his \"astounding physical intuition combined with the ability to invent new mathematics to create new physics\".[16] During his career, Dirac made numerous important contributions to mathematical subjects, including the Dirac delta function, Dirac algebra and the Dirac operator./nDirac's first step into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925. Ralph Fowler, his research supervisor, had received a proof copy of an exploratory paper by Werner Heisenberg in the framework of the old quantum theory of Bohr and Sommerfeld. Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully.[94]/nDirac's attention was drawn to a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had established. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson brackets that occur in the classical dynamics of particle motion.[94] At the time, his memory of Poisson brackets was rather vague, but he found E. T. Whittaker's Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies illuminating.[95] From his new understanding, he developed a quantum theory based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to the most profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics to date.[96] His novel formulation using Dirac brackets allowed him to obtain the quantisation rules in a novel and more illuminating manner. For this work,[97] published in 1926, Dirac received a PhD from Cambridge. This formed the basis for Fermi-Dirac statistics that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in semi-conductors./nDirac was famously not bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum theory.  In fact, in a paper published in a book in his honour, he wrote: \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here.  I want to deal with more fundamental things.\"[98] However, in 1964 he wrote a short article about the interpretation of quantum field theory when based on the Heisenberg picture of quantum theory; his primary point in the article was that the Schrodinger model does not work for this purpose.[99]/nIn 1928, building on 2\u00d72 spin matrices which he purported to have discovered independently of Wolfgang Pauli's work on non-relativistic spin systems (Dirac told Abraham Pais, \"I believe I got these [matrices] independently of Pauli and possibly Pauli got these independently of me.\"),[100] he proposed the Dirac equation as a relativistic equation of motion for the wave function of the electron.[101] This work led Dirac to predict the existence of the positron, the electron's antiparticle, which he interpreted in terms of what came to be called the Dirac sea.[102] The positron was observed by Carl Anderson in 1932. Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of quantum spin as a relativistic phenomenon./nThe necessity of fermions (matter) being created and destroyed in Enrico Fermi's 1934 theory of beta decay led to a reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a \"classical\" field equation for any point particle of spin \u0127/2, itself subject to quantisation conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by Werner Heisenberg, as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles \u2013 today quarks and leptons \u2013 this Dirac field equation is as central to theoretical physics as the Maxwell, Yang\u2013Mills and Einstein field equations. Dirac is regarded as the founder of quantum electrodynamics, being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of vacuum polarisation in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, in particular Schwinger, Feynman, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Dyson in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics./nDirac's The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, published in 1930, is a landmark in the history of science. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of Werner Heisenberg on matrix mechanics and of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger on wave mechanics into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the Hilbert space of vectors that describe the state of a physical system. The book also introduced the Dirac delta function. Following his 1939 article,[103] he also included the bra\u2013ket notation in the third edition of his book,[104] thereby contributing to its universal use nowadays./nIn 1931, Dirac proposed that the existence of a single magnetic monopole in the universe would suffice to explain the quantisation of electrical charge.[105] In 1975,[106] 1982[107] and 2009,[108][109][110] intriguing results suggested the possible detection of magnetic monopoles, but there is, to date, no direct evidence for their existence (see also Searches for magnetic monopoles)./nDirac quantized the gravitational field.[40][111] His work laid the foundations for canonical quantum gravity.[112] \nIn his 1959 lecture at the Lindau Meetings, Dirac discussed why gravitational waves have \"physical significance\".[113] Dirac predicted gravitational waves would have well defined energy density in 1964.[111] Dirac reintroduced the term \"graviton\" in a number of lectures in 1959, noting that the energy of the gravitational field should come in quanta, which Dirac referred to as \u201cgravitons\u201d, doing so in a reintroduction terminology manner.[114][115]/nDirac is seen as having anticipated string theory, with his work on the Dirac membrane and Dirac\u2013Born\u2013Infeld action, amongst other contributions.[30][31] He also developed a general theory of the quantum field with dynamical constraints,[116][117][30] which forms the basis of the gauge theories and superstring theories of today.[30][40][118]/nDirac was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge from 1932 to 1969. In 1937, he proposed a speculative cosmological model based on the large numbers hypothesis. During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on uranium enrichment by gas centrifuge.[119] He introduced the separative work unit (SWU) in 1941.[120] He contributed to the Tube Alloys project, the British programme to research and construct atomic bombs during World War II.[121][21]/nDirac's quantum electrodynamics (QED) made predictions that were \u2013 more often than not \u2013 infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. \"I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation\", he said in 1975, \"because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small \u2013 not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!\"[122] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream./nHowever, from his once rejected notes he managed to work on putting quantum electrodynamics on \"logical foundations\" based on Hamiltonian formalism that he formulated. He found a rather novel way of deriving the anomalous magnetic moment \"Schwinger term\" and also the Lamb shift, afresh in 1963, using the Heisenberg picture and without using the joining method used by Weisskopf and French, and by the two pioneers of modern QED, Schwinger and Feynman. That was two years before the Tomonaga\u2013Schwinger\u2013Feynman QED was given formal recognition by an award of the Nobel Prize for physics./nWeisskopf and French (FW) were the first to obtain the correct result for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. At first FW results did not agree with the incorrect but independent results of Feynman and Schwinger.[123] The 1963\u20131964 lectures Dirac gave on quantum field theory at Yeshiva University were published in 1966 as the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Monograph Series Number, 3./nAfter having relocated to Florida to be near his elder daughter, Mary, Dirac spent his last fourteen years of both life and physics research at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, and Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida./nIn the 1950s in his search for a better QED, Paul Dirac developed the Hamiltonian theory of constraints[124] based on lectures that he delivered at the 1949 International Mathematical Congress in Canada. Dirac[125] had also solved the problem of putting the Schwinger\u2013Tomonaga equation into the Schr\u00f6dinger representation[126] and given explicit expressions for the scalar meson field (spin zero pion or pseudoscalar meson), the vector meson field (spin one rho meson), and the electromagnetic field (spin one massless boson, photon)./nThe Hamiltonian of constrained systems is one of Dirac's many masterpieces. It is a powerful generalisation of Hamiltonian theory that remains valid for curved spacetime. The equations for the Hamiltonian involve only six degrees of freedom described by \n\n\n\n\ng\n\nr\ns\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g_{rs}}\n\n,\n\n\n\n\np\n\nr\ns\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p^{rs}}\n\n for each point of the surface on which the state is considered. The  \n\n\n\n\ng\n\nm\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g_{m0}}\n\n (m = 0, 1, 2, 3) appear in the theory only through the variables \n\n\n\n\ng\n\nr\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g^{r0}}\n\n, \n\n\n\n(\n\u2212\n\n\ng\n\n00\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (-{g^{00}})^{-1/2}}\n\n which occur as arbitrary coefficients in the equations of motion.\nThere are four constraints or weak equations for each point of the surface \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{0}}\n\n = constant. Three of them \n\n\n\n\nH\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H_{r}}\n\n form the four vector density in the surface. The fourth \n\n\n\n\nH\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H_{L}}\n\n is a 3-dimensional scalar density in the surface HL \u2248 0; Hr \u2248 0 (r = 1, 2, 3)/nIn the late 1950s, he applied the Hamiltonian methods he had developed to cast Einstein's general relativity in Hamiltonian form[127][128] and to bring to a technical completion the quantization problem of gravitation and bring it also closer to the rest of physics according to Salam and DeWitt. In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on \"Energy of the Gravitational Field\" at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society.[129] In 1964 he published his Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (London: Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including quantization of curved spacetime. He also published a paper entitled \"Quantization of the Gravitational Field\" in the 1967 ICTP/IAEA Trieste Symposium on Contemporary Physics./nFrom September 1970 to January 1971, Dirac was a visiting professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. During that time he was offered a permanent position there, which he accepted, becoming a full professor in 1972. Contemporary accounts of his time there describe it as happy except that he apparently found the summer heat oppressive and liked to escape from it to Cambridge.[130]/nHe would walk about a mile to work each day and was fond of swimming in one of the two nearby lakes (Silver Lake and Lost Lake), and was also more sociable than he had been at the University of Cambridge, where he mostly worked at home apart from giving classes and seminars. At Florida State, he would usually eat lunch with his colleagues before taking a nap.[131]/nDirac published over 60 papers in those last twelve years of his life, including a short book on general relativity.[132] His last paper (1984), entitled \"The inadequacies of quantum field theory,\" contains his final judgment on quantum field theory: \"These rules of renormalisation give surprisingly, excessively good agreement with experiments. Most physicists say that these working rules are, therefore, correct. I feel that is not an adequate reason. Just because the results happen to be in agreement with observation does not prove that one's theory is correct.\" The paper ends with the words: \"I have spent many years searching for a Hamiltonian to bring into the theory and have not yet found it. I shall continue to work on it as long as I can and other people, I hope, will follow along such lines.\"[133]/nAmongst his many students[3][134] were Homi J. Bhabha,[1] Fred Hoyle, John Polkinghorne[5] and Freeman Dyson.[135] Polkinghorne recalls that Dirac \"was once asked what was his fundamental belief. He strode to a blackboard and wrote that the laws of nature should be expressed in beautiful equations.\"[136]/nDirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize for physics with Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\".[18] Dirac was also awarded the Royal Medal in 1939 and both the Copley Medal and the Max Planck Medal in 1952. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1930,[137][6] a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1938,[138] an Honorary Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1948, a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1949,[139] a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950,[140] and an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London in 1971. He received the inaugural J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1969.[141][142] Dirac became a member of the Order of Merit in 1973, having previously turned down a knighthood as he did not want to be addressed by his first name.[75][143]/nIn 1984, Dirac died in Tallahassee, Florida, and was buried at Tallahassee's Roselawn Cemetery.[144] Dirac's childhood home in Bishopston, Bristol is commemorated with a blue plaque,[145] and the nearby Dirac Road is named in recognition of his links with the city of Bristol. A commemorative stone was erected in a garden in Saint-Maurice, Switzerland, the town of origin of his father's family, on 1 August 1991. On 13 November 1995 a commemorative marker, made from Burlington green slate and inscribed with the Dirac equation, was unveiled in Westminster Abbey.[144][146] The Dean of Westminster, Edward Carpenter, had initially refused permission for the memorial, thinking Dirac to be anti-Christian, but was eventually (over a five-year period) persuaded to relent.[147]/nThe influence and importance of Dirac's work have increased with the decades, and physicists use daily the concepts and equations that he developed./nIn 1975, Dirac gave a series of five lectures at the University of New South Wales which were subsequently published as a book, Directions in Physics (1978). He donated the royalties from this book to the university for the establishment of Dirac Lecture Series. The Silver Dirac Medal for the Advancement of Theoretical Physics is awarded by the University of New South Wales to commemorate the lecture.[148]/nImmediately after his death, two organizations of professional physicists established annual awards in Dirac's memory. The Institute of Physics, the United Kingdom's professional body for physicists, awards the Paul Dirac Medal for \"outstanding contributions to theoretical (including mathematical and computational) physics\".[149] The first three recipients were Stephen Hawking (1987), John Stewart Bell (1988), and Roger Penrose (1989). Since 1985, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics awards the Dirac Medal of the ICTP each year on Dirac's birthday (8 August).[150]/nThe Dirac-Hellman Award at Florida State University was endowed by Bruce P. Hellman in 1997 to reward outstanding work in theoretical physics by FSU researchers.[151] The Paul A.M. Dirac Science Library at Florida State University, which Manci opened in December 1989,[152] is named in his honour, and his papers are held there.[153] Outside is a statue of him by Gabriella Bollob\u00e1s.[154] The street on which the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Innovation Park of Tallahassee, Florida, is located is named Paul Dirac Drive.  As well as in his hometown of Bristol, there is also a road named after him, Dirac Place, in Didcot, Oxfordshire.[155]/nThe BBC named a video codec, Dirac, in his honour.

The major problem which he tackled was that of wireless waves.

Thereafter he worked at Harvard University as a research fellow and lecturer in the Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory from 1943 to 1950./nHe became interested in information technology, and moved to MIT in 1950 as an associate professor, where he served on a committee that established MIT Lincoln Laboratory and a psychology program for engineering students. While at MIT, Licklider was involved in the SAGE project as head of the team concerned with human factors.[9] In 1957, he received the Franklin V. Taylor Award from the Society of Engineering Psychologists. In 1958, he was elected President of the Acoustical Society of America, and in 1990 he received the Commonwealth Award for Distinguished Service.[10]/nLicklider left MIT to become a vice president at Bolt Beranek and Newman in 1957. He learned about time-sharing from Christopher Strachey at a UNESCO-sponsored conference on Information Processing in Paris in 1959.[11][12] At BBN he developed the BBN Time-Sharing System and conducted the first public demonstration of time-sharing.[13]/nIn October 1962, Licklider was appointed head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at ARPA, the United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,[14] an appointment he kept through July 1964.[15][16] In April 1963, he sent a memo to his colleagues in outlining the early challenges presented in establishing a time-sharing network of computers with the software of that time.[17] Ultimately his vision led to ARPANet, the precursor of today's Internet.[18]/nAfter serving as manager of information sciences, systems and applications at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York from 1964 to 1967, Licklider rejoined MIT as a professor of electrical engineering in 1968. During this period, he concurrently served as director of Project MAC until 1971.[19] Project MAC had produced the first computer time-sharing system, CTSS, and one of the first online setups with the development of Multics (work on which commenced in 1964). Multics provided inspiration for some elements of the Unix operating system developed at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1970.[20]/nFollowing a second stint as IPTO director (1974\u20131975), his MIT faculty line was transferred to the Institute's Laboratory for Computer Science, where he was based for the remainder of his career. He was a founding member of Infocom in 1979, known for their interactive fiction computer games.[21] He retired and became professor emeritus in 1985. He died in 1990 in Arlington, Massachusetts;[10] his cremated remains are interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery./nIn the psychoacoustics field, Licklider is most remembered for his 1951 \"Duplex Theory of Pitch Perception\", presented in a paper[22] which has been cited hundreds of times,[23] was reprinted in a 1979 book,[24] and formed the basis for modern models of pitch perception.[25] He was also the first to report binaural unmasking of speech.[26]/nWhile at MIT in the 1950s, Licklider worked on Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE), a Cold War project to create a computer-aided air defense system. The SAGE system included computers that collected and presented data to a human operator, who then chose the appropriate response. He worked as a human factors expert, which helped convince him of the great potential for human/computer interfaces.[27]/nLicklider became interested in information technology early in his career. His ideas foretold of graphical computing, point-and-click interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and software that would exist on a network and migrate wherever it was needed. Much like Vannevar Bush's, Licklider's contribution to the development of the Internet consists of ideas, not inventions. He foresaw the need for networked computers with easy user interfaces./nLicklider was instrumental in conceiving, funding and managing the research that led to modern personal computers and the Internet. In 1960 his seminal paper on \"Man-Computer Symbiosis\"[28] foreshadowed interactive computing, and he went on to fund early efforts in time-sharing and application development, most notably the work of Douglas Engelbart, who founded the Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute and created the famous On-Line System where the computer mouse was invented. He also did some seminal early work for the Council on Library Resources, imagining what libraries of the future might look like,[29] which he describes as \"thinking centers\" in his 1960 paper.[28]/nIn \"Man-Computer Symbiosis\", Licklider in 1960 outlined the need for simpler interaction between computers and computer users.[30] Licklider has been credited as an early pioneer of cybernetics and artificial intelligence (AI),[31] but unlike other AI practitioners, he never felt sure that men would be replaced by computer-based beings. As he wrote in the article: \"Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking\". He goes on to write in the same article: \"In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone\".[28] This approach, focusing on effective use of information technology in augmenting human intelligence, is sometimes called Intelligence amplification (IA). Peter Highnam, DARPA director in 2020, focused on human-machine partnership as a long-term goal and guiding light ever since Licklider's 1960 publication.[32]/nDuring his time as director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) from 1962 to 1964, he funded Project MAC at MIT. A large mainframe computer was designed to be shared by up to 30 simultaneous users, each sitting at a separate \"typewriter terminal\". He also funded similar projects at Stanford University, UCLA, UC Berkeley (called Project Genie), and the AN/FSQ-32 at System Development Corporation.\nThis time-sharing technology later developed to become what today are known as servers./nLicklider played a similar role in conceiving of and funding early networking research. He formulated the earliest ideas of a global computer network in August 1962 at BBN, in a series of memos discussing the \"Intergalactic Computer Network\" concept. These ideas contained almost everything that the Internet is today, including cloud computing.[33]/nWhile at IPTO he convinced Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and Lawrence G. Roberts that an all-encompassing computer network was a very important concept. He met with Donald Davies in 1965 and inspired his interest in data communications.[34][35]/nIn 1967 Licklider submitted the paper \"Televistas: Looking ahead through side windows\" to the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television.[36] This paper describes a radical departure from the \"broadcast\" model of television. Instead Licklider advocates for a two-way communications network. The Carnegie Commission led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Although the Commission's report explains that \"Dr.\u00a0Licklider's paper was completed after the Commission had formulated its own conclusions,\" President Johnson said at the signing of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, \"So I think we must consider new ways to build a great network for knowledge\u2014not just a broadcast system, but one that employs every means of sending and of storing information that the individual can use\".[37]/nHis 1968 paper The Computer as a Communication Device illustrates his vision of network applications and predicts the use of computer networks to support communities of common interest and collaboration without regard to location.[38]/nIn the same 1968 paper, J. C. R. Licklider and Robert W. Taylor wrote, \"Take any problem worthy of the name, and you find only a few people who can contribute effectively to its solution. Those people must be brought into close intellectual partnership so that their ideas can come into contact with one another. But bring these people together physically in one place to form a team, and you have trouble, for the most creative people are often not the best team players, and there are not enough top positions in a single organization to keep them all happy. Let them go their separate ways, and each creates his own empire, large or small, and devotes more time to the role of emperor than to the role of problem solver.  The principals still get together at meetings. They still visit one another. But the time scale of their communication stretches out, and the correlations among mental models degenerate between meetings so that it may take a year to do a week's communicating. There has to be some way of facilitating communication among people wit bout [sic] [without] bringing them together in one place.\"[38] (Evan Herbert edited the article and acted as intermediary during its writing between Licklider in Boston and Taylor in Washington.)/nThe Licklider Transmission Protocol is named after him./nLicklider wrote numerous articles and lectures, and one book:/nArticles, a selection:", "9396423": "Regina Iosifovna Tyshkevich (Belarusian: \u0420\u044d\u0433\u0456\u043d\u0430 \u0406\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0444\u0430\u045e\u043d\u0430 \u0422\u044b\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0456\u0447; 20 October 1929 \u2013 17 November 2019[1]) was a Belarusian mathematician, an expert in graph theory,  Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, professor of the Belarusian State University.[2][3]/nHer main scientific interests included Intersection graphs, degree sequences, and the reconstruction conjecture.

He was made Bishop of Birmingham in 1924, the only bishop appointed during Ramsay MacDonald's first term in office. His modernist views, in particular objection to Reservation, led to conflict with the Anglo-Catholics in his diocese.[6] A biography by his son, Sir John Barnes, Ahead of His Age: Bishop Barnes of Birmingham, was published in 1979./nBarnes was the eldest of four sons of John Starkie Barnes and Jane Elizabeth Kerry, both elementary school head-teachers. In 1883 Barnes' father was appointed Inspector of Schools in Birmingham, a position that he occupied throughout the rest of his working life. Barnes was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and in 1893 went up to Cambridge as a Scholar of Trinity College. He was bracketed Second Wrangler in 1896 and was placed in the first division of the first class in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in 1897. In the following year he was awarded the first Smith's Prize and was duly elected to a Trinity Fellowship. During his time as a Fellow he served on the committee of Cambridge University Liberal Club from 1899 to 1901.[7] He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics in 1902, junior dean in 1906\u20131908 and a tutor in 1908. He graduated ScD of the University of Cambridge in 1907 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909.[1] In the years that followed, Barnes was assigned to be Ramanujan's tutor and agreed with G.\u00a0H. Hardy's assessment of his brilliance.[8]/nIn the same year he became a lecturer in mathematics, Barnes was made deacon by the Bishop of London and from 1906 to 1908 was Junior Dean of Trinity. In 1915, Barnes left Cambridge, and his career as a professional mathematician, upon his appointment as Master of the Temple in London. This was followed in 1918 by a canonry of Westminster Abbey and finally, in 1924, by consecration to the Bishopric of Birmingham, an office he held until April 1953, when he had to retire on account of ill-health. He died at his home in Sussex at the age of 79, survived by his wife and two sons.  A bronze memorial tablet to him, as the third bishop of Birmingham, was erected in the south aisle of Birmingham Cathedral, near where his ashes, together with those of his wife, are placed under the pavement marked by a slab with the initials \"EWB\"./nBarnes was perhaps the best known liberal bishop of his time, identified with the modernist or broad church movement. His episcopate was marked by continual controversy.[9]/nHis book The Rise of Christianity (1947) attacked many Christian claims, including the Virgin Birth and the bodily resurrection of Christ.[10] This led to calls that he should resign as a bishop. This Barnes refused to do. Earlier he had written Should Such a Faith Offend? (1927) and Scientific Theory and Religion (1933), and he was a contributor to 18 other books. His attack on Francis of Assisi as \"probably verminous\" drew a rebuke in verse from G.\u00a0K. Chesterton./nHe was also politically active. In 1940, he lost a libel case in which he had attacked the Cement Makers' Federation for allegedly holding up the supply of cement, for their own profit at a time of great national need, in the construction of air-raid shelters.[11] Undaunted by this set-back, Barnes returned to his accusations on the cement ring in a speech he delivered in the House of Lords the following year./nHe was an uncompromising pacifist,[12] and spoke out against British participation in the Second World War. He also expressed eugenic views.[13] Though a member of the Eugenic Society from 1924 until his death in 1953, it was not until after the Second World War that he openly argued in favour of voluntary sterilisation as a means to overcome the apparent prevalence of \"mental deficiency\" in society. Several of these eugenic-themed lectures gained significant newspaper coverage in The Times and The Manchester Guardian, sparking a fervent public debate in which inevitable\u00a0\u2013 if not entirely justifiable\u00a0\u2013 parallels were drawn between Barnes' arguments and Nazi ideology. In his latter years Barnes was thus a pacifist, religious leader and campaigner for the perceived declining cause of eugenics.[14]/nIn 1916, Barnes married Adelaide Caroline Theresa Ward, daughter of Sir Adolphus Ward.[15] Together they had two sons: John was a diplomat, who served as ambassador to Israel and the Netherlands; and William, a public servant and philanthropist.[16]", "24797": "Proclus Lycius (/\u02c8pr\u0252kl\u0259s la\u026a\u02c8si\u0259s/; 8 February 412\u00a0\u2013 17 April 485), called Proclus the Successor (Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u0394\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, Pr\u00f3klos ho Di\u00e1dokhos), was a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher, one of the last major classical philosophers of late antiquity. He set forth one of the most elaborate and fully developed systems of Neoplatonism and, through later interpreters and translators, exerted an influence on Byzantine philosophy, Early Islamic philosophy, Scholastic philosophy, and German Idealism, especially G.W.F. Hegel, who called Proclus's Platonic Theology \"the true turning point or transition from ancient to modern times, from ancient philosophy to Christianity.\"[1]/nThe primary source for the life of Proclus is the eulogy Proclus, or On Happiness that was written for him upon his death by his successor, Marinus,[2] Marinus' biography set out to prove that Proclus reached the peak of virtue and attained eudaimonia.[2] There are also a few details about the time in which he lived in the similarly structured Life of Isidore written by the philosopher Damascius in the following century.[2]/nAccording to Marinus,[3] Proclus was born in 412 AD in Constantinople to a family of high social status from Lycia, and raised in Xanthus. He studied rhetoric, philosophy and mathematics in Alexandria, with the intent of pursuing a judicial position like his father. Before completing his studies, he returned to Constantinople when his rector, his principal instructor (one Leonas), had business there.[4] Proclus became a successful practicing lawyer. However, the experience of the practice of law made Proclus realize that he truly preferred philosophy. He returned to Alexandria, and began determinedly studying the works of Aristotle under Olympiodorus the Elder. He also began studying mathematics during this period as well with a teacher named Heron (no relation to Hero of Alexandria, who was also known as Heron). As a gifted student, he eventually became dissatisfied with the level of philosophical instruction available in Alexandria, and went to Athens, philosophical center of the day, in 431 to study at the Neoplatonic successor of the New Academy, where he was taught by Plutarch of Athens (not to be confused with Plutarch of Chaeronea), Syrianus, and Asclepigenia; he succeeded Syrianus as head of the Academy in 437, and would in turn be succeeded on his death by Marinus of Neapolis. He lived in Athens as a vegetarian bachelor, prosperous and generous to his friends, until the end of his life, except for a one-year exile, to avoid pressure from Christian authorities.[2] Marinus reports that he was writing seven hundred lines each day./nOne challenge with determining Proclus' specific doctrines is that the Neoplatonists of his time did not consider themselves innovators; they believed themselves to be the transmitters of the correct interpretations of Plato himself.[5] Although the neoplatonic doctrines are much different from the doctrines in Plato's dialogues, it's often difficult to distinguish between different Neoplatonic thinkers and determine what is original to each one.[5] For Proclus, this is largely only possible with Plotinus, the only other Neoplatonic writer for whom a significant amount of writings survive.[5]/nProclus, like Plotinus and many of the other Neoplatonists, agreed on the three hypostases of Neoplatonism: The One (hen), The Intellect (nous) and The Soul (psyche), and wrote a commentary on the Enneads, of which unfortunately only fragments survive. At other times he criticizes Plotinus' views, such as the prime mover.[5] Unlike Plotinus, Proclus also did not hold that matter was evil, an idea that caused contradictions in the system of Plotinus.[5] It is difficult to determine what, if anything, is different between the doctrines of Proclus and Syrianus: for the latter, only a commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics survives, and Proclus never criticizes his teacher in any of his preserved writings.[5]/nThe particular characteristic of Proclus's system is his elaboration of a level of individual ones, called henads, between the One which is before being and intelligible divinity.[5] The henads exist \"superabundantly\", also beyond being, but they stand at the head of chains of causation (seirai) and in some manner give to these chains their particular character.[5] He identifies them with the Greek gods, so one henad might be Apollo and be the cause of all things apollonian, while another might be Helios and be the cause of all sunny things. Each henad participates in every other henad, according to its character. What appears to be multiplicity is not multiplicity at all, because any henad may rightly be considered the center of the polycentric system.[citation needed] According to Proclus, philosophy is the activity which can liberate the soul from a subjection to bodily passions, remind it of its origin in Soul, Intellect, and the One, and prepare it not only to ascend to the higher levels while still in this life, but to avoid falling immediately back into a new body after death.[citation needed] Because the soul's attention, while inhabiting a body, is turned so far away from its origin in the intelligible world, Proclus thinks that we need to make use of bodily reminders of our spiritual origin.[citation needed] In this he agrees with the doctrines of theurgy put forward by Iamblichus. Theurgy is possible because the powers of the gods (the henads) extend through their series of causation even down to the material world.[citation needed] And by certain power-laden words, acts, and objects, the soul can be drawn back up the series, so to speak. Proclus himself was a devotee of many of the religions in Athens, considering that the power of the gods could be present in these various approaches.[citation needed]/nThe majority of Proclus's works are commentaries on dialogues of Plato (Alcibiades, Cratylus, Parmenides, Republic, Timaeus). In these commentaries, he presents his own philosophical system as a faithful interpretation of Plato, and in this he did not differ from other Neoplatonists, as he considered that \"nothing in Plato's corpus is unintended or there by chance\", that \"Plato's writings were divinely inspired\" (\u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd ho theios Platon\u2014the divine Plato, inspired by the gods), that \"the formal structure and the content of Platonic texts imitated those of the universe\",[6] and therefore that they spoke often of things under a veil, hiding the truth from the philosophically uninitiated. Proclus was however a close reader of Plato, and quite often makes very astute points about his Platonic sources./nIn his commentary on Plato's Timaeus Proclus explains the role the Soul as a principle has in mediating the Forms in Intellect to the body of the material world as a whole. The Soul is constructed through certain proportions, described mathematically in the Timaeus, which allow it to make Body as a divided image of its own arithmetical and geometrical ideas./nIn addition to his commentaries, Proclus wrote two major systematic works.[7] The Elements of Theology (\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae) consists of 211 propositions, each followed by a proof, beginning from the existence of the One (divine Unity) and ending with the descent of individual souls into the material world. The Platonic Theology (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) is a systematization of material from Platonic dialogues, showing from them the characteristics of the divine orders, the part of the universe which is closest to the One./nWe also have three essays, extant only in Latin translation: Ten doubts concerning providence (De decem dubitationibus circa providentiam); On providence and fate (De providentia et fato); On the existence of evils (De malorum subsistentia).[7]/nProclus, the scholiast to Euclid, knew  Eudemus of Rhodes' History of Geometry well, and gave a short sketch of the early history of geometry, which appeared to be founded on the older, lost book of Eudemus. The passage has been referred to as \"the Eudemian summary,\" and determines some approximate dates, which otherwise might have remained unknown.[8] The influential commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements is one of the most valuable sources we have for the history of ancient mathematics,[9] and its Platonic account of the status of mathematical objects was influential./nIn this work, Proclus also listed the first mathematicians associated with Plato: a mature set of mathematicians (Leodamas of Thasos, Archytas of Taras, and Theaetetus), a second set of younger mathematicians (Neoclides, Eudoxus of Cnidus), and a third yet younger set (Amyntas, Menaechmus and his brother Dinostratus, Theudius of Magnesia, Hermotimus of Colophon and Philip of Opus). Some of these mathematicians were influential in arranging the Elements that Euclid later published./nA number of his Platonic commentaries are lost. In addition to the Alcibiades, the Cratylus, the Timaeus, and the Parmenides, he also wrote commentaries on the remainder of the dialogues in the Neoplatonic curriculum.[10] He also wrote a commentary on the Organon, as well as prolegomena to both Plato and Aristotle.[10]/nProclus exerted a great deal of influence on Medieval philosophy, though largely indirectly, through the works of the commentator Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.[11] This late-5th- or early-6th-century Christian Greek author wrote under the pseudonym Dionysius the Areopagite, the figure converted by St. Paul in Athens. Because of this fiction, his writings were taken to have almost apostolic authority. He is an original Christian writer, and in his works can be found a great number of Proclus's metaphysical principles.[12]/nAnother important source for the influence of Proclus on the Middle Ages is Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, which has a number of Proclus principles and motifs.[citation needed] The central poem of Book III is a summary of Proclus's Commentary on the Timaeus[citation needed], and Book V contains the important principle of Proclus that things are known not according to their own nature, but according to the character of the knowing subject.[11]/nA summary of Proclus's Elements of Theology circulated under the name Liber de Causis (Book of Causes).[11] This book is of uncertain origin, but circulated in the Arabic world as a work of Aristotle, and was translated into Latin as such.[11] It had great authority because of its supposed Aristotelian origin, and it was only when Proclus's Elements were translated into Latin that Thomas Aquinas realised its true origin.[11] Proclus's works also exercised an influence during the Renaissance through figures such as Nicholas of Cusa and Marsilio Ficino. The most significant early scholar of Proclus in the English-speaking world was Thomas Taylor, who produced English translations of most of his works.[11]/nThe crater Proclus on the Moon is named after him./nThe Liber de Causis (Book of Causes) is not a work by Proclus, but a summary of his work the Elements of Theology, likely written by an Arabic interpreter./nMonographs/nCollections/nBibliographic resources", "9986270": "Philip Mayne Woodward (6 September 1919 \u2013 30 January 2018) was a British mathematician, radar engineer and horologist.

Professor Edwin Thompson Jaynes in his posthumously published book[8] recognized Woodward as having been \"many years ahead of his time\" and as having shown \"prophetic insight into what was to come\" in the application of probability and statistics to the recovery of data from noisy samples. In the 1960s, Woodward's computer software team in Malvern provided the Royal Radar Establishment with the ALGOL 68-R compiler, the world's first implementation of the programming language ALGOL 68, and provided the armed services with their first standard high-level programming language, CORAL 66, for the small military computers of the day./nHis academic posts have included honorary professor in electrical engineering at the University of Birmingham and visiting professor in cybernetics at the University of Reading. When in 2000, the Woodward Building was opened by Sir John Chisholm at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, now privatized as QinetiQ, guests were given complimentary clocks as souvenirs of the occasion and of Woodward's horological interests./nIn June 2005, the Royal Academy of Engineering gave Woodward its first Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing him as an outstanding pioneer of radar and for his work in precision mechanical horology.[1] In 2009 he received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Dennis J. Picard Medal for Radar Technologies and Applications: \"for pioneering work of fundamental importance in radar waveform design, including the Woodward ambiguity function, the standard tool for waveform and matched filter analysis\".[2][9]/nIn retirement, Woodward wrote another book, My Own Right Time,[10] known as MORT, a record of his passion for horology. Along with many other topics, MORT describes in detail the design of his clocks, including his masterpiece W5./nWoodward contributed dozens of articles to horological periodicals over more than 30 years. From his experience as a mathematician and analyst of complex systems, he has made major contributions to scientific horology, including the definitive analysis of balance springs and much work on the properties of pendulums. In 2006 the British Horological Institute published a hard-cover collection of 63 articles with new notes by Woodward. The collection, Woodward on Time,[11] originally compiled by Bill Taylor, ASC[clarification needed], became known as WOT. It was very well received.[citation needed]/nW5 was built in a small workshop with simple tools, and displays an elegance of concept and design rarely seen in the history of the science. It was acclaimed by Jonathan Betts, the senior curator of horology at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich as \"the nearest approach to perfection by any mechanical timekeeper not employing a vacuum chamber\".[citation needed] Woodward also built the case, assembling it with intricate but invisible hidden mitre joints./nThe horologist Anthony Randall carried on a long series of timekeeping trials of W5, showing unprecedented accuracy over periods of more than 100 days.[11] Although the clock was widely celebrated, and Woodward published a series of detailed articles on its construction to encourage others to carry its ideas forward,[11] no one completed another clock like it for more than twenty years. Finally, in 2006, the Australian clockmaker David Walter (now of Buellton, California) succeeded in making a highly skeletonized version that, while quite different in details, closely followed the basic Woodward design.[12]/nWoodward was born on 6 September 1919 and educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon.[13]/nHe met his wife, mathematician Alice Mary Winter Robertson (1917-1999) whilst they shared an office in Durnford House in Langton Matravers as part of the Telecommunications Research Establishment. She detailed the field solution for a slab loaded rectangular waveguide. They married after 18 months of meeting, in August 1942, and took their honeymoon after the war, travelling through Europe in an MG, later naming their house after Fionnay, a hamlet in Switzerland.[14]/nHe lived in Malvern, Worcestershire, England, where he died on 30 January 2018 at the age of 98.[15]", "5300446": "Perseus (Greek: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2; c. 150 BC) was an ancient Greek geometer, who invented the concept of spiric sections, in analogy to the conic sections studied by Apollonius of Perga./nFew details of Perseus' life are known, as he is mentioned only by Proclus and Geminus; none of his own works have survived./nThe spiric sections result from the intersection of a torus with a plane that is parallel to the rotational symmetry axis of the torus.  Consequently, spiric sections are fourth-order (quartic) plane curves, whereas the conic sections are second-order (quadratic) plane curves.  Spiric sections are a special case of a toric section, and were the first toric sections to be described./nThe most famous spiric section is the Cassini oval, which is the locus of points having a constant product of distances to two foci.

Byzantine scholarship became more fully available to the West after 1438, when Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaiologos attended the Council of Ferrara, later known as the Council of Florence, to discuss a union of the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches. Despite not being a theologian, Plethon was chosen to accompany John VIII on the basis of his renowned wisdom and morality. Other delegates included Plethon's former students Bessarion, Mark Eugenikos and Gennadius Scholarius.[18]/nAt the invitation of some Florentine humanists he set up a temporary school to lecture on the difference between Plato and Aristotle. Few of Plato's writings were studied in the Latin West at that time,[19] and he essentially reintroduced much of Plato to the Western world, shaking the domination which Aristotle had come to exercise over Western European thought in the high and later middle ages./nMarsilio Ficino's introduction to the translation of Plotinus[20] has traditionally been interpreted to the effect that Cosimo de' Medici attended Pletho's lectures and was inspired to found the Accademia Platonica in Florence, where Italian students of Plethon continued to teach after the conclusion of the council.[18] However, according to James Hankins, Ficino was misunderstood. In fact, communication between Plethon and Cosimo de' Medici - for whose meeting there is no independent evidence - would have been severely constrained by the language barrier. Furthermore, Ficino's \"Platonic Academy\" was more of an \"informal gymnasium\" that did not have a particularly Platonic orientation.[8] Nevertheless, Plethon came to be considered one of the most important influences on the Italian Renaissance. Marsilio Ficino, the Florentine humanist and the first director of the Accademia Platonica, paid Plethon the ultimate honour, calling him 'the second Plato', while Cardinal Bessarion speculated as to whether Plato's soul occupied his body. Plethon may also have been the source for Ficino's Orphic system of natural magic.[12]/nWhile still in Florence, Pletho wrote a volume titled Wherein Aristotle disagrees with Plato, commonly called De Differentiis, to correct the misunderstandings he had encountered. He claimed he had written it \"without serious intent\" while incapacitated through illness, \"to comfort myself and to please those who are dedicated to Plato\".[17] George Scholarius responded with a Defence of Aristotle, which elicited Plethon's subsequent Reply. Expatriate Byzantine scholars and later Italian humanists continued the argument.[18]/nPlethon died in Mistra in 1452, or in 1454, according to J. Monfasani (the difference between the two dates being significant as to whether or not Plethon still lived to know of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453). In 1466, some of his Italian disciples, headed by Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, stole his remains from Mistra and interred them in the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, \"so that the great Teacher may be among free men\".[citation needed]/nBelieving that the Peloponnesians were direct descendants of the ancient Hellenes, Plethon rejected Justinian's idea of a universal Empire in favour of recreating the Hellenistic civilization, the zenith of Greek influence.[21] In his 1415 and 1418 pamphlets he urged Manuel II and his son Theodore Palaiologos to turn the peninsula into a cultural island with a new constitution of strongly centralised monarchy advised by a small body of middle-class educated men. The army must be composed only of professional native Greek soldiers, who would be supported by the taxpayers, or \"Helots\" who would be exempt from military service. Land was to be publicly owned, and a third of all produce given to the state fund; incentives would be given for cultivating virgin land. Trade would be regulated and the use of coinage limited, barter instead being encouraged; locally available products would be supported over imports. Mutilation as a punishment would be abolished, and chain gangs introduced. Homosexuals and sexual deviants would be burnt at the stake. The social and political ideas in these pamphlets were largely derived from Plato's Republic. Plethon touched little on religion, although he expressed disdain for monks, who \"render no service to the common good\". He vaguely prescribed three religious principles: belief in a supreme being; that this being has concern for mankind; and that it is uninfluenced by gifts or flattery. Manuel and Theodore did not act on any of these reforms.[16]/nIn De Differentiis Plethon compares Aristotle's and Plato's conceptions of God, arguing that Plato credits God with more exalted powers as \"creator of every kind of intelligible and separate substance, and hence of our entire universe\", while Aristotle has God as only the motive force of the universe; Plato's God is also the end and final cause of existence, while Aristotle's God is only the end of movement and change.[18] Plethon derides Aristotle for discussing unimportant matters such as shellfish and embryos while failing to credit God with creating the universe,[18] for believing the heavens are composed of a fifth element, and for his view that contemplation was the greatest pleasure; the latter aligned him with Epicurus, Plethon argued, and he attributed this same pleasure-seeking to monks, whom he accused of laziness.[12] Later, in response to Gennadius' Defence of Aristotle, Plethon argued in his Reply that Plato's God was more consistent with Christian doctrine than Aristotle's, and this, according to Darien DeBolt, was probably in part an attempt to escape suspicion of heterodoxy.[18]/nI myself heard him at Florence ... asserting that in a few more years the whole world would accept one and the same religion with one mind, one intelligence, one teaching. And when I asked him \"Christ\u2019s or Muhammad\u2019s?,\" he said, \"Neither; but it will not differ much from paganism.\" I was so shocked by these words that I hated him ever after and feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see or hear him. I heard, too, from a number of Greeks who escaped here from the Peloponnese that he openly said before he died ... that not many years after his death Muhammad and Christ would collapse and the true truth would shine through every region of the globe./nAfter his death, Plethon's N\u00f3m\u014dn syngraph\u1e17 (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae) or N\u00f3moi (\u039d\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, \"Book of Laws\") was discovered. It came into the possession of Princess Theodora, wife of Demetrios Palaiologos, despot of Morea. Theodora sent the manuscript to Scholarius, now Gennadius II, Patriarch of Constantinople, asking for his advice on what to do with it; he returned it, advising her to destroy it. Morea was under invasion from Sultan Mehmet II, and Theodora escaped with Demetrios to Constantinople where she gave the manuscript back to Gennadius, reluctant to destroy the only copy of such a distinguished scholar's work herself. Gennadius burned it in 1460; however, in a letter to the Exarch Joseph (which still survives) he details the book, providing chapter headings and brief summaries of the contents.[18] It seemed to represent a merging of Stoic philosophy and Zoroastrian mysticism, and discussed astrology, daemons and the migration of the soul. He recommended religious rites and hymns to petition the classical gods, such as Zeus, whom he saw as universal principles and planetary powers. Man, as relative of the gods, should strive towards good. Plethon believed the universe has no beginning or end in time, and being created perfect, nothing may be added to it. He rejected the concept of a brief reign of evil followed by perpetual happiness, and held that the human soul is reincarnated, directed by the gods into successive bodies to fulfill divine order. This same divine order, he believed, governed the organisation of bees, the foresight of ants and the dexterity of spiders, as well as the growth of plants, magnetic attraction, and the amalgamation of mercury and gold.[12]/nPlethon drew up plans in his N\u00f3moi to radically change the structure and philosophy of the Byzantine Empire in line with his interpretation of Platonism. The new state religion was to be founded on a hierarchical pantheon of pagan gods, based largely upon the ideas of humanism prevalent at the time, incorporating themes such as rationalism and logic. As an ad hoc measure he also supported the reconciliation of the two churches in order to secure Western Europe's support against the Ottomans.[23] He also proposed more practical, immediate measures, such as rebuilding the Hexamilion, the ancient defensive wall across the Isthmus of Corinth, which had been breached by the Ottomans in 1423./nThe political and social elements of his theories covered the creation of communities, government (he promoted benevolent monarchy as the most stable form), land ownership (land should be shared, rather than individually owned), social organisation, families, and divisions of sex and class. He believed that labourers should keep a third of their produce, and that soldiers should be professional. He held that love should be private not because it is shameful, but because it is sacred.[12]/nPlethon's own summary of the N\u00f3moi also survived, among manuscripts held by his former student Bessarion. This summary, titled Summary of the Doctrines of Zoroaster and Plato, affirms the existence of a pantheon of gods, with Zeus as supreme sovereign, containing within himself all being in an undivided state; his eldest child, motherless, is Poseidon, who created the heavens and rules all below, ordaining order in the universe. Zeus' other children include an array of \"supercelestial\" gods, the Olympians and Tartareans, all motherless. Of these Hera is third in command after Poseidon, creatress and ruler of indestructible matter, and the mother by Zeus of the heavenly gods, demi-gods and spirits. The Olympians rule immortal life in the heavens, the Tartareans mortal life below, their leader Kronos ruling over mortality altogether. The eldest of the heavenly gods is Helios, master of the heavens here and source of all mortal life on earth. The gods are responsible for much good and no evil, and guide all life towards divine order. Plethon describes the creation of the universe as being perfect and outside of time, so that the universe remains eternal, without beginning or end. The soul of man, like the gods is immortal and essentially good, and is reincarnated in successive mortal bodies for eternity at the direction of the gods.[18]/nMany of Plethon's other works still exist in manuscript form in various European libraries. Most of Plethon's works can be found in J. P. Migne's Patrologia Graeca collection; for a complete list see Fabricius, Bibliotheca Graeca (ed. Harles), xii./nEarly in his writing career, E. M. Forster attempted a historical novel about Plethon and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, but was not satisfied with the result and never published it \u2014 though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.[24] Forster also wrote an essay about Plethon, to be found in his book Abinger Harvest./nEzra Pound included Plethon in his poem The Cantos. References to Plethon and Sigismondo Malatesta can be found in Canto 8. Plethon is also mentioned in Cantos 23 and 26. Pound was fascinated by the effect that Plethon's conversation may have had on Cosimo de Medici and his decision to acquire Greek manuscripts of Plato and Neoplatonic philosophers. By having manuscripts brought from Greece and becoming the patron of \"the young boy, Ficino,\" Cosimo facilitated the preservation and transmission of the Greek cultural patrimony into the modern world after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Plethon thus played a key but hidden role in the Italian Renaissance.", "65298680": "Sonja Brentjes (born 1951)[1] is a German historian of science, historian of mathematics, and historian of cartography known for her work on mapmapking and mathematics in medieval Islam./nBrentjes is the daughter of archaeologists, orientalists, and Islamists Burchard Brentjes\u00a0[de] and Helga Wilke Brentjes.[2]/nShe earned a diploma in mathematics from TU Dresden in 1973 and completed her doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) there in 1977.[3] Her doctoral dissertation, Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der linearen Optimierung von den Anf\u00e4ngen zur Konstituierung als selbst\u00e4ndige mathematische Theorie - eine Studie zum Problem der Entstehung mathematischer Disziplinen im 20.

He eventually was named a cardinal and was twice considered for the papacy.[2]/nHis baptismal name was Basil (Greek: \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2,[3] Basileios[4] or Basilios[5]). The name Bessarion he took when entering the monastery.[6] He has been mistakenly known also as Johannes Bessarion (Italian: Giovanni Bessarione) due to an erroneous interpretation of Gregory III Mammas./nBessarion was born in Trebizond, the Black Sea port in northeastern Anatolia that was the heart of Pontic Greek culture and civilization during the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. The year of his birth has been given as 1389, 1395 or 1403.[7]/nBessarion was educated in Constantinople, then went in 1423 to Mystras, Peloponnese to study Neoplatonism under Gemistus Pletho.[8] Under Pletho, he \"went through the liberal arts curriculum\u2026, with a special emphasis on mathematics\u2026including the study of astronomy and geography\" that would have related \"philosophy to physics\u2026cosmology and astrology\" and Pletho's \"mathematics would include Pythagorean number-mysticism, Plato's cosmological geometry and the Neoplatonic arithmetic which connected the material world with the world of Plato's Forms. Possibly it also included astrology\u2026\"[9] Woodhouse also mentions that Bessarion \"had a mystical streak\u2026[and] was proficient in Neoplatonic vocabulary\u2026mathematics\u2026and Platonic theology\".[9]/nBessarion's Neoplatonism stayed with him his whole life, even as a cardinal. He was very familiar with Neoplatonist terminology and used it in his letter to Pletho's two sons, Demitrios and Andronikos, on the death of his still-beloved teacher in 1452.[10] Perhaps the most remarkable thing about his life was that a Neoplatonist could have played such a significant role in the Catholic Church for at least a brief time, though he was attacked for his views by more orthodox Catholic academics shortly after his death./nOn becoming a tonsured monk, he adopted the name of Bessarion of Egypt, whose story he has related. In 1436 became abbot of a monastery in Constantinople and in 1437, he was made metropolitan of Nicaea by the Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaeologus, whom he accompanied to Italy in order to bring about a reunion between the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Catholic) churches. The emperor hoped to use the possibility of re-uniting the churches to obtain help from Western Europe against the Ottoman Empire. Bessarion participated in the Byzantine delegation to the Council of Ferrara-Florence as the most eminent representative of unionists, although he originally belonged to the party of anti-unionists. On 6 July 1439, he read the declaration of the Greek Association of Churches in the cathedral of Florence, in the presence of Pope Eugene IV and the Emperor John VIII Palaeologus.[7]/nSome historians have impugned Bessarion's sincerity in adhering to the union.[11] However, Gill upholds Bessarion's sincerity in being convinced to the truth of the Roman position in the matters discussed at the Council quoting from the bishop's own Oratio Dogmatica:/nBut if we had discerned error in the doctrine of the Latins or distortion in their faith, not even I would have counseled you to embrace union and agreement with them in that case, that for fear of bodily ills you should prefer the values of the present world to spiritual values, the freedom of the body to the betterment of the soul, but I myself would have undergone all that is worst and I would have exposed you to it before I would have urged you to union with them and have recommended such action.[12]/nUpon his return to the East, he found himself bitterly resented for his attachment to the minority party that saw no difficulty in a reconciliation of the two churches. Pope Eugene IV invested him with the rank of cardinal at a consistory of 18 December 1439./nFrom that time, Bessarion resided permanently in Italy, doing much (by his patronage of learned men, by his collection of books and manuscripts, and by his own writings) to spread abroad the New Learning. His palazzo in Rome was a virtual academy for the studies of new humanistic learning, a center for learned Greeks[citation needed] and Greek refugees,[citation needed] whom he supported by commissioning transcripts of Greek manuscripts and translations into Latin that made Greek scholarship available to Western Europeans.[neutrality is disputed] He supported Regiomontanus in this fashion and defended Nicholas of Cusa. He is known in history as the original patron of the Greek exiles (scholars and diplomats) including Theodore Gaza, George of Trebizond, John Argyropoulos, and Janus Lascaris./nHe held in succession the archbishopric of Siponto and the suburbicarian sees of Sabina and Frascati. At the papal conclave of 1455 which elected the Aragonese candidate, Alfons de Borja, as Callixtus III, Cardinal Bessarion was an early candidate for his disinterest in the competition between Roman factions that pressed candidates of the Orsini and Colonna factions.[13] He was opposed for his Greek background by the French Cardinal Alain de Co\u00ebtivy./nFor five years (1450\u20131455), he was legate at Bologna, and he was engaged on embassies to many foreign princes, among others to Louis XI of France in 1471.  Other missions were to Germany to encourage Western princes to help their fellow Christians in the East.  For these efforts, his fellow humanist Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, then Pius II, gave him the purely ceremonial title of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople in 1463./nAs primus Cardinalium (from April 1463) \u2013 the title Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals was not yet in use \u2013 Cardinal Bessarion presided over the Papal conclave, 1464[14] and Papal conclave, 1471.[15]/nHe died on 18 November 1472 at Ravenna. He is buried in the basilica of Santi Apostoli, Rome./nBessarion was one of the most learned scholars of his time. Besides his translations of Aristotle's Metaphysics and Xenophon's Memorabilia, his most important work is a treatise directed against George of Trebizond, a vehement Aristotelian who had written a polemic against Plato, which was entitled In Calumniatorem Platonis (\"Against the Slanderer of Plato\").[16] Bessarion, though a Platonist, was not so thoroughgoing in his admiration as Gemistus Pletho, and he strove instead to reconcile the two philosophies. His work, by opening up the relations of Platonism to the main questions of religion, contributed greatly to the extension of speculative thought in the department of theology./nIt was thanks to him that the Bibliotheca, an important compendium of Greek mythology, has survived to the present./nHis library, which contained a very extensive collection of Greek manuscripts, was presented by him in 1468 to the Senate of the Republic of Venice, and forms the nucleus of the famous library of St Mark's, the Biblioteca Marciana.

His first published article, in 1977, was a contribution to the vast literature on convergence of certain iterative algorithms to fixed points of a given nonexpansive self-map of a closed convex subset of Hilbert space.[L77][11] In collaboration with his thesis advisor Ha\u00efm Br\u00e9zis, Lions gave new results about maximal monotone operators in Hilbert space, proving one of the first convergence results for Bernard Martinet and R. Tyrrell Rockafellar's proximal point algorithm.[BL78][12] In the time since, there have been a large number of modifications and improvements of such results.[13]/nWith Bertrand Mercier, Lions proposed a \"forward-backward splitting algorithm\" for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators.[LM79] Their algorithm can be viewed as an abstract version of the well-known Douglas\u2212Rachford and Peaceman\u2212Rachford numerical algorithms for computation of solutions to parabolic partial differential equations. The Lions\u2212Mercier algorithms and their proof of convergence have been particularly influential in the literature on operator theory and its applications to numerical analysis. A similar method was studied at the same time by Gregory Passty.[14][12]/nThe mathematical study of the steady-state Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Newton equation, also called the Choquard equation, was initiated in a seminal article of Elliott Lieb.[15] It is inspired by plasma physics via a standard approximation technique in quantum chemistry. Lions showed that one could apply standard methods such as the mountain pass theorem, together with some technical work of Walter Strauss, in order to show that a generalized steady-state Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Newton equation with a radially symmetric generalization of the gravitational potential is necessarily solvable by a radially symmetric function.[L80]/nThe partial differential equation/nhas received a great deal of attention in the mathematical literature. Lions' extensive work on this equation is concerned with the existence of rotationally symmetric solutions as well as estimates and existence for boundary value problems of various type.[L82a] In the interest of studying solutions on all of Euclidean space, where standard compactness theory does not apply, Lions established a number of compactness results for functions with symmetry.[L82b] With Henri Berestycki and Lambertus Peletier, Lions used standard ODE shooting methods to directly study the existence of rotationally symmetric solutions.[BLP81] However, sharper results were obtained two years later by Berestycki and Lions by variational methods. They considered the solutions of the equation as rescalings of minima of a constrained optimization problem, based upon a modified Dirichlet energy. Making use of the Schwarz symmetrization, there exists a minimizing sequence for the infimization problem which consists of positive and rotationally symmetric functions. So they were able to show that there is a minimum which is also rotationally symmetric and nonnegative.[BL83a] By adapting the critical point methods of Felix Browder, Paul Rabinowitz, and others, Berestycki and Lions also demonstrated the existence of infinitely many (not always positive) radially symmetric solutions to the PDE.[BL83b] Maria Esteban and Lions investigated the nonexistence of solutions in a number of unbounded domains with Dirichlet boundary data.[EL82] Their basic tool is a Pohozaev-type identity, as previously reworked by Berestycki and Lions.[BL83a] They showed that such identities can be effectively used with Nachman Aronszajn's unique continuation theorem to obtain the triviality of solutions under some general conditions.[16] Significant \"a priori\" estimates for solutions were found by Lions in collaboration with Djairo Guedes de Figueiredo and Roger Nussbaum.[FLN82]/nIn more general settings, Lions introduced the \"concentration-compactness principle\", which characterizes when minimizing sequences of functionals may fail to subsequentially converge. His first work dealt with the case of translation-invariance, with applications to several problems of applied mathematics, including the Choquard equation.[L84a] He was also able to extend parts of his work with Berestycki to settings without any rotational symmetry.[L84b] By making use of Abbas Bahri's topological methods and min-max theory, Bahri and Lions were able to establish multiplicity results for these problems.[BL88] Lions also considered the problem of dilation invariance, with natural applications to optimizing functions for dilation-invariant functional inequalities such as the Sobolev inequality.[L85a] He was able to apply his methods to give a new perspective on previous works on geometric problems such as the Yamabe problem and harmonic maps.[L85b] With Thierry Cazenave, Lions applied his concentration-compactness results to establish orbital stability of certain symmetric solutions of nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations which admit variational interpretations and energy-conserving solutions.[CL82]/nIn 1988, Fran\u00e7ois Golse, Lions, Beno\u00eet Perthame, and R\u00e9mi Sentis studied the transport equation, which is a first-order linear partial differential equation.[GLPS88] They showed that if the first-order coefficients are randomly chosen according to some probability distribution, then the corresponding function values are distributed with regularity which is enhanced from the original probability distribution. These results were later extended by DiPerna, Lions, and Meyer.[DLM91] In the physical sense, such results, known as velocity-averaging lemmas, correspond to the fact that macroscopic observables have greater smoothness than their microscopic rules directly indicate. According to C\u00e9dric Villani, it is unknown if it is possible to instead use the explicit representation of solutions of the transport equation to derive these properties.[17]/nThe classical Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem deals with integral curves of Lipschitz-continuous vector fields. By viewing integral curves as characteristic curves for a transport equation in multiple dimensions, Lions and Ronald DiPerna initiated the broader study of integral curves of Sobolev vector fields.[DL89a] DiPerna and Lions' results on the transport equation were later extended by Luigi Ambrosio to the setting of bounded variation, and by Alessio Figalli to the context of stochastic processes.[18]/nDiPerna and Lions were able to prove the global existence of solutions to the Boltzmann equation.[DL89b] Later, by applying the methods of Fourier integral operators, Lions established estimates for the Boltzmann collision operator, thereby finding compactness results for solutions of the Boltzmann equation.[L94] As a particular application of his compactness theory, he was able to show that solutions subsequentially converge at infinite time to Maxwell distributions.[17] DiPerna and Lions also established a similar result for the Maxwell\u2212Vlasov equations.[DL89c][19]/nMichael Crandall and Lions introduced the notion of viscosity solution, which is a kind of generalized solution of Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equations. Their definition is significant since they were able to establish a well-posedness theory in such a generalized context.[CL83] The basic theory of viscosity solutions was further worked out in collaboration with Lawrence Evans.[CEL84] Using a min-max quantity, Lions and Jean-Michel Lasry considered mollification of functions on Hilbert space which preserve analytic phenomena.[LL86] Their approximations are naturally applicable to Hamilton-Jacobi equations, by regularizing sub- or super-solutions. Using such techniques, Crandall and Lions extended their analysis of Hamilton-Jacobi equations to the infinite-dimensional case, proving a comparison principle and a corresponding uniqueness theorem.[CL85]/nCrandall and Lions investigated the numerical analysis of their viscosity solutions, proving convergence results both for a finite difference scheme and artificial viscosity.[CL84]/nThe comparison principle underlying Crandall and Lions' notion of viscosity solution makes their definition naturally applicable to second-order elliptic partial differential equations, given the maximum principle.[20][IL90] Crandall, Ishii, and Lions' survey article on viscosity solutions for such equations has become a standard reference work.[CIL92]/nWith Jean-Michel Lasry, Lions has contributed to the development of mean-field game theory.[LL07]/nArticles./nTextbooks.", "41312567": "Alberto Adrego Pinto is a full professor at the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto (Portugal).

Early appearances of Morgan in Arthurian literature do not elaborate her character beyond her role as a goddess, a fay, a witch, or a sorceress, generally benevolent and connected to Arthur as his magical saviour and protector. Her prominence increased as the legend of Arthur developed over time, as did her moral ambivalence, and in some texts there is an evolutionary transformation of her to an antagonist, particularly as portrayed in cyclical prose such as the Lancelot-Grail and the Post-Vulgate Cycle. A significant aspect in many of Morgan's medieval and later iterations is the unpredictable duality of her nature, with potential for both good and evil./nHer character may have originated from Welsh mythology as well as from other ancient and medieval myths and historical figures. The earliest documented account, by Geoffrey of Monmouth in Vita Merlini (written c.\u20091150) refers to Morgan in association with the Isle of Apples (Avalon), to which Arthur was carried after having been fatally wounded at the Battle of Camlann, as the leader of the nine magical sisters unrelated to Arthur. Therein, and in the early chivalric romances by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and others, Morgan's chief role is that of a great healer. Several of numerous and often unnamed fairy-mistress and maiden-temptress characters found through the Arthurian romance genre may also be considered as appearances of Morgan in her different aspects./nRomance authors of the late 12th century established Morgan as Arthur's supernatural elder sister. In the 13th-century prose cycles \u2013 and the later works based on them, including the influential Le Morte d'Arthur \u2013 she is usually described as the youngest daughter of Arthur's mother Igraine and her first husband Gorlois. Arthur, son of Igraine and Uther Pendragon, is thus Morgan's half-brother, and her full sisters include Mordred's mother, the Queen of Orkney. The young Morgan unhappily marries Urien, with whom she has a son, Yvain. She becomes an apprentice of Merlin, and a capricious and vindictive adversary of some knights of the Round Table, all the while harbouring a special hatred for Arthur's wife Guinevere. In this tradition, she is also sexually active and even predatory, taking numerous lovers that may include Merlin and Accolon, with an unrequited love for Lancelot. In some variants, including in the popular retelling by Malory, Morgan is the greatest enemy of Arthur, scheming to usurp his throne and indirectly becoming an instrument of his death. However, she eventually reconciles with Arthur, retaining her original role of taking him on his final journey to Avalon./nMany other medieval and Renaissance works feature continuations of her evolutionary tale from the aftermath of Camlann as she becomes the immortal queen of Avalon in both Arthurian and non-Arthurian stories, sometimes alongside Arthur. After a period of being largely absent from contemporary culture, Morgan's character again rose to prominence in the 20th and 21st centuries,  appearing in a wide variety of roles and portrayals. Notably, her modern character is frequently being conflated with her sister's as mother of Arthur's son and nemesis Mordred, the status that Morgan herself never had in medieval legend./nThe earliest spelling of the name (found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini, written c. 1150) is Morgen, which is likely derived from Old Welsh or Old Breton Morgen, meaning 'sea-born' (from Common Brittonic *Mori-gen\u0101, the masculine form of which, *Mori-genos, survived in Middle Welsh as Moryen or Morien; a cognate form in Old Irish is Muirgen, the name of a Celtic Christian shapeshifting female saint who was associated with the sea). The name is not to be confused with the unrelated Modern Welsh masculine name Morgan (spelled Morcant in the Old Welsh period).[2][3] As her epithet \"le Fay\" (a pseudo-French phrase derived in the 15th century by Thomas Malory[4] from its original French form la f\u00e9e 'the fairy'; Malory would also use the form \"le Fey\" alternatively with \"le Fay\"[5]) and some traits indicate, the figure of Morgan appears to have been a remnant of supernatural females from Celtic mythology, and her main name could be connected to the myths of Morgens (also known as Mari-Morgans or just Morgans),[6] the Welsh and Breton fairy water spirits related to the legend of Princess Dahut (Ahes). Speculatively, beginning with Lucy Allen Paton in 1904,[7] Morgan has been connected with the shapeshifting and multifaced Irish goddess of strife known as the Morr\u00edgan ('Great Queen').[8] Proponents of this theory have included Roger Sherman Loomis, who doubted the Muirgen connection.[9][10] Further inspiration for her character likely came from other Welsh folklore as well as possibly other works of medieval Irish literature and hagiography./nPossible influence by elements of the classical Greek mythology sorceresses or goddesses such as Circe and especially Medea (who, similar to Morgan, are often alternately benevolent and malicious),[7][11] and other magical women from the Irish mythology such as the mother of hero Fr\u00e1ech,[12] as well as historical figure of Empress Matilda,[11] have been also suggested. A chiefly Greek construction is a relatively new origin theory by Carolyne Larrington.[5] Geoffrey's description of Morgen and her sisters in the Vita Merlini closely resembles the story of the nine Gaulish priestesses of the isle of Sena (now \u00cele de Sein) called Gallisenae (or Gallizenae), as described by the geographer Pomponius Mela during the first century, strongly suggesting that Pomponius' Description of the World (De situ orbis) was one of Geoffrey's prime sources for at least his unique version.[13][14][15][16] One of the proposed candidates for the historical Arthur, Artuir mac \u00c1ed\u00e1n, was recorded as having a sister named Maithgen (daughter of king \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in, a 6th-century king of D\u00e1l Riata), whose name also appears as that of a prophetic druid in the Irish legend of Saint Brigid of Kildare./nMorgan has also been often linked with the supernatural mother Modron,[6][17] derived from the continental mother goddess figure of Dea Matrona and featured in medieval Welsh literature. Modron appears in Welsh Triad 70 (\"Three Blessed Womb-Burdens of the Island of Britain\") \u2013 in which her children by Urien are named Owain mab Urien (son) and Morfydd (daughter)[18] \u2013 and a later folktale have recorded more fully in the manuscript Peniarth 147.[19] A fictionalised version of the historical king Urien is usually Morgan le Fay's husband in the variations of Arthurian legend informed by continental romances, wherein their son is named Yvain. Furthermore, the historical Urien had a treacherous ally named Morcant Bulc who plotted to assassinate him, much as Morgan attempts to kill Urien.[20] Additionally, Modron is called \"daughter of Afallach\",[21] a Welsh ancestor figure also known as Avallach or Avalloc, whose name can also be interpreted as a noun meaning 'a place of apples';[22] in the tale of Owain and Morfydd's conception in Peniarth 147, Modron is called the \"daughter of the King of Annwn\", a Celtic Otherworld.[23] This evokes Avalon, the marvelous \"Isle of Apples\" with which Morgan has been associated since her earliest appearances, and the Irish legend of the otherworldly woman Niamh including the motif of apple in connection to Avalon-like Otherworld isle of T\u00edr na n\u00d3g (\"Land of Youth\").[24] As summarised by Will Hasty, \"while this is difficult to establish with certainty the relationship between female figures such as these in the Arthurian tradition and the otherworldly goddesses, sprites, and nymphs of Irish and Welsh myths (a relationship is assumed especially in the case of Morgan le Fay), both groups demonstrate similar ambivalent characteristics: they are by turns dangerous and desirable, implicated alternately in fighting, death, sexuality, and fertility.\"[25]/nWhile many works make Morgan specifically human, she almost always keeps her magical powers[26] and often also her otherworldly if not divine attributes and qualities.[6] Some medieval authors refer to her as a fairy queen or even outright a goddess (dea, d\u00e9esse, gotinne).[27] According to Gerald of Wales in his 12th-century De instructione principis, a noblewoman and close relative of King Arthur named Morganis carried the dead Arthur to her island of Avalon (identified by him as Glastonbury), where he was buried.[28] Writing in the early 13th century in Speculum ecclesiae, Gerald also wrote that \"as a result, the fanciful Britons and their bards invented the legend that some kind of a fantastic goddess (dea quaedam phantastica)[29][30] had removed Arthur's body to the Isle of Avalon, so that she might cure his wounds there,\" for the purpose of enabling the possibility of King Arthur's messianic return.[31] In his encyclopaedic work, Otia Imperialia, written around the same time and with similar derision for this belief, Gervase of Tilbury calls her Morganda Fatata (Morganda the Fairy).[30] Morgan retains her early role as Arthur's legendary healer throughout later Arthurian tradition./nMorgan first appears by name in Vita Merlini, written by Norman-Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth. Purportedly an account of the life of Merlin, it elaborates some episodes from Geoffrey's more famous earlier work, Historia Regum Britanniae (1136). In Historia, Geoffrey relates how King Arthur, gravely wounded by Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, is taken off to the blessed Isle of Apple Trees (Latin Insula Pomorum), Avalon, to be healed; Avalon (Ynys Afallach in the Welsh versions of Historia) is also mentioned as the place where Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged. (Geoffrey's Arthur does have a sister, whose name is Anna, but the possibility of her being a predecessor to Morgan is unknown.[4]) In Vita Merlini, Geoffrey describes this island in more detail and names Morgen as the chief of the nine magical queen sisters who dwell there, ruling in their own right. Morgen agrees to take Arthur, delivered to her by Taliesin to have him revived. She and her sisters are capable of shapeshifting and flying,[32] and (at least seemingly[11]) use their powers only for good.[33] Morgen is also said to be a learned mathematician[34] and to have taught it and astronomy[35] to her fellow nymph (nymphae)[29] sisters, whose names are listed as Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, Thiten (Thitis), and Thiton (Thetis).[36][37]/nShe who is first among them is more skilled in the healing art, and also surpasses her sisters in beauty. Morgen is her name, and she has learned what useful properties all the herbs contain, so that she can cure the body ills. She knows, too, the art by which to change her shape, and to fly through the air, like Daedalus, on strange wings. When she wishes, she is now at  Brest (Brisiti), now at Chartres (Carnoti), now at Pavia (Papie); and at will she glides down from the sky onto your shores. (...) Morgen received us with due honor. She put the king in her chamber on a golden bed, uncovered his wound with her noble hand and looked long at it. At length she said he could be cured if only he stayed with her a long while and accepted her treatment. We therefore happily commited the king to her care, and spred our sails to favourable winds on return journey./nIn the making of this arguably Virgin Mary-type[4] character and her sisters, Geoffrey might have been influenced by the first-century Roman cartographer Pomponius Mela, who has described an oracle at the \u00cele de Sein off the coast of Brittany and its nine virgin priestesses believed by the continental Celtic Gauls to have the power to cure disease and perform various other awesome magic, such as controlling the sea through incantations, foretelling the future, and changing themselves into any animal.[6][38] In addition, according to a theory postulated by R. S. Loomis, it is possible that Geoffrey has not been the original inventor of Morgan, as character may have had already existed in Breton folklore in the hypothetical unrecorded oral stories that featured her as Arthur's fairy saviour, or even also his fairy godmother (her earliest shared supernatural ability being able to traverse on or under water). Such stories being told by wandering storytellers (as credited by Gerald of Wales) would then influence multiple authors writing independently from each other, especially since Vita Merlini was a relatively little-known text.[29]/nGeoffrey's description of Morgan is notably very similar to that in Beno\u00eet de Sainte-Maure's epic poem Roman de Troie (c. 1155\u20131160), a story of the ancient Trojan War in which Morgan herself makes an unexplained appearance in this second known text featuring her.[10] As Orvan the Fairy (Orva la f\u00e9e, likely a corruption of a spelling such as *Morgua[a] in the original-text),[39] there she first lustfully[40] loves the Trojan hero Hector and gifts him a wonderful horse, but then pursues him with hate after he rejects her. The abrupt way in which she is used suggests Beno\u00eet did expect his aristocratic audience to have been already familiar with her character.[7][11] Another such ancient-times appearance of a Morgan character can be found in the much later Perceforest (1330s), within the fourth book which is set in Britain during Julius Caesar's invasions, where the fairy Morgane lives in the isle of Zeeland and has learned her magic from Zephir. Here, she has a daughter named Morganette and an adoptive son named Passelion, who in turn have a son named Morgan, described as an ancestor of the Lady of the Lake.[41]/nIn Jaufre, an early Occitan language Arthurian romance dated c. 1180, Morgan seems to appear, without being named other than introducing herself as the \"Fairy of Gibel\", Gibel is the Arabic name of Mount Etna in Sicily (fada de Gibel,  the mount Gibel being a version of the Avalon motif as in later works), as the ruler of an underground kingdom who takes the protagonist knight Jaufre (Griflet) through a fountain to gift him her magic ring of protection.[29] In the romance poem Lanzelet, translated by the end of the 12th century by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven from a now-lost French text, the infant Lancelot is spirited away by a water fairy (merfeine in Old High German) and raised in her paradise island country of Meidelant ('Land of Maidens'). Ulrich's unnamed fairy queen character might be also related to Geoffrey's Morgen,[12] as well as to the early Breton oral tradition of Morgan's figure, especially as her son there is named Mabuz, similar to the name of Modron's son Mabon ap Modron. In Layamon's Middle English poem The Chronicle of Britain (c. 1215), Arthur was taken to Avalon by two women to be healed there by its most beautiful elfen (aluen) queen named Argante or Argane;[7][42] it is possible her name had been originally Margan(te) before it was changed in manuscript transmission.[43]/nThe 12th-century French poet Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes already mentions her in his first romance, Erec and Enide, completed around 1170. In it, a love of Morgan (Morgue) is Guigomar (Guingomar, Guinguemar), the Lord of the Isle of Avalon and a nephew of King Arthur, a character derivative of Guigemar from the Breton lai Guigemar.[12] Guingamor's own lai by Marie de France links him to the beautiful magical entity known only as the \"fairy mistress\",[44] who was later identified by Thomas Chestre's Sir Launfal as Dame Tryamour, the daughter of the King of the Celtic Otherworld who shares many characteristics with Chr\u00e9tien's Morgan.[45][46] It was noted that even Chr\u00e9tien' earliest mention of Morgan already shows an enmity between her and Queen Guinevere, and although Morgan is represented only in a benign role by Chr\u00e9tien, she resides in a mysterious place known as the Vale Perilous (which some later authors would say she has created as a place of punishment for unfaithful knights).[38][47] She is later mentioned in the same poem when Arthur provides the wounded hero Erec with a healing balm made by his sister Morgan. This episode affirms her early role as a healer, in addition to being one of the first instances of Morgan presented as Arthur's sister. Healing remains Morgan's chief ability, but Chr\u00e9tien also hints at her potential to harm.[48]/nChr\u00e9tien again refers to Morgan as a great healer in his later romance Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, in an episode in which the Lady of Norison restores the maddened hero Yvain to his senses with a magical potion provided by Morgan the Wise (Morgue la sage).[27][11] Morgan the Wise is female in Chr\u00e9tien's original, as well as in the Norse version Ivens saga, but male in the English Ywain and Gawain. While the fairy Modron is mother of Owain mab Urien in the Welsh myth, and Morgan would be assigned this role in the later literature, this first continental association between Yvain (the romances' version of Owain) and Morgan does not imply they are son and mother. The earliest mention of Morgan as Yvain's mother is found in Tyolet, an early 13th-century Breton lai.[42]/nThe Middle Welsh Arthurian tale Geraint son of Erbin, either based on Chr\u00e9tien's Erec and Enide or derived from a common source, mentions King Arthur's chief physician named Morgan Tud. It is believed that this character, though considered a male in Gereint, may be derived from Morgan le Fay, though this has been a matter of debate among Arthurian scholars since the 19th century (the epithet Tud may be a Welsh or Breton cognate or borrowing of Old Irish tuath, 'north, left', 'sinister, wicked', also 'fairy (fay), elf').[49][50] There, Morgan is called to treat Edern ap Nudd, Knight of the Sparrowhawk, following the latter's defeat at the hands of his adversary Geraint, and is later called on by Arthur to treat Geraint himself. In the German version of Erec, the 12th-century knight and poet Hartmann von Aue has Erec healed by Guinevere with a special plaster that was given to Arthur by the king's sister, the goddess (gotinne)[29] Feimurg\u00e2n (F\u00e2murg\u00e2n, Fairy Murgan[51]):/nWhen she began to demonstrate her magic powers, she had very soon circumnavigated the world and come back again. (...) Both in the air and on the earth she could hover at her ease, on the waves and beneath them. She was totally indifferent as to whether she lived in the fire or, just as much at her ease, in the dew. (...) And when it took her fancy she could change a man into a bird or an animal. (...) Mighty was she in magic and her life was greatly in defiance of God, for at her command were the birds in the wild, in the woods and fields, and what seems to me greatest, those evil spirits, that are called devils \u2013 they were all at her command. She was well capable of marvels for dragons had to bring from the air support in her affairs, as well as the fish in the sea. Moreover, she had kin deep in Hell: the Devil was her companion. He sent her aid, even from the fire, as much as she wanted. And whatever she would have from this earth, she took, without peril, in ample measure, all for herself. The earth bore no root, the power of which was not as familiar to her as the back of my hand is to me. (...) This earth never acquired a better mistress of magic arts than Feimurg\u00e2n.[52]/nIn writing that, Hartmann might have not been influenced by Chr\u00e9tien, but rather by an earlier oral tradition from the stories of Breton bards.[29] Hartmann also separated Arthur's sister (that is Feimurg\u00e2n) from the fairy mistress of the lord of Avalon (Chr\u00e9tien's Guigomar), who in his version is named Marguel.[53] In the anonymous First Continuation of Chr\u00e9tien's Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the fairy lover of its variant of Guigomar (here as Guingamuer) is named Brangepart, and the two have a son Brangemuer who became the king of an otherworldly isle \"where no mortal lived\".[54][55] In the 13th-century romance Parzival, another German knight-poet Wolfram von Eschenbach inverted Hartmann's F\u00e2murg\u00e2n's name to create that of Arthur's fairy ancestor named Terdelaschoye de Feimurg\u00e2n, the wife of Mazad\u00e2n, where the part \"Terdelaschoye\" comes from Terre de la Joie, or Land of Joy; the text also mentions the mountain of F\u00e2morg\u00e2n.[29][42] Jean Markale further identified a Morganian figure in Wolfram's ambiguous character of Cundrie the Sorceress (later better known as Kundry) through her plot function as mistress of illusions in an enchanted fairy garden.[56]/nSpeculatively, Loomis and John Matthews further identified other perceived avatars of Morgan as the \"Besieged Lady\" archetype in various early works associated with the Castle of Maidens motif, often appearing as (usually unnamed) wife of King Lot and mother of Gawain. These characters include the Queen of Meidenlant in Diu Cr\u00f4ne, the lady of Castellum Puellarum in De Ortu Waluuanii, and the nameless heroine of the Breton lai Doon, among others, including some in later works (such as with Lady Lufamore of Maydenlande in Sir Perceval of Galles).[57] Loomis also linked her to the eponymous seductress evil queen from The Queen of Scotland, a 19th-century ballad \"containing Arthurian material dating back to the year 1200.\"[58]/nA recently discovered moralistic manuscript written in Anglo-Norman French is the only known instance of medieval Arthurian literature presented as being composed by Morgan herself. This late 12th-century text is purportedly addressed to her court official and tells of the story of a knight called Piers the Fierce; it is likely that the author's motive was to draw a satirical moral from the downfall of the English knight Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Morgayne is titled in it as \"empress of the wilderness, queen of the damsels, lady of the isles, and governor of the waves of the great sea.\"[59] Morgan (Morganis) is also mentioned in the Draco Normannicus, a 12th-century (c. 1167\u20131169) Latin chronicle by \u00c9tienne de Rouen, which contains a fictitious letter addressed by King Arthur to Henry II of England, written for political propaganda purpose of having 'Arthur' criticise King Henry for invading the Duchy of Brittany.[59] Notably, it is one of the first known texts that made her a sister to Arthur, as she is in the works of Chr\u00e9tien and many others after him.[60] As described by \u00c9tienne,/nArthur, gravely wounded, sought the help of his sister, who held the holy Isle of Avalon. Morgan, the everlasting nymph (Morganis nympha perennis), received her brother here, cured him, nourished him, revived him, and made him immortal. He was presented the Antipodes as his kingdom. The faerie folk being unarmed, the great war leader comes to their aid: he fears no battle.[59]/nMorgan's role was greatly expanded by the unknown authors of the early-13th-century Old French prose romances of the Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail cycle, and its subsequent rewrite, the Prose Tristan-influenced Post-Vulgate Cycle. (Both of these cycles are believed to be at least influenced by the Cistercian religious order, which might explain the texts' demonisation of pagan motifs and increasingly anti-sexual attitudes,[6] altrough some of these attitudes may be arguably shared with the pre-Christian source material.[b]) Integrating her figure fully into the Arthurian world, they also portray Morgan's ways and deeds as being much more sinister and aggressive than they are in Geoffrey or Chr\u00e9tien, showing her undergoing a series of transformations in the process of becoming a much more chaotic and unpredictable character.[7][62] Beginning as an erratic ally of Arthur and a notorious temptress opposed to his wife and some of his knights (especially Lancelot, doubling as her unrequited love interest) in the original stories of the Vulgate Cycle, Morgan's figure eventually often turns into an ambitious and depraved nemesis of King Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate stories./nA common image of Morgan becomes a malicious, jealous and cruel sorceress, the source of many intrigues at the royal court of Arthur and elsewhere. In some of the later works, she is also subversively working to take over Arthur's throne through her mostly harmful magic and scheming, including manipulating men.[35][63] Most of the time, Morgan's magic arts correspond with these of Merlin's and the Lady of the Lake's, featuring shapeshifting, illusion, and sleeping spells (Richard Kieckhefer connected it with Norse magic[5]).[64] Although she is usually depicted in medieval romances as beautiful and seductive,[65] the medieval archetype of the loathly lady is used frequently, as Morgan can be in a contradictory fashion described as both beautiful and ugly even within the same narration.[27]/nThis version of Morgan (usually named Morgane, Morgain or Morgue) first appears in the few surviving verses of the Old French poem Merlin, which later served as the original source for the Vulgate Cycle and consequently also the Post-Vulgate Cycle. It was written c. 1200 by the French knight-poet Robert de Boron, who described her as an illegitimate daughter of Lady Igraine with an initially unnamed Duke of Tintagel, after whose death she is adopted by King Neutres of Garlot.[7][67] Merlin is the first known work linking Morgan to Igraine and mentioning her learning sorcery after having been sent away for an education. The reader is informed that Morgan was given her moniker 'la f\u00e9e' (\"the fairy\") due to her great knowledge.[68] A 14th-century massive prequel to the Arthurian legend, Perceforest, also implies that Arthur's sister was later named after its f\u00e9e character Morgane from several centuries earlier. In the Huth-Merlin version of Merlin, Morgain and Morgue la fee are introduced as two different half-sisters of Arthur who then become merged into one character later in the text.[69]/nIn a popular tradition, Morgan is the youngest of the daughters of Igraine and her husband, a Duke of Cornwall (or Tintagel) who today best known as Gorlois. Her father dies in battle with the army of the British high king Uther Pendragon in a war over his wife (Morgan's mother) at the same moment as when Arthur is conceived by Uther, who infiltrates Tintagel Castle with the half-demon Merlin's magic aid. In the poem's prose version and its continuations, she has at least two elder sisters. Various manuscripts list up to five sisters or half-sisters of Arthur, sometimes from different fathers, and some do not mention Morgan being a bastard (step)child.[7] In the best-known version, her sisters are Elaine (Blasine) and the Queen of Orkney sometimes known as Morgause, the latter of whom is the mother of Arthur's knights Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth by King Lot, and the traitor Mordred by Arthur (in some romances the wife of King Lot is called Morcades, a name that R. S. Loomis argued was another name of Morgan[70]). At a young age, Morgan is sent to a convent after Arthur's father Uther marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan's younger half-brother). There, Morgan masters the seven arts and begins her study of magic, going on to specialise in astronomie (astronomy and astrology) and healing;[59][71] the Prose Merlin describes her as \"wonderfully adept\" and \"working hard all the time.\"[59] The Vulgate Suite du Merlin narration describes Morgan's unmatched beauty and her various skills and qualities of character:/nShe was comely in body and features, she stood straight and was wonderfully pleasant and a good singer. She was the best worker with her hands  that anyone knew about in any land, and she was the cleverest of all. And she had the fairest head of any suited for a woman, and the most beautiful hands, and her skin was softer than millet. But she was the most lustful woman in all Great Britain and the lewdest.    And as long as she was in her right mind, she was more courteous than any, but when she was angry with anyone, there was no need in trying to reconcile them.[72]/nUther (or Arthur himself in the Post-Vulgate[7]) betroths her to his ally, King Urien of Gorre (Gore), the realm described as an Otherworldly northern British kingdom, possibly the historical Rheged (early versions have alternatively named Morgan's husband as Nentres of Garlot, who later was recast as the husband of her sister Elaine). Now a queen but unhappy with her husband, Morgan serves as a lady-in-waiting for the high queen, Arthur's newly married young wife Guinevere. At first, Morgan and the also young Guinevere are close friends, even wearing shared near-identical rings. However, everything changes when Morgan is caught in an affair with her lover Guiomar (derived from Chr\u00e9tien's Guigomar) by Guinevere. Usually, Guiomar is depicted as Guinevere's cousin (alternatively, appearing there as Gaimar, he is Guinevere's early lover instead of her relative in the German version Lancelot und Ginevra). The high queen intervenes to break their relationship to prevent the loss of honor (according to some scholarship, possibly also because of Guinevere's perception of Morgan, with her kinship and close relationship with Arthur, as a rival in political power[73]). This incident, introduced in the Prose Merlin and expanded in the Vulgate Lancelot[74] and the Post-Vulgate Suite du Merlin (the Huth Merlin),[7] begins a lifelong feud between Guinevere and Morgan, who leaves the court of Camelot with all her wealth to seek out Merlin and greater powers. The pregnant Morgan later gives birth to Guiomar's son, who is not named in the story but is said to grow up to become a great knight.[75]/nMorgan then either undertakes or continues her studies of dark magic under Merlin, enamored for her, the details of which vary widely depending on the telling.[40] In the Prose Merlin, for instance, it is Morgan who finds Merlin, whom she \"loves passionately\".[7] In the Livre d'Artus, where Morgan's first lover is a knight named Bertolais,[76] it is rather Merlin who goes to live with Morgan and her two ladies for a long time following the betrayal of him by Niniane (the Lady of the Lake) with her other lover, just as Morgan wished for him to do.[7][40] In the Post-Vulgate Suite, Morgan had been tutored by Merlin even before her relationship with Guiomar, and later she returns to learn more.[7] They meet at Lot's funeral, during the time when Morgan is pregnant with Yvain. After Merlin teaches her so much she becomes \"the wisest woman in the world\", Morgan scorns and drives Merlin away by threatening to torture and kill him if he would not leave her alone, which causes him great sorrow out of his \"foolish love\" (fol amor) for her.[7][30] In the Vulgate Lancelot, Morgan learns all her magic only from Merlin (and not in the nunnery). In any case, having finished her studies under Merlin, Morgan begins scheming her vengeance as she tries to undermine virtue and achieve Guinevere's downfall whenever she can./nIn the Post-Vulgate Cycle, where Morgan's explicitly evil nature is stated and accented, she also works to destroy Arthur's rule and end his life. The most famous and important of these machinations is introduced in the Post-Vulgate Suite, where she arranges for her devoted lover Accolon to obtain the enchanted sword Excalibur as well as its protective scabbard, which has been previously confided to Morgan by Arthur himself as he had trusted her even more than his wife, replacing the real ones with fakes. In a conspiracy with the villainous lord Damas, Morgan plans for Accolon to use Arthur's own magic items against him in single combat, so she and her beloved Accolon would become the rulers. As part of her convoluted plan, both Arthur and Accolon are spirited away from their hunt with Urien by a magical boat of twelve damsels. Confident of her coming victory, Morgan also attempts to murder her sleeping husband Urien with his own sword, but in this act she is stopped by their son Yvain (Uwayne), who pardons her when she protests she has been under the devil's power and promises to abandon her wicked ways.[75] After Arthur nevertheless mortally defeats Accolon in a duel arranged by Morgan, her former mentor Merlin, still having feelings for her, saves her from Arthur's wrath by enabling her to escape.[78] To avenge Accolon's death, which caused her great sorrow, Morgan again steals the scabbard from the sleeping king. Pursued by Arthur for her betrayal, Morgan throws the scabbard into a lake, before temporarily turning herself and her entourage to stone, the sight of which makes Arthur think they have been already punished by God. That action of Morgan ultimately causes the death of Arthur, who would otherwise be protected by the scabbard's magic in his final battle. On her way out, Morgan saves Arthur's knight named Manassen (Manessen) from certain death when she learns Accolon was Manessen's cousin and enables him to kill his captor./nIn the same narrative, having been banished from Camelot, Morgan then retires to her lands in the magical kingdom of Gorre and then to her castle near the stronghold of Tauroc (possibly in North Wales). However, her treacherous attempts to bring about Arthur's demise in the Suite are repeatedly frustrated by the king's new sorceress advisor Ninianne (the Lady of the Lake). An iconic case of Morgan's such further and very underhanded plots to kill Arthur in the Post-Vulgate occurs when Morgan sends him a supposed offering of peace in the form of a rich mantle cloak, but Morgan's messenger maiden is made put on the gift first by Ninianne'a advice to Arthur, for \"if she dies of it, Morgan will be angrier than at anything else that could happen to her, for she loves her with a very great love.\" The girl indeed falls dead, and Arthur has her body burned.[79] It is possible that this motif was inspired by classical stories like that how Medea killed her rival for Jason's affection[80] or how Deianira sent a poisoned tunic to Hercules.[81] The reasons for Morgan's hatred of her brother in the Post-Vulgate narrative are never fully explained, other than by just a \"natural\" extreme antipathy against goodness by the evil that she is an embodiment of.[7]/nMorgan is often emphasised as promiscuous, even more than her sister Morgause, as she is \"so lustful and wanton that a looser [noble]woman could not have been found.\"[82] In some versions, she also associates with two other lascivious enchantresses, Queen Sebile (Sedile) and the unnamed Queen of Sorestan. Together, the three \"knew so much about magic, they enjoyed one another's company and always rode together and ate and drank together.\" Sebile and Morgan are particularly close companions, working their magic together, but they tend to fall into petty squabbles due to their rivalries and bad tempers, including a conflict between them when they both seduce Hector de Maris in the late 13th-century Proph\u00e9ties de Merlin. Their friendship is further tested when a quarrel over a handsome widower named Berengier (captured by Sebile after Morgan kidnapped his child) ends in a violent attack by Sebile that leaves Morgan half-dead; Morgan swears revenge, but their relationship is later restored.[67] After Merlin's entombment by the Lady of the Lake, Morgan and her three enchantresses also try to find and rescue him but they fail in that task.[30] Morgan's other allies in the Proph\u00e9ties include the opponents of chivalry such as Mark and Claudas, and she enlists the help of the latter in her failed attempt to eliminate the Lady of the Lake.[83]/nMorgan uses her skills in her dealings, amorous or otherwise, with several of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. It applies in particular to the greatest of them all, Lancelot, whom she alternately tries to seduce and to expose as Guinevere's adulterous lover. Her magic aside, Lancelot is always disempowered in his dealings with Morgan as he could never hurt a woman, which, coupled with her being his king's kin, made the Vulgate's Morgan a perfect foil for Lancelot as \"the woman he most feared in the world.\"[7][85] As told in the Prose Lancelot, they first meet in her magical domain known as the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return), serving as an enchanted prison for false lovers since she took an unnamed knight as her lover but then discovered  his affair with another woman.[7] There, Lancelot frees the 250 unfaithful knights entrapped by Morgan, including her former lover Guiomar whom she has turned to stone for his infidelity,[42] but Morgan then captures Lancelot himself under her spell, using a magic ring and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would then go mad or die of sorrow. She also otherwise torments Guinevere, causing her great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring that protects her from Morgan's power.[86] Since then, Lancelot becomes Morgan's prime object of sexual desire but he consistently refuses her obsessive advances due to his great love of Guinevere, even as Morgan repeatedly courts, drugs, enchants or imprisons the knight. Their one-sided relationship (as well as interactions between her and Arthur[7]) may evoke that of the goddess Morr\u00edgan and the Celtic hero C\u00fa Chulainn.[87] One time, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Gawain when he promises to come back (but also keeping him the company of the most beautiful of her maidens to do \"whatever she could to entice him\"), and he keeps his word and does return; she eventually releases him altogether after over a year, when his health falters and he is near death.[88] On another occasion, Lancelot captured in Cart Castle (Charyot) by Morgan and her fellow magical queens, each of whom tries to make Lancelot her lover; he refuses to choose either of them and escapes with the help of one of their maidservants, Rocedon.[42]/nAnother of Morgan's illicit love subjects is the rescued-but-abducted young Cornish knight Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin), a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy from a later addition in the Prose Tristan as well as the Proph\u00e9ties de Merlin, whom she promises to heal but he vows to castrate himself rather than to pleasure her. Nevertheless, Alexander promises to defend her castle of Fair Guard (Belle Garde), where he has been held, for a year and a day, and then dutifully continues to guard it even after the castle gets burned down;[42][89] this eventually leads to his death.[34] Morgan's other fancied good knights include Alexander's relative Tristan, but her interest in him turns into burning hatred of him and his true love Isolde after he kills her lover as introduced in the Prose Tristan. In this story, Morgan's paramours include Huneson the Bald (Hemison in Malory's version) who is mortally wounded when he attacks the great Cornish knight out of his jealously for her attention; the knight soon dies after returning to her, and the anguished Morgan buries him in a grand tomb. In one variation, Morgan then takes revenge as she takes possession of the lance that was used to kill Huneson, enchants it, and sends it to King Mark of Cornwall, her possible lover,[90] who years later uses it to slay Tristan.[42]/nIn the Prose Tristan, wherein Morgan presents herself as Arthur's full sister,[7] she delivers by Lamorak to Arthur's court a magical drinking horn from which no unfaithful lady can drink without spilling, hoping to disgrace Guinevere by revealing her infidelity, but it is Isolde whose adultery is disclosed instead. With same intent, when Tristan was to be Morgan's champion at a jousting tournament, she also gives him an enchanted shield depicting Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot to deliver to Camelot in the Prose Tristan.[86] In the Vulgate Queste, after Morgan hosts her nephews Gawain, Mordred and Gaheriet to heal them, Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there. Morgan shows it to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they decide not to do this.[91]/nIt is said that Morgan concentrates on witchcraft to such degree that she goes to live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess (Morgain-la-d\u00e9esse, Morgue la dieuesse).[29][30][83] In the Post-Vulgate version of Queste del Saint Graal, Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still will be able to control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere.[92] In one of her castles, Tugan in Garlot, Morgan has hidden a magic book given to her by Merlin, which actually prophesied the deaths of Arthur and Gawain and who would kill them, but no one can read this passage without dying instantly.[42][78] In the Vulgate La Mort le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just the Mort Artu), Morgan ceases troubling Arthur and vanishes for a long time, and the king assumes her to be dead. One day, he and Sagramor wander into Morgan's incredibly beautiful castle while lost in a forest, where Arthur is received extremely well and instantly reconciles with his sister. Overjoyed with their reunion, the king allows Morgan to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon, \"where the women live who know all the world's magic,\" so she can dwell there with these (unspecified) other sorceresses.[93]/nHowever, disaster strikes Arthur when the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces him about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. At the end of the Vulgate Mort Artu, Morgan is the only one who is recognised among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest and possible revival in Avalon. Depending on the manuscript, she is either the leading lady (usually, being recognised by Griflet as the one holding Arthur's hand as he enters the boat), a subordinate to another who is unnamed, or neither of them are superior.[94] The latter part of the Post-Vulgate versions of Queste and Mort both seem to revert to Morgan's friendly attitude toward Arthur from the end of the Vulgate Cycle, despite the Post-Vulgate' own characterisation of Morgan as thoroughly evil and the earlier fierce hostility between them. As Arthur steps into her boat after Camlann but assures he is not going to return, she makes no mention of Avalon or her intentions when taking him away. His supposed grave is later said to be found mysteriously empty but for his helmet.[7] (Spanish poem La Faula has Morgan explain that by saying the tomb's purpose was to prevent knights from searching for Arthur.[95])/nMiddle English writer Thomas Malory follows the portrayals of Morgan from the Old French prose cycles in his late-15th-century seminal work of the selective compilation book Le Morte d'Arthur (The Death of Arthur), though he reduces her in role and detail of characterisation, in particular either removing or limiting her traditions of healing and prophecy, and making her more consistently and inherently evil just as he makes Merlin more good.[7] He also diminishes Morgan's conflict with Guinevere, as there is no motif of Guiomar and Accolon is her first named lover (appearing as Accolon of Gaul in a much abbreviated version of his story[5]), but does not clarify Morgan's motivations for her antagonistic behaviour against Arthur.[60][82] Malory scholar Elizabeth Sklar described Morgan's character here as \"an essentially sociopathic personality, respecting no boundaries and acknowledging no rules save those dictated by her own ambitions, envy, and lust.\"[98] Up until the war between Arthur and Lancelot and the rebellion of Mordred, it is Morgan who remains the main and constant source of direct and indirect threat to the realm.[60] According to Corinne Saunders, Malory's \"Morgan is also characterized as following the pattern of the otherworldly ruler who wishes both to destroy and to possess bodies\" of knights through sex and manipulation.[5] As noted by Mary Lynn Saul: \"Curiously, in spite of all her powers, Morgan is rarely successful in any of her plots. Nevertheless, she remains a medieval symbol of the potential danger of uncontrolled female power.\"[99] Some modern researchers attribute Malory's \"personal misogyny\"[100] to his portrayal of Morgan as well as women in general./nIn Malory's backstory, Morgan has studied astrology as well as nigremancie (which might actually mean black magic in general rather than \"necromancy\"[101]) in the nunnery where she was raised, before being married to Urien (Uriens) as a young teenager; in this narrative she did not study with Merlin.[60] Unlike Malory's good sorceress Nimue, Morgan deals mostly in \"black\" rather than \"white\" magic, employed usually through enchantments and potions.[5] Her powers, however, seem to be inspired by fairy magic of Celtic folklore rather than by medieval Christian demonology.[34] Malory mentions Arthur's attempts to conquer at least one of her castles, which originally had been his own gift to her, and which he could not retake (apparently due to magical defences[99]). She also plots an elaborate ambush in \"The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyons\", after learning of the death of one of her favourites in a tournament, but Tristan ends up killing or routing thirty of her knights when the ambush ends in a disaster. Morgan is widely feared and hated, so much that \"many knights wished her burnt.\" She is now the leader of the four (not three) witch queens who capture Lancelot (the others being the Queen of the Northgales, the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Outer Isles). In an episode that had been first introduced by the anonymous writer of the earlier Prose Lancelot, Lancelot rescues Elaine of Corbenic from being trapped in an enchanted boiling bath by Morgan and the Queen of the Northgales, both envious of Elaine's great beauty (echoing Circe's treatment of Scylla[7]). Malory also reused the magic mantle assassination plot from the Huth Merlin in a slightly modified form, resulting in Morgan's damsel instantly burnt to cinders by its curse when she is forced to take it on. However, despite all of their prior hostility towards each other and her numerous designs directed against Arthur personally (and his own promise to get a terrible revenge on her as long as he lives[60]), Malory's Morgan is still redeemed and is one of the four grieving enchantress queens (the others being Nimue, marking the end of conflict between her and Morgan,[102] and two of Morgan's allies, the Queen of the Northgales and the Queen of the Wasteland) who arrive in a black boat to transport the wounded king to Avalon in the end. Unlike in the French and earlier stories on which Le Morte d'Arthur is based, and where Morgan and Arthur usually would either have first made peace or have just never fought to begin with, here her change of attitude towards him is sudden and unexplained (similar to the Post-Vulgate).[4][60][103] Arthur is last seen in Morgan's lap, with her lament of sorrow referring to him as her \"dear brother\" (dere brothir), as they disappear from the work's narrative together./nIn the c. 1400 English poem Alliterative Morte Arthure, Morgan  appears in Arthur's dream as Lady Fortune (that is, the goddess Fortuna) with the Wheel of Fortune to warn Arthur prior to his fatal final battle, foretelling his death.[104][105] She also appears in some other English texts, such as the early-13th-century Anglo-Norman Roman de Waldef where she is only \"name-dropped\" as a minor character.[106] Middle English romance Arthour and Merlin, written around 1270, casts a villainous Morgan in the role of the Lady of the Lake and gives her a brother named Morganor as an illegitimate son of King Urien; her wondrous castle Palaus is built mostly of crystal and glass.[42] Conversely, a 14th-century Middle English version of the Vulgate Mort Artu known as the Stanzaic Morte Arthur makes Morgan an unquestionably good sister of Arthur, concerned only about his honour in regard to the affair of Lancelot and Guinevere. Entering her boat (she is not named in the scene, but addresses him as her brother), Arthur believes he is going to be healed, yet his tomb is later discovered by Bedivere.[7]/nAt the end of the 14th-century Middle English romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, one of the best-known Arthurian tales, it is revealed that the entire Green Knight plot has been instigated by Gawain's aunt, the goddess[107] Morgan le Fay (Morgue la Faye, Morgne \u00fee goddes[30]), whose prior mentorship by Merlin is mentioned.[108] Here, she is an ambiguous trickster[34] who takes an appearance of an elderly woman (contrasting from the beautiful Lady Bertilak in a role evoking the loathly lady tradition[109]), as a test for Arthur and his knights and to frighten Guinevere to death. Morgan's importance to this particular narrative has been disputed and called a deus ex machina[110] and simply an artistic device to further connect Gawain's episode to the Arthurian legend, but some regard her as a central character and the driving force of the plot.[27][73] Opinions are also divided regarding Morgan's intentions and whether she succeeds or fails,[111] and how the story's shapeshifting and enigmatic Morgan might be, or might be not, also Lady Bertilak herself.[103]/nMorgan further turns up frequently throughout the Western European literature of the High and Late Middle Ages, as well as of the Renaissance. She appears in a variety of roles, generally appearing in works related to the literary cycles of Arthur (the Matter of Britain) or Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and written mostly in various Romance languages and dialects, especially still in France but also in Italy, Spain and elsewhere. In the case of Spain, even public edicts dating from the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century tell of the belief in Morgan continuing to enchant and imprison people at Tintagel and in \"the Valley of False Trickery\".[112]/nLater standalone romances often feature Morgan as a lover and benefactor of various heroes, and yet she can also be their opponent, especially when abducting those who turned down her amorous offers or working to separate true lovers. Such texts may also introduce her additional offspring or alternate siblings, or connect her closer with the figure of the Lady of the Lake. For instance, the fairy queen Lady Morgan (Dame Morgue, Morgue li fee) shows up in Adam de la Halle's late-13th-century French farce Jeu de la feuill\u00e9e, in which she visits a contemporary Arras.[113] She arrives accompanied by two of her fay sisters named Arsile and Maglore to dispense enchantment gifts to and curses upon several characters including the author himself, and in the course of the story reverts her love interest in the local mortal (and unfaithful) knight Robert to her previous lover Hellequin (Hellekin), a demonic prince of Faerie who has been trying to woo her back.[114][115] Hellequin's character in this case may be connected in some way to Arthur, who like him sometimes also figures as the leader of the Wild Hunt.[116][117] In Thomas III of Saluzzo's Le Chevalier Errant, the fairy Morgan (la f\u00e9e Morgane) holds the eponymous Wandering Knight captive inside a magnificent castle in her forest realm Pa\u00efenie ('Pagania'), until messengers from her brother Arthur arrive with a request to lift her enchantment and let him go, to which she agrees.[118] Loosely drawing from the Vulgate Cycle, the Old French anonymous Li Romans de Claris et Laris better known as just Claris and Laris (c. 1270),[119] has its  Morgan (Morgane la Faye) as a fairy sister of Arthur as well as a former pupil of the Lady of Lake, Viviane. Ever lascivious and sexual, Morgan lives in a splendid enchanted castle in the wilderness (identified as Broc\u00e9liande in a later manuscript) with twelve other beautiful fairy ladies including the sorceress Madoine.[29][120][121] There, they lure and ensnare many hundreds of young and attractive knights, who then spend the rest of their lives in the palace:/nMorgana made several conquests, and of course, many enemies amongst the damsels who found themselves forsaken by their disloyal Knights. The fairy gave proofs of her partial preference to the great Lancelot of the Lake, which Genievre, Arthur's beauteous consort, bore very impatiently. At last, whether she took a dislike to the court, or the court to her, she thought proper to retire to the forest we speak of; where, at her command, her invisible agents erected an enchanted palace. She was followed in her delicious retreats by young and beautiful Varlets, Esquires, and as many Knights as preferred the inglorious, but delightful pleasures that awaited them with Morgana, to the honourable toils of knight-errantry. The fairy was also constantly attended by spirits, and other familiars, who gave her an exact account of what passed within a certain distance from her palace, and assisted her in inveigling every traveller whom she best thought worth her notice./n1780 English translation by Lewis Porney[122]/nA human Morgan is named Dioneta in the 14th-century Welsh fragment known as The Birth of Arthur, where she is a sister of both Gwyar (Morgause) and Gwalchmei (Gawain), as well as of the other sisters Gracia and Graeria, and is sent off by Uther to Avallach (Avalon).[124] The island of Avalon is often described as an otherworldly place ruled by Morgan in other later texts from all over Western Europe, especially these written in Iberia. In the 14th-century French Crusadic fantasy Le B\u00e2tard de Bouillon, the island kingdom of Arthur and his fairy sister Morgan the Beautiful is hidden by a cloud in the Red Sea,[125] where it is visited by King Bauduins (Baldwin II of Jerusalem). In his 14th-century Catalan poem La faula, Guillem de Torroella writes about having visited the Enchanted Isle and met Arthur who has been brought back to life by the fay Morgan (Morgan la feya, Morguan la fea)[29] and they both are now forever young due to the power of the Holy Grail.[126] In the 15th-century Valencian romance Tirant lo Blanc, the noble Queen Morgan searches the world for her missing brother. Finally finding him entranced in Constantinople, Morgan brings Arthur back to his senses by removing Excalibur from his hands, after which they celebrate and leave to Avalon.[127][128] The Castilian Arderique begins where the Mort Artu ends, that is with the departure and disappearance of Arthur and his sister Morgaina, described there as a fairy necromancer, after the battle with Mordred.[129] Another Spanish work, Francisco de Enciso Z\u00e1rate's Florambel de Lucea (1532), features a later appearance of Arthur together with his sister Morgaina, \"better known as Morgana the fairy\" (fada Morgana), who explains how she saved her brother and gifts Excalibur to the eponymous hero Florambel.[130][131] In Trist\u00e1n de Leonis, Morgana offers her love to Tristan.[132] In the rondalla ('folk tale' in Catalan) La fada Morgana, the protagonist Joana ends up marrying the fairy queen Morgana's son named Beuteusell after passing his mother's test with his help.[133][134]/nIn the legends of Charlemagne, she is associated with the Danish legendary hero and one of the Paladins, Ogier the Dane: following his initial epics, when he is 100 years old, the fairy queen Morgan restores him to his youthful form but removes his memory, then takes him to her mystical island palace in Avalon (where Arthur and Gawain are also still alive) to be her lover for 200 years. She later protects him during his adventures in the mortal world as he defends France from Muslim invasion, before his eventual return to Avalon.[135] In some accounts, Ogier begets her two sons, including Marlyn (Meurvin).[42][136] In the 14th-century pseudo-chronicle Ly Myreur des Histors written by the French-Belgian author Jean d'Outremeuse, one of their sons is a giant[29] and they live in a palace made of jewels.[59] In the 13th-century chanson de geste story of another Paladin, Huon of Bordeaux, Morgan is a protector of the eponymous hero and the mother of the fairy king Oberon by none other than Julius Caesar.[137] In the 14th-century Ogier le Danois, a prose redaction of the epic poem Roman d'Ogier, Morgue la F\u00e9e lives in her palace in Avalon together with Arthur and Oberon, who both seem to be her brothers.[42][138] Variants of Ogier's and Huon's stories typically involve Morgan, Arthur, and Oberon (Auberon) all living in a fairyland where time passes much slower than in human world. Such works include the 14th century's French Tristan de Nanteuil and the Chanson de Lion de Bourges, the 15th-century French Mabrien,[139][140] and John Bourchier's 16th-century English The Boke of Duke Huon of Burdeux in which Arthur's sister Morgan is mother of not Oberon but Merlin.[141] In another French chanson de geste, the early-13th-century La Bataille Loquifer, the fays[29] Morgan (Morgue) and her sister Marsion (Marrion) bring the Saracen hero Renoart (Renouart, Rainouart) to Avalon, where Arthur is the king. Renoart falls in love with Morgan and impregnates her with his illegitimate son named Corbon (Corbans), \"a live devil who did nothing but evil.\"[42][140] When Renoart jilts her and escapes to rescue his other son Maileffer, Morgan sends her demonic monster servant Kapalu (character derived from the Welsh legends' Cath Palug[142]) after him; the shipwrecked Renoart ends up luckily rescued by a mermaid./nThe 14th-century Italian romance titled La Pulzella Gaia (The Merry Maiden)[143] features the titular beautiful young fairy daughter of Morgana (Italian version of Morgan's name, here too also a sister of the Lady of the Lake) with Hemison. In her own tale, Morgana's daughter defeats Gawain (Galvano) in her giant serpent form before becoming his lover; she and her fairy army then save Gawain from the jealous Guinevere, who wants Gawain dead after having been spurned by him. She then herself is imprisoned in a magical torment in her mother's glass-and-diamond magical castle Pela-Orso, because of how Morgana wanted to force her to marry Tristan. Eventually, Gawain storms the castle after three years of siege and frees her from a cursed dungeon, also capturing her tyrannical mother for the same punishment.[144][145] The 15th-century Italian compilation of Arthur and Tristan legends, La Tavola Ritonda (The Round Table), too makes Morgan a sister to the Lady of the Lake as well as to Arthur (about the fate of whom it says Morgan \"brought him away to a little island in the sea; and there he died of his wounds, and the fairy buried him on that island\"[146]). It is based on the French prose romances, but here Morgan is a prophetic figure whose main role is to ensure the fulfilment of fate.[90] Her daughter also appears, as Gaia Donzella, in the Tavola Ritonda, where she is kidnapped by the knight Burletta of the Desert (Burletta della Diserta) who wants to rape her but she is rescued by Lancelot. The Italian Morgana appears in a number of cantari poems of the 14th to 15th century. Some of these are original new episodes, such as the Cantari di Tristano group's Cantare di Astore e Morgana, in which Morgana heals the wounded Hector de Maris (Astore) but turns him evil, and gives him an armour made in Hell as well as a magical ship in her revenge plot against Gawain as well as Arthur himself, and the Cantari del Falso Scudo that features her evil fairy son, the Knight of the False Shield, who ends up slain by Galahad. Other include Lasencis, a standalone version of the Tavola Ritonda story of the eponymous Corsican knight armed by Morgan with enchanted weapons to avenge his brother killed by Lancelot, and a yet another telling of the familiar story of Morgana's good fairy daughter titled the Ponzela Gaia.[147][148][149][150][151] Evangelista Fossa combined and retold some of those in his Innamoramento di Galvano (Gawain Falling in Love, c. 1494).[152]/nMorgan le Fay, or Fata Morgana in Italian, has been in particular associated with Sicily as a location of her enchanted realm in the mythological landscape of medieval Europe (at least since the Norman conquest of southern Italy),[153] and local folklore describes her as living in a magical castle located at or floating over Mount Etna.[42] As such she gave her name to the form of mirage common off the shores of Sicily, the Fata Morgana, since the 14th century.[153][154] References linking Avalon to Sicily can be found in Otia Imperialia (c. 1211) and La faula, as well as in Breton and Proven\u00e7al literature, for example in the aforementioned Jaufre and La Bataille Loquifer. The 13th-century Chr\u00e9tien-inspired romance Floriant et Florete places Morgan's secret mountain castle of Mongibel (also Montgibel or Montegibel, derived from the Arabic name for Etna), where, in the role of a fairy godmother, Morgane and two other fays[29] spirit away and raises Floriant, a son of a murdered Sicilian king and the hero of the story. Floriant, with the help of her magic ship, eventually reunites with Morgane at her castle when he returns there with his wife Florete.[42] The 15th-century French romance La Chevalier du Papegau (The Knight of the Parrot) gives Morgaine the Fairy of Montgibel (Morgaine, la f\u00e9e de Montgibel, as she is also known in Floriant et Florete)[155] a sister known as the Lady Without Pride (la Dame sans Orgueil), whom Arthur saves from the evil Knight of the Wasteland (similar to the story in the Tavola Ritonda). Meanwhile, the Fastnachtspiel (Ain Hupsches Vasnacht Spill von K\u00fcnig Artus), a German retelling of the enchanted horn episode, moved Morgan's Mediterranean Sea island domain to the east of Sicily, referring to her only as the Queen of Cyprus.[156]/nDuring the Italian Renaissance, Morgan has been primarily featured in relation to the cycle of epic poems of Orlando (based on Roland of the historical Charlemagne). In Matteo Maria Boiardo's late-15th-century Orlando Innamorato, fata Morgana (initially as lady Fortune[157]) is beautiful but wicked fairy enchantress, a sister of King Arthur and a pupil of Merlin. Morgana lives in her paradise-like garden in a crystal cavern under a lake, plotting to eventually destroy the entire world. There, she abducts her favourites until she is thwarted by Orlando who defeats, chases and captures Morgana, destroying her underwater prison and letting her keep only one of her forced lovers, a knight named Ziliante.[158] In Ludovico Ariosto's continuation of this tale, Orlando Furioso (1532), Morgana is revealed as a twin sister of two other sorceresses, the good Logistilla and the evil Alcina; Orlando again defeats Morgana, rescuing Ziliante who has been turned into a dragon, and forces Morgana to swear by her lord Demogorgon to abandon her plots. The story also features the medieval motif where uses a magic horn to convince Arthur of the infidelity of his queen (Geneura), here successfully. Bernardo Tasso's L'Amadigi (1560) further introduces Morgana's three daughters: Carvilia, Morganetta, and Nivetta, themselves temptresses of knights.[159] Morgan's other 16th-century appearances include these of Morgue la f\u00e9e in Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais' French satirical fantasy novel Les grandes chroniques du grand et \u00e9norme g\u00e9ant Gargantua et il publie Pantagruel (1532)[160] and of the good Morgana in Erasmo di Valvasone's Italian didactic poem La caccia (1591).[161] In Edmund Spenser's English epic poem The Faerie Queene (1590), Argante (Layamon's name for Morgan) is lustful giantess queen of the \"secret Ile\", evoking the Post-Vulgate story of Morgan's kidnapping of Sir Alexander. It also features three other counterpart characters: Acrasia, Duessa, and Malecasta, all representing different themes from Malory's description of Morgan.[162] Morgan might have also inspired the characters of the healer Loosepaine and the fay Oriande in the Scots language poem Greysteil,[163] possibly originally written in 15th-century England./nThe character Morgan le Fay has become ubiquitous in Arthurian works of the modern era, spanning fantasy, historical fiction and other genres across various mediums, especially since the mid-20th century.[164]", "25616731": "Vinzenz Bronzin (born 1872 in Rovigno \u2013 died 1970 in Trieste) was an Italian mathematics professor, known today for an early (\"rediscovered\") option pricing formula, similar to, and predating, the Black\u2013Scholes 1973 formula;\n[1] \nhe also provided a formulation of put\u2013call parity, \n[2] \nwritten up formally only in 1969 by Stoll.\n[3]/nBronzin was born in Rovigno (now Rovinj), Istria. \nHe studied engineering at the Vienna Polytechnic Institute, and then mathematics and pedagogics at the University of Vienna. \nHe was made a professor at the Accademia di Commercio e Nautica, Trieste, Italy, in 1900;\nhis focus was \"Political and Commercial Arithmetic\", which included actuarial science and probability theory.\nIn 1910 he accepted the position of director. \nIn 1937 he resigned from all of his positions at the Academia at the age of 65.[4]/nIn 1908 Bronzin published his Theorie der Pr\u00e4miengesch\u00e4fte (German: \"Theory of Premium Contracts\") discussing a then current type of option contract. \nAlmost every element of modern option pricing can be found in Bronzin\u2019s book;[5] \nhowever, like Louis Bachelier's now famous dissertation (1900), the work seems to have been forgotten shortly after it was published.\nBronzin\u2019s \"methodological setup is completely different from Bachelier\u2019s,\"[6] at least in terms of the underlying stochastic framework;  \nhe takes a much more \"pragmatic\" approach, directly making assumptions on the share price distribution at maturity, and deriving a \"rich set of closed form solutions for the value of options.\"/nThis article about an Italian mathematician is a stub.

He is now probably best known for helping to instigate the Longitude Act in 1714 (and his attempts to win the rewards that it promised) and his important translations of the Antiquities of the Jews and other works by Josephus (which are still in print).  He was a prominent exponent of Arianism and wrote A New Theory of the Earth./nWhiston succeeded his mentor Newton as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. In 1710 he lost the professorship and was expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views. Whiston rejected the notion of eternal torment in hellfire, which he viewed as absurd, cruel, and an insult to God. What especially pitted him against church authorities was his denial of the doctrine of the Trinity, which he believed had pagan origins./nWhiston was born to Josiah Whiston (1622\u20131685) and Katherine Rosse (1639\u20131701) at Norton-juxta-Twycross, in Leicestershire, where his father was rector.  His mother was daughter of the previous rector at Norton-juxta-Twycross, Gabriel Rosse.  Josiah Whiston was a presbyterian, but retained his rectorship after the Stuart Restoration in 1660.  William Whiston was educated privately, for his health, and so that he could act as amanuensis to his blind father.[1][2] He studied at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School at Tamworth, Staffordshire. After his father's death, he entered Clare College, Cambridge as a sizar in 1686. He applied himself to mathematical study, was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA) (1690), and AM (1693), and was elected Fellow in 1691 and probationary senior Fellow in 1693.[1][3]/nWilliam Lloyd ordained Whiston at Lichfield in 1693. In 1694, claiming ill health, he resigned his tutorship at Clare to Richard Laughton, chaplain to John Moore, the bishop of Norwich, and swapped positions with him. He now divided his time between Norwich, Cambridge and London. In 1698 Moore gave him the living of Lowestoft where he became rector. In 1699 he resigned his Fellowship of Clare College and left to marry.[1]/nWhiston first met Isaac Newton in 1694 and attended some of his lectures, though he first found them, by his own admission, incomprehensible.  Encouraged after reading a paper by David Gregory on Newtonian philosophy, he set out to master Newton's Principia mathematica thereafter.  He and Newton became friends.[1] In 1701 Whiston resigned his living to become Isaac Newton's substitute, giving the Lucasian lectures at Cambridge.[2] He succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor in 1702. There followed a period of joint research with Roger Cotes, appointed with Whiston's patronage to the Plumian professorship in 1706. Students at the Cotes\u2013Whiston experimental philosophy course included Stephen Hales, William Stukeley, and Joseph Wasse.[4]/nIn 1707 Whiston was Boyle lecturer; this lecture series was at the period a significant opportunity for Newton's followers, including Richard Bentley and Samuel Clarke, to express their views, especially in opposition to the rise of deism.[5] The \"Newtonian\" line came to include, with Bentley, Clarke and Whiston in particular, a defence of natural law by returning to the definition of Augustine of Hippo of a miracle (a cause of human wonderment), rather than the prevailing concept of a divine intervention against nature, which went back to Anselm. This move was intended to undermine arguments of deists and sceptics.[6] The Boyle lectures dwelt on the connections between biblical prophecies, dramatic physical events such as floods and eclipses, and their explanations in terms of science.[7] On the other hand, Whiston was alive to possible connections of prophecy with current affairs: the War of the Spanish Succession, and later the Jacobite rebellions.[8]/nWhiston supported a qualified biblical literalism: the literal meaning should be the default, unless there was a good reason to think otherwise.[9] This view again went back to Augustine. Newton's attitude to the cosmogony of Thomas Burnet reflected on the language of the Genesis creation narrative; as did Whiston's alternative cosmogony. Moses as author of Genesis was not necessarily writing as a natural philosopher, nor as a law-giver, but for a particular audience.[10] The new cosmogonies of Burnet, Whiston and John Woodward were all criticised for their disregard of the biblical account, by John Arbuthnot, John Edwards and William Nicolson in particular.[11]/nThe title for Whiston's Boyle lectures was The Accomplishment of Scripture Prophecies. Rejecting typological interpretation of biblical prophecy, he argued that the meaning of a prophecy must be unique. His views were later challenged by Anthony Collins.[12] There was a more immediate attack by Nicholas Clagett in 1710.[13] One reason prophecy was topical was the Camisard movement that saw French exiles (\"French prophets\") in England. Whiston had started writing on the millenarianism that was integral to the Newtonian theology, and wanted to distance his views from theirs, and in particular from those of John Lacy.[14] Meeting the French prophets in 1713, Whiston developed the view that the charismatic gift of revelation could be demonic possession.[15]/nIt is no longer assumed that Whiston's Memoirs are completely trustworthy on the matter of his personal relations with Newton. One view is that the relationship was never very close, Bentley being more involved in Whiston's appointment to the Lucasian chair; and that it deteriorated as soon as Whiston began to write on prophecy, publishing Essay on the Revelation of St John (1706).[14] This work proclaimed the millennium for the year 1716.[16]/nWhiston's 1707 edition of Newton's Arithmetica Universalis did nothing to improve matters. Newton himself was heavily if covertly involved in the 1722 edition, nominally due to John Machin, making many changes.[17]/nIn 1708\u20139 Whiston was engaging Thomas Tenison and John Sharp as archbishops in debates on the Trinity. There is evidence from Hopton Haynes that Newton reacted by pulling back from publication on the issue;[18] his antitrinitarian views, from the 1690s, were finally published in 1754 as An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture./nWhiston was never a Fellow of the Royal Society. In conversation with Edmond Halley he blamed his reputation as a \"heretick\". Also, though, he claimed Newton had disliked having an independent-minded disciple; and was unnaturally cautious and suspicious by nature.[19]/nWhiston's route to rejection of the Nicene Creed, the historical orthodox position against Arianism, began early in his tenure of the Lucasian chair as he followed hints from Samuel Clarke. He read also in Louis Ellies Dupin, and the Explication of Gospel Theism (1706) of Richard Brocklesby.[20] His study of the Apostolic Constitutions then convinced him that Arianism was the creed of the early church.[2]/nThe general election of 1710 brought the Tories solid political power for a number of years, up to the Hanoverian succession of 1714. Their distrust of theological innovation had a direct impact on Whiston, as well as others of similar views. His heterodoxy was notorious.[21] In 1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled from the university.[2]/nThe matter was not allowed to rest there: Whiston tried to get a hearing before Convocation. He did have defenders even in the high church ranks, such as George Smalridge.[22] For political reasons, this development would have been divisive at the time. Queen Anne made a point of twice \"losing\" the papers in the case.[23] After her death in 1714 the intended hearing was allowed to drop.[24] The party passions of these years found an echo in Henry Sacheverell's attempt to exclude Whiston from his church of St Andrew's, Holborn, taking place in 1719.[24][25]/nWhiston founded a society for promoting primitive Christianity, lecturing in support of his theories in halls and coffee-houses at London, Bath, and Tunbridge Wells.[2] Those he involved included Thomas Chubb,[26] Thomas Emlyn,[27] John Gale,[28] Benjamin Hoadley,[29] Arthur Onslow,[29] and Thomas Rundle.[30] There were meetings at Whiston's house from 1715 to 1717; Hoadley avoided coming, as did Samuel Clarke, though invited.[31] A meeting with Clarke, Hoadley, John Craig and Gilbert Burnet the younger had left these leading latitudinarians unconvinced about Whiston's reliance on the Apostolical Constitutions.[32]/nFranz Wokenius wrote a 1728 Latin work on Whiston's view of primitive Christianity.[33] His challenge to the teachings of Athanasius meant that Whiston was commonly considered heretical on many points. On the other hand, he was a firm believer in supernatural aspects of Christianity. He defended prophecy and miracle. He supported anointing the sick and touching for the king's evil. His dislike of rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of Hoadley's Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament. He was fervent in his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline, derived from the Apostolical Constitutions.[2]/nAround 1747, when his clergyman began to read the Athanasian Creed, which Whiston did not believe in, he physically left the church and the Anglican communion, becoming a Baptist.[2]/nBy the 1720s, some dissenters and early Unitarians viewed Whiston as a role model.[1]/nWhiston began lecturing on natural philosophy in London. He gave regular courses at coffee houses, particularly Button's, and also at the Censorium, a set of riverside meeting rooms in London run by Richard Steele.[34] At Button's, he gave courses of demonstration lectures on astronomical and physical phenomena, and Francis Hauksbee the younger worked with him on experimental demonstrations. His passing remarks on religious topics were sometimes objected to, for example by Henry Newman writing to Steele.[35][36]/nHis lectures were often accompanied by publications. In 1712, he published, with John Senex, a chart of the Solar System showing numerous paths of comets.[37] In 1715, he lectured on the total solar eclipse of 3 May 1715 (which fell in April Old Style in England); Whiston lectured on it at the time, in Covent Garden, and later, as a natural event and as a portent.[38]/nBy 1715 Whiston had also become adept at newspaper advertising.[39] He frequently lectured to the Royal Society./nIn 1714, he was instrumental in the passing of the Longitude Act, which established the Board of Longitude. In collaboration with Humphrey Ditton he published A New Method for Discovering the Longitude, both at Sea and Land,[40] which was widely referenced and discussed. For the next forty years he continued to propose a range of methods to solve the longitude reward, which earned him widespread ridicule, particularly from the group of writers known as the Scriblerians.[41][42] In one proposal for using magnetic dip to find longitude he produced one of the first isoclinic maps of southern England in 1719 and 1721. In 1734, he proposed using the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites.[43]/nWhiston's A New Theory of the Earth from its Original to the Consummation of All Things (1696) was an articulation of creationism and flood geology. It held that the global flood of Noah had been caused by a comet. The work obtained the praise of John Locke, who classed the author among those who, if not adding much to our knowledge, \"At least bring some new things to our thoughts.\"[2] He was an early advocate, along with Edmond Halley, of the periodicity of comets; he also held that comets were responsible for past catastrophes in Earth's history. In 1736, he caused widespread anxiety among London's citizens when he predicted the world would end on 16 October that year because a comet would hit the earth.[44] William Wake as Archbishop of Canterbury officially denied this prediction to calm the public./nThere was no consensus within the Newtonians as to how far mechanical causes could be held responsible for key events of sacred history: John Keill was at the opposite extreme to Whiston in minimising such causes.[45] As a natural philosopher, Whiston's speculations respected no boundary with his theological views. He saw the creation of man as an intervention in the natural order. He picked up on Arthur Ashley Sykes's advice to Samuel Clarke to omit an eclipse and earthquake mentioned by Phlegon of Tralles from future editions of Clarke's Boyle lectures, these events being possibly synchronous with Christ's crucifixion. Whiston published The Testimony of Phlegon Vindicated in 1732.[46]/nThe series of Moyer Lectures often made Whiston's unorthodox views a particular target.[47]/nWhiston held that Song of Solomon was apocryphal and that the Book of Baruch was not.[2] He modified the biblical Ussher chronology, setting the Creation at 4010\u00a0BCE.[48] He challenged Newton's system of The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728). Westfall absolves Whiston of the charge that he pushed for the posthumous publication of the Chronology just to attack it, commenting that the heirs were in any case looking to publish manuscripts of Newton, who died in 1727.[49]/nWhiston's advocacy of clerical monogamy is referenced in Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield. His last \"famous discovery, or rather revival of Dr Giles Fletcher, the Elder's,\" which he mentions in his autobiography, was the identification of the Tatars with the lost tribes of Israel.[2]/nWhiston married Ruth, daughter of George Antrobus, his headmaster at Tamworth school. He had a happy family life and died in Lyndon Hall, Rutland, at the home of his son-in-law, Samuel Barker, on 22 August 1752.[1] He was survived by his children Sarah, William, George, and John.[50]/nWhiston's later life was spent in continual controversy: theological, mathematical, chronological, and miscellaneous. He vindicated his estimate of the Apostolical Constitutions and the Arian views he had derived from them in his Primitive Christianity Revived (5 vols., 1711\u20131712). In 1713 he produced a reformed liturgy. His Life of Samuel Clarke appeared in 1730.[2]/nIn 1727 he published a two volume work called Authentik Record belonging to the Old and New Testament. This was a collection of translations and essays on various deuterocanonical books, pseudepigrapha and other essays with a translation if relevant.[2]/nWhiston translated the complete works of Josephus into English, and published them along with his own notes and dissertations under the title The Genuine Works of Flavius Josephus the Jewish Historian in 1737. This translation was based on the same Greek edition of Josephus' works used by Siwart Haverkamp in his prior translation.[51] The text on which Whiston's translation of Josephus is based is, reputedly, one which had many errors in transcription.[52] In 1745 he published his Primitive New Testament (on the basis of Codex Bezae and Codex Claromontanus).[citation needed]/nWhiston left memoirs (3 vols., 1749\u20131750).

Without resigning his other duties, he filled the directorship of the school. The school was a pioneer of its kind in the United States, and served as the model in organizing other similar schools, in consequence of which Woodward's expositions of the aims and value of manual training have had much influence in shaping the new education both inside and outside the United States. During the 1880s, the Manual Training School was the largest and most well-attended public high school in St. Louis./nThe manual training system that Woodward introduced was akin to tools training. Students learned how to use tools by shaping wood or metal, but the products they produced had no commercial value. The worth of the instruction lay mostly in mind-hand coordination.[citation needed]/nWoodward lectured extensively on manual training and his high school.

Watson Research Center, IBM, in Yorktown Heights, New York. He was the founding editor of the journal Linear Algebra and its Applications, and held several patents. He contributed to combinatorial optimization and the eigenvalue theory of graphs. Hoffman and Robert Singleton constructed the Hoffman\u2013Singleton graph, which is the unique Moore graph of degree 7 and diameter 2.[2]/nHoffman died on January 18, 2021, at the age of 96.[3][4]/nAlan Hoffman was born and raised in New York City, residing first in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and then on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, with his sister Mildred and his parents Muriel and Jesse. Alan knew from an early age that he wanted a career in mathematics. He was a good student in all disciplines, finding inspiration in both the liberal arts and the sciences. But he was enthralled by the rigor of deductive reasoning found in mathematics. He graduated from the George Washington High School in 1940 and entered Columbia University that fall, on a Pulitzer scholarship in 1940 at the age of 16./nAt Columbia, Hoffman joined the Debate Council, in part to overcome his fear of public speaking, and was active in both movements to increase American support for the Allies in the growing war against the Axis, and in the movement to have America directly enter the war. Although his coursework consisted primarily of mathematics, including small classes with luminaries in the field, he also studied philosophy, literature, and the history of governments./nWorld War II interrupted Hoffman's studies but not his interest in mathematics. He was called to service in February 1943 and served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, spending time in both Europe and the Pacific. Hoffman eloquently refers to these three years as \"the climatic event of my life, with adventure magnified by the sensibilities of youth.\"/nWhile in basic training in the anti-aircraft artillery school he considered the possibility of developing axioms for the geometry of circles. Unable to draw, he carried in his head a vision of the configurations in space \u2013 points, circles and spheres \u2013 depicting phenomena analogous to the geometry of lines. These ideas would later become the genesis of his doctoral dissertation on the foundations of inversion geometry. The experience of developing ideas in the mind rather than on paper or the chalkboard remained a practice throughout his career \u2013 a practice he did not recommend to others but which served his unique mind remarkably well./nAfter additional Army training, Hoffman became an instructor at the anti-aircraft metrology [IL1] [2] school, teaching basic trigonometry used to track balloons to plot deduce winds aloft. Following additional training in Electrical Engineering at the University of Maine and on the rudiments of long-lines telephony Hoffman was assigned to the 3186th Signal Service Battalion and sent to the European theatre in December 1944, as the war there was nearing its end. He spent a brief period in the Pacific theatre before returning home in February 1946. During his time abroad he and others taught some mathematics in small self-organized courses and he recorded his forays into circular geometry to share with faculty back at Columbia./nUpon returning to Columbia in the Fall of 1946, Hoffman was assigned to teach a mathematical survey course to the Columbia College of Pharmacy. He viewed this as an opportunity to improve his pedagogical[3] skills and determine whether the planned career in university teaching would be the most suitable choice. During that academic year, he gained confidence and skills in his teaching, crystallized his ideas on axioms for circular geometry, and proposed marriage to Esther Walker, the sister of an Army friend. Hoffman began graduate studies at Columbia, in the Fall of 1947, \"brimming with confidence.\"/nFollowing successful completion of exams and defense of his doctoral dissertation on the foundations of inversion geometry in 1950, Hoffman spent a postdoctoral year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. During this year he established a rhythm for his work, based on the mantra \"You are a mathematician, you do mathematics.\"[5]/nAt the end of the postdoctoral year, having not secured an academic appointment anywhere he would want to live, Hoffman joined the Applied Mathematics Division of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) in Washington DC. This, choice, advocated against by friends and colleagues, was fortuitous. \"The entire arc of my career is based on the experience of the five years I spent in Washington at NBS.\" Hoffman had been hired to help fulfill a contract (Project SCOOP) with the Office of the Air Controller of the United States Air Force to pursue a program of research and computing in an area he had never heard of: linear programming. Hoffman found the new (both to him and the world) subject \"a delicious combination of challenge and fun.\"/nHoffman learned linear programming from George Dantzig, who believed that their work would help organizations operate more efficiently through the use of mathematics \u2013 a concept that is now, 70 years later, continuing to be realized[IL4]. Through this work Hoffman became exposed to business concepts from management consulting, manufacturing, and finance, areas he enjoyed, but never felt fully at home in. Through Project SCOOP Hoffman became acquainted with other operations research notables such as Richard Bellman and Harold Kuhn. Although the code he wrote in 1951 \"just didn't run,\" an experience disheartening enough that he never wrote another program, Hoffman and coauthors published a paper showing, based on experiments, that the simplex method was computationally superior to its contemporary competitors. This paper contained the first computational experiments with the simplex method and serves as a model for doing computational experiments in mathematical programming./nDuring these early years at NBS Hoffman developed the first example of cycling in the simplex method, an example which appears in numerous textbooks on the subject. A short NBS technical paper, apparently not widely circulated, showed that a point which \"almost\" satisfies a set of linear inequalities is \"close: to some other point that does, under any reasonable definitions of \"almost\" and \"close.\" The implications for linear programming algorithms that consider \"lazy\" or \"soft\" constraints, or for which the constraint data (matrix coefficients and right-hand side) are subject to noise are worth considering./nHoffman was a key organizer of the influential Second Symposium in Linear Programming, held at the Bureau in January 1955. NBS's paper on the simplex method, (\"How to solve a linear programming problem,\" Proc. Second Linear Programming Symposium, 1955) was widely distributed to other groups working on their own codes for the simplex algorithm. In 2020 this paper is a fascinating glimpse into the challenges of solving linear programs on tiny (by today's standards) computers. Hoffman's work at NBS included failed attempts to use linear programming to solve a combinatorial procurement auction problem. Combinatorial auctions remain challenging to this day, due to the overwhelming computational burden associated with computing optimal solutions[IL5]. The NBS effort used an approach which resembles branch-and-bound, which is now the standard method for solving integer programming problems./nWith the German mathematician Helmut Wielandt, Hoffman used linear programming to estimate how distant the eigenvalues of one normal matrix were from the eigenvalues of another normal matrix, in terms of how distant the two matrices were from each other. The result relies on the observation that every doubly stochastic matrix is the convex hull of permutation matrices. For the Operations Research community, this result implies that for the subclass of linear programming problems which are called transportation problems, if the data (right hand side, or supply and demand values) consists of integers, then there is an optimal solution taking only integer values. The general result is known as the Hoffman-Wielandt Theorem and there are mathematicians who know Hoffman only through this result./nAt NBS Hoffman explored the connection between linear programming duality and other combinatorial problems. This led to a simple but elegant proof to the K\u00f6nig-Egerv\u00e1ry Theorem which states that for a 0-1 matrix, the maximum number of 1s that appear in different rows and columns is equal to the minimum number of rows and columns that in combination include all of the 1s in the matrix. This early work at NBS, and Hoffman's continued interest using linear equalities to prove combinatorial theorems led to collaborations with Harold Kuhn, David Gale and Al Tucker and to the birth of a subfield that later became known as polyhedral combinatorics. Hoffman was influential in later bringing Jack Edmonds to NBS (1959-1969), where the subject flourished./nWhile at NBS, Joe Kruskal and Hoffman showed that total unimodularity (the concept, not the name) provided an explanation of why some linear programs with integer data have integer solutions, and some do not. They also identified some sufficient conditions for a matrix to have the required property./nHoffman also wrote about Lipschitz conditions for systems of linear inequalities, bounds on eigenvalues of normal matrices and the properties of smooth patterns of production. In 1956, Hoffman left the Bureau and moved to England with Esther and two young daughters, Eleanor (then 2) and Elizabeth (then less than 6 months) for the glamorous role of Scientific Liaison Officer (mathematics) at the London branch of the Office of Naval Research, with the mission of reestablishing connections between American and European mathematicians. This was a year of listening and learning, establishing and renewing friendships, and of course, doing mathematics. He did mathematics across Europe, discovering on a train to Frankfurt a beautiful theorem (but a flawed proof, later corrected by Jeff Kahn) connecting a topic in algebra to his early work on the geometry of circles. Another paper produced during this period further explores consequences of total unimodularity, and introduces the concept of a circulation in a directed graph as n generalization of the concept of an s-t flow, in which two of the graph's nodes play a special role./nAs the year abroad came to a close Hoffman investigated two industrial positions in New York, one in a tiny mathematical research group at the nascent IBM Research Lab in northern Westchester county and the other teaching and providing general operations research support for GE employees at the Manhattan headquarters of the company. Hoffman choose the role in the larger, more established organization due to the location, the salary, and the opportunity to see if he, and the field of operations research could succeed in business. Hoffman found the job fascinating and, in many respects, satisfying. He was allowed by management to do mathematics, as long as it did not interfere with his assigned duties. Hoffman continued his research, most of which was orthogonal to the mission of the Management Consulting group, in an elegant office in the heart of Manhattan./nIn the summer of 1960, Hoffman participated in a summer workshop on Combinatorics hosted by the mathematics department at IBM Research. He was dazzled by the atmosphere and \"people all around doing mathematics.\"\u00a0In 1961 he accepted the invitation of Herman Goldstine, Herb Greenberg, and Ralph Gomory to join IBM Research, thinking that it would be a great place to work, but that it probably wouldn't last, and in a few years he would get a \"real job\" in academia. Although Hoffman served as a visiting or adjunct professor at Technion Israel Institute of Technology (which awarded him an honorary doctorate), Yale, Stanford (where he spent cold winters for almost a decade), Rutgers, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Yeshiva University, the New School, and the City University of New York and supervised Ph.D. dissertations at City University of New York, Stanford, Yale and Princeton, he remained a member of the Mathematics Department at IBM Research until his retirement as an IBM Fellow in 2002./nUpon joining IBM, Hoffman was one of the oldest members of the department, which was composed primarily of new Ph.D.\u2019s. Despite being a mere 11 years post-PhD, Hoffman quickly assumed the role of mentor to these young researchers, discussing their work and interest and providing guidance. He served briefly as director of the department and was appointed IBM Fellow in 1977. Over the course of his career he published upwards of 200 academic papers, more than a third of them with coauthors. His mathematical range spanned numerous areas in both Algebra and Operations Research. He co-authored papers with many of his IBM colleagues, collaborating effectively with everyone from his fellow IBM Fellows) to summer interns and postdocs. Hoffman's humor, enthusiasm for math, music and puns, kindness and generosity were appreciated by all who encountered him./nSummary of Mathematical Contributions (from his notes in Selected Papers of Alan Hoffman)[6]/nHoffman's work in Geometry, beginning with his dissertation \"On the foundations of inversion geometry,\" included proofs of properties of affine planes, and the study of points of correlation of finite projective planes, conditions on patterns of the union and intersection of cones (derived largely from his generalization of his earlier results on the rank of real matrices). He produced an alternate proof, based on axioms for certain abstract systems of convex sets, of a result (by Scarf and others) on the number of inequalities required to specify a solution to an integer programming problem. A theorem about this abstract system appears closely related to antimatroids (also known as convex geometries), although the connect has not been fully explored./nHoffman's work in combinatorics extended our understanding of several classes of graphs. A 1956 lecture by G. Haj\u00f3s on interval graphs led to Hoffman's characterization of comparability graphs, and later, through collaboration with Paul Gilmore, the GH theorem (also attributed to A. Ghouia-Houri). Motivated by Edmond's matching algorithm, Hoffman collaborated with Ray Fulkerson and M. McAndrew Hoffman to characterize sets of integers that could correspond to the degrees and bounds on each vertex-pair edge counts of such a graph. They further considered which graphs in the class of all graphs having a prescribed set of degrees and edge count bounds could be transformed by a specific set of interchanges to any other set in the class. The proofs relate intimately to an important concept of Hilbert basis. The paper on self-orthogonal Latin squares, with IBM co-authors Don Coppersmith and R. Brayton, was inspired by a request to schedule a spouse avoiding mixed doubles tournament for a local racquet club. It has the distinction of being the only paper Hoffman would discuss outside of the mathematics community./nPartially ordered sets were a frequent topic of study for Hoffman. The 1977 paper with D. E. Schwartz uses linear programming duality to generalize Green and Kleitman's 1976 generalization of Dilworth's theorem on the decomposition of partially ordered sets, in yet another example of the unifying role duality plays in many combinatorial results./nThroughout his career Hoffman sought simple elegant alternative proofs to established theorems. These alternate proofs often gave rise to generalizations and extensions. In the late 1990s he collaborated with Cao, Chv\u00e1tal and Vince to develop an alternate proof, using elementary methods rather than linear algebra or Ryser's theorem about square 0-1 matrices./nHoffman's work on matrix inequalities and eigenvalues are staples in any course on matrix theory. Of particular charm, and in keeping with his fondness for unifying approaches is his 1975 paper on Linear G-Functions. While the proof of the specified Gerschgorin Variation is longer and more complex than others, it covers all the Ostrowski variations and many additional variations as special cases./nHoffman was an encouraging elder but not an active participant in IBM's development of a series of linear and integer programming products. He did, however, continue research on combinatorial and algebraic aspects of linear programming and linear inequalities, including a delightful abstraction of linear programming duality (1963). He also continued to use properties of linear inequalities to prove (or re-prove, more elegantly) results in convexity./nA collaboration with Shmuel Winograd, also an IBM Fellow in the Mathematics department, produced an efficient algorithm for finding all shortest distances in a directed network, using pseudo-multiplication of matrices. A series of papers on lattice polyhedral (some with Don Schwarts) introduced the concept of lattice polyhedral, which gave rise to yet another instance of combinatorial duality./nFollowing a collaboration with Ray Fulkerson and Rosa Oppenheim on balanced matrices, Hoffman generalized the Ford-Fulkerson Max Flow \u2013 Min Cut result to other cases (flow at nodes, undirected arcs, etc.) by providing a proof of which all previously known instances were special cases. This paper also introduced the concept of (but again, not the name) of total dual integrality, an idea behind most uses of linear programming to prove extremal combinatorial theorems./nOver his career Hoffman studied the class of integer programming problems that were solvable by successively maximizing the variables in some order. One such instance is the complete transportation problem, in the case where the cost coefficient exhibit a particular property discovered more than a century earlier by the French Mathematician Gaspard Monge. This approach, called simply \"simple\" in the Hoffman paper, was later deemed \"greedy\" by Edmonds and Fulkerson. The Monge property gives rise to an antimatroid, and through the use of that antimatroid, Hoffman's result is easily extended to the case of incomplete transportation problems. Hoffman re-used the term \"greedy\" to describe a subclass of 0-1 matrices for which the dual linear program can be solved by the greedy algorithm for all right-hand sides and all objective functions with decreasing (in the variable index) coefficients. Together with Kolen and Sakarovitch he showed that for these matrices, the corresponding integer program has an integer optimal solution for integer data. The elegant and brief 1992 paper provides a characterization on 0-1 matrices for which packing and covering problems can be solved through a greedy approach. It provides a unification of results for shortest path and minimum spanning tree problems. His final paper on this topic \"On greedy algorithms, partially ordered sets and submodular functions,\" co-authored with Dietrich, appeared in 2003./nHoffman visited and revisited the topic of Graph Spectra, addressing the uniqueness of the triangular association scheme in a 1959 paper, Moore Graphs with diameters 2 and 3 in 1960 (with R Singleton), the polynomial of a graph in 1963, the line graph of a symmetric balanced incomplete block design (with Ray-Chaudhuri) in 1965, connections between Eigenvalues and colorings of a graph (in 1970), connections between Eigenvalues and partitionings of the edges in a Graph in 1972, and many more, including exploring properties of the edge versus path incidence matrix of series parallel graphs (related to greedy packings) with Schieber in 2002./nHoffman was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1982, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987, and to the inaugural class of INFORMS\u00a0Fellows in 2002. Over his long career, Hoffman served on the editorial board of eleven journals and as the founding editor of Linear Algebra and its Applications. In 1992, together with Phillip Wolfe (also of IBM) he was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize by ORSA and TIMS[6], predecessors of INFORMS[7]. In presenting the award George Nemhauser recognized Hoffman and Wolfe as the intellectual leaders of the mathematical programming group at IBM. He cited Hoffman for his work in combinatorics and linear programming and for his early work on the computational efficiency of the simplex method during his time at NBS. In August 2000, Hoffman was honored by the Mathematical Programming Society as one of 10 recipients (3 from IBM) of the Founders Award./nIn a biography published in an issue of Linear Algebra and its Applications dedicated to Hoffman on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday, Uriel Rothblum wrote that \"Above and beyond his scholarly and professional contributions, Hoffman has unparalleled ability to enjoy everything he does. He enjoys singing, ping pong, puns, witty stories, and -- possibly as much as anything else -- doing mathematics.\"/nEsther Hoffman died of a blood disease in summer of 1988.

P\u00e1l's outstanding mathematical abilities showed early, already in secondary school he was the best student.[1][2]/nAt the same period of time, Tur\u00e1n and P\u00e1l Erd\u0151s were famous answerers in the journal K\u00f6MaL. On 1 September 1930, at a mathematical seminar at the University of Budapest, Turan met Erd\u0151s. They would collaborate for 46 years and produce 28 scientific papers together.[3][1]/nTur\u00e1n received a teaching degree at the University of Budapest in 1933.

In 1940 Tur\u00e1n ended up in Transylvania for railway construction. Tur\u00e1n said that one day while working another prisoner addressed him by his surname, saying that he was working extremely clumsily:/nWinkler wanted to help Tur\u00e1n and managed to get him transferred to an easier job.

The soldiers questioned the mathematician and then forced him to show them the contents of his briefcase. Seeing a reprint of an article from a pre-War Soviet magazine among the papers, the soldiers immediately let the mathematician go.

S\u00f3s was sure that Tur\u00e1n was \u2018too much in love with life\u2019 and would have fallen into despair at the news of his fatal illness, and would not have been able to work properly. However, as Erd\u0151s parried, Tur\u00e1n did not lose his spirit even in the Nazi camps and came up with his brilliant theories there. Erd\u0151s deeply regretted that Tur\u00e1n had been kept unaware of his illness because he had put off certain works and books 'for later', hoping that he would soon feel better, and in the end was never able to finish them. Tur\u00e1n died in Budapest on 26 September 1976 of leukemia, aged 66.[13]:\u200a8/nTur\u00e1n worked primarily in number theory,[13]:\u200a4\u200a but also did much work in analysis and graph theory.[14]/nIn 1934, Tur\u00e1n used the Tur\u00e1n sieve to give a new and very simple proof of a 1917 result of G. H. Hardy and Ramanujan on the normal order of the number of distinct prime divisors of a number n, namely that it is very close to \n\n\n\nln\n\u2061\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ln \\ln n}\n\n. In probabilistic terms he estimated the variance from \n\n\n\nln\n\u2061\nln\n\u2061\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ln \\ln n}\n\n. Hal\u00e1sz says \"Its true significance lies in the fact that it was the starting point of probabilistic number theory\".[15]:\u200a16\u200a The Tur\u00e1n\u2013Kubilius inequality is a generalization of this work.[13]:\u200a5\u200a[15]:\u200a16/nTur\u00e1n was very interested in the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions, and he coined the term \"prime number race\" for irregularities in the distribution of prime numbers among residue classes.[13]:\u200a5\u200a With his coauthor Knapowski he proved results concerning Chebyshev's bias. The Erd\u0151s\u2013Tur\u00e1n conjecture makes a statement about primes in arithmetic progression. Much of Tur\u00e1n's number theory work dealt with the Riemann hypothesis and he developed the power sum method (see below) to help with this. Erd\u0151s said \"Tur\u00e1n was an 'unbeliever,' in fact, a 'pagan': he did not believe in the truth of Riemann's hypothesis.\"/nMuch of Tur\u00e1n's work in analysis was tied to his number theory work. Outside of this he proved Tur\u00e1n's inequalities relating the values of the Legendre polynomials for different indices, and, together with Paul Erd\u0151s, the Erd\u0151s\u2013Tur\u00e1n equidistribution inequality./nErd\u0151s wrote of Tur\u00e1n, \"In 1940\u20131941 he created the area of extremal problems in graph theory which is now one of the fastest-growing subjects in combinatorics.\" The field is known more briefly today as extremal graph theory. Tur\u00e1n's best-known result in this area is Tur\u00e1n's graph theorem, that gives an upper bound on the number of edges in a graph that does not contain the complete graph Kr as a subgraph. He invented the Tur\u00e1n graph, a generalization of the complete bipartite graph, to prove his theorem. He is also known for the K\u0151v\u00e1ri\u2013S\u00f3s\u2013Tur\u00e1n theorem bounding the number of edges that can exist in a bipartite graph with certain forbidden subgraphs, and for raising Tur\u00e1n's brick factory problem, namely of determining the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph./nTur\u00e1n developed the power sum method to work on the Riemann hypothesis.[15]:\u200a9\u201314\u200a The method deals with inequalities giving lower bounds for sums of the form/nAside from its applications in analytic number theory, it has been used in complex analysis, numerical analysis, differential equations, transcendental number theory, and estimating the number of zeroes of a function in a disk.[16]:\u200a320", "68051547": "Otto Forster (born 8 July 1937 in Munich) is a German mathematician./nForster received his Diplom in 1960 from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.

He is internationally renowned for his work on the foundations of probability, statistics, mathematical logic, and computer science.  Since the late 1970s, Martin-L\u00f6f's publications have been mainly in logic. In philosophical logic, Martin-L\u00f6f has wrestled with the philosophy of logical consequence and judgment, partly inspired by the work of Brentano, Frege, and Husserl. In mathematical logic, Martin-L\u00f6f has been active in developing intuitionistic type theory as a constructive foundation of mathematics; Martin-L\u00f6f's work on type theory has influenced computer science.[4]/nUntil his retirement in 2009,[5] Per Martin-L\u00f6f held a joint chair for Mathematics and Philosophy at Stockholm University.[6]/nHis brother Anders Martin-L\u00f6f is now emeritus professor of mathematical statistics at Stockholm University; the two brothers have collaborated in research in probability and statistics. The research of Anders and Per Martin-L\u00f6f has influenced statistical theory, especially concerning exponential families, the expectation-maximization method for missing data, and model selection.[7]/nPer Martin-L\u00f6f received his PhD in 1970 from Stockholm University, under Andrey Kolmogorov.[8]/nMartin-L\u00f6f is an enthusiastic bird-watcher; his first scientific publication was on the mortality rates of ringed birds.[9]/nIn 1964 and 1965, Martin-L\u00f6f studied in Moscow under the supervision of Andrei N. Kolmogorov. He wrote a 1966 article The definition of random sequences that gave the first suitable definition of a random sequence.[10]/nEarlier researchers such as Richard von Mises had attempted to formalize the notion of a test for randomness in order to define a random sequence as one that passed all tests for randomness; however, the precise notion of a randomness test was left vague. Martin-L\u00f6f's key insight was to use the theory of computation to define formally the notion of a test for randomness. This contrasts with the idea of randomness in probability; in that theory, no particular element of a sample space can be said to be random./nMartin-L\u00f6f randomness has since been shown to admit many equivalent characterizations \u2014 in terms of compression, randomness tests, and gambling \u2014 that bear little outward resemblance to the original definition, but each of which satisfies our intuitive notion of properties that random sequences ought to have: random sequences should be incompressible, they should pass statistical tests for randomness, and it should be impossible to make money betting on them. The existence of these multiple definitions of Martin-L\u00f6f randomness, and the stability of these definitions under different models of computation, give evidence that Martin-L\u00f6f randomness is a fundamental property of mathematics and not an accident of Martin-L\u00f6f's particular model. The thesis that the definition of Martin-L\u00f6f randomness \"correctly\" captures the intuitive notion of randomness has been called the \"Martin-L\u00f6f\u2013Chaitin Thesis\"; it is somewhat similar to the Church\u2013Turing thesis.[11]/nFollowing Martin-L\u00f6f's work, algorithmic information theory defines a random string as one that cannot be produced from any computer program that is shorter than the string (Chaitin\u2013Kolmogorov randomness); i.e. a string whose Kolmogorov complexity is at least the length of the string. This is a different meaning from the usage of the term in statistics. Whereas statistical randomness refers to the process that produces the string (e.g. flipping a coin to produce each bit will randomly produce a string), algorithmic randomness refers to the string itself. Algorithmic information theory separates random from nonrandom strings in a way that is relatively invariant to the model of computation being used./nAn algorithmically random sequence is an infinite sequence of characters, all of whose prefixes (except possibly a finite number of exceptions) are strings that are \"close to\" algorithmically random (their length is within a constant of their Kolmogorov complexity)./nPer Martin-L\u00f6f has done important research in mathematical statistics, which (in the Swedish tradition) includes probability theory and statistics./nPer Martin-L\u00f6f began bird watching in his youth and remains an enthusiastic bird-watcher.[12]  As a teenager, he published an article on estimating the mortality rates of birds, using data from bird ringing, in a Swedish zoological journal: This paper was soon cited in leading international journals, and this paper continues to be cited.[9][13]/nIn the biology and statistics of birds, there are several problems of missing data. Martin-L\u00f6f's first paper discussed the problem of estimating the mortality rates of the Dunlin species, using capture-recapture methods. The problem of determining the biological sex of a bird, which is extremely difficult for humans, is one of the first examples in Martin-L\u00f6f's lectures on statistical models./nMartin-L\u00f6f wrote a licenciate thesis on probability on algebraic structures, particularly semigroups, while a student of Ulf Grenander at Stockholm University.[14][15][16]/nMartin-L\u00f6f developed innovative approaches to statistical theory. In his paper \"On Tables of Random Numbers\", Kolmogorov observed that the frequency probability notion of the limiting properties of infinite sequences failed to provide a foundation for statistics, which considers only finite samples.[17] Much of Martin-L\u00f6f's work in statistics was to provide a finite-sample foundation for statistics./nIn the 1970s, Per Martin-L\u00f6f made important contributions to statistical theory and inspired further research, especially by Scandinavian statisticians including Rolf Sundberg, Thomas H\u00f6glund, and Steffan Lauritzen. In this work, Martin-L\u00f6f's previous research on probability measures on semigroups led to a notion of \"repetitive structure\" and a novel treatment of sufficient statistics, in which one-parameter exponential families were characterized. He provided a category-theoretic approach to nested statistical models, using finite-sample principles. Before (and after) Martin-L\u00f6f, such nested models have often been tested using chi-square hypothesis tests, whose justifications are only asymptotic (and so irrelevant to real problems, which always have finite samples).[17]/nMartin-L\u00f6f's student, Rolf Sundberg, developed a detailed analysis of the expectation-maximization (EM) method for estimation using data from exponential families, especially with missing data. Sundberg credits a formula, later known as the Sundberg formula, to previous manuscripts of the Martin-L\u00f6f brothers, Per and Anders.[18][19][20][21] Many of these results reached the international scientific community through the 1976 paper on the expectation maximization (EM) method by Arthur P. Dempster, Nan Laird, and Donald Rubin, which was published in a leading international journal, sponsored by the Royal Statistical Society.[22]/nIn philosophical logic, Per Martin-L\u00f6f has published papers on the theory of logical consequence, on judgments, etc. He has been interested in Central-European philosophical traditions, especially of the German-language writings of Franz Brentano, Gottlob Frege, and of Edmund Husserl./nMartin-L\u00f6f has worked in mathematical logic for many decades./nFrom 1968 to '69 he worked as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago where he met William Alvin Howard with whom he discussed issues related to the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence. Martin-L\u00f6f's first draft article on type theory dates back to 1971.  This impredicative theory generalized Girard's System F. However, this system turned out to be inconsistent due to Girard's paradox which was discovered by Girard when studying System U, an inconsistent extension of System F. This experience led Per Martin-L\u00f6f to develop the philosophical foundations of type theory, his meaning explanation, a form of proof-theoretic semantics, which justifies predicative type theory as presented in his 1984 Bibliopolis book, and extended in a number of increasingly philosophical texts, such as his influential On the Meanings of the Logical Constants and the Justifications of the Logical Laws./nThe 1984 type theory was extensional while the type theory presented in the book by Nordstr\u00f6m et al. in 1990, which was heavily influenced by his later ideas, intensional, and more amenable to being implemented on a computer./nMartin-L\u00f6f's intuitionistic type theory developed the notion of dependent types and directly influenced the development of the calculus of constructions and the logical framework LF. A number of popular computer-based proof systems are based on type theory, for example NuPRL, LEGO, Coq, ALF, Agda, Twelf, Epigram, and Idris./nMartin-L\u00f6f is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences[23] and of the Academia Europaea.[6]", "55927430": "Charles Thompson Sullivan, FRSC (9 September 1882, Manchester, Nova Scotia \u2013 17 September 1948, Montreal) was a Canadian mathematician./nSullivan graduated with B.A. in 1906 from Dalhousie University and was Science Master at Alberta College, Edmonton from 1906 to 1908.

The modern Complex Approximation Theory is based on Mergelyan's classical work. Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (since 1953), member of NAS ASSR (since 1956)./nThe surname \"Mergelov\" given at birth was changed for patriotic reasons to the more Armenian-sounding \"Mergelyan\" by the mathematician himself before his trip to Moscow.[1]/nHe was a laureate of the Stalin Prize (1952) and the Order of St. Mesrop Mashtots (2008). He was the youngest Doctor of Sciences in the history of the USSR (at the age of 20),[1] and the youngest corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (the title was conferred at the age of 24).[1] During his postgraduate studies, the 20-year-old Mergelyan solved one of the fundamental problems of the mathematical theory of functions, which had not been solved for more than 70 years. His theorem on the possibility of uniform polynomial approximation of functions of a complex variable is recognized by the classical Mergelyan theorem,[2] and is included in the course of the theory of functions./nAlthough he himself was not a computer designer, Mergelyan was a pioneer in Soviet computational mathematics.[3]/nSergey Mergelyan was born on 19 May 1928 in Simferopol in an Armenian family.[4] His father Nikita (Mkrtich) Ivanovich Mergelov, a former private entrepreneur (Nepman), his mother Lyudmila Ivanovna Vyrodova, the daughter of the manager of the Azov-Black Sea bank, who was shot in 1918. In 1936 Sergey's father was building a paper mill in Yelets, but soon together with his family was deported to the Siberian settlement of Narym, Tomsk Oblast. In the Siberian frost, Sergey suffered from a serious illness and narrowly survived. In 1937, the mother and son were acquitted by the court's decision and returned to Kerch, and in 1938 Lyudmila Ivanovna obtained (from the USSR Prosecutor General Andrei Yanushyevich Vyshinsky) the rehabilitation of her husband. In 1941, in connection with the offensive of the Hitler armies to the South, the Mergelov family left Kerch and settled in Yerevan.[5]/nBefore the war, Mergelyan lived in Russia, and studied at the Kerch secondary school. When at the end of 1941 his family has moved from Kerch to Yerevan, he got into a completely unfamiliar environment, he did not know Armenian at all. He studied at the Yerevan school named after Mravyan. Soon he excelled in his abilities. In 1943, Mergelyan won the first place at the republican physics and mathematics Olympiad. In 1944, at age 16, he passed the examinations via extern for grades 9-10, graduated from high school and immediately entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the Yerevan State University (YSU)./nHe drew attention to himself at the university, where he during a year passed the first and second courses, and soon began attending lectures of academician Artashes Shahinian, the founder of the Armenian mathematical school. In addition to studying and working in the seminar, Mergelyan taught in the mathematical circle at the Yerevan Palace of Pioneers. There he gave full freedom to fantasy, writing puzzles for children by conducting competitions to solve particularly difficult tasks and organizing mathematical games./nHe passed a five-year university course for three years, in the first year he studied only a few days, then via extern had passed exams and immediately switched to the second, and in 1946 he received a diploma.\nAt the same time, he restored the original surname on his father's line and received a diploma already as Sergey Nikitovich Mergelyan./nAfter YSU (1946), Mergelyan entered the postgraduate study at Steklov Institute of Mathematics to Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh. Although all his colossal employment, Keldysh paid special attention to his new graduate student. They met mainly at Keldysh's house, at 8-9 o'clock in the evening, and conducted long conversations about mathematical problems.[1]/nA thesis for the degree on physical and mathematical sciences, Mergelyan wrote for a year and a half. The defense took place in 1949 and was brilliant. After an hour and a half session, the academic council announced the awarding of a doctorate in physics and mathematics to Mergelyan. Although Mergelyan introduced to defend the Ph.D. dissertation, all three official opponents - Academician Lavrentyev, Sergey Nikolsky and Corresponding Member Alexander Gelf\u043end - petitioned the Academic Council to award him the Doctor of Science degree./nThe petition of opponents was satisfied (for this it was necessary to call the members of the scientific council, which took time), and Mergelyan became the youngest doctor of physical and mathematical sciences in the USSR at the age of 20 (at 21)./nUntil today this is a record of getting the highest scientific degree (Doctor of Science) at such a young age in former USSR and present Russia./nMergelyan graduated from Yerevan University in 1947. From 1945 to 1957 he worked at the Yerevan University, and from 1954 to 1958 and from 1964 to 1968 at the Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov./nWhen he was 24 he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, which, from the point of view of young age, is yet another absolute record among USSR scientists. He has been a symbol of a young scientist in former USSR. Indira Gandhi, among other famous people in USSR and abroad, has been a friend of Mergelyan from the early 1950s. In 1978, after her official visit to Moscow, Gandhi had also a private visit to Yerevan just as a guest of Mergelyan. In 1952 he was awarded the Stalin Prize./nMergelyan was also a talented organizer of science. He played a leading role in establishing Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (YerSRIMM). On 14 July 1956 the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (YerNIIMM) was founded\u2024 He became the first director of the institute and headed it in 1956-1960. Soon the institute became popular as the \"Mergelyan Institute\". This unofficial name is preserved and still used nowadays\u2024[6]/nIn 1961 he returned to the field of pure mathematics. He resumed work at the Moscow Steklov Mathematical Institute of Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. In 1963 he was elected Deputy Academician of the Secretary of the Department of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogolyubov). In 1964 he was appointed head of the department of complex analysis at the Mathematical Institute, the position he retained until 2002, the same year he was reinstated as a professor of the Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty of the Moscow State University./nIn 1968, he again left the post of professor of the faculty and only engaged in scientific work. Mergelyan had \"traveling permission\", and often was on foreign business trips. In 1970 he gave a presentation as a guest speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice./nMergelyan's main works include theory of functions of complex variables, theory of approximation, and theory of potential and harmonic functions. In 1951 he formulated and proved the famous result from complex analysis called Mergelyan's theorem. This solved an old classical problem. The theorem completed a long series of studies, begun in 1885, and composed of the classical results of Karl Weierstrass, Carl Runge, J. Walsh, Mikhail Lavrentyev, Mstislav Keldysh and others. The new terms \"Mergelyan's theorem\" and \"Mergelyan's sets\" found their place in textbooks and monographs on approximation theory./nSeveral years later he solved another famous problem, the Sergei Bernstein Approximation Problem. Mergelyan also has many important results in other areas of complex analysis including the theory of pointwise approximations by polynomials./nHis research was the study of the approximation of continuous functions satisfying the smoothness properties for an arbitrary set (1962) and the solution of Bernstein's approximate problem (1963). Mergelyan conducted in-depth studies and obtained valuable results in such areas as best approximation by polynomials on an arbitrary continuum, weighted approximations by polynomials on the real axis, pointwise approximation by polynomials on closed sets of the complex plane, uniform approximation by harmonic functions on compact sets and entire functions on an unbounded continuum, uniqueness harmonic functions. In the theory of differential equations, his results related to the sphere of the Cauchy problem and some other questions. Mergelyan's scientific achievements significantly contributed to the formation, development and international recognition of the Armenian mathematical school, as evidenced by the one organized in Yerevan in 1965, at the initiative and with the active participation of Sergey Mergelyan a major international conference on the theory of functions. Many prominent mathematicians of the world took part in the conference, which promoted international cooperation and further promotion of the Armenian mathematical school./nSergey Mergelyan died on 20 August 2008.

Louli\u00e9 and Sauveur joined forces to show the prince how mathematics and musical theory were inter-related. Remnants of this joint course have survived in Sauveur's manuscript treatise on the theory of music, and in Louli\u00e9's \u00c9l\u00e9ments. In the years that followed, Sauveur taught mathematics to various princes of the royal family. In 1686 he obtained the mathematics chair at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, which granted him a rare exemption: since he was incapable of reciting a speech from memory, he was permitted to read his inaugural lecture./nCirca 1694, Sauveur began working with Louli\u00e9 on \"the science of sound\", that is, acoustics. As Fontenelle put it, Sauveur laid out a vast plan that amounted to the \"discovery of an unknown country\", and that created for him a \"personal empire\", the study of \"acoustical sound\" (le son acoustique). But, as Fontenelle pointed out, \"He had neither a voice nor hearing, yet he could think only of music. He was reduced to borrowing the voice and the ear of someone else. and in return he gave hitherto unknown demonstrations to musicians.\" The Duke of Chartres did everything he could to make the undertaking successful. Sauveur's work, continued Fontenelle, resulted in \"a new musical language that was more convenient and more broad, a new system of sounds, an unusual monochord, and \u00e9chom\u00e8tre, fixed sound [le son fixe, that is, absolute frequency], the nodes of undulating strings. [...] This pushed him all the way to the music of the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Arabs, the Turks and the Persians.\"/nSauveur is known principally for his detailed studies on acoustics. Indeed, he has been credited with coining the term acoustique, which he derived from the ancient Greek word \u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, meaning \"able to be heard\". His work involved researching the correlation between frequency and musical pitch, and \u2013 putting Fontenelle's statements in modern terms \u2013 he conducted studies on subjects such as the vibrating string, tuning pitch, harmonics, ranges of voices and musical instruments, et al. He also created a measure of intervals concerning the octave. Though Marin Mersenne's 1637 theories are correct, his measurements are not very exact, and his calculation of Mersenne's laws was greatly improved by Sauveur through the use of acoustic beats and metronomes.[1] The following are some of the terms Sauveur used as logarithmic divisions:/nIn 1696, Sauveur had been elected to the French Royal Academy of Sciences and most of his work on acoustics was therefore done under its aegis. He soon ran into what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle: the musicians who were serving as his ears and voices had become exasperated at the mathematician's insistence upon using those new measuring units, arguing that they were simply too small for the human ear to distinguish and the human voice to replicate. Furthermore, they did not like the equal tuning he was proposing for instruments, nor the pa, ra, ga, so, bo, and so forth that were supposed to replace the familiar ut, re, mi, fa, sol.... (Sauveur had broken the octave into 3,010 parts.) A break took place circa 1699, and Sauveur had difficulty completing some of his experiments. Actually, Louli\u00e9 had begun going his own way by 1698, when he published a little book called the Nouveau Sist\u00e8me, which presents his work with Saveur from a musician's perspective. Louli\u00e9's surviving manuscripts round out the musician's contributions to Sauveur's project./nIt was not until 1701 that Sauveur presented the results of his research to the Academy. The presentation was studded with jibes about musicians and their closed minds. In this same presentation, he rightly criticized Louli\u00e9's practical inventions as insufficiently scientific. In 1696, Louli\u00e9 had published a description of a metronome-like instrument called the \"chronom\u00e8tre\", which Louli\u00e9 had invented with practicing musicians in mind. Now, in 1701, Sauveur focused on the shortcomings of his former colleague's device, compared with his own \u00e9chom\u00e8tre: Louli\u00e9's invention was not based on the second, and the swings of the pendulum were not related to one specific note value. In that same presentation before the Academy, Sauveur presented his own monocorde for tuning harpsichords (it was based on an octave divided into equal units composed of the tiny, precise units of his \"new system\"); and he contrasted his invention with Louli\u00e9's sonom\u00e8tre, approved by the Academy in 1699, which replicated the unequal intervals actually being used in France./nSauveur, whom a contemporary described as \"over-obliging, gentle, and humorless\", was declared a \"pensioned veteran\" of the Academy in on March 4, 1699.

After his ordination in 1904, he taught languages for a year at Duquesne University, was briefly appointed an instructor of philosophy and theology at the Ferndale Holy Ghost Seminary in Norwalk, Connecticut, and then served as the pastor of a church in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, for seven years.[2] After that assignment, he was appointed head of the Holy Ghost Apostolic College in 1916, a role he filled for fifteen years.[5]/nCallahan formally succeeded Martin Hehir as president of Duquesne University on January 4, 1931. He promptly greeted a throng of newspaper reporters by explaining his personal critique of Einstein's theory of relativity.[1][note 2] Inaugural ceremonies were held in Oakland's Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall on April 30, 1931. In his inaugural address, he set forth a theory of education that was very different from that of his predecessor. Hehir had taken a college that focused on a classical approach to education, surveyed the needs of the Catholic immigrant community in Pittsburgh, and transformed Duquesne University into a school with an emphasis on occupational training and practicality in curriculum. Callahan, on the other hand, believed that liberal education should \"lead to the possession of manners and the mental attitude of a gentleman, the complete and perfectly rounded out man of the world\".[7][note 3]/nAlthough Callahan was hand-picked for the position by Hehir, Duquesne historian Joseph Rishel calls Callahan \"an unfortunate choice\".[1] The onset of the Great Depression had a negative impact on the university's fortunes, and Callahan's impersonal and rigid administrative attitude only exacerbated the crisis. Moreover, he was uninterested in day-to-day decision making, instead outsourcing authority to the deans of the individual schools, who operated with virtual autonomy.[1] He habitually took two-month \"sabbaticals\", even in the middle of the school year, and did not associate with the other Spiritan priests living on campus\u2014he chose instead to live in a private apartment he had constructed adjoining the Administration Building.[1] His inflexible attitude was summed up by one of his confr\u00e8res in the congregation: \"Father Callahan was the one man I knew who never had a doubt\".[1]/nBy 1936, Callahan's \"disregard of constitutional safeguards\" had resulted in all-time low morale among university staff, and the bishop of Pittsburgh, as well as a number of parents, were rapidly losing confidence in his leadership.[9] Callahan had privately conceded to the demands of Father Christopher J. Plunkett, the American Provincial of the Holy Ghost Fathers, and vowed to resign after returning from his February sabbatical.[9] Indeed, his departure was covered by the Duquesne Duke, amid rumors of \"shakeups in the administration\".[9][10] Two weeks into Callahan's absence, Father H. J. Goebel, the university's vice-president and treasurer, resigned. W. S. York Critchley, a man whom Callahan had appointed to be dean of the School of Education, followed suit, as it had been revealed that his academic credentials were forged.[9]/nIn light of these scandals, Callahan announced his resignation when he arrived back in Pittsburgh in May 1936. He then promptly changed his mind.[9] Plunkett responded by firing him from the office of president, but Callahan ignored the order and simply remained in office, claiming that only the board of directors had the authority to remove him.[9] A meeting of the board in June failed to oust Callahan with a vote by secret ballot, and so Callahan hung on to the office for another four years.[9]/nCallahan's term came to an end when Plunkett died in 1939. Father George J. Collins was appointed American provincial, and transferred Callahan to St. Augustine's, a poor rural African-American parish located 10 miles outside of Natchitoches, Louisiana, on the Cane River. Callahan resigned at last in February 1940, in order to \"bring this internal dissatisfaction to an end\".[9] He remained at St. Augustine until his death in 1969, becoming a well-known figure in Central Louisiana./nDuring Callahan's ten-year term as president, the university's curriculum grew to include day sessions in the School of Liberal Arts and Sciences, as well as in pharmacy, accounting, pre-medical and pre-dental studies, oratory, and music and drama. The university took over supervision of Mount Mercy College for Women (today Carlow University), and athletic programs were expanded.[5] (When asked if he wasn't overemphasizing athletics, Callahan responded, \"The Greeks of Homer's time trained more rigorously than football players of today\".[11])/nHis successor was Father Raymond V. Kirk./nCallahan was an academic who studied Euclidean geometry. The first volume of his book Euclid or Einstein? A Proof of the Parallel Theory and a Critique of Metageometry claimed to have proved Euclid's fifth \"parallel\" postulate, by re-ordering the logical structure of Euclid's Elements. Callahan proved that for any point not on a given line, there exists a parallel line in the plane so determined and through the point that does not intersect the given line. Euclidean geometry requires the existence of a unique parallel line satisfying the specified conditions--which Callahan did not prove. The second volume purported to refute the theory of relativity./nCallahan served as a pastor in Louisiana until the late 1950s.

Abramo Volterra died in 1862 when Vito was two years old. The family moved to Turin, and then to Florence, where he studied at the Dante Alighieri Technical School and the Galileo Galilei Technical Institute. [5]/nVolterra showed early promise in mathematics before attending the University of Pisa, where he fell under the influence of Enrico Betti, and where he became professor of rational mechanics in 1883. He immediately started work developing his theory of functionals which led to his interest and later contributions in integral and integro-differential equations. His work is summarised in his book Theory of functionals and of Integral and Integro-Differential Equations (1930)./nIn 1892, he became professor of mechanics at the University of Turin and then, in 1900, professor of mathematical physics at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Volterra had grown up during the final stages of the Risorgimento when the Papal States were finally annexed by Italy and, like his mentor Betti, he was an enthusiastic patriot, being named by the king Victor Emmanuel III as a senator of the Kingdom of Italy in 1905. In the same year, he began to develop the theory of dislocations in crystals that was later to become important in the understanding of the behaviour of ductile materials. On the outbreak of World War I, already well into his 50s, he joined the Italian Army and worked on the development of airships under Giulio Douhet. He originated the idea of using inert helium rather than flammable hydrogen and made use of his leadership abilities in organising its manufacture.[citation needed]/nAfter World War I, Volterra turned his attention to the application of his mathematical ideas to biology, principally reiterating and developing the work of Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst. An outcome of this period is the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations./nVolterra is the only person who was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians four times (1900, 1908, 1920, 1928).[6][7][8][9][10]/nVolterra was an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.[11][12]/nIn 1922, he joined the opposition to the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and in 1931 he was one of only 12 out of 1,250 professors who refused to take a mandatory oath of loyalty. His political philosophy can be seen from a postcard he sent in the 1930s, on which he wrote what can be seen as an epitaph for Mussolini's Italy: Empires die, but Euclid\u2019s theorems keep their youth forever. However, Volterra was no radical firebrand; he might have been equally appalled if the leftist opposition to Mussolini had come to power, since he was a lifelong royalist and nationalist.

His personal interest, however, was in the larger fungi, particularly agarics (mushrooms and toadstools), and he was a familiar figure at forays of the British Mycological Society in the 1940s and 1950s. He even published a statistical survey of these forays.  For nearly 30 years Parker-Rhodes tutored a course on fungi at the Flatford Mill Field Studies Centre in Suffolk and, in 1950, published a popular book, Fungi, friends and foes.[7] Subsequently, he produced papers studying the kinetics of fairy rings and a series surveying the larger fungi of Skokholm, an island off the western coast of Wales.[2] He described several taxa new to science, including the species now known as Trechispora clanculare (Park.-Rhodes) K.H.

Both these areas of expertise were of use to him when he joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit, an independent research centre established in 1955 by Margaret Masterman. The unit was said to house \"an extraordinary collection of eccentrics\" engaged in research on language and computing, including information retrieval.[8] Parker-Rhodes' colleagues at CLRU included Roger Needham, Karen Sp\u00e4rck Jones, Ted Bastin, Stuart Linney, and Yorick Wilks./nParker-Rhodes was \"an original thinker in information retrieval, quantum mechanics and computational linguistics.\"[8] He wrote A Sequential Logic for Information Structuring in \"Mathematics of a Hierarchy of Brouwerian Operations\" with Yorick Wilks (Fort Belvoir Defense Technical Information Center 01 MAY 1965)./nParker-Rhodes also co-authored papers with Needham on the \"theory of clumps\" in relation to information retrieval and computational linguistics.[9]/nHe wrote a book on language structure and the logic of descriptions, Inferential Semantics, published in 1978.[10]  The work analyzes sentences and longer passages into mathematical lattices (the kind in Lattice Theory, not crystal lattices) which are semantic networks.  These are inferred not only from sentence syntax but also from grammatical focus and sometimes prosody.   Each node the network is a concept in one or more structured conceptual dimensions (called base domains, which are also lattice structures); this places a description into a resulting abstract lattice of possible descriptions, ordered from general to specific.  This structure can be used for automated inference in artificial intelligence and machine translation.  He factors some of the dimensions (base domains, like a quantifier lattice, a (deep) case lattice, et al.) into sublattice-factors.  Division of the lattice of possible descriptions into factors acts to divide-and-conquer the abstract lattice of all possible descriptions into simpler, independent semantic \"factors\" or \"dimensions\"./nHis Times obituarist, Ted Bastin, says of Parker-Rhodes' personality and scientific contribution: \"One must say, in sum, that Parker-Rhodes leaves us with an enigma \u2013 a situation to which he brought his characteristic gentle and slightly amused acquiescence.\".[1]/nParker-Rhodes influenced mathematical metaphysics with his book [11] relating to the Combinatorial Hierarchy's remarkable correspondences to the dimensionless scaling laws of physics.

The most romantic is that he was spurned by a young lady and decided to commit suicide, but was distracted by what he thought was an error in a paper by Ernst Kummer, who had detected a flaw in Augustin Cauchy's attempted proof of Fermat's famous problem.  This rekindled his will to live and, in gratitude, he established the prize. This story was traced by Philip Davis and William Chinn in their 1969 book 3.1416 and All That to renowned mathematician Alexander Ostrowski, who supposedly heard it from another, unidentified source. Another more prosaic story has it that Wolfskehl wanted to leave as little as possible to his shrewish wife. Yet another story, told in The Man Who Loved Only Numbers by Paul Hoffman, tells that Wolfskehl actually missed his supposed suicide time because he was in the library studying the Theorem.

Under Leray's tutorship de Gosson completed a Habilitation \u00e0 Diriger des Recherches en Math\u00e9matiques at the University of Paris 6 (1992). During this period he specialized in the study of the Leray\u2013Maslov index and in the theory of the metaplectic group, and their applications to mathematical physics. In 1998 de Gosson met Basil Hiley, who triggered his interest in conceptual question in quantum mechanics. Basil Hiley wrote a foreword to de Gosson's book The Principles of Newtonian and Quantum Mechanics (Imperial College Press, London).\nAfter having spent several years in Sweden as Associate Professor and Professor in Sweden, de Gosson was appointed in 2006 at the Numerical Harmonic Analysis Group of the University of Vienna, created by Hans Georg Feichtinger (see www.nuhag.eu).

Dennis and Basil Hiley, de Gosson laid out examples of how the quantum blob can be seen as a \"blow-up\" of a particle in phase space. To demonstrate this, they picked up on \"Fermi's trick\"[17] which allows to identify an arbitrary wavefunction as a stationary state for some Hamiltonian operator. They showed that this blow-up requires internal energy that comes from the particle itself, involving the kinetic energy and David Bohm's quantum potential.[18][19]/nIn the classical limit, the quantum blob becomes a point particle.[20]/nDe Gosson's notion of quantum blobs has given rise to a proposal for a new formulation of quantum mechanics, which is derived from postulates on quantum-blob-related limits to the extent and localization of quantum particles in phase space;[14][21] this proposal is strengthened by the development of a phase space approach that applies to both quantum and classical physics, where a quantum-like evolution law for observables can be recovered from the classical Hamiltonian in a non-commutative phase space, where x and p are (non-commutative) c-numbers, not operators.[22]", "58516365": "Francis Michael Christ (born 7 June 1955) is an American mathematician and professor at University of California, Berkeley, specializing in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and several complex variables.[1][2] He is known for the Christ\u2013Kiselev maximal inequality./nHe received in 1977 from Harvey Mudd College his bachelor's degree[1] and in 1982 from the University of Chicago his PhD under the supervision of Alberto Calder\u00f3n with thesis Restrictions of the Fourier transform to submanifolds of low codimension.[3] At Princeton University, Christ worked with Elias M.

Schoenfeld's study found that the strategies alone are weak, and need to be strengthened by complementary domain-specific tactics. He also showed the importance of students' monitoring their work on a problem and adjusting their tactical and technical moves accordingly. \u00a0This work was published as Mathematical Problem Solving (1985).[3]/nOn models of teaching.

Mathematics was central to his method of inquiry, and he connected the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra into analytic geometry. Descartes spent much of his working life in the Dutch Republic, initially serving the Dutch States Army, later becoming a central intellectual of the Dutch Golden Age.[15] Although he served a Protestant state and was later counted as a deist by critics, Descartes was Roman Catholic.[16][17]/nMany elements of Descartes' philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism, the revived Stoicism of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like Augustine. In his natural philosophy, he differed from the schools on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to final ends, divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.[18] In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the Passions of the Soul, an early modern treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before.\" His best known philosophical statement is \"cogito, ergo sum\" (\"I think, therefore I am\"; French: Je pense, donc je suis), found in Discourse on the Method (1637, in French and Latin, 1644) and Principles of Philosophy (1644, in Latin, 1647 in French).[note 4] The statement has either been interpretated as a logical syllogism or as an intuitive thought.[19]/nDescartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy, and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the 17th century.[20][note 5] He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz, and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. The rise of early modern rationalism\u2014as a systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history\u2014exerted an influence on modern Western thought in general, with the birth of two rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes (Cartesianism) and Spinoza (Spinozism). It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz who have given the \"Age of Reason\" its name and place in history. Leibniz, Spinoza,[21] and Descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed  to science as well.[22]/nDescartes' Meditations on First Philosophy (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes' influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the Cartesian coordinate system was named after him. He is credited as the father of analytic geometry\u2014used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution./nRen\u00e9 Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine, Province of Touraine (now Descartes, Indre-et-Loire), France, on 31 March 1596.[23]  In May 1597, his mother Jeanne Brochard, died a few days after giving birth to a still-born child.[24][23] Descartes' father, Joachim, was a member of the Parlement of Rennes at Rennes.[25]:\u200a22\u200a Ren\u00e9 lived with his grandmother and with his great-uncle. Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic, the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots.[26] In 1607, late because of his fragile health, he entered the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Fl\u00e8che,[27][28] where he was introduced to mathematics and physics, including Galileo's work.[29][30] While there, Descartes first encountered hermetic mysticism. After graduation in 1614, he studied for two years (1615\u201316) at the University of Poitiers, earning a Baccalaur\u00e9at and Licence in canon and civil law in 1616,[29] in accordance with his father's wishes that he should become a lawyer.[31] From there, he moved to Paris./nIn Discourse on the Method, Descartes recalls:[32]:\u200a20\u201321/nI entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it./nIn accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in 1618, Descartes joined, as a mercenary, the Protestant Dutch States Army in Breda under the command of Maurice of Nassau,[29] and undertook a formal study of military engineering, as established by Simon Stevin.[33] Descartes, therefore, received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics.[29] In this way, he became acquainted with Isaac Beeckman,[29] the principal of a Dordrecht school, for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music (written 1618, published 1650).[34]/nWhile in the service of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria from 1619,[35] Descartes was present at the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague, in November 1620.[36][37]/nAccording to Adrien Baillet, on the night of 10\u201311 November 1619 (St. Martin's Day), while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau, Descartes shut himself in a room with an \"oven\" (probably a cocklestove)[38] to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams,[39] and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is speculated that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome.[40] Upon exiting, he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.[41][42] Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another, so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous \"I think, therefore I am.\"[43]/nIn 1620, Descartes left the army. He visited Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years, he spent time in Paris. It was there that he composed his first essay on method: Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii (Rules for the Direction of the Mind).[43] He arrived in La Haye in 1623, selling all of his property to invest in bonds, which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life.[44][45]:\u200a94\u200a Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in 1627.[45]:\u200a128\u200a In the autumn of that year, in the residence of the papal nuncio Guidi di Bagno, where he came with Mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist, Nicolas de Villiers, Sieur de Chandoux, on the principles of a supposed new philosophy,[46] Cardinal B\u00e9rulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the Inquisition.[47]/nDescartes returned to the Dutch Republic in 1628.[39] In April 1629, he joined the University of Franeker, studying under Adriaan Metius, either living with a Catholic family or renting the Sjaerdemaslot. The next year, under the name \"Poitevin\", he enrolled at Leiden University, which at the time was a Protestant University.[48] He studied both mathematics with Jacobus Golius, who confronted him with Pappus's hexagon theorem, and astronomy with Martin Hortensius.[49] In October 1630, he had a falling-out with Beeckman, whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas. In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, Francine, who was born in 1635 in Deventer. She was baptized a Protestant[50][51] and died of scarlet fever at the age of 5./nUnlike many moralists of the time, Descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them;[52] he wept upon Francine's death in 1640.[53] According to a recent biography by Jason Porterfield, \"Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man.\"[54] Russell Shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes' work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.[55]/nDespite frequent moves,[note 6] he wrote all of his major work during his 20-plus years in the Netherlands, initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy.[note 7] In 1633, Galileo was condemned by the Italian Inquisition, and Descartes abandoned plans to publish Treatise on the World, his work of the previous four years. Nevertheless, in 1637, he published parts of this work in three essays:[56] \"Les M\u00e9t\u00e9ores\" (The Meteors), \"La Dioptrique\" (Dioptrics) and La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie (Geometry), preceded by an introduction, his famous Discours de la m\u00e9thode (Discourse on the Method).[56] In it, Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation:[57]/nThe first was never to accept anything for true which I did not know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt./nIn La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with Pierre de Fermat. This later became known as Cartesian Geometry.[58]/nDescartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641, he published a metaphysics treatise, Meditationes de Prima Philosophia (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by Principia Philosophiae (Principles of Philosophy), a kind of synthesis of the Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First Philosophy. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, settling in Egmond-Binnen./nBetween 1643 and 1649 Descartes lived with his girlfriend at Egmond-Binnen in an inn.[59] Descartes became friendly with Anthony Studler van Zurck, lord of Bergen and participated in the design of his mansion and estate.[60][61][62] He also met Dirck Rembrantsz van Nierop, a mathematician and surveyor.[63] He was so impressed by Van Nierop's knowledge that he even brought him to the attention of Constantijn Huygens and Frans van Schooten.[64]/nChristia Mercer suggested that Descartes may have been influenced by Spanish author and Roman Catholic nun Teresa of \u00c1vila, who, fifty years earlier, published The Interior Castle, concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth.[65][66]/nDescartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a six-year correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects.[67] Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published Les Passions de l'\u00e2me (The Passions of the Soul), which he dedicated to the Princess. A French translation of Principia Philosophiae, prepared by Abbot Claude Picot, was published in 1647. This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth. In the preface to the French edition, Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom. He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth, better and more secure, consisting in the search for first causes.[68]/nBy 1649, Descartes had become one of Europe's most famous philosophers and scientists.[56] That year, Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love.[69] Descartes accepted, and moved to the Swedish Empire in the middle of winter.[70] Christina was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish The Passions of the Soul.[71]/nHe was a guest at the house of Pierre Chanut, living on V\u00e4sterl\u00e5nggatan, less than 500 meters from Castle Tre Kronor in Stockholm. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian mercury barometer.[69] Challenging Blaise Pascal, Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather.[72]/nDescartes arranged to give lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week at 5 am, in her cold and draughty castle. However, by 15 January 1650 the Queen had actually met with Descartes only four or five times.[69] It soon became clear they did not like each other; she did not care for his mechanical philosophy, nor did he share her interest in Ancient Greek language and literature.[69] On 1 February 1650, he contracted pneumonia and died on 11 February at Chanut.[73]/n\u201cYesterday morning about four o'clock a.m. has deceased here at the house of His Excellency Mr. Chanut, French ambassador, Mr. Descartes. As I have been informed, he had been ill for a few days with pleurisy. But as he did not want to take or use medicines, a hot fever appears to have arisen as well. Thereupon, he had himself bled three times in one day, but without operation of losing much blood. Her Majesty much bemoaned his decease, because he was such a learned man. He has been cast in wax. It was not his intention to die here, as he had resolved shortly before his death to return to Holland at the first occasion. Etc.\u201d [74]/nThe cause of death was pneumonia according to Chanut, but peripneumonia according to Christina's physician Johann van Wullen who was not allowed to bleed him.[75] (The winter seems to have been mild,[76] except for the second half of January which was harsh as described by Descartes himself; however, \"this remark was probably intended to be as much Descartes' take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather.\")[71]/nE. Pies has questioned this account, based on a letter by the Doctor van Wullen; however, Descartes had refused his treatment, and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since.[77] In a 2009 book, German philosopher Theodor Ebert argues that Descartes was poisoned by Jacques Viogu\u00e9, a Catholic missionary who opposed his religious views.[78][79][80] As evidence, Ebert suggests that Catherine Descartes, the niece of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, made a veiled reference to the act of poisoning when her uncle was administered \"communion\" two days before his death, in her Report on the Death of M. Descartes, the Philosopher (1693).[81]/nAs a Catholic[82][83][84] in a Protestant nation, he was interred in the churchyard of what was to become Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm, where mainly orphans had been buried. His manuscripts came into the possession of Claude Clerselier, Chanut's brother-in-law, and \"a devout Catholic who has begun the process of turning Descartes into a saint by cutting, adding and publishing his letters selectively.\"[85][86]:\u200a137\u2013154\u200a In 1663, the Pope placed Descartes' works on the Index of Prohibited Books. In 1666, sixteen years after his death, his remains were taken to France and buried in Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont. In 1671, Louis XIV prohibited all lectures in Cartesianism. Although the National Convention in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the Panth\u00e9on, he was reburied in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s in 1819, missing a finger and the skull.[note 8] His skull is on display in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris.[87]/nIn his Discourse on the Method, he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or Cartesian doubt: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.[88] Descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in The Meditations on First Philosophy. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings. To Descartes, Aristotle's foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism.[89]/nInitially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: he thinks. This is expressed in the Latin phrase in the Discourse on Method \"Cogito, ergo sum\" (English: \"I think, therefore I am\").[90] Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"[91] These two first principles\u2014I think and I exist\u2014were later confirmed by Descartes' clear and distinct perception (delineated in his Third Meditation from The Meditations): as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability./nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a thinking thing. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (cogitatio) as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious.[92] He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams, and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before one's senses.[89]/nAnd so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.[93]:\u200a109/nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding perception as unreliable and, instead, admitting only deduction as a method.[94]/nDescartes, influenced by the automatons on display at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye near Paris, investigated the connection between mind and body, and how they interact.[95] His main influences for dualism were theology and physics.[96] The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes' signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as Cartesian dualism (or mind\u2013body dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies.[97] In Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body;[98] thus Descartes' dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of modes, which are the ways in which substances exist. In Principles of Philosophy, Descartes explained, \"we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance\". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,[99] which Descartes explained as follows:/nThe intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.[99]/nAccording to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus, Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.[100] He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. According to Descartes' indivisibility argument, the mind is utterly indivisible: because \"when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete.\"[101]/nMoreover, in The Meditations, Descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances\u2014the mind or soul defined as thinking, and the body defined as matter and unthinking.[102] The Aristotelian philosophy of Descartes' days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree, was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the \"final cause,\" and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes' theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of Kepler and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and \"final causes\" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes' dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or res extensa) in favor of the mind (or res cogitans). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics, it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul.[103]/nDescartes' dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was, according to Descartes, a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In The Meditations, Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of \"accidents\".[104] But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:[105]/nNature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.[105]/nDescartes' discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?[105] Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind\u2013body problem for many years after Descartes' death.[106] Descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas.[107] Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704), an empiricist.[108] Empiricism holds that all knowledge is acquired through experience./nIn The Passions of the Soul, published in 1649,[109] Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector.[110] Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.[111]/nDescartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events, which influenced 19th-century reflex theory. He argued that external motions, such as touch and sound, reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. For example, heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn, animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.[111] Through this chain of reactions, the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.[107]/nAbove all, he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine, thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous.[112] Descartes' writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed the brain resembled a working machine and that mathematics, and mechanics could explain complicated processes in it.[113] In the 20th century, Alan Turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories, more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist Ivan Pavlov was a great admirer of Descartes.[114]/nDescartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence.[115] He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically.[116] Whereas humans had a soul, or mind, and were able to feel pain and anxiety, animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety. If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage, but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent.[117] Although Descartes's views were not universally accepted, they became prominent in Europe and North America, allowing humans to treat animals with impunity. The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals, and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the 19th century.[118]:\u200a180\u2013214\u200a The publications of Charles Darwin would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals.[119]:\u200a37\u200a Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species opened the possibilities that animals did not have dissimilar properties to suffer.[120]:\u200a177/nFor Descartes, ethics was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.[94] In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind\u2013body dualism, and defends free will. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that individuals should seek, and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide their actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge and mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body.[121]:\u200a189\u200a He discussed this subject in the correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, and as a result wrote his work The Passions of the Soul, that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.[122] His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see Cartesianism), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.[123]/nDescartes and Zeno both identified sovereign goods with virtue. For Epicurus, the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding Aristotle's opinion that happiness (eudaimonia) depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth, Descartes does not deny that fortunes contributes to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.[122] The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his Discourse on the Method, he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. Those maxims are known as his \"Provisional Morals\"./nIn the third and fifth Meditation, Descartes offers proofs of a benevolent God (the trademark argument and the ontological argument respectively). Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, since he believed that God provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception. Regarding epistemology, therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, however, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.[94]/nDescartes invokes his causal adequacy principle[124] to support his trademark argument for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\", meaning \"Nothing comes from nothing\" (Lucretius).[125] Oxford Reference summarises the argument, as follows, \"that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin (God), just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker.\"[126] In the fifth Meditation, Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"[127]/nDescartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,[82][83][84] and one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. Pascal regarded Descartes' views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of deism: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, Martin Schoock, accused him of atheist beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his Meditations. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.[128][129][130]:\u200a274/nDescartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism. Through this method of skepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true \"substance\". But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.[131]/nDescartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, he replied, \"I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God.\"[132]/nDescartes \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x, y, and z, and knowns by a, b, and c\". He also \"pioneered the standard notation\" that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x2 to indicate x squared.[133][134]:\u200a19/nOne of Descartes' most enduring legacies was his development of Cartesian or analytic geometry, which uses algebra to describe geometry. He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities.[135]:\u200a91\u2013114\u200a European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as Pacioli, Cardano, Tartaglia and Ferrari. Equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity a2 could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te, who insisted that a second power must represent an area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to symbolic logic, that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.[136]:\u200a280\u2013281/nCurrent popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Isaac Newton, and this is arguably one of his most important contributions. Decartes' influence extended not directly from his original French edition of La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, however, but rather from Frans van Schooten's expanded second Latin edition of the work.[137]:\u200a100\u200a Newton continued Descartes' work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.[138]:\u200a109\u2013129/nDescartes' work provided the basis for the calculus developed by Leibniz and Newton, who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem, thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.[139] His rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial./nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences.[140] For him, philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, as he related in a letter to a French translator:[94]/nThus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics. By the science of Morals, I understand the highest and most perfect which, presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, is the last degree of wisdom./nThe beginning to Descartes' interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician Isaac Beeckman, whom he met in 1618, and who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics.[141] It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace, detailing a mathematical problem to be solved. Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French.[142] In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory, and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature.[143][142] In 1628, Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo's ideas.[143] Together, they worked on free fall, catenaries, conic sections, and fluid statics. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.[43]/nAlthough the concept of work (in physics) was not formally used until 1826, similar concepts existed before then.[144] In 1637, Descartes wrote:[145]/nLifting 100 lb one foot twice over is the same as lifting 200 lb one foot, or 100 lb two feet./nIn Principles of Philosophy (Principia Philosophiae) from 1644 Descartes outlined his views on the universe. In it he describes his three laws of motion.[146] (Newton's own laws of motion would later be modeled on Descartes' exposition.)[141] Descartes defined \"quantity of motion\" (Latin: quantitas motus) as the product of size and speed,[147] and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved.[147]/nIf x is twice the size of y, and is moving half as fast, then there's the same amount of motion in each./n[God] created matter, along with its motion ... merely by\u00a0letting things run their course, he preserves the same amount of motion ... as he put there in the beginning./nDescartes had discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum.[148] He envisioned quantity of motion as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as Galileo had envisioned it.[141][148] Descartes' discovery should not be seen as the modern law of conservation of momentum, since had no concept of mass as distinct from weight or size, and since he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved.[149][150][151]/nDescartes' vortex theory of planetary motion was later rejected by Newton in favor of his law of universal gravitation, and most of the second book of Newton's Principia is devoted to his counterargument./nDescartes also made contributions to the field of optics. He showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law, or more commonly Snell's law outside France) that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42\u00b0).[152] He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law.[153]/nWithin Discourse on the Method, there is an appendix in which Descartes discusses his theories on Meteorology known as Les M\u00e9t\u00e9ores. He first proposed the idea that the elements were made up of small particles that join together imperfectly, thus leaving small spaces in between. These spaces were then filled with smaller much quicker \"subtile matter\".[154] These particles were different based on what element they constructed, for example, Descartes believed that particles of water were \"like little eels, which, though they join and twist around each other, do not, for all that, ever knot or hook together in such a way that they cannot easily be separated.\"[154] In contrast, the particles that made up the more solid material, were constructed in a way that generated irregular shapes. The size of the particle also matters, if the particle was smaller, not only was it faster and constantly moving, it was more easily agitated by the larger particles, which were slow but had more force. The different qualities, such as combinations and shapes, gave rise to different secondary qualities of materials, such as temperature.[155] This first idea is the basis for the rest of Descartes' theory on Meteorology./nWhile rejecting most of Aristotle's theories on Meteorology, he still kept some of the terminology that Aristotle used such as vapors and exhalations. These \"vapors\" would be drawn into the sky by the sun from \"terrestrial substances\" and would generate wind.[154] Descartes also theorized that falling clouds would displace the air below them, also generating wind. Falling clouds could also generate thunder. He theorized that when a cloud rests above another cloud and the air around the top cloud is hot, it condenses the vapor around the top cloud, and causes the particles to fall. When the particles falling from the top cloud collided with the bottom cloud's particles it would create thunder.[155] He compared his theory on thunder to his theory on avalanches. Descartes believed that the booming sound that avalanches created, was due to snow that was heated, and therefore heavier, falling onto the snow that was below it.[155] This theory was supported by experience \"It follows that one can understand why it thunders more rarely in winter than in summer; for then not enough heat reaches the highest clouds, in order to break them up,\u201d[155]/nAnother theory that Descartes had was on the production of lightning. Descartes believed that lightning was caused by exhalations trapped between the two colliding clouds. He believed that in order to make these exhalations viable to produce lightning, they had to be made \"fine and inflammable\" by hot and dry weather.[155] Whenever the clouds would collide it would cause them to ignite creating lightning, if the cloud above was heavier than the bottom cloud it would also produce thunder./nDescartes also believed that clouds were made up of drops of water and ice, and believed that rain would fall whenever the air could no longer support them. It would fall as snow if the air was not warm enough to melt the raindrops. And hail was when the cloud drops would melt, and then freeze again because cold air would refreeze them.[154][155]/nDescartes did not use mathematics or instruments (as there were not any at the time) to back up his theories on Meteorology and instead used qualitative reasoning in order to deduce his hypothesis.[154]/nDescartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy, the thinker whose approaches has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for modernity.[20][156] The first two of his Meditations on First Philosophy, those that formulate the famous methodic doubt, represent the portion of Descartes' writings that most influenced modern thinking.[157] It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move.[158] In shifting the debate from \"what is true\" to \"of what can I be certain?\", Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)\u2014while the traditional concept of \"truth\" implies an external authority, \"certainty\" instead relies on the judgment of the individual./nIn an anthropocentric revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.[159][160][161] In modernity, the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings, each of whom is a \"self-conscious shaper and guarantor\" of their own reality.[162][163] In that way, each person is turned into a reasoning adult, a subject and agent,[162] as opposed to a child obedient to God. This change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the Christian medieval period to the modern period, a shift that had been anticipated in other fields, and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by Descartes.[162][164]/nThis anthropocentric perspective of Descartes' work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the Enlightenment's emancipation from God and the Church. According to Martin Heidegger, the perspective of Descartes' work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology.[165] Descartes' philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism.[20][166][167][168]/nIn commercial terms, The Discourse appeared during Descartes' lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The Meditations, which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes' death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.[169]:\u200axliii\u2013xliv/nAlthough Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy (Henricus Regius, 1598\u20131679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the university, Gijsbert Voet (Voetius), for teaching Descartes' physics.[170]/nAccording to John Cottingham\u2014whose translation of Meditations is considered to be \"authoritative\"\u2014Descartes's Meditations on First Philosophy is considered to be \"one of the key texts of Western philosophy\". Cottingham said that the Meditations is the \"most widely studied of all Descartes' writings\".[171]:\u200a50/nAccording to Anthony Gottlieb, a former senior editor of The Economist, and the author of The Dream of Reason and The Dream of Enlightenment, one of the reasons Descartes and Thomas Hobbes continue to be debated in the second decade of the twenty-first century, is that they still have something to say to us that remains relevant on questions such as, \"What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and our ideas of God?\" and \"How is government to deal with religious diversity.\"[172]/nIn her 2018 interview with Tyler Cowen, Agnes Callard described Descartes' thought experiment in the Meditations, where he encouraged a complete, systematic doubting of everything that you believe, to \"see what you come to\". She said, \"What Descartes comes to is a kind of real truth that he can build upon inside of his own mind.\"[173] She said that Hamlet's monologues\u2014\"meditations on the nature of life and emotion\"\u2014were similar to Descartes' thought experiment. Hamlet/Descartes were \"apart from the world\", as if they were \"trapped\" in their own heads.[173] Cowen asked Callard if Descartes actually found any truths through his thought experiment or was it just \"an earlier version of the contemporary argument that we're living in a simulation, where the evil demon is the simulation rather than Bayesian reasoning?\" Callard agreed that this argument can be traced to Descartes, who had said that he had refuted it. She clarified that in Descartes' reasoning, you do \"end up back in the mind of God\"\u2014in a \"universe God has created\" that is the \"real world\"...The whole question is about being connected to reality as opposed to being a figment. If you're living in the world God created, God can create real things. So you're living in a real world.\"[173]/nThe membership of Descartes to the Rosicrucians is debated.[174]/nThe initials of his name have been linked to the R.C. acronym widely used by Rosicrucians.[175] Furthermore, in 1619 Descartes moved to Ulm which was a well renowned international center of the Rosicrucian movement.[175] During his journey in Germany, he met Johannes Faulhaber who had previously expressed his personal commitment to join the brotherhood.[176]/nDescartes dedicated the work titled The Mathematical Treasure Trove of Polybius, Citizen of the World to \"learned men throughout the world\nand especially to the distinguished B.R.C. (Brothers of the Rosy Cross) in Germany\". The work was not completed and its publication is uncertain.[177]/nIn January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through Google. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.[181][182]/nThe Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two Meditations, someone preoccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument./nFor up to Descartes...a particular sub-iectum...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances. The superiority of a sub-iectum...arises out of the claim of man to a...self-supported, unshakeable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty. Why and how does this claim acquire its decisive authority? The claim originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself./nWith the interpretation of man as subiectum, Descartes creates the metaphysical presupposition for future anthropology of every kind and tendency./n...\u00a0the kind of anthropocentric subjectivism which has emerged from the Cartesian revolution./nWhen, with the beginning of modern times, religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief: their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science. [...] in philosophy, the Meditations were epoch-making in a quite unique sense, and precisely because of their going back to the pure ego cogito.

Moore, discovered mathematics through a summer job at the Cincinnati Observatory while in high school. He subsequently studied mathematics at Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones[1]:\u200a47\u20138\u200a and obtained a BA in 1883 and the PhD in 1885 with a thesis supervised by Hubert Anson Newton, on some work of William Kingdon Clifford and Arthur Cayley. Newton encouraged Moore to study in Germany, and thus he spent an academic year at the University of Berlin, attending lectures by Leopold Kronecker and Karl Weierstrass./nOn his return to the United States, Moore taught at Yale and at Northwestern University. When the University of Chicago opened its doors in 1892, Moore was the first head of its mathematics department, a position he retained until his death in 1932. His first two colleagues were Oskar Bolza and Heinrich Maschke. The resulting department was the second research-oriented mathematics department in American history, after Johns Hopkins University./nMoore first worked in abstract algebra, proving in 1893 the classification of the structure of finite fields (also called Galois fields). Around 1900, he began working on the foundations of geometry. He reformulated Hilbert's axioms for geometry so that points were the only primitive notion, thus turning David Hilbert's primitive lines and planes into defined notions. In 1902, he further showed that one of Hilbert's axioms for geometry was redundant. His work on axiom systems is considered one of the starting points for metamathematics and model theory. After 1906, he turned to the foundations of analysis. The concept of a closure operator first appeared in his 1910 Introduction to a form of general analysis.[2] He also wrote on algebraic geometry, number theory, and integral equations.[3]/nAt Chicago, Moore supervised 31 doctoral dissertations, including those of George Birkhoff, Leonard Dickson, Robert Lee Moore (no relation), and Oswald Veblen.

He also supported the use of the people's language in education instead of archaic forms of Greek.  He was involved in a controversy regarding Korydalism.  He is known for being persecuted for introducing modern philosophical thought to Greek education, the incident is widely known as the Methodios Affair.  He made a significant contribution to the growth of the Modern Greek Enlightenment during the Ottoman occupation of Greece.[1][2]/nAnthrakites was born in the village of Kaminia (\u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac) or Kamnia (\u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac), in the Zagori region (Epirus). He studied in the Gioumeios (later Balaneios) School in Ioannina under Georgios Sougdouris. After becoming a priest, he left for Venice in 1697, where he studied philosophy, mathematics, geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, and physics.[3] His stay in Venice lasted until 1708, he was a priest at San Giorgio dei Greci. He was associated with Meletius Tipaldi a former Greek Orthodox convert to Roman Catholicism living in Venice. He urged Methodios to publish three of his works at the printing house of Nikolaos Glykis. In 1699 Christian Theories and Spiritual Advises, 1707 Spiritual Visitation and in 1708, Shepherd of Reasonable Sheep. He returned to Greece in 1708 and become the first director of the Ierospoudasterion, a new school founded in Kastoria in Macedonia. The benefactor was Georgios Kastriotis, a wealthy Greek from Kastoria, who lived in Wallachia. Anthrakites focused on teaching contemporary European philosophy and mathematics.[4]/nIn 1710, he was called to take over the management of the Kyritzi School in Kastoria.  At the institution, he taught Mathematics, Elements of Euclid, Spherics of Theodosius, geometry theoretical and practical use of geometric instruments. He also taught micrometry, altitude, surface metering, geodesy, iconography, choreography, stereometry, holometry, and sometimes trigonometry. He taught the study of spheres, astrolabe, geography, and optics. Anthrakites was an educational pioneer and became extremely popular very fast. The Galileo affair of 1633 was the persecution of Galileo Galilei involving Greek scholar Corydalleus's professor Cesare Cremonini. The issue dealt with the disbelief in heliocentrism.[5]/nThe Catholic education as well as the Greek education was centered around Neo-Aristotelian philosophy. In the Greek community, this was widely known as Korydalism. Anthrakites tried to break barriers and teach modern European philosophy and logic. He tried to focus on the new teachings of Descartes and Malebranche while new philosophical doctrines were suspect across Europe and banned in some countries.  Anthrakites fame gathered a huge following.  Some of his students included Eugenios Voulgaris, Sevastos Leontiadis and Balanos Vasilopoulos. Balanos Vasilopoulos published Anthrakites mathematical notes in 1749.  They were used in Greek textbooks for years to come.[6] In his book The Way of Mathematics, later edited and re-printed by his student Balanos Vasilopoulos, Anthrakites referred to the Copernican heliocentric system, although he supported the geocentric system.[7][8]/nAnthrakites also began to introduce spoken language into his teaching. This contrasted with the view in Constantinople. The elders of the church felt Greek tradition lies in the complex Ancient Greek language. He used unconventional teaching methods of which the church became very suspicious. Just as Galileo and Descartes tried to break barriers.  Anthrakites also suffered the same fate as his contemporaries. He was eventually involved in the Methodios affair as Galileo faced the inquisition for Heliocentrism. Anthrakites faced a similar fate for teaching it.[9]/nHis teachings were regarded as unusual and gave rise to suspicion in church circles they began questioning his teaching methods at the school. Anthrakites resigned from the Ierospoudasterion in 1718 and moved to Siatista, then to Macedonia, where he taught for another two years. He was associated with a powerful wealthy community but they could not help him against the slander. He returned to Kastoria and in 1723 appeared before the bishop of Achris Ioasaph to defend his Christian faith. After that journey, he moved back to Ioannina where he became director of the Gioumeios.[10] Anthrakites was suspended (\u201cunfrocked\u201d) from the Church. Scholars from Ioannina protested the decision to the bishop of Nikopolis Paisios.[11]/nOn 23 August 1723, the Patriarchate of Constantinople Jeremias III formally accused him of heresy as a follower of Spanish mystic Miguel de Molinos and Quietism and issued a condemnation of his teachings. While he was in Constantinople he hid in the basement for months refusing to burn his notes and books.  It was the most difficult period in his life. His books reflected his thoughts on geometry, logic, physics, euclidean arithmetic, and philosophy. He was accused of a satanic conspiracy. He eventually burned his books in the courtyard.[12]/nAnthrakites was restored as a teacher but he was only allowed to follow Korydalism. The incident like the condemnation of Quietism by Pope Innocent XI and the Galileo affair is termed the Methodios affair. The Methodios affair led Greece into the Modern Greek Enlightenment.[13] From 1725 he became director of the Epiphaneios School in Ioannina, probably until his death in 1736.[14]  Some of his students became very important within the Greek community and used his teaching methods and theories. Eugenios Voulgaris his student eventually taught at the Maroutsaia School from 1742 to 1746. He taught the physics and mathematics of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Isaac Newton.  He also explored the philosophers John Locke, and Thomas Hobbes. Eventually, the church began to persecute Eugenios Voulgaris and he went to another institution.

For 2017 he received the Stefan Bergman Prize.[1]/nBerndtsson's  first results concern zero sets of holomorphic functions, and in 1981 he showed  that any divisor with finite area in the unit ball in the two-dimensional complex space is defined by a bounded holomorphic function (which is not true in higher dimensions).[citation needed]  In the 1980s  he also developed (together with Mats Andersson) a formalism to generate weighted integral representation formulas for holomorphic functions and solutions to the so-called dbar-equation,[2] which is the higher-dimensional generalization of the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations in the plane. This formalism led to new results concerning division and interpolation of holomorphic functions.[citation needed]\nIn the 1990s Berndtsson started to work with L^2 methods that had been introduced by Lars H\u00f6rmander, Joseph J. Kohn and others in the 1960s and he modified  these methods to obtain uniform estimates for the dbar-equation. At this time he also achieved results about interpolation and sampling in Hilbert spaces of holomorphic functions\nusing L^2-estimates.[citation needed]/nMore recently Berndtsson has worked on global problems on complex manifolds. In a series of papers starting in 2005 he has obtained positivity results for the curvature of holomorphic vector bundles naturally associated to holomorphic fibrations.[3] These vector bundles arise as the zeroth direct images of the adjoint of an ample line bundle over the fibration. The case of a trivial line bundle was considered in earlier work by Phillip Griffiths in connection to variations of Hodge structures and by Fujita, Kawamata and Eckart Viehweg in algebraic geometry. Berndtsson has also explored applications of these positivity results in K\u00e4hler geometry (e.g.,  to geodesics in the space of K\u00e4hler metrics [4]) and algebraic geometry (e.g.,  a new proof of the Kawamata subadjunction formula in a collaboration with Mihai P\u0103un)./nBo Berndtsson was a singer in the Swedish prog rock group Love Explosion that was founded in the late sixties.* \"Love Explosion\".

He wrote prolifically, and some of his work (following the intuition-led approach of Federigo Enriques) has subsequently been shown to be not rigorous according to the then new standards set in particular by Oscar Zariski and Andre Weil. Although many of his arguments have since been made rigorous, a significant fraction were not only lacking in rigor but also wrong (in contrast to the work of Enriques, which though not rigorous was almost entirely correct). At the personal level, according to Roth (1963) he was easily offended, and he was involved in a number of controversies.

Intent on eventually settling in Jerusalem, he taught himself Hebrew and delivered a lecture entitled Solved and unsolved problems in elementary number theory in Hebrew on 2 April 1925 during the university's groundbreaking ceremonies. He negotiated with the university's president, Judah Magnes, regarding a position at the university and the building that was to house the Mathematics Institute./nLandau and his family emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1927 and he began teaching at the Hebrew University. The family had difficulty adjusting to the primitive living standards then available in Jerusalem. In addition, Landau became a pawn in a struggle for control of the university between Magnes and Chaim Weizmann and Albert Einstein. Magnes suggested that Landau be appointed Rector of the university, but Einstein and Weizmann supported Selig Brodetsky.

Righ after the premature death of his father occurred in 1767, Cagnazzi, at that time a boy, together with his elder brother Giuseppe, had Carlo de Marco as their guardian, who was their father's close friend and who took care of their education and careers. On 4th June 1772, both of them were enrolled in the Collegio di Bari, just founded, where they had as teachers, among othere, Emanuele Mola, Filippo Farchi, and Nicola Fiorentino. The principal at that time was Luigi Sagrariga Visconti. Cagnazzi left the college on October 1779.[3]/nCagnazzi was provided at his college just with a basic education in math, where he studied just Euclidean geometry, logic and history (\"chronology\"). He continued his studies at the University of Altamura with professor Giuseppe Carlucci, with which he completed his math education and he was also taught law by professor Domenico Castelli in the same university.[3]/nCagnazzi had to study math basically on his own, except for the basic notions learned in the  Collegio di Bari. Advanced math, like calculus, was at that ignored by scholars in the Kingdom of Naples and Cagnazzi was enticed by Fiorentini to learn advanced math. Cagnzzi studied on his own the book Compiendio d'analisi by Girolamo Saladini, even if he had seriousl difficulties with equations of degree greater than the secondp. In order to overcome these diffculties, Cagnazzi was in correspondence with Saladino himself, who, among other things, suggested that he had to study his book Institutiones Analyticae, wrotten together with Vincenzo Riccati.[3]/nSubsequently, Cagnazzi moved to Naples, where he continued his studies and was initiated into an ecclesiastical career. His teachers were Canon Ignarra, Marino Guarani and Francesco Conforti. In Naples, Cagnazzi realized that he was particularly skilled in mathematics compared to his peers, and his skills were as deep as the best mathematicians in Naples. As he himself stated, \"the only one who cast a shadow on me was Annibale Giordani.\". In Naples, Cagnazzi could study math and science and he could exchange views and opinions with the most notable Neapolitan scholars, but he also reluctantly had to study law and theology as his guardian Carlo de Marco wished; this sort of conflict between favorite subjects and hated and reluctantly imposed subjects appears several times in his autobiography. From this, we learn how this situation was very common at his time; some acquaintances of him had even developed a kind of disease derived from the imposition of subjects not congenial with their vocation. [4]\nAs early as his youth, Cagnazzi started to develop health problems; they were of various kinds (backache, fever etc.) and are all documented in detail in his autobiography. Some illnesses were probably due to his travels, which intensified starting from 1799. [4]/nFollowing pain in his left side, he was advised by doctor Domenico Cotugno to return to his own city Altamura. In the University of Altamura, there weren't suitable teacher for the chair of mathematics. Cagnazzi convinced the then rector Gioacchino de Gemmis to add a mathematics course; until then just Euclidean geometry was taught. Cagnazzi had to obtain some credentials from the Chaplain Major in order to be hired as a teacher and he finally obtained the chair of mathematics in 1787. He later regretted coming back to his hometown since he preferred living in Naples, the capital of the Kingdom. Despite that, he was already appointed \"Canon of Altamura\".[5]/nCagnazzi later had the chance to return to Naples, where he was able to deepen his knowledge in the field of mineralogy with the help of Alberto Fortis, with whom Cagnazzi remained in contact even after his return to Lombardy (in winter of 1789) through extensive correspondence and exchange of minerals.[6]/nIn February 1790, while he was in Naples, Cagnazzi was appointed \"Primicerio\" of the Cathedral of Altamura and \"I had to doctorate in the ridiculous manner that was practiced in the College of the Prince of Avellino\". In June of the same year he returned to Altamura and began to teach \"the natural and rational philosophical course\", replacing Giuseppe Carlucci, who had been teaching that course. Cagnazzi describes Carlucci as \"highly skilled in ecclesiastical matters and rational philosophy\" and contemptuous of the superstition \"that was promoted by foolish priests\".[7]/nIn the years between 1790 and 1799 he used to visit quite often Naples and in the same years he was offered offered important ecclesiastical positions (including the bishopric) which Cagnazzi systematically refused. In his autobiography, he stated: \"I confess that I did not despise the bishopric, but I did not want to bind myself to a very circumspect life, like that of a bishop at a young age like mine.\"[8]/nIn the summer of 1798, Cagnazzi had to return to Altamura and in the meantime \"the invasion of the French into the Kingdom was likely\". The government in Naples then wanted to understand how many men fit for arms there were in the Kingdom of Naples in order to deploy an army that would counter the invasion. The Clergyman's Secretariat had data relating to marriages and births in the kingdom without any further information. The Major Officer then turned to Cagnazzi who gave his first proof of ability in calculations and, from that time, his technical competence made him much appreciated and requested by the Neapolitan government. In a few hours and by applying the \"probability calculation according to statistical theories\" starting from the above data alone, Cagnazzi calculated the number of men suitable for arms and, in addition, obtained other useful information \"necessary for the good government of a nation\". Cagnazzi drew up a table to be presented directly to the king of Naples and, as he himself recounts, \"I had to struggle to give it the title \"Statistical Table\", since such a title sounded suche an act of vanity at that time, which shows how statistics was disregarded at that time here\".[9]/nIn 1799, he first moved to Florence, where he worked as a teacher and then he moved to the University of Naples Federico II where he became a professor of statistics and of economics, and a member of the Royal Society of Encouragement to Natural Sciences of Naples.\nHe also became head of the Office of Statistics and Trade of the Kingdom of Naples, under Joachim Murat's rule, and he kept that position until 1821. He was a frequent contributor to the Italian journal Il progresso delle scienze, delle lettere e delle arti, of which he was also editor for a short time. In 1848, aged 84, he was elected member of the newly born Parliament of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; he was involved in the riots of Naples on 15 May 1848 and, because of this, he ended up under trial in Naples.

In 1885 she became one of the first British women to receive a doctorate,[3] and the first British woman to receive a doctorate in mathematics, which she received from the University of London.[4] She did her graduate research under Arthur Cayley at Cambridge University, but since Cambridge did not begin issuing degrees to women until 1948, Scott received her BSc (1882) and D.Sc. (1885) from the University of London[2] through external examinations./nIn 1880, Scott obtained special permission to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam.

He is best known for calculations involving the eponymous 19-year Metonic cycle, which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar. Euphronios says that Colonus was Meton's deme.[1]/nThe Metonic calendar incorporates knowledge that 19 solar years and 235 lunar months are very nearly of the same duration. Consequently, a given day of a lunar month will often occur on the same day of the solar year as it did 19 years previously. Meton's observations were made in collaboration with Euctemon, about whom nothing else is known.  The Greek astronomer Callippus expanded on the work of Meton, proposing what is now called the Callippic cycle. A Callippic cycle runs for 76 years, or four Metonic cycles.  Callippus refined the lunisolar calendar, deducting one day from the fourth Metonic cycle in each Callippic cycle (i.e., after 940 synodic lunar periods had elapsed), so as to better keep the lunisolar calendar synchronized with the seasons of the solar year./nThe world's oldest known astronomical calculator, the Antikythera Mechanism (2nd century BC), performs calculations based on both the Metonic and Callipic calendar cycles, with separate dials for each.[2][3]/nThe foundations of Meton's observatory in Athens are still visible just behind the podium of the Pnyx, the ancient parliament. Meton found the dates of equinoxes and solstices by observing sunrise from his observatory. From that point of observation, during the summer solstice, sunrise was in line with the local hill of Mount Lycabetus, while six months later, during the winter solstice, sunrise occurs over the high brow of Mount Hymettos in the southeast. So from Meton's observatory the Sun appears to move along a 60\u00b0 arc between these two points on the horizon every six months. The bisector of the observatory's solstitial arc lies in line with the Acropolis. These topological features are important because the summer solstice was the point in time from which the Athenians measured the start of their calendar years. The first month of the new year, Hekatombaion, began with the first new moon after the summer solstice.[4]/nMeton appears briefly as a character in Aristophanes' play The Birds (414 BC).  He comes on stage carrying surveying instruments and is described as a geometer./nWhat little is known about Meton is related by ancient historians.

In 1904, Cartan's first son, Henri Cartan, who later became an influential mathematician, was born; in 1906, another son, Jean Cartan, who became a composer, was born. In 1909 Cartan moved his family to Paris and worked as a lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences in the Sorbonne.

Before, it was designated Apollonius D./nIn the Travaux, Cartan breaks down his work into 15 areas. Using modern terminology, they are:/nCartan's mathematical work can be described as the development of analysis on differentiable manifolds, which many now consider the central and most vital part of modern mathematics and which he was foremost in shaping and advancing. This field centers on Lie groups, partial differential systems, and differential geometry; these, chiefly through Cartan's contributions, are now closely interwoven and constitute a unified and powerful tool./nCartan was practically alone in the field of Lie groups for the thirty years after his dissertation. Lie had considered these groups chiefly as systems of analytic transformations of an analytic manifold, depending analytically on a finite number of parameters. A very fruitful approach to the study of these groups was opened in 1888 when Wilhelm Killing systematically started to study the group in itself, independent of its possible actions on other manifolds. At that time (and until 1920) only local properties were considered, so the main object of study for Killing was the Lie algebra of the group, which exactly reflects the local properties in purely algebraic terms. Killing's great achievement was the determination of all simple complex Lie algebras; his proofs, however, were often defective, and Cartan's thesis was devoted mainly to giving a rigorous foundation to the local theory and to proving the existence of the exceptional Lie algebras belonging to each of the types of simple complex Lie algebras that Killing had shown to be possible. Later Cartan completed the local theory by explicitly solving two fundamental problems, for which he had to develop entirely new methods: the classification of simple real Lie algebras and the determination of all irreducible linear representations of simple Lie algebras, by means of the notion of weight of a representation, which he introduced for that purpose. It was in the process of determining the linear representations of the orthogonal groups that Cartan discovered in 1913 the spinors, which later played such an important role in quantum mechanics./nAfter 1925 Cartan grew more and more interested in topological questions. Spurred by Weyl's brilliant results on compact groups, he developed new methods for the study of global properties of Lie groups; in particular he showed that topologically a connected Lie group is a product of a Euclidean space and a compact group, and for compact Lie groups he discovered that the possible fundamental groups of the underlying manifold can be read from the structure of the Lie algebra of the group. Finally, he outlined a method of determining the Betti numbers of compact Lie groups, again reducing the problem to an algebraic question on their Lie algebras, which has since been completely solved./nAfter solving the problem of the structure of Lie groups which Cartan (following Lie) called \"finite continuous groups\" (or \"finite transformation groups\"), Cartan posed the similar problem for \"infinite continuous groups\", which are now called Lie pseudogroups, an infinite-dimensional analogue of Lie groups (there are other infinite generalizations of Lie groups). The Lie pseudogroup considered by Cartan is a set of transformations between subsets of a space that contains the identical transformation and possesses the property that the result of composition of two transformations in this set (whenever this is possible) belongs to the same set. Since the composition of two transformations is not always possible, the set of transformations is not a group (but a groupoid in modern terminology), thus the name pseudogroup. Cartan considered only those transformations of manifolds for which there is no subdivision of manifolds into the classes transposed by the transformations under consideration. Such pseudogroups of transformations are called primitive. Cartan showed that every infinite-dimensional primitive pseudogroup of complex analytic transformations belongs to one of the six classes: 1) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of n complex variables; 2) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of n complex variables with a constant Jacobian (i.e., transformations that multiply all volumes by the same complex number); 3) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of n complex variables whose Jacobian is equal to one (i.e., transformations that preserve volumes); 4) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2n > 4 complex variables that preserve a certain double integral (the symplectic pseudogroup); 5) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2n > 4 complex variables that multiply the above-mentioned double integral by a complex function; 6) the pseudogroup of all analytic transformations of 2n + 1 complex variables that multiply a certain form by a complex function (the contact pseudogroup). There are similar classes of pseudogroups for primitive pseudogroups of real transformations defined by analytic functions of real variables./nCartan's methods in the theory of differential systems are perhaps his most profound achievement. Breaking with tradition, he sought from the start to formulate and solve the problems in a completely invariant fashion, independent of any particular choice of variables and unknown functions. He thus was able for the first time to give a precise definition of what is a \"general\" solution of an arbitrary differential system. His next step was to try to determine all \"singular\" solutions as well, by a method of \"prolongation\" that consists in adjoining new unknowns and new equations to the given system in such a way that any singular solution of the original system becomes a general solution of the new system. Although Cartan showed that in every example which he treated his method led to the complete determination of all singular solutions, he did not succeed in proving in general that this would always be the case for an arbitrary system; such a proof was obtained in 1955 by Masatake Kuranishi./nCartan's chief tool was the calculus of exterior differential forms, which he helped to create and develop in the ten years following his thesis and then proceeded to apply to a variety of problems in differential geometry, Lie groups, analytical dynamics, and general relativity. He discussed a large number of examples, treating them in an extremely elliptic style that was made possible only by his uncanny algebraic and geometric insight./nCartan's contributions to differential geometry are no less impressive, and it may be said that he revitalized the whole subject, for the initial work of Riemann and Darboux was being lost in dreary computations and minor results, much as had happened to elementary geometry and invariant theory a generation earlier. His guiding principle was a considerable extension of the method of \"moving frames\" of Darboux and Ribaucour, to which he gave a tremendous flexibility and power, far beyond anything that had been done in classical differential geometry. In modern terms, the method consists in associating to a fiber bundle E the principal fiber bundle having the same base and having at each point of the base a fiber equal to the group that acts on the fiber of E at the same point. If E is the tangent bundle over the base (which since Lie was essentially known as the manifold of \"contact elements\"), the corresponding group is the general linear group (or the orthogonal group in classical Euclidean or Riemannian geometry). Cartan's ability to handle many other types of fibers and groups allows one to credit him with the first general idea of a fiber bundle, although he never defined it explicitly. This concept has become one of the most important in all fields of modern mathematics, chiefly in global differential geometry and in algebraic and differential topology. Cartan used it to formulate his definition of a connection, which is now used universally and has superseded previous attempts by several geometers, made after 1917, to find a type of \"geometry\" more general than the Riemannian model and perhaps better adapted to a description of the universe along the lines of general relativity./nCartan showed how to use his concept of connection to obtain a much more elegant and simple presentation of Riemannian geometry. His chief contribution to the latter, however, was the discovery and study of the symmetric Riemann spaces, one of the few instances in which the initiator of a mathematical theory was also the one who brought it to its completion. Symmetric Riemann spaces may be defined in various ways, the simplest of which postulates the existence around each point of the space of a \"symmetry\" that is involutive, leaves the point fixed, and preserves distances. The unexpected fact discovered by Cartan is that it is possible to give a complete description of these spaces by means of the classification of the simple Lie groups; it should therefore not be surprising that in various areas of mathematics, such as automorphic functions and analytic number theory (apparently far removed from differential geometry), these spaces are playing a part that is becoming increasingly important./nCartan created a competitor theory of gravity also Einstein\u2013Cartan theory./nCartan's papers have been collected in his Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes, 6 vols.

For such a path, every pair of vertices is an ancestor\u2013descendant pair./nIn the graph shown below, the tree with edges 1\u20133, 2\u20133, and 3\u20134 is a Tr\u00e9maux tree when it is rooted at vertex\u00a01 or vertex\u00a02: every edge of the graph belongs to the tree except for the edge 1\u20132, which (for these choices of root) connects an ancestor-descendant pair./nHowever, rooting the same tree at vertex\u00a03 or vertex\u00a04 produces a rooted tree that is not a Tr\u00e9maux tree, because with this root 1 and 2 are no longer an ancestor and descendant of each other./nEvery finite connected undirected graph has at least one Tr\u00e9maux tree.[4] One can construct such a tree by performing a depth-first search and connecting each vertex (other than the starting vertex of the search) to the earlier vertex from which it was discovered. The tree constructed in this way is known as a depth-first search tree. If \n\n\n\nu\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle uv}\n\n is an arbitrary edge in the graph, and \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n is the earlier of the two vertices to be reached by the search, then \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n must belong to the subtree descending from \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n in the depth-first search tree, because the search will necessarily discover \n\n\n\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v}\n\n while it is exploring this subtree, either from one of the other vertices in the subtree or, failing that, from \n\n\n\nu\n\n\n{\\displaystyle u}\n\n directly. Every finite Tr\u00e9maux tree can be generated as a depth-first search tree: If \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n is a Tr\u00e9maux tree of a finite graph, and a depth-first search explores the children in \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n of each vertex prior to exploring any other vertices, it will necessarily generate \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n as its depth-first search tree./nIs there a deterministic parallel NC algorithm for constructing Tr\u00e9maux trees?/nIt is P-complete to find the Tr\u00e9maux tree that would be found by a sequential depth-first search algorithm, in which the neighbors of each vertex are searched in order by their identities.[5] Nevertheless, it is possible to find a different Tr\u00e9maux tree by a randomized parallel algorithm, showing that the construction of Tr\u00e9maux trees belongs to the complexity class RNC. The algorithm is based on another randomized parallel algorithm, for finding minimum-weight perfect matchings in 0-1-weighted graphs.[6] As of 1997, it remained unknown whether Tr\u00e9maux tree construction could be performed by a deterministic parallel algorithm, in the complexity class NC.[7] If matchings can be found in NC, then so can Tr\u00e9maux trees.[6]/nIt is possible to express the property that a set \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n of edges with a choice of root vertex \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n forms a Tr\u00e9maux tree, in the monadic second-order logic of graphs, and more specifically in the form of this logic called MSO2, which allows quantification over both vertex and edge sets. This property can be expressed as the conjunction of the following properties:/nOnce a Tr\u00e9maux tree has been identified in this way, one can describe an orientation of the given graph, also in monadic second-order logic, by specifying the set of edges whose orientation is from the ancestral endpoint to the descendant endpoint. The remaining edges outside this set must be oriented in the other direction. This technique allows graph properties involving orientations to be specified in monadic second order logic, allowing these properties to be tested efficiently on graphs of bounded treewidth using Courcelle's theorem.[8]/nIf a graph has a Hamiltonian path, then that path (rooted at one of its endpoints) is also a Tr\u00e9maux tree. The undirected graphs for which every Tr\u00e9maux tree has this form are the cycle graphs, complete graphs, and balanced complete bipartite graphs.[9]/nTr\u00e9maux trees are closely related to the concept of tree-depth. The tree-depth of a graph \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n can be defined as the smallest number \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n for which there exist a graph \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n, with a Tr\u00e9maux tree \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n of depth \n\n\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle d}\n\n, such that \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is a subgraph of \n\n\n\nH\n\n\n{\\displaystyle H}\n\n. Bounded tree-depth, in a family of graphs, is equivalent to the existence of a path that cannot occur as a graph minor of the graphs in the family. Many hard computational problems on graphs have algorithms that are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-depth of their inputs.[10]/nTr\u00e9maux trees also play a key role in the Fraysseix\u2013Rosenstiehl planarity criterion for testing whether a given graph is planar. According to this criterion, a graph \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n is planar if, for a given Tr\u00e9maux tree \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n of \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n, the remaining edges can be placed in a consistent way to the left or the right of the tree, subject to constraints that prevent edges with the same placement from crossing each other.[11]/nNot every infinite graph has a normal spanning tree. For instance, a complete graph on an uncountable set of vertices does not have one: a normal spanning tree in a complete graph can only be a path, but a path has only a countable number of vertices. However, every graph on a countable set of vertices does have a normal spanning tree.[3][4]/nEven in countable graphs, a depth-first search might not succeed in eventually exploring the entire graph,[3] and not every normal spanning tree can be generated by a depth-first search: to be a depth-first search tree, a countable normal spanning tree must have only one infinite path or one node with infinitely many children (and not both)./nIf an infinite graph \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n has a normal spanning tree, so does every connected graph minor of \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n. It follows from this that the graphs that have normal spanning trees have a characterization by forbidden minors. One of the two classes of forbidden minors consists of bipartite graphs in which one side of the bipartition is countable, the other side is uncountable, and every vertex has infinite degree. The other class of forbidden minors consists of certain graphs derived from Aronszajn trees.[12]/nThe details of this characterization depend on the choice of set-theoretic axiomatization used to formalize mathematics. In particular, in models of set theory for which Martin's axiom is true and the continuum hypothesis is false, the class of bipartite graphs in this characterization can be replaced by a single forbidden minor. However, for models in which the continuum hypothesis is true, this class contains graphs which are incomparable with each other in the minor ordering.[13]/nNormal spanning trees are also closely related to the ends of an infinite graph, equivalence classes of infinite paths that, intuitively, go to infinity in the same direction. If a graph has a normal spanning tree, this tree must have exactly one infinite path for each of the graph's ends.[14]/nAn infinite graph can be used to form a topological space by viewing the graph itself as a simplicial complex and adding a point at infinity for each end of the graph. With this topology, a graph has a normal spanning tree if and only if its set of vertices can be decomposed into a countable union of closed sets. Additionally, this topological space can be represented by a metric space if and only if the graph has a normal spanning tree.[14]", "255236": "Eric Temple Bell (7 February 1883 \u2013 21 December 1960) was a Scottish-born mathematician and science fiction writer who lived in the United States for most of his life.

In 1927, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[3] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1937.[4] He died in 1960 in Watsonville, California.[citation needed]/nDuring the early 1920s, Bell wrote several long poems. He also wrote several science fiction novels, which independently invented some of the earliest devices and ideas of science fiction.[5] Only the novel The Purple Sapphire was published at the time, using the pseudonym John Taine; this was before Hugo Gernsback and the genre publication of science fiction. His novels were published later, both in book form and serialised in magazines. Basil Davenport, writing in The New York Times, described Taine as \"one of the first real scientists to write science-fiction [who] did much to bring it out of the interplanetary cops-and-robbers stage\". But he concluded that \"[Taine] is sadly lacking as a novelist, in style and especially in characterization\".[6]/nBell wrote a book of biographical essays titled Men of Mathematics (one chapter of which was the first popular account of the 19th century mathematician Sofya Kovalevskaya), which is still in print. He originally wrote it under the title The Lives of Mathematicians,[7] but the publishers, Simon and Schuster, cut about a third of it (125,000 words), and, in order to tie in with their book Men of Art (by Thomas Craven), gave it the title Men of Mathematics which he did not like.[8] The book inspired notable mathematicians including Julia Robinson,[9] John Forbes Nash, Jr.,[10] and Andrew Wiles[11] to begin careers in mathematics. However, historians of mathematics have disputed the accuracy of much of Bell's history. In fact, Bell does not distinguish carefully between anecdote and history. He has been much criticized for romanticizing \u00c9variste Galois. For example: \"[E. T.] Bell's account [of Galois's life], by far the most famous, is also the most fictitious\".[12] His treatment of Georg Cantor, which reduced Cantor's relationships with his father and with Leopold Kronecker to stereotypes, has been criticized even more severely.[13]/nWhile this book was under printing, he also wrote and had published another book, The Handmaiden of the Sciences.[8] Bell's later book Development of Mathematics has been less famous, but his biographer Constance Reid finds it has fewer weaknesses.[14]\nHis book on Fermat's Last Theorem, The Last Problem, was published the year after his death and is a hybrid of social history and the history of mathematics.[15] It inspired mathematician Andrew Wiles to solve the problem.[16]/nIn his book about Paul Erd\u0151s, titled The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, Paul Hoffman wrote:/nBell... had a rare gift for words as well as numbers. Those who have witnessed the deep truths of mathematics, Bell wrote, \"have experienced something no jellyfish has ever felt.\" He had a knack for pithily summing up a man's character: Pythagoras, Bell said, whose mysticism had hobbled his mathematics, was \"one-tenth genius, nine-tenths sheer fudge.\" And if Bell's prose was at times flowery, The Last Problem and his better-known 1937 work, Men of Mathematics, sowed the seeds of mathematical interest in three generations of readers.[17]", "67986694": "Tomohiro Tachi (Japanese: \u8218 \u77e5\u5b8f, born 1982[1][2]) is a Japanese academic who studies origami from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining approaches from the mathematics of paper folding, structural rigidity, computational geometry, architecture, and materials science.

A decade passed between Amp\u00e8re's paper being read at the Paris Academy of Sciences and William Ritchie building the first demonstration electromagnetic telegraph.

Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula./nRoger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset, England, in the early 13th century, although his date of birth is sometimes narrowed down to c.\u20091210,[9] \"1213 or 1214\",[10] or \"1215\".[11] However, modern scholars[who?] tend to argue for the date of c.\u20091220[why?], but there are disagreements on this.[9] The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 Opus Tertium that \"forty years have passed since I first learned the Alphabetum\".[12] The latest dates assume this referred to the alphabet itself, but elsewhere in the Opus Tertium it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the trivium or quadrivium that formed the medieval curriculum.[13] His family appears to have been well off.[14]/nBacon studied at Oxford.[n 2] While Robert Grosseteste had probably left shortly before Bacon's arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar[9] and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and William of Sherwood in Lincoln.[16] Bacon became a Master at Oxford, lecturing on Aristotle. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title Doctor Mirabilis was a posthumous scholastic accolade.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.[17]/nIn 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Paris.[18] While there, he lectured on Latin grammar, Aristotelian logic, arithmetic, geometry, and the mathematical aspects of astronomy and music.[19] His faculty colleagues included Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, and Peter of Spain (logician),[20] who may later become Pope as Pope John XXI.[21] The Cornishman Richard Rufus was a scholarly opponent.[19] In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.[21]/nAs a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain[22] but he was likely in Oxford c.\u20091248\u20131251, where he met Adam Marsh, and in Paris in 1251.[19] He seems to have studied most of the known Greek and Arabic works on optics[20] (then known as \"perspective\", perspectiva). A passage in the Opus Tertium states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.[12]/nBy the late 1250s, resentment against the king's preferential treatment of his \u00e9migr\u00e9 Poitevin relatives led to a coup and the imposition of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster, instituting a baronial council and more frequent parliaments. Pope Urban IV absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after initial abortive resistance, Simon de Montfort led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the Second Barons' War. Bacon's own family were considered royal partisans:[23] De Montfort's men seized their property[n 3] and drove several members into exile.[2]/nIn 1256 or 1257, he became a friar in the Franciscan Order in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as Grosseteste and Marsh.[19] After 1260, Bacon's activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval.[24] He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation[25] and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.[19]/nBy the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford.[25] For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors' interference through his acquaintance with Guy de Foulques, bishop of Narbonne, cardinal of Sabina, and the papal legate who negotiated between England's royal and baronial factions.[23]/nIn 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon's messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the Second Barons' War. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at Perugia that elected him Pope Clement IV.[26] William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between Henry III and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement.[26] Clement's reply of 22\u00a0June 1266 commissioned \"writings and remedies for current conditions\", instructing Bacon not to violate any standing \"prohibitions\" of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.[26]/nWhile faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement's patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era.[19] In 1267 or '68, Bacon sent the Pope his Opus Majus, which presented his views on how to incorporate Aristotelian logic and science into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste's text-based approach against the \"sentence method\" then fashionable.[19]/nBacon also sent his Opus Minus, De Multiplicatione Specierum,[27] De Speculis Comburentibus, an optical lens,[19] and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology.[27][n 4] The entire process has been called \"one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity\", with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.[28]/nPope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The Condemnations of 1277 banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest. This was traditionally ascribed to Franciscan Minister General Jerome of Ascoli, probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon's 1271 Compendium Studii Philosophiae.[2]/nModern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon's \"imprisonment\" dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified \"suspected novelties\"[29][30] and finds it less than credible.[31] Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon's imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon's \"attraction to contemporary prophesies\",[32] his sympathies for \"the radical 'poverty' wing of the Franciscans\",[31] interest in certain astrological doctrines,[33] or generally combative personality[30] rather than from \"any scientific novelties which he may have proposed\".[31]/nSometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies[34] and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing\u2014the Compendium Studii Theologiae\u2014was completed in 1292.[2] He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.[3][35]/nMedieval European philosophy often relied on appeals to the authority of Church Fathers such as St\u00a0Augustine, and on works by Plato and Aristotle only known at second hand or through Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions \u2013 in Arabic or in new Latin translations from the Arabic \u2013 began to trickle north from Muslim Spain. In Roger Bacon's writings, he upholds Aristotle's calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that \"thence cometh quiet to the mind\"./nBacon also called for reform with regard to theology. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the Bible itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science (\"natural philosophy\") and its addition to the medieval curriculum./nBacon's 1267 Greater Work, the Opus Majus,[n 5] contains treatments of mathematics, optics, alchemy, and astronomy, including theories on the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies. It is divided into seven sections: \"The Four General Causes of Human Ignorance\" (Causae Erroris),[36] \"The Affinity of Philosophy with Theology\" (Philosophiae cum Theologia Affinitas),[37] \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (De Utilitate Grammaticae),[38] \"The Usefulness of Mathematics in Physics\" (Mathematicae in Physicis Utilitas),[39] \"On the Science of Perspective\" (De Scientia Perspectivae),[40] \"On Experimental Knowledge\" (De Scientia Experimentali),[41] and \"A Philosophy of Morality\" (Moralis Philosophia).[42]/nIt was not intended as a complete work but as a \"persuasive preamble\" (persuasio praeambula), an enormous proposal for a reform of the medieval university curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects.[43] The new subjects were to be \"perspective\" (i.e., optics), \"astronomy\" (inclusive of astronomy proper, astrology, and the geography necessary to use them), \"weights\" (likely some treatment of mechanics but this section of the Opus Majus has been lost), alchemy, agriculture (inclusive of botany and zoology), medicine, and \"experimental science\", a philosophy of science that would guide the others.[43] The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a map based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost.[44] His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided Columbus.[44]/nIn this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus, who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of Aristotle at second hand during their preaching careers.[45][46] Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes,[47] a situation Bacon decried: \"never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before.\"[48]/nIn Part I of the Opus Majus Bacon recognises some philosophers as the Sapientes, or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the vulgus philosophantium, or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them \"both philosophers and sacred writers\" and defended the integration of Islamic philosophy into Christian learning.[49]/nIn Part IV of the Opus Majus, Bacon proposed a calendrical reform similar to the later system introduced in 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII.[39] Drawing on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of Robert Grosseteste and criticised the then-current Julian calendar as \"intolerable, horrible, and laughable\"./nIt had become apparent that Eudoxus and Sosigenes's assumption of a year of 365\u00bc days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the computation of Easter had shifted forward by 9 days since the First Council of Nicaea in 325.[50] His proposal to drop one day every 125 years[39][51] and to cease the observance of fixed equinoxes and solstices[50] was not acted upon following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. The eventual Gregorian calendar drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years./nIn Part V of the Opus Majus, Bacon discusses physiology of eyesight and the anatomy of the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses.[40] His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen's Book of Optics. He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo's Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Optics; on Robert Grosseteste's work based on Al-Kindi's Optics;[5][52] and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl's work on dioptrics.[53]/nA passage in the Opus Majus and another in the Opus Tertium are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder. Partington and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers, possibly obtained by Franciscans\u2014including Bacon's friend William of Rubruck\u2014who visited the Mongol Empire during this period.[56][n 6] The most telling passage reads:/nWe have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning.[56]/nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the Royal Artillery published the theory that Bacon's Epistola contained a cryptogram giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed.[58] The theory was criticised by Thorndike in a 1915 letter to Science[59] and several books, a position joined by Muir,[60] John Maxson Stillman,[60] Steele,[61] and Sarton.[62] Needham et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon[56] and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of saltpetre to charcoal to sulphur) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel.[63] The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties.[64]/nBacon attributed the Secret of Secrets (Secretum Secretorum), the Islamic \"Mirror of Princes\" (Arabic: Sirr al-\u02bfasrar), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edition of Philip of Tripoli's Latin translation, complete with his own introduction and notes; and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton[66] and others, including Robert Steele,[67] to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.)[67] The dating of Bacon's edition of the Secret of Secrets is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date;[67] but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.[19]/nBacon has been credited with a number of alchemical texts.[68]/nThe Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic (Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae et de Nullitate Magiae),[69] also known as On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature (De Mirabili Potestate Artis et Naturae), a likely-forged letter to an unknown \"William of Paris,\" dismisses practices such as necromancy[70] but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon,[68] including one for a philosopher's stone[71] and another possibly for gunpowder.[56] It also includes several passages about hypothetical flying machines and submarines, attributing their first use to Alexander the Great.[72] On the Vanity of Magic or The Nullity of Magic is a debunking of esoteric claims in Bacon's time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.[73]/nHe wrote on the medicine of Galen, referring to the translations of Avicenna. He believed that the medicine of Galen belonged to an ancient tradition passed through Chaldeans, Greeks and Arabs.[74] Although he provided a negative image of Hermes Trismegistus, his work was influenced by the Renaissance Hermetic thought[dubious  \u2013 discuss][clarification needed].[75] Bacon's endorsement of Hermetic philosophy is evident, as his citations of the alchemical literature known as the Secretum Secretorum made several appearances in the Opus Majus. The Secretum Secretorum contains knowledge about the Hermetic Emerald Tablet, which was an integral component of alchemy, thus proving that Bacon's version of alchemy was much less secular, and much more spiritual than once interpreted. The importance of Hermetic philosophy in Bacon's work is also evident through his citations of classic Hermetic literature such as the Corpus Hermeticum. Bacon's citation of the Corpus Hermeticum, which consists of a dialogue between Hermes and the pagan deity Asclepius, proves that Bacon's ideas were much more in line with the spiritual aspects of alchemy rather than the scientific aspects. However, this is somewhat paradoxical as what Bacon was specifically trying to prove in the Opus Majus and subsequent works, was that spirituality and science were the same entity. Bacon believed that by using science, certain aspects of spirituality such as the attainment of \"Sapientia\" or \"Divine Wisdom\" could be logically explained using tangible evidence. Bacon's Opus Majus was first and foremost, a compendium of sciences which he believed would facilitate the first step towards \"Sapientia\". Bacon placed considerable emphasis on alchemy and even went so far as to state that alchemy was the most important science. The reason why Bacon kept the topic of alchemy vague for the most part, is due to the need for secrecy about esoteric topics in England at the time as well as his dedication to remaining in line with the alchemical tradition of speaking in symbols and metaphors.[76]/nBacon's early linguistic and logical works are the Overview of Grammar (Summa Grammatica), Summa de Sophismatibus et Distinctionibus, and the Summulae Dialectices or Summulae super Totam Logicam.[19] These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris's terminist and pre-modist logic and grammar.[19] His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.[77]/nIn his Greek and Hebrew Grammars (Grammatica Graeca and Hebraica), in his work \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (Book III of the Opus Majus), and in his Compendium of the Study of Philosophy,[77] Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages.[78] Europe's vernacular languages are not ignored\u2014he considers them useful for practical purposes such as trade, proselytism, and administration\u2014but Bacon is mostly interested in his era's languages of science and religion: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin.[78]/nBacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages' original meaning.[78] For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic[78] but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts.[79] He pointedly states, \"I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers\".[80][n 7] It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon's boast that he could teach an interested pupil a new language within three days.[79][n 8]/nPassages in the Overview and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a universal grammar underlying all human languages.[81] The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:[81]/nGrammar is one and the same in all languages, substantially, though it may vary, accidentally, in each of them.[84][n 9]/nHowever, Bacon's lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted Hovdhaugen to question the usual literal translation of Bacon's grammatica in such passages.[85] She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., linguistics.[85]/nBacon states that his Lesser Work (Opus Minus) and Third Work (Opus Tertium) were originally intended as summaries of the Opus Majus in case it was lost in transit.[43] Easton's review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a fair copy of the Opus Majus, whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.[28]/nOther works by Bacon include his \"Tract on the Multiplication of Species\" (Tractatus de Multiplicatione Specierum),[88] \"On Burning Lenses\" (De Speculis Comburentibus), the Communia Naturalium and Mathematica, the \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\" and \"of Theology\" (Compendium Studii Philosophiae and Theologiae), and his Computus.[19] The \"Compendium of the Study of Theology\", presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s./nThe Mirror of Alchimy (Speculum Alchemiae), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon.[89] It espouses the Arabian theory of mercury and sulphur forming the other metals, with vague allusions to transmutation. Stillman opined that \"there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries\", and Muir and Lippmann also considered it a pseudepigraph.[90]/nThe cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner,[91][92][93] but historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton dismissed these claims as unsupported,[94][95][96] and the vellum of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.[97]/nBacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favour of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas,[14] although his works were studied by Bonaventure, John Pecham, and Peter of Limoges, through whom he may have influenced Raymond Lull.[20] He was also partially responsible for the addition of optics (perspectiva) to the medieval university curriculum.[8]/nBy the early modern period, the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge, a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon,[n 10] in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by \"the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples\",[101] testing his theory that speech is caused by \"an effusion of vapors\".[102]/nAround 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay,[103][104][105] one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies.[104] As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that \"Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, Time is\".[106] Greene's Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak \"strange and uncouth aphorisms\"[107] to enable him to encircle Britain with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer./nUnlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by \"nigromantic charms\" and \"the enchanting forces of the devil\":[108] i.e., by entrapping a dead spirit[102] or hobgoblin.[109] Bacon collapses, exhausted, just before his device comes to life and announces \"Time is\", \"Time was\", and \"Time is Past\"[110] before being destroyed in spectacular fashion: the stage direction instructs that \"a lightening flasheth forth, and a hand appears that breaketh down the Head with a hammer\".[111]/nA necromantic head was ascribed to Pope Sylvester\u00a0II as early as the 1120s,[112][n 11] but Browne considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in Peter the Good's c.\u20091335 Precious Pearl where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever.[106] The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork armillary spheres.[115] Bacon had praised a \"self-activated working model of the heavens\" as \"the greatest of all things which have been devised\".[116]/nAs early as the 16th century, natural philosophers such as Bruno, Dee[117] and Francis Bacon[8] were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon's reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following Whewell[118][8] considered that \"Bacon ... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th- or 17th-century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century\".[14] His assertions in the Opus Majus that \"theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses\"[119] were (and still are) considered \"one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record\".[73]/nThis idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the \"Dark Ages\".[120] This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century popular science books,[123] portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas.[124] Based on Bacon's apocrypha, he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the submarine, aircraft, and automobile.[125] Consistent with this view of Bacon as a man ahead of his time, H. G. Wells's Outline of History attributes this prescient passage to him:/nMachines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men. Likewise, cars may be made so that without a draught animal they may be moved cum impetu inaestimabili, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which antiquity fought. And flying machines are possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.[126]/nHowever, in the course of the 20th century, Husserl, Heidegger and others emphasised the importance to the modern science of Cartesian and Galilean projections of mathematics over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger, in particular, noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon's works.[8] Although Crombie,[127] Kuhn[128] and Schramm\u00a0[de][129] continued to argue for Bacon's importance to the development of \"qualitative\" areas of modern science,[8] Duhem,[130] Thorndike,[131][132] Carton[133] and Koyr\u00e9[134] emphasised the essentially medieval nature of Bacon's scientia experimentalis.[133][135]/nResearch also established that Bacon was not as isolated\u2014and probably not as persecuted\u2014as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon's scientific activity have been identified.[136] In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste:[137] his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste's lead,[138] as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.[139]/nBacon noted of William of Sherwood that \"nobody was greater in philosophy than he\";[140][141] praised Peter of Maricourt (the author of \"A Letter on Magnetism\")[142] and John of London as \"perfect\" mathematicians; Campanus of Novara (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as \"good\";[143] and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures. He was clearly not an isolated genius.[137] The medieval church was also not generally opposed to scientific investigation[144] and medieval science was both varied and extensive.[n 12]/nAs a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the medieval universities at Paris and Oxford but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by Robert Grosseteste, William of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent, Albert Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.[146] Lindberg summarised:/nBacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge\".[147]/nA recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order./nHis Opus majus was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith, written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars. It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the Antichrist. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy.[148]/nWith regard to religion's influence on Bacon's philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce noted, \"To Roger Bacon,... the schoolmen's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the transubstantiation of bread.\"[149] Later scholars have therefore viewed him as a proto-protestant.[150]/nIn Oxford lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of Folly Bridge for having been placed under house arrest nearby.[151] Although this is probably untrue,[152] it had formerly been known as \"Friar Bacon's Bridge\".[153] Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the new Westgate shopping centre.[151]/nTo commemorate the 700th anniversary of Bacon's approximate year of birth, Prof. J. Erskine wrote the biographical play A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century, which was performed and published by Columbia University in 1914.[154][155] A fictionalised account of Bacon's life and times also appears in the second book of James Blish's After Such Knowledge trilogy, the 1964 Doctor Mirabilis.[156] Bacon serves as a mentor to the protagonists of Thomas Costain's 1945 The Black Rose,[157][158] and Umberto Eco's 1980 The Name of the Rose.[159]\nGreene's play prompted a less successful sequel John of Bordeaux and was recast as a children's story for James Baldwin's 1905 Thirty More Famous Stories Retold.[160] \"The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon\" also appears in Daniel Defoe's 1722 Journal of the Plague Year, Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1843 \"The Birth-Mark\" and 1844 \"The Artist of the Beautiful\", William Douglas O'Connor's 1891 \"The Brazen Android\" (where Bacon devises it to terrify King Henry into accepting Simon de Montfort's demands for greater democracy),[161][162] John Cowper Powys's 1956 The Brazen Head, and Robertson Davies's 1970 Fifth Business.[163]", "15656216": "Bruria Kaufman (August 21, 1918 \u2013 January 7, 2010) was an American theoretical physicist.

He was the eldest of four children.[2]/nStanton received his BA in Mathematics and Physics in 1944 from the University of Western Ontario.[1] He went on to receive his MA in 1945 and PhD in 1948, both from the University of Toronto.[1] His PhD dissertation was on the topic \"On The Mathiew Group M(Sub 24)\", under advisor Richard Dagobert Brauer.[3] He received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Queensland in 1989, and from the University of Natal in 1997. He also received an honorary D. Math from the University of Waterloo in 1997.[2]/nFrom 1946 to 1957 Stanton taught at the University of Toronto. In 1957, he moved to Kitchener-Waterloo to work at what was then Waterloo College, which was undergoing expansion, and became what is currently the University of Waterloo. At the time of his arrival he constituted the entirety of the Mathematics Department.[4] Stanton became the university's first Dean of Graduate Studies in 1960.[5] He turned the Department of Mathematics into the Faculty of Mathematics, which when it opened on January 1, 1967 was the first of its kind in North America.[6] In 1967 he moved to York University to found their Graduate program in Mathematics. In 1970 he moved to the University of Manitoba's Department of Computer Science, serving successively as Head, Professor, and Distinguished Professor./nStanton's main areas of research were in statistics and applied statistics; algebra; mathematical biology; combinatorial design theory, including pair-wise balanced designs, difference sets, covering and packing designs, and room squares; graph theory, including graph models of networks; and algorithms.[2][4]/nStanton's influence on the young University of Waterloo extended to many areas. He hired Wes Graham, who Stanton had taught as an undergraduate. Graham became one of the first professors of computer science at the university, and the first Director of its Computing Centre in 1962. Stanton was one of five members of the Academic Advisory Committee that, in 1958, urged the board of governors to buy the Schweitzer farm on the outskirts of Waterloo that today houses the main campus. He introduced computers to classroom teaching in 1960, and introduced co-op programs in applied mathematics and computer science. [2]/nHis interest in teaching extended to the secondary school level. He encouraged teaching of computing science and mathematics in high schools, serving as editor of two high school mathematical journals, member of Ontario provincial curriculum committees, and was actively involved in developing the Canadian Junior Mathematics Contest and the Descartes Senior Mathematics Competition, now administered by the University of Waterloo's Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing./nStanton's gaudy neckties were the inspiration for the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Mathematics mascot, a giant pink tie that was hung by students over the Math and Computer Building when it opened in 1968. The pink tie remains the unofficial symbol of the Mathematics Faculty, with the Mathematics Society distributing more than 1000 pink ties to new students in the first week of the school year.[7]/nStanton founded and administered three not-for-profit corporations dedicated to mathematical research and communication.[2] \"Utilitas Mathematica Publishing\" started in the 1970s and published conference proceedings in mathematics and scientific computing. He founded the Charles Babbage Research Centre (CBRC), a registered charitable organization, to promote conferences and encourage the publication of research. The CBRC currently has published the Canadian journal of combinatorics, Ars Combinatoria, since its inception in 1976, and continues to publish six volumes per year. [8] In 1990 he began his final project, the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (ICA). Although the institute was minimally active after Stanton's death in 2010, in March 2016 it resumed its full activities. Stanton also helped organize the first Southeastern Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing. He continued as one of the organizers until at least 1991, at which point it was the largest combinatorial meeting in the world.

Haughton presumably saw the printed version of the papers and attacked the theory briefly in remarks made to the Geological Society of Dublin on 9 February 1859.

Don Tortolini, along with Don Michele Ambrosini, was put in charge of the Basilica of Santa Maria dei Martiri (Our Lady of the Martyrs) from 1860, and then alone after the latter's death in 1866. Edoardo Borromeo Arese, the Papal majordomo, enabled Tortolini to join the \u201cCamerieri d\u2019onore in abito paonazzo (Chamberlains of Honor of the Purple)\" in 1861; this was a former honorary office of the Papal Court./nAs his biography shows, Tortolini had a foot in both the religious and scientific worlds.  As a priest and noted academic at major universities of the city, he was an official figure with stature in the Papal States.  Yet his own correspondences with Enrico Betti show his concern as an editor and mathematician with careful attention to detail, concern for content and awareness of the latest foreign developments./nIn February 1835, Tortolini began his career as professor of mathematical physics at the Pontifical Urban University, an institution run by the Pontifical Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (long called the \"Propaganda\"), directed to the promotion of the worldwide Catholic overseas missions.  The College was founded by Pope Urban VIII in 1627.  It came under the authority of the Congregation in 1641, and received the title \"Pontifical\" from Pope John XXIII in 1962./nA year later, in 1836, Tortolini was appointed to the chair of mechanics and hydraulics at the University of Rome where, in 1837, he obtained by competition the professorship of introductory higher calculus.  Following in the same year, he was also appointed professor of differential and integral calculus.  At the Pontifical Roman Seminary, his alma mater, he assumed the professorship of mathematical physics in 1846 and began directing the publication of Propaganda Fide, founded in 1626.  This editorship he pursued from 1846 to 1865./nProfessionally, his interests in research ranged from definite and elliptic integrals, calculus of residues, and applications of various differential equations.  He was quoted in the works of Augustin Louis Cauchy, George Boole, Joseph Liouville, and Betti.  He was honored with membership in the most eminent Italian societies and became a foreign minister of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Uppsala.  As a teacher, he was applauded for over 30 years at the University of Rome.  He devoted his life to raising the standards of scientific education on the peninsula at a time when Italy as a newly formed European power in 1860 needed a cultural presence on par with France, Germany, and England./nAlthough he was a productive mathematician and devoted teacher, Tortolini is mainly remembered for his role in founding and publishing the first Italian international scientific journal, then published under the now defunct title, Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche, from 1850 to 1857.  This journal gathered and disseminated the work of the most notable scholars of the exact sciences in order to revive a love for higher educational studies in Italy and to bring to notice to other nations the scientific activity of the peninsula./nBy publishing his own research abroad, he underscored his belief in the importance of the internationalization of mathematical results and made contact with differing cultures reflecting the views and standards of rigor promoted by foreign editors. During his tenure, the journal's content skewed progressively more towards pure mathematics and away from application and topics in other sciences.  Among the foreign authors who published in his journal were Arthur Cayley, Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi, J. J. Sylvester and the Irishman William Roberts. Betti pioneered work in Galois theory of irreducible equations of prime degree at the encouragement of Tortolini./nIn 1858, the journal was restructured to include an editorial board composed of Tortolini, Betti, Luigi Cremona, Francesco Brioschi and Angelo Genocchi.  This was the last year of the Annali\u2019s publication as broader geopolitical trends called for a more focused new journal of pure mathematics to witness the opening stages of what would become the unification of Italy by 1861.  This was one of the reasons why Brioschi and Cremona later moved the Annali to Milan in 1867.  The journal which replaced the former Annali became the Annali di matematica pura ed applicata and its first series reigned from 1858 to 1865 but published in Roma.  The numerical parity between foreign and Italian contributors became equal. The Editorial Board members contributed their own papers vigorously. Betti even started the publication of a translation of Riemann's inaugural dissertation./nAfter a hiatus in 1866,  Cremona and Brioschi proposed to stop publication of the journal due to Tortolini's \"mishandling\" \u2014 according to their opinion.  The political process of unification was very long and painful and the role played by the Church was not exactly pointing toward unification. The Annali finally moved to Milan in 1867 to distance itself from the Papal State.  Cremona and Brioschi called for another new journal series enlisting the collaboration of Europe's leading mathematicians.  Tortolini once again graciously went along.  The second series ran from July 1867 to May 1868 but that was only the first volume. The second series lasted way longer.  The new Annali saw contributions from Alfred Clebsch, Elwin Christoffel, Paul Gordan, Camille Jordan, Cayley, Charles Hermite, Rudolf Sturm, Carl Neumann, Hermann Schwarz and Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann.  Pari passu, Tortolini's influence over the content of the second series ebbed.  At the end of the century, the new journal had become one of Europe's premiere mathematical journals.  This new Annali enjoys continuity into the present day./nIn the early years, in his role as sole editor of the Annali,  Tortolini corresponded with all the major scientists of his day.  Aside from Betti,  Tortolini was one of the few Italian contemporaries to tap into foreign journals and by doing so established a rapport with the finest minds of his time including Carl Friedrich Gauss, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Cauchy, Riemann, Luigi Bianchi, Tullio Levi-Civita, Charles Hermite, Niels Abel, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Sir William Thomson, Augustus De Morgan, J. J. Sylvester, Gabriel Lam\u00e9, and Eugenio Beltrami.  His contributions to mathematical research \u2014 over one hundred papers \u2014 have yet to be assessed on their own merits./nOn 20 September 1870, after refusing to sign a loyalty oath to the King of Italy upon invasion and occupation of Roma by the Italian troops led by Raffaele Cadorna, Tortolini lost the chair of calculus at Roma.  A year earlier he had become paralyzed and was ultimately forced to retire his various positions.  He died in Ariccia, Rome, on 24 August 1874./nThe street \u201cVia Barnaba Tortolini\u201d in Rome is named for Tortolini.", "22209837": "Nikolaus Hofreiter (8 May 1904 \u2013 23 January 1990) was an Austrian mathematician who worked mainly in number theory./nHofreiter went to school in Linz and studied from 1923 in Vienna with Hans Hahn, Wilhelm Wirtinger, Emil M\u00fcller at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien on descriptive geometry, and Philipp Furtw\u00e4ngler, with whom he obtained his doctorate in 1927 on the reduction theory of quadratic forms (Eine neue Reduktionstheorie f\u00fcr definite quadratische Formen). In 1928 he passed the Lehramtspr\u00fcfung examination and completed the probationary year as a teacher in Vienna, but then returned to the university (first as a scientific assistant at the TU Vienna) where in 1929 he was assistant to Furtw\u00e4ngler and then habilitated in 1933. He was even then an excellent teacher, and gave lectures not only in Vienna but also in Graz./nHis dissertation and habilitation thesis dealt with the reduction theory of quadratic forms, which Gauss, Charles Hermite and Hermann Minkowski had worked on previously. Hofreiter treated the case of four variables of a problem of Minkowski (Minkowski had solved the problem for two variables, while Robert Remak had solved it for three variables) on the product of inhomogeneous linear forms and achieved significant progress. The complete solution was only found 15 years later (and the general case is still unresolved). In 1934, he proved the existence of infinitely many real quadratic number fields without a Euclidean algorithm. In addition, he dealt with the geometry of numbers and Diophantine approximation./nIn 1939, he was an associate professor and married the mathematician Margarete Dostal\u00edk (1912-2013). She was also a student of Furtw\u00e4ngler and did important work on algebraic equations and was working as a meteorologist in Berlin at the time. During the Second World War, he moved from Vienna and was a little later at the Hermann Goering Aviation Research Institute in Braunschweig, where his colleagues Wolfgang Gr\u00f6bner from Vienna, Bernhard Baule from Graz, Ernst Peschl and Josef Laub were already working. Through his work there, together with Gr\u00f6bner, he started a table of integrals. The first volume, on indefinite integrals, was published by Notdruck (Braunschweig) in 1944 and by Springer in 1949. In 1950, the second volume containing definite integrals appeared. Both parts were widely available through to the 5th 1973/75 edition. His wife, Margaret, assisted with the calculations, as well as the preparation and review of both volumes./nIn addition to their work at the Aviation Research Institute, Gr\u00f6bner and Hofreiter continued to give lectures and seminars at the Technical University of Braunschweig. After the war he returned to Vienna in 1946 and continued to expand on his number theory work. He also worked on linear optimization and numerical mathematics. In 1954, he became a professor, and in 1963/4 became Dean of the Faculty, and in 1965/6, he was Rector of the University of Vienna. In 1974, he retired./nIn 1970, Hofreiter became a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1965,[1] the Gold Medal of Honour of the City of Vienna, the Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1977,[2] the Commander's Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, the Ring of Honour of the Austrian Mathematical Society.

He is the namesake of the Johnson homomorphism in the study of mapping class groups of surfaces.[1]/nJohnson\u2019s early talent for mathematics earned him a full scholarship to the Phillips Exeter Academy, New Hampshire, where he completed high school. He enrolled to study mathematics at the California Institute of Technology in 1956. But after a year he became disillusioned, and although he had studied the piano only casually as a child, he decided to transfer to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to study music.[1]/nJohnson is credited as having composed one of the first truly minimal compositions, November,[1][2] which was written for solo piano in 1959 and later revised. The creation of November was inspired by Johnson's UCLA college friend La Monte Young's Trio for Strings, written in 1958. November is a pensive piano piece that runs for nearly six hours and predates all other known minimalist works in its use of additive process and diatonic tonality. Part of it was recorded by Johnson in 1962 on audio cassette. November was in return an inspiration for Young's later 1964 The Well-Tuned Piano work.[3] Young gave, from his archive, a cassette copy of November to composer, musicologist and writer Kyle Gann. From it Gann made a new recording of it, as well as producing six pages of the original score.[4] Gann first performed a four-and-a-half-hour version in 2009 with Sarah Cahill and he has produced a new performance score based on the original material that R. Andrew Lee recorded in a five hour version released in 2013 by Irritable Hedgehog Music, after receiving good reviews.[5][6] In 2017 the Dutch pianist and composer Jeroen van Veen released November as part of his eight-disc Minimal Piano Collection, Vols.

She made advancements in the fields of mathematics, computing, and data systems.[2] She used her background in physics and mathematics to contribute to defense weapons and high-performance storage systems at Los Alamos. She was instrumental in the advancement of a major weather centre in England, was involved in many classified projects for the government, and revolutionized the mass data storage system./nEmily West was born on November 25, 1930, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[1] Her father, Frank M. West, was the superintendent for a private beach estate, and her mother was a homemaker. She was their only child.[3] West attended the public high school. From a young age she expressed great interest in mathematics and science.[2] West studied science at Duke University beginning in 1948.[1] After her first year she received a scholarship for academic excellence and was the sole female physics major in her graduating class. She earned a B.S. in math and physics in 1952. She continued her education at the University of New Mexico where she completed a master's degree in physics in 1957.[2]/nWest worked as an engineering aide in mathematics at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Co  from 1952 to 1954.[1] Her work there involved hand calculations of heat flow and fluid dynamics for a feasibility study on nuclear-powered aircraft, in partnership with General Electric.[2]/nWest began working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1954.[1] While at Los Alamos National Laboratory her initial work involved hand calculations. This evolved into working with the MANIAC I computer for weapons applications. She continued working in the weapons division until the early seventies. She worked under Roger Lazarus in the Computer Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory until she retired in 1990. Her work in the computing department involved the design and maintenance of computer storage, including a project to design a clustered file system. Her work for this project included software development and computerizing weapons data. She adapted the same software in an English weather center database, the Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System.[2]/nWest met Eugene Willbanks at Los Alamos. At the time, she was working in the weapons department while Eugene worked in the computing division.  They married in 1959, but had no children. Her husband died from a brain tumour in 1994.[2] Emily Willbanks died on February 18, 2007, in Los Alamos, New Mexico.[4]/nAt the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Willbanks (n\u00e9e West) and a group of five or six others used their pre-written code to analyze weapons that were designed by the engineers at LANL. Their analysis produced data from simulated explosions and provided feedback to the engineers to develop more effective designs. This task required coding skills over analytical skills.[2] Willbanks played a key role in charting and analyzing the trends in the data to ensure that it was correct. This work allowed weapon designs to be streamlined to varying parameters and enabled testing simulations to produce different yields for the different designs. Most of the codes during this time were done on the IBM machine called Stretch. While this project relied more on mathematics and computing, Willbank's background in physics allowed her to adapt the terminology and concepts.[2]/nAfter working in the weapons department at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Willbanks began working on a project to improve their data storage systems. This improvement was crucial because LANL could not purchase needed storage systems from a software vendor at the time. With a team of six or seven, over a twelve-year period Willbanks helped create a high-performance data storage system for LANL called the Clustered File System (CFS).[2] Besides accountability for storing classified information, the challenges she faced in designing these digital storage systems included keeping up to date with the rapidly evolving software and storage systems. Most upgrades in the storage devices required her to develop a new interface so that data could adapt to that technology. The varying needs of multiple users were taken into account when designing the storage systems. Some required the protection of valuable information, while others needed to share data. Along with these demands, Willbanks helped design the CFS custom IBM storage system to organize a variety of information and its security needs. The CFS storage system became commercially available, which led to Willbanks being recruited to collaborate with a weather center in England. Her CFS storage system became extremely useful for bomb calculations, weather data collection, and other applications. The lack of widespread applications and constantly updating storage technology caused the storage system to eventually become unpopular on a commercial scale, but for bomb calculations and weather systems, this storage system remained extremely useful.[2]/nAfter the Clustered File System (CFS) software was released to the public domain, England's weather centre contacted Los Alamos National Laboratory for help using their software. The centre in Reading, located approximately 40-minutes outside of London, required Willbanks' expertise for regular upgrades and maintenance of the software. Their data were stored on a Control Data Machine, then a Cray Machine, and eventually a Fujitsu machine before abandoning most of the LANL software for a commercial IBM model.[2] Her dedication and work led to the adaptation of the Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System (MARS). This system enabled the acquisition of large datasets from the field including meteorological observations, analysis and forecast fields, and data from the Reanalysis project.[5]", "25929": "Johannes M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigsberg (6 June 1436 \u2013 6 July 1476[1]), better known as Regiomontanus (/\u02ccri\u02d0d\u0292io\u028am\u0252n\u02c8te\u026an\u0259s/), was a mathematician, astrologer and astronomer of the German Renaissance, active in Vienna, Buda and Nuremberg.

He is named after K\u00f6nigsberg in Lower Franconia, not the larger K\u00f6nigsberg (modern Kaliningrad) in Prussia./nAlthough little is known of Regiomontanus' early life, it is believed that at eleven years of age, he became a student at the University of Leipzig, Saxony. In 1451 he continued his studies at Alma Mater Rudolfina, the university in Vienna, in the Duchy of Austria, where he became a pupil and friend of Georg von Peuerbach. In 1452 he was awarded his bachelor's degree (baccalaureus), and he was awarded his master's degree (magister artium) at the age of 21 in 1457.[2] He lectured in optics and ancient literature.[3]/nIn 1460 the papal legate Basilios Bessarion came to Vienna on a diplomatic mission. Being a humanist scholar with a great interest in the mathematical sciences, Bessarion sought out Peuerbach's company. George of Trebizond who was Bessarion's philosophical rival had recently produced a new Latin translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from the Greek, which Bessarion, correctly, regarded as inaccurate and badly translated, so he asked Peuerbach to produce a new one. Peuerbach's Greek was not good enough to do a translation but he knew the Almagest intimately so instead he started work on a modernised, improved abridgement of the work. Bessarion also invited Peuerbach to become part of his household and to accompany him back to Italy when his work in Vienna was finished. Peuerbach accepted the invitation on the condition that Regiomontanus could also accompany them. However Peuerbach fell ill in 1461 and died having completed only the first six books of his abridgement of the Almagest. On his death bed Peuerbach made Regiomontanus promise to finish the book and publish it.[1][3]/nIn 1461 Regiomontanus left Vienna with Bessarion and spent the next four years travelling around Northern Italy as a member of Bessarion's household, looking for and copying mathematical and astronomical manuscripts for Bessarion, who possessed the largest private library in Europe at the time. Regiomontanus also made the acquaintance of the leading Italian mathematicians of the age such as Giovanni Bianchini and Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli who had also been friends of Peuerbach during his prolonged stay in Italy more than twenty years earlier.[1]/nIn 1467, he went to work for J\u00e1nos Vit\u00e9z, archbishop of Esztergom. There he calculated extensive astronomical tables and built astronomical instruments.[2] Next he went to Buda, and the court of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, for whom he built an astrolabe, and where he collated Greek manuscripts for a handsome salary.[4] The trigonometric tables that he created while living in Hungary, his Tabulae directionum profectionumque (printed posthum., 1490), were designed for astrology, including finding astrological houses.[5] The Tabulae also contained several tangent tables.[6]/nIn 1471 Regiomontanus moved to the Free City of Nuremberg, in Franconia, then one of the Empire's important seats of learning, publication, commerce and art, where he worked with the humanist and merchant Bernhard Walther.[4] Here he founded the world's first scientific printing press, and in 1472 he published the first printed astronomical textbook, the Theoricae novae Planetarum of his teacher Georg von Peurbach.[1]/nRegiomontanus and Bernhard Walther observed the comet of 1472. Regiomontanus tried to estimate its distance from Earth, using the angle of parallax.[a] According to David A. Seargeant:[7]/nIn agreement with the prevailing Aristotelian theory on comets as atmospheric phenomena, he estimated its distance to be at least 8,200 miles (13,120 km) and, from this, estimated the central condensation as 26, and the entire coma as 81 miles (41.6 and 129.6 km respectively) in diameter. These values, of course, fail by orders of magnitude, but he is to be commended for this attempt at determining the physical dimensions of the comet./nThe 1472 comet was visible from Christmas Day 1471 to 1 March 1472 (Julian Calendar), a total of 59 days.[8]/nIn 1475, Regiomontanus was called to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV on to work on the planned calendar reform. Sixtus promised substantial rewards, including the title of bishop of Regensburg,[9][10] but it is unlikely that he was actually appointed to the role.[3]/nOn his way to Rome, stopping in Venice, he commissioned the publication of his Calendarium with Erhard Ratdolt (printed in 1476).[11] Regiomontanus reached Rome, but he died there after only a few months, in his 41st year, on 6 July 1476. According to a rumor repeated by Gassendi in his Regiomontanus biography, he was poisoned by relatives of George of Trebizond whom he had criticized in his writing; it is however considered more likely that he died from the plague.[1]/nDuring his time in Italy he completed Peuerbach's abridgement of Almagest, Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei. In 1464, he completed De triangulis omnimodis (\"On Triangles of All Kinds\"). De triangulis omnimodis was one of the first textbooks presenting the current state of trigonometry and included lists of questions for review of individual chapters. In it he wrote:/nYou who wish to study great and wonderful things, who wonder about the movement of the stars, must read these theorems about triangles. Knowing these ideas will open the door to all of astronomy and to certain geometric problems./nHis work on arithmetic and algebra, Algorithmus Demonstratus, was among the first containing symbolic algebra.[12] In 1465, he built a portable sundial for Pope Paul II./nIn Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei, he critiqued the translation of Almagest by George of Trebizond, pointing out inaccuracies. Later Nicolaus Copernicus would refer to this book as an influence on his own work./nA prolific author, Regiomontanus was internationally famous in his lifetime. Despite having completed only a quarter of what he had intended to write, he left a substantial body of work. Nicolaus Copernicus' teacher, Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara, referred to Regiomontanus as having been his own teacher.

He was an emeritus professor and occupied Albert Einstein's office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, until 2020 when he retired.[5]/nLanglands was born in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada, in 1936 to Robert Langlands and Kathleen J Phelan. He has two younger sisters (Mary  b 1938; Sally b 1941). In 1945, his family moved to White Rock, near the US border, where his parents had a building supply and construction business.[6][3][1]/nHe graduated from Semiahmoo Secondary School and started enrolling at the University of British Columbia at the age of 16, receiving his undergraduate degree in Mathematics in 1957;[7] he continued at UBC to receive an M. Sc. in 1958. He then went to Yale University where he received a PhD in 1960.[8]/nHis first academic position was at Princeton University from 1960 to 1967, where he worked as an associate professor.[3] He spent a year in Turkey at METU during 1967\u201368 in an office next to Cahit Arf's.[9] He was a Miller Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley from 1964 to 1965, then was a professor at Yale University from 1967 to 1972. He was appointed Hermann Weyl Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1972, and became professor emeritus in January 2007.[5]/nLanglands' Ph.D. thesis was on the analytical theory of Lie semigroups,[10] but he soon moved into representation theory, adapting the methods of Harish-Chandra to the theory of automorphic forms. His first accomplishment in this field was a formula for the dimension of certain spaces of automorphic forms, in which particular types of Harish-Chandra's discrete series appeared.[11][12]/nHe next constructed an analytical theory of Eisenstein series for reductive groups of rank greater than one, thus extending work of Hans Maass, Walter Roelcke, and Atle Selberg from the early 1950s for rank one groups such as \n\n\n\n\nS\nL\n\n(\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {SL} (2)}\n\n. This amounted to describing in general terms the continuous spectra of arithmetic quotients, and showing that all automorphic forms arise in terms of cusp forms and the residues of Eisenstein series induced from cusp forms on smaller subgroups. As a first application, he proved the Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers for the large class of arbitrary simply connected Chevalley groups defined over the rational numbers. Previously this had been known only in a few isolated cases and for certain classical groups where it could be shown by induction.[13]/nAs a second application of this work, he was able to show meromorphic continuation for a large class of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n-functions arising in the theory of automorphic forms, not previously known to have them. These occurred in the constant terms of Eisenstein series, and meromorphicity as well as a weak functional equation were a consequence of functional equations for Eisenstein series. This work led in turn, in the winter of 1966\u201367, to the now well known conjectures[14] making up what is often called the Langlands program. Very roughly speaking, they propose a huge generalization of previously known examples of reciprocity, including (a) classical class field theory, in which characters of local and arithmetic abelian Galois groups are identified with characters of local multiplicative groups and the idele quotient group, respectively; (b) earlier results of Martin Eichler and Goro Shimura in which the Hasse\u2013Weil zeta functions of arithmetic quotients of the upper half plane are identified with \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n-functions occurring in Hecke's theory of holomorphic automorphic forms. These conjectures were first posed in relatively complete form in a famous letter to Weil,[14] written in January 1967. It was in this letter that he introduced what has since become known as the \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n-group and along with it, the notion of functoriality./nThe book by Herv\u00e9 Jacquet and Langlands on \n\n\n\n\nG\nL\n\n(\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {GL} (2)}\n\n presented a theory of automorphic forms for the general linear group \n\n\n\n\nG\nL\n\n(\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {GL} (2)}\n\n, establishing among other things the Jacquet\u2013Langlands correspondence showing that functoriality was capable of explaining very precisely how automorphic forms for \n\n\n\n\nG\nL\n\n(\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {GL} (2)}\n\n related to those for quaternion algebras. This book applied the adelic trace formula for \n\n\n\n\nG\nL\n\n(\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathrm {GL} (2)}\n\n and quaternion algebras to do this. Subsequently, James Arthur, a student of Langlands while he was at Yale, successfully developed the trace formula for groups of higher rank. This has become a major tool in attacking functoriality in general, and in particular has been applied to demonstrating that the Hasse\u2013Weil zeta functions of certain Shimura varieties are among the \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n-functions arising from automorphic forms.[15]/nThe functoriality conjecture is far from proven, but a special case (the octahedral Artin conjecture, proved by Langlands[16] and Tunnell[17]) was the starting point of Andrew Wiles' attack on the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture and Fermat's Last Theorem./nIn the mid-1980s Langlands turned his attention[18] to physics, particularly the problems of percolation and conformal invariance. In 1995, Langlands started a collaboration with Bill Casselman at the University of British Columbia with the aim of posting nearly all of his writings\u2014including publications, preprints, as well as selected correspondence\u2014on the Internet. The correspondence includes a copy of the original letter to Weil that introduced the \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n-group. In recent years he has turned his attention back to automorphic forms, working in particular on a theme he calls \"beyond endoscopy\".[19]/nLanglands has received the 1996 Wolf Prize (which he shared with Andrew Wiles),[20] the 2005 AMS Steele Prize, the 1980 Jeffery\u2013Williams Prize, the 1988 NAS Award in Mathematics from the National Academy of Sciences,[21] the 2000 grande m\u00e9daille de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences de Paris, the 2006 Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences (with Richard Taylor) for his work on automorphic forms.

In the following years he published on projective geometry, iterative methods, and approximation theory./nIn 1914 he took a teaching position in a school near Heppenheim, and a year later another in Hochwaldhausen. He became a German citizen in 1919.  At around that time he suffered a breakdown, and moved back to Poland with his wife. He shortly began publishing mathematics again. The couple moved to G\u00f6ttingen in 1921, and M\u00fcntz became involved in editorial, reviewing and translation work, as well as research. At this period, and from 1924 in Berlin, he was unsuccessfully trying to get an academic position, hampered because he had not habilitated. In 1927 he worked closely with Albert Einstein./nIn 1929 he took a professorial position at the Leningrad State University, where he was active in teaching, research, administration and as an editor of Lyapunov. Though he left Germany before the Nazis seized power in 1933, some scholars consider him an early Jewish emigrant from Nazi Germany; his career was negatively impacted by anti-semitism and he was not able to return to Germany, unlike early non-Jewish emigrants such as Eberhard Hopf and Wilhelm Maier.[3][4]/nIn 1932 he was an official Soviet delegate to the International Congress of Mathematicians, with N.

He is recognized as the pioneer behind modern face recognition, and is known for eigenfaces, the method of snapshots, low dimensional dynamical systems, analysis of the US Supreme Court, neuronal population dynamics, and the faithful copy neuron.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]/nSirovich was born to Jewish immigrants from Poland and raised in Brownsville, a working-class immigrant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. He gained entrance to the Brooklyn Technical H.S., an experience which first opened his eyes to the possibilities of the world. There he was captain of the math team and years later, in 2018, inducted into the BTHS Hall of Fame.[10] Sirovich attended Johns Hopkins University as an undergraduate math major, and as a graduate student in aeronautical engineering (where applied mathematics was practiced).[11] In 1958, jointly with Johns Hopkins University, he became a research assistant at the Courant Institute at NYU. It was there that he wrote his PhD dissertation \"On the Kinetic Theory of Steady Gas Flows\" in 1960.[12]  At the Courant Institute, K.O. Friedrichs, a mathematician of great insight and taste, was his most influential teacher. For Sirovich, taking a course with Friedrichs on asymptotics was a life-changing experience. Another early mentor at the Courant Institute was Fritz John, a mathematician of the highest character with whom Sirovich later started the eminent Applied Mathematical Sciences series, of Springer-Verlag Publishing./nSirovich's early research was in kinetic theory, its connection with fluid mechanics, and such areas of fluid mechanics as supersonic flow and turbulence. A turning point in Sirovich's research came with his reading of Jim Watson's The Double Helix, which caused Sirovich to realize that he was not engaged in the heroic research of his time. This prompted participation in a Cold Spring Harbor summer course on biology, and eventually led to his close association with H. Keffer Hartline's Laboratory of Biophysics at the Rockefeller University, and a long collaboration with Bruce W. Knight, the present head of the laboratory. As a maturing scientist, Sirovich's research interests took on an element of serendipity (\"chance confers an advantage on the prepared mind\", Louis Pasteur). For example, a chance remark on the failure of the standard description of the horseshoe crab's lateral eye neural network at its boundaries led to a Weiner-Hopf solution to the problem, with complete experimental agreement.[13][14] An article by Linda Greenhouse in the New York Times led to \"A pattern analysis of the second Rehnquist U.S. Supreme Court.\"[7][15] An observation that human faces, are always different, but are always recognizable as a face; and likewise that images of turbulence had the same property of being different, and being recognizable as turbulence led to a successful model of face recognition, and also served as an analysis model for turbulence. The former led to Sirovich's establishing the subject of face recognition.[1][2] Allied to this was the notion of low dimensional dynamical descriptions of turbulence in standard geometrical settings.  In a series of three papers on the subject, Sirovich established the field of low dimensional dynamical models.[4][5][6]/nAccording to Google Scholar, Lawrence Sirovich has ~250 publications, which have been cited nearly 30,000 times.[16]/nSirovich met Carole Hochman, a number theorist, at the Courant Institute.

Hyland in the mid-1980s on the subject of \"optimal projection fixed-structure control,\" Haddad solved several important problems concerning the design of reduced-order optimally robust compensators and estimators for multivariable systems. Haddad's fixed-structure control framework provides the capability for simultaneously performing multiple design tradeoffs for multivariable systems with respect to competing constraints such as sensor noise, control effort, controller order, robustness, disturbance rejection, mean-square error, sample rate, and controller architecture.

The concepts are illustrated by examples from biology, chemistry, ecology, economics, genetics, medicine, sociology, and engineering. This book develops a unified stability and dissipativity analysis and control design framework for nonnegative and compartmental dynamical systems in order to foster the understanding of these systems as well as advancing the state-of-the-art in active control of nonnegative and compartmental systems. It has had fundamental ramifications in many areas of intense interest in today's contracting world, where medicine, economics, and sociology in closely interacting populations are becoming more important, where epidemiology and genetics are essential in understanding disease propagation in more and more closely interacting groups, and where real-time control system technology impacts modern medicine through robotic surgery, electrophysiological systems (pacemakers and automatic implantable defibrillators), life support (ventilators, artificial hearts), and image-guided therapy and surgery./nIn this research, Haddad has brought a longstanding research theme to fruition by his work on vector dissipative systems approaches to large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems.[38][39][40][41][42][43] This work has broad application to large-scale aerospace systems, air traffic control systems, power and energy grid systems, manufacturing and processing systems, transportation systems, communication and information networks, integrative biological systems, biological neural networks, biomolecular and biochemical systems, nervous systems, immune systems, environmental and ecological systems, molecular, quantum, and nanoscale systems, particulate and chemical reaction systems, and economic and financial systems, to name but a few examples.

In particular, looking to autonomous swarm systems appearing in nature for inspiration, he has developed control algorithms to address agent interactions, cooperative and non-cooperative control, task assignments, and resource allocations for multiagent network systems.[44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]  This work has had a major impact on cooperative control of unmanned air vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, distributed sensor networks, air and ground transportation systems, swarms of air and space vehicle formations, and congestion control in communication networks. His results exploit fundamental links between system thermodynamics and information theory in \"ingenious ways\"[citation needed] and have initiated major breakthroughs in control of networks and control over networks./nHaddad's work in this area has tackled one of the most challenging problems in clinical pharmacology. In particular, he has developed adaptive and neural network adaptive control algorithms for automated anesthesia and critical care unit medicine. His adaptive control algorithms adjust to interpatient and intrapatient pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability and have significantly improved the outcome for drug administration. This research in active control of clinical pharmacology has transitioned to clinical practice and is improving medical care, health care, and reliability of drug dosing equipment, and has a real potential of reducing health care costs.

From 1968 to 1990, he worked as an associate professor of mathematics at the same institution.[3] In 1988, he became one of the founders and first fifteen members of the sovereigntist Popular Front of Azerbaijan. He was known for his radical nationalist viewpoints[3] and vehement support of Abulfaz Elchibey. Gaziyev was arrested in the summer of 1990 as an organiser of the anti-Soviet riots leading to the Black January massacre, and was incarcerated in the Lefortovo prison in Moscow. He was freed upon being elected to the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan later that summer, although his criminal case was never closed.[4] With the escalation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani military conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Shusha becoming one of the few remaining Azerbaijani strongholds in the region, Gaziyev took command of the city's defence in January 1992./nAfter the resignation of President Ayaz Mutallibov on 6 March 1992, no official body regulated Gaziyev's actions, which provoked him to break ceasefire on a number of occasions including artillery bombardment of Nagorno-Karabakh's capital city Stepanakert.[5] On 17 March 1992, Acting President of Azerbaijan Yagub Mammadov appointed Gaziyev (who had no professional military training) Defence Minister.[5] Two months later, with various political groups chaotically struggling for power, both Shusha and Lachin (city in Azerbaijan-proper linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia) lacked any serious or unified defence and quickly fell to the Armenians.[5] In response, Gaziyev ordered troops to move to the north of the province. Mardakert was taken back in June 1992 and by August, Azerbaijani troops were already at Vank, 12 kilometres north of the province capital Stepanakert.[4][6] Contrary to his radical anti-Russian sentiment in the late 1980s, Gaziyev was now convinced in the necessity of partnership with Russia.[7] In November, the Azerbaijanis were dislodged from most of Mardakert. After Armenians started advancing into Kalbajar, the Popular Front, which had been in power since June 1992, issued a statement in which it blamed Rahim Gaziyev and Elchibey's official representative in Nagorno-Karabakh Surat Huseynov for treason and intentional surrender of Shusha in an attempt to restore Mutallibov as President and indulge Russia's geopolitical interests. Gaziyev was forced to resign in February 1993.[4]/nAfter Heydar Aliyev came to power in June 1993, Gaziyev was elected to the National Assembly and was offered the position of Vice Premier for Defence Industry. However knowing that Azerbaijan at the time did not produce any defence materials which made the office of no significance (the industry was only established in 2005; see: Azerbaijan Defense Industry), infuriated Gaziyev verbally attacked Aliyev during a parliament session calling him a liar.[4] In an early 1996 interview, Gaziyev claimed having had a mutual agreement with Aliyev by which Gaziyev was to be appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan upon Aliyev's rise to power but was wronged for the sake of the latter's regionalist policies favouring natives of Nakhchivan.[8]/nNow confronting Aliyev's powerful figure Gaziyev was officially convicted of treason in surrendering Shusha to Armenians. He was detained in jail in August 1993 and was to be tried in court in November but managed to escape to Moscow, followed by Surat Huseynov.

In 1861, Hill was hired by John Daniel Runkle to work in the United States Naval Observatory's Nautical Almanac Office, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1]/nIn 1862 Rutgers awarded Hill a Master of Arts degree.  Hill lived for a while in Cambridge and later in Washington, D.C., but he preferred to carry out his mathematical work in his family farm in West Nyack, to which he retired for good after 1892./nHill's mature work focused on the mathematics of the three-body problem,[2] and later the four-body problem, to calculate the orbits of the Moon around the Earth, as well as that of planets around the Sun.  Hill was able to quantify the gravitational sphere of influence of an astronomical body in the presence of other heavy bodies, by introducing the concept of the zero-velocity surface.  The space within this surface is now known as the Hill sphere and it corresponds to the region around a body within which it may capture satellites./nIn 1878, Hill provided the first complete mathematical solution to the problem of the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit around the Earth, a difficult problem in lunar theory first raised in Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica of 1687.[3]  This same work also introduced what is now known in physics and mathematics as the \"Hill differential equation\", which describes the behavior of a parametric oscillator and which made an important contribution to the mathematical Floquet theory./nHill's work attracted the attention of the international scientific community, and in 1894 he was chosen as president of the American Mathematical Society, serving for two years.

Still a postgraduate student, Donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame. He published the result in a paper \"Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds\" which appeared in 1983. In the words of Atiyah, the paper \"stunned the mathematical world.\"[3]/nWhereas Michael Freedman classified topological four-manifolds, Donaldson's work focused on four-manifolds admitting a differentiable structure, using instantons, a particular solution to the equations of Yang\u2013Mills gauge theory which has its origin in quantum field theory. One of Donaldson's first results gave severe restrictions on the intersection form of a smooth four-manifold. As a consequence, a large class of the topological four-manifolds do not admit any smooth structure at all. Donaldson also derived polynomial invariants from gauge theory. These were new topological invariants sensitive to the underlying smooth structure of the four-manifold. They made it possible to deduce the existence of \"exotic\" smooth structures\u2014certain topological four-manifolds could carry an infinite family of different smooth structures./nAfter gaining his DPhil degree from Oxford University in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.

Donaldson obtained results in the toric case of the problem (see for example Donaldson (2001)). He then solved the K\u00e4hler\u2013Einstein case of the problem in 2012, in collaboration with Chen and Sun. This latest spectacular achievement involved a number of difficult and technical papers.

He is known for Weiszfeld's algorithm for minimizing the sum of distances to a set of points, and for founding The Institute of Management Sciences.[1][2][3]/nEndre Weiszfeld was born on November 4, 1916, the middle son of a Jewish family in Budapest, where his father was the owner of a shoe store. At age 14, he met and befriended Paul Erd\u0151s (his elder by three years), and at age 16, he began working on the geometric median problem for which he would later publish a solution. He studied at the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University in Budapest, from which he earned a doctorate in 1936. His thesis, on higher-dimensional surfaces, was supervised by Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r. Because of increasing discrimination against Jews in the 1930s and following the lead of his cousin, politician Vilmos V\u00e1zsonyi, he changed his name in 1937 to Andrew V\u00e1zsonyi. The name comes from that of his father's native town, Nagyv\u00e1zsony.[1][3][4] During this period, V\u00e1zsonyi studied graph theory, working with Erd\u0151s on finding necessary and sufficient conditions for an infinite graph to have an Euler tour.[5][6]/nIn 1938, V\u00e1zsonyi was invited by Otto Sz\u00e1sz to escape Europe and work with Sz\u00e1sz at the University of Cincinnati, but was only able to obtain a one-year student visa. Instead, he traveled to Paris, and finally succeeded in traveling to the US in April 1940, two months before France's fall to the Nazis. He spent a year at a Quaker workshop at Haverford, Pennsylvania, and in 1941 began graduate studies in mechanical engineering at Harvard University, studying there under Richard von Mises with the support of a Gordon McKay Fellowship. He earned an M.S. in 1942 and continued to work at Harvard for Howard Wilson Emmons, studying the design of supersonic aircraft. While at Harvard, he met and married Baroness Laura Vladimirovna Saparova, a musician and immigrant from Georgia  whom he had met at Harvard's International Club.[1][3][7]/nIn 1945, V\u00e1zsonyi took US citizenship and left Harvard, working as an engineer for the Elliott Company in Jeannette, Pennsylvania. From there, he moved to southern California, where he worked on missile design for North American Aviation. He moved to the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station in 1948, where he headed their missile guidance and control division, and in 1953 moved again to Hughes Aircraft. At Hughes, his interests shifted from aeronautics to management science. He began working on computerization of Hughes' payroll and production lines, and on diagramming parts requirements. His alias \"Zepartzatt Gozinto\" began during this period, when he visited the RAND Corporation and, during a presentation there, made a joke that was misinterpreted by attendee George Dantzig. Through the 1950s and 1960s, V\u00e1zsonyi continued to work on management science problems at several other companies, including the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, Roe Alderson, and a second stint at NAA.[1][3][8]/nIn 1970, V\u00e1zsonyi joined the School of Management at the University of Southern California,[9] but he did not get tenure there, and in 1973 he moved to the Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester.

An algorithm for the more general problem with an arbitrarily large number of points, published by Weiszfeld in 1937,[12] solves this problem numerically using  a hill climbing procedure that repeatedly finds a point improving the sum of distances until no more improvements can be made. Each step of this algorithm assigns weights to the points, inversely proportional to the distances to the current solution, and then finds the weighted average of the points, which is the point that minimizes the sum of the squares of the weighted distances. The algorithm has been frequently rediscovered, and although other methods for finding the geometric median are known, Weiszfeld's algorithm is still frequently used due to its simplicity and rapid convergence.[13][14]/nKruskal's tree theorem states that, in every infinite set of finite trees, there exists a pair of trees one of which is homeomorphically embedded into the other; another way of stating the same fact is that the homeomorphisms of trees form a well-quasi-ordering.

He used it to refine the timing for the military campaigns for the Count of Montefeltro[5] Bonati announced to the count that he would repulse the enemy but would be wounded in the fray. The event transpired as Bonati had predicted, and the count, who had taken with him the necessary materials to staunch his wound in case the prophecy came true, became a devout adherent of astrology.[6]/nThere is a tradition that Bonatti, towards the end of his life, took the friar's habit of the Franciscan Order. This has been contested, as Bonatti expressed great disdain for Franciscans in his early period.

Furthermore he was a contributor to the Encyclop\u00e9die.[1]/nCharles Marie de La Condamine was born in Paris as a son of well-to-do parents, Charles de La Condamine and Louise Marguerite Chourses. He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand where he was trained in humanities as well as in mathematics.  After finishing his studies, he enlisted in the army and fought in the war against Spain (1719).  After returning from the war, he became acquainted with scientific circles in Paris.  On 12 December 1730 he became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences and was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Academy./nIn 1729 La Condamine and his friend Voltaire exploited a loophole in the French government\u2019s lottery, which brought them large profits.[2][3]/nIn May 1731 La Condamine sailed with the Levant Company to Constantinople (now Istanbul), where he stayed five months. After returning to Paris, La Condamine submitted in November 1732 a paper to the Academy entitled Mathematical and Physical Observations made during a Visit of the Levant in 1731 and 1732./nThree years later he joined the French Geodesic Mission to territory which is now Ecuador which had the aim of testing a hypothesis of Isaac Newton. Newton had posited that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges around the equator and is flattened  at the poles. Newton's opinion had raised a huge controversy among French scientists. Pierre Louis Maupertuis, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Pierre Charles Le Monnier traveled to Lapland, where they were to measure the length of several degrees of latitude orthogonal to the arctic circle, while Louis Godin, Pierre Bouguer, and La Condamine were sent to South America to perform similar measurements around the equator./nOn 16 May 1735, La Condamine sailed from La Rochelle accompanied by Godin, Bouguer and a botanist, Joseph de Jussieu.  After stopovers in Martinique, Saint-Domingue, and Cartagena, they sailed southward through Panama, arriving at the Pacific port of Manta on 10 March 1736./nLa Condamine's associations with his colleagues were unhappy. The expedition was beset by many difficulties, and finally La Condamine split from the rest and made his way to Quito, Ecuador separately,[4] following the Esmeraldas River, becoming the first European to encounter rubber in the process. La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences of France in 1736.[5] In 1751, he presented a paper by Fran\u00e7ois Fresneau to the Acad\u00e9mie (eventually published in 1755) which described many of the properties of rubber. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber. He joined the group again on 4 June 1736 in the city of Quito./nThe meridian arc whose length La Condamine and his colleagues chose to measure passed through a high valley perpendicular to the equator, stretching from Quito (now the capital of Ecuador) in the north to Cuenca in the south.  The scientists spent a month performing triangulation measurements in the Yaruqui plains\u2014from 3 October to 3 November 1736\u2014and then returned to Quito./nAfter they had come back to Quito, they found that subsidies expected from Paris had not arrived. La Condamine, who had taken precautions and had made a deposit on a bank in Lima, traveled in early 1737 to Lima to collect money. He prolonged this journey somewhat to study the cinchona tree with its medicinally active bark (containing the anti-malarial drug quinine), the tree being hardly known in Europe. Because cinchona only grows at high altitudes the plants did not survive.\nHe described how the plants were brought to France:[6]/nOn June 3rd I spent the whole day on one of these mountains [near Loja in present-day Ecuador]. Though assisted by two Americans of the region whom I took with me as guides, I was able to collect no more than eight or nine young plants of Quinquina [cinchona] in a proper state for transportation. These I had placed in earth taken from the spot in a case of suitable size and had them carried on the shoulders of a man whom I kept constantly in my sight, and then by canoe. I hoped to leave some of the plants at Cayenne [in Guiana] for cultivation and to transport the others to the King's garden in France./nHe collected valuable seeds, sarsparilla, guaiacum, ipecacuanha, cacao, vanilla and simarouba./nAfter returning to Quito on 20 June 1737, he found that Godin refused to disclose his results, whereupon La Condamine joined forces with Bouguer.  The two men continued with their length measurements in the mountainous and inaccessible region close to Quito.  When in December 1741 Bouguer detected an error in a calculation of La Condamine's, the two explorers got into a quarrel and stopped speaking to each other.  However, working separately, the two completed their project in May 1743./nInsufficient funds prevented La Condamine from returning to France directly. Thus La Condamine chose to return by way of the Amazon River, a route which is longer and more dangerous. His was the first scientific exploration of the Amazon. He reached the Atlantic Ocean on 19 September 1743, having made observations of astronomic and topographic interest on the way.  He also made some botanical studies, notably of cinchona and rubber trees./nIn February 1744 he arrived in Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana. He did not dare to travel back to France on a French merchant ship because France was at war (the Austrian Succession War of 1740\u20131748), and he had to wait for five months for a Dutch ship, but made good use of his waiting time by observing and recording physical, biological and ethnological phenomena.  Finally leaving Cayenne in August 1744, he arrived in Amsterdam on 30 November 1744, where he stayed for a while, and arrived in Paris in February 1745. He brought with him many notes, natural history specimens, and art objects that he donated to the naturalist Buffon (1707\u20131788)./nLa Condamine published the results of his measurements and travels with a map of the Amazon in M\u00e9m. de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, 1745 (English translation 1745\u20131747).[4] This included the first descriptions by a European of the Casiquiare canal and the curare arrow poison prepared by the Amerindians. He also noted the correct use of quinine to fight malaria. The journal of his ten-year-long voyage to South America was published in Paris in 1751. The scientific results of the expedition were unambiguous: the Earth is indeed a spheroid flattened at the poles as was believed by Newton./nLa Condamine and Bouguer failed to write a joint publication, and Bouguer's death in 1758 put an end to their relationship. The other expedition member, Godin, died in 1760. Being the only surviving member, he received most of the credit for the expedition which drew a great deal of attention in France, as he was a gifted writer and popularizer./nOn a visit to Rome La Condamine made careful measurements of the ancient buildings with a view to a precise determination of the length of the Roman foot. He also wrote in favour of inoculation, and on various other subjects, mainly connected with his work in South America.[4]/nLa Condamine had contracted smallpox in his youth.  This led him to take part in the debate on variolation against the disease and to propagate inoculation against smallpox. Assisted by the clarity and elegance of his writing, he presented several papers at the Academy of Sciences in which he defended his ideas with passion. He became a corresponding member of the academies of London, Berlin, Saint Petersburg and Bologna, and was elected to the l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 29 November 1760.  In August 1756, he married, with papal dispensation, his young niece Charlotte Bouzier of Estouilly.  La Condamine had many friends, the closest one being Maupertuis, to whom he bequeathed his papers.

In 1984, he and his son Robert collaborated in developing the 'Dubner cruncher', a board which used a commercial finite impulse response filter chip to speed up dramatically the multiplication of medium-sized multi-precision numbers, to levels competitive with supercomputers of the time, though his focus later changed to efficient implementation of FFT-based algorithms on personal computers./nHe found many large prime numbers of special forms: repunits, Fibonacci primes, prime Lucas numbers, twin primes, Sophie Germain primes, Belphegor's prime, and primes in arithmetic progression.[1]  In 1993 he was responsible for more than half the known primes of more than two thousand digits.[citation needed]/nHe also authored Dubner's conjecture./nDubner died on October 23, 2019.[2]", "5006878": "Organizations:/nNicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu, 4 February 1906 \u2013 30 October 1994) was a Romanian mathematician, statistician and economist. He is best known today for his 1971 paper The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, in which he argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. An esteemed professor and educator in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work was decisive for the establishing of ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics./nIn the history of economic thought, Georgescu-Roegen was the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's mineral resources will eventually be exhausted at some indeterminate future point.[1]:\u200a13\u200a[2]:\u200a164f\u200a[3]:\u200a160\u2013171\u200a In his papers, Georgescu-Roegen argued that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the carrying capacity of earth\u00a0\u2013 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels\u00a0\u2013 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of mineral resources is being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the world economy as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse, ultimately bringing about human extinction.[4] Due to the radical pessimism inherent to his work, based on the physical concept of entropy, the theoretical position of Georgescu-Roegen and his followers was later termed 'entropy pessimism'.[5]:\u200a116\u200aAs he brought natural resource flows into economic modelling and analysis, Georgescu-Roegen's work was decisive for the establishing of ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics in the 1980s.[6]:\u200a150f\u200a[7]:\u200a65\u201368\u200a[8]:\u200a422\u200a[9]:\u200a302f/nNicolae Georgescu was born in Constan\u021ba, Romania in 1906. His father, of Greek descent, was an army officer, and his mother, an ethnic Romanian, was a sewing teacher at a girls school. After having lost his position in the army for disciplinary reasons, his father died when Nicolae was only eight years old.[4]:\u200axiv\u200a[10][11]:\u200a1\u20133/nIn primary school, Nicolae excelled at mathematics, and he was encouraged by a teacher to apply for a scholarship at a secondary school, the Lyceum M\u00e2n\u0103stirea Dealu (\"Lyc\u00e9e of the Monastery of the Hill\"), a new military prep school in the town. Nicolae won a scholarship there in 1916, but his attendance was delayed by Romania's entry into World War I. His widowed mother fled with the family to Bucharest, the country's capital, where they stayed with Nicolae's maternal grandmother during the rest of the war.[12]:\u200a9\u201311\u200a[13]:\u200a16\u201320\u200a[14]:\u200a1\u20133/nGeorgescu accepted a scholarship at the University of Bucharest in 1923, and earned the equivalent of a master's degree in mathematics from the university in 1926. In college, he adopted Roegen as an additional last name, using the first and the last letter of his first name, plus the first four letters of his last name, reversed, to create Roegen. Later in his life, he also changed his first name to its French and English form, Nicholas./nAfter a year of teaching as a secondary school teacher in Constanta, Georgescu-Roegen moved to Paris to study at the Sorbonne, following a recommendation from his professor, Traian Lalescu./nGeorgescu-Roegen's stay in Paris broadened his field of study well beyond pure mathematics. Not only did he attend the lectures of the best statistics and economics professors in France, he also immersed himself in the philosophy of science, especially the works of Blaise Pascal, Ernst Mach, and Henri Bergson. Daily life was not easy for a poor foreign student in a great city. The meager means he received from Romania could barely support even his most basic necessities, and French students habitually referred to all foreign students by the derogatory term m\u00e9t\u00e8ques, 'strangers'. But his studies progressed splendidly: in 1930, Georgescu-Roegen defended his doctoral dissertation on how to discover the cyclical components of a phenomenon. He passed with extraordinary honour. \u00c9mile Borel, one of Georgescu-Roegen's professors, thought so highly of the dissertation that he had it published in full as a special issue of a French academic journal.[12]:\u200a11f\u200a[15]:\u200a129f\u200a[14]:\u200a3\u20135\u200a[13]:\u200a20\u201323/nWhile studying in Paris, Georgescu-Roegen learned of the work of Karl Pearson at University College in London. Pearson was a leading English scholar of the time, with a field of interests that coincided with Georgescu-Roegen's own, namely mathematics, statistics, and philosophy of science. Georgescu-Roegen made arrangements to lodge with the family of a young Englishman he had met in Paris and left for England in 1931. During his stay in London, his hosts not only accepted Georgescu-Roegen as their paying guest, but also taught him the basics of the English language, in preparation for his studies in the country./nWhen he approached Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu-Roegen was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There was no more feeling like a m\u00e9t\u00e8que, a stranger. Studying with Pearson for the next two years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu-Roegen's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two became friends, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu-Roegen to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called \"problem of moments\", one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither was able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu-Roegen was pleased by their joint effort nonetheless./nWhile studying in London, Georgescu-Roegen was contacted by a representative of the U.S.-based Rockefeller Foundation. Due to his past academic achievements, the foundation wanted to grant Georgescu-Roegen a research fellowship in the U.S. Georgescu-Roegen had earlier learned of the use of time series analyses by the then famous Harvard Economic Barometer at Harvard University, so he accepted the grant. The trip was put off for about a year, however, as he had more pressing obligations in Romania: He needed to conclude his first national editorial project, a 500-page manual on Metoda Statistic\u0103, and he had to care for his aging widowed mother who was in bad health./nIn autumn 1934, Georgescu-Roegen went to the United States. On arriving at Harvard University, he learned that the Economic Barometer had been shut down years before: The project had completely failed to predict the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and was soon abandoned altogether. After several failed attempts to find another sponsor for his research, Georgescu-Roegen finally managed a meeting with the professor at the university teaching business cycles to see if there were any other opportunities available to him. This professor happened to be Joseph Schumpeter.[12]:\u200a11\u201313\u200a[11]:\u200a3\u20135\u200a[13]:\u200a22\u201324\u200a[14]:\u200a5\u20138/nMeeting Schumpeter at this point completely changed the direction of Georgescu-Roegen's life and career. Schumpeter warmly welcomed Georgescu-Roegen to Harvard, and soon introduced him to the now famous 'circle', one of the most remarkable groups of economists ever working at the same institution, including Wassily Leontief, Oskar Lange, Fritz Machlup, and Nicholas Kaldor, among others. Georgescu-Roegen was now in a stimulating intellectual environment with weekly evening gatherings and informal academic discussions, where Schumpeter himself presided as the 'ringmaster' of the circle. In Schumpeter, Georgescu-Roegen had found a competent and sympathetic mentor. Although Georgescu-Roegen never formally enrolled in any economics classes, this was how he became an economist: \"Schumpeter turned me into an economist ... My only degree in economics is from Universitas Schumpeteriana.\"[15]:\u200a130/nWhile at Harvard, Georgescu-Roegen published four important papers, laying the foundations for his later theories of consumption and production.[16][17][18][19] The scholarly quality of these articles impressed Schumpeter./nGeorgescu-Roegen's trip to the U.S. was not all spent at Harvard. He managed to obtain a modest stipend for himself and his wife Otilia that enabled them to travel about the country, journeying as far as California. Through Schumpeter's contacts, Georgescu-Roegen had the opportunity to meet Irving Fisher, Harold Hotelling, and other leading economists of the day. He also met Albert Einstein at Princeton University./nDuring his stay, Georgescu-Roegen's relationship with Schumpeter developed. Realising that Georgescu-Roegen was a promising young scholar, Schumpeter wanted to keep him at Harvard. He offered Georgescu-Roegen a position with the economics faculty, and asked him to work with him on an economics treatise as a joint effort, but Georgescu-Roegen declined. He wanted to go back to Romania in order to serve his backward fatherland that had sponsored most of his education so far; besides, his return was expected at home. Later in his life, Georgescu-Roegen would regret having turned down Schumpeter's generous offer at this point in his career.[15]:\u200a132\u200a[14]:\u200a7f/nIn spring 1936, Georgescu-Roegen left the U.S. His voyage back to Romania came to last almost a year in itself, as he paid a long visit to Friedrich Hayek and John Hicks at the London School of Economics on the way home. He was in no hurry to return./nFrom 1937 to 1948, Georgescu-Roegen lived in Romania, where he witnessed all the turmoil of World War II and the subsequent rise to power of the communists in the country. During the war, Georgescu-Roegen lost his only brother due to a fatal reaction to a tuberculosis vaccine.[12]:\u200a13f\u200a[11]:\u200a5\u20137\u200a[14]:\u200a8\u201310/nUpon his return from the U.S. to Bucharest, Georgescu-Roegen was soon appointed to several government posts. His doctoral dissertation from Sorbonne as well as his other academic credentials earned him a respectable reputation everywhere, and his fine French and English skills were needed in the foreign affairs department. He became vice-director of the Central Statistical Institute, responsible for compiling data on the country's foreign trade on a daily basis; he also served on the National Board of Trade, settling commercial agreements with the major foreign powers; he even participated in the diplomatic negotiations concerning the reassignment of Romania's national borders with Hungary./nGeorgescu-Roegen engaged himself in politics and joined the pro-monarchy National Peasants' Party. The country's economy was still underdeveloped and had a large agrarian base, where the mass of the peasantry lived in backwardness and poverty. Substantial land reforms were called for if the most appalling inequalities between the rural and the urban parts of the population were to be evened out. Georgescu-Roegen put a persuasive effort into this work and was soon elevated to the higher ranks of the party, becoming member of the party's National Council./nGeorgescu-Roegen did only little academic work during this period of his life. Apart from co-editing the national encyclopedia, the Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei, and reporting on the country's economic situation in some minor statistics publications, he published nothing of scholarly significance. Although he did reside in his native country, Georgescu-Roegen would later refer to this period of his life as his Romanian 'exile': The exile was an intellectual one for him./nBy the end of the war, Romania was occupied by the Soviet Union. A trusted government official and a leading member of an influential political party, Georgescu-Roegen was appointed general secretary of the Armistice Commission, responsible for negotiating the conditions for peace with the occupying power. The negotiations dragged out for half a year and came to involve long and stressful discussions: During most of the war, Romania had been an Axis power allied with Nazi Germany, so the Soviet representatives treated the commission as nothing but a vehicle for levying the largest possible amount of war reparations on the Romanian people./n/nAfter the war, political forces in the country began encroaching on Georgescu-Roegen. Before and during the war, Romania had already passed through three successive dictatorships, and the fourth one was now imminent. Plenty of items on Georgescu-Roegen's track record were suitable for antagonising both the native Romanian communists and the Soviet authorities that still occupied the country: His top membership of the Peasants' Party, in open opposition to the Communist Party; his chief negotiating position in the Armistice Commission, defending Romania's sovereignty against the occupying power; and his earlier affiliation with capitalist US as a Rockefeller research fellow at Harvard University. Political repression in the country intensified as the rise to power of the communists was completing, and Georgescu-Roegen finally realised it was time to get away: \"... I had to flee Romania before I was thrown into a jail from which no one has ever come out alive.\"[15]:\u200a133\u200a By the aid of the Jewish community\u00a0\u2013 he had earlier risked his neck by helping the Jews during the Romanian part of the Holocaust\u00a0\u2013 Georgescu-Roegen and his wife got hold of counterfeit identity cards that secured them the passage out of the country, surrounded by bribed smugglers and stowed away in the hold of a freighter heading for Turkey./nHaving visited Turkey before on official business, Georgescu-Roegen was able to use his contacts there to notify Schumpeter and Leontief at Harvard University in the U.S. about his flight. Leontief offered Georgescu-Roegen a position at Harvard, and made the necessary arrangements for the couple in advance of their arrival there./nAfter a journey from Turkey through continental Europe, Georgescu-Roegen and his wife reached Cherbourg in France, from where they crossed the Atlantic by ship. Georgescu-Roegen's arrival at Harvard in summer 1948 was something of a return for him there. Only now, the circumstances were very different from what they had been in the 1930s: He was no longer a promising young scholar on a trip abroad, supported and sponsored by his native country; instead, he was a middle-aged political refugee who had fled a communist dictatorship behind the Iron Curtain. Yet, he was welcomed at Harvard just the same, obtaining employment as a lecturer and research associate, collaborating with Wassily Leontief on the Harvard Economic Research Project and other subjects. This was not a permanent employment, however.[12]:\u200a14\u201318\u200a[13]:\u200a24\u201327/nWhile working at Harvard, Georgescu-Roegen was approached by Vanderbilt University, who offered him a permanent academic chair as economics professor. Georgescu-Roegen accepted the offer and moved to Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee in 1949. It has been argued that Georgescu-Roegen's decision to move from Harvard to the permanence and stability of the less prestigious Vanderbilt was motivated by his precarious wartime experiences and his feeling of insecurity as a political refugee in his new country.[12]:\u200a14f\u200a It has also been argued that Joseph Schumpeter had at this point lost most of his former influence that could have secured Georgescu-Roegen a permanent position at Harvard (Schumpeter died in 1950).[14]:\u200a11\u200a Georgescu-Roegen remained at Vanderbilt until his retirement in 1976 at age 70. Except for short trips, he would never leave Nashville again./nDuring his years at Vanderbilt University, Georgescu-Roegen pursued an impressive academic career. He held numerous visiting appointments and research fellowships across the continents, and served as editor of a range of academic journals, including the Econometrica. He received several academic honours, including the distinguished Harvie Branscomb Award, presented in 1967 by his employer, Vanderbilt University. In 1971, the very same year his magnum opus was published, he was honoured as Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association.[12]:\u200a16/nIn the early-1960s, Georgescu-Roegen had Herman Daly as a student.[9]:\u200a305\u200a Daly later went on to become a leading ecological economist as well as the economists profession's most faithful, persistent and influential proponent of the economics of Georgescu-Roegen.[20]:\u200a7\u201312\u200a[6][21][22]:\u200a61\u201376\u200a[23][24]:\u200a545f\u200a However, Georgescu-Roegen, for his part, would later turn critical of his student's work (see below)./nThe publication of Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus in 1971 did not trigger any immediate debates in the mainstream of the economics profession, and the only review in a leading mainstream journal warned the readers against the \"incorrect statements and philosophical generalisations\" made by the author; but Georgescu-Roegen did receive four favourable reviews from heterodox, evolutionary economists.[25]:\u200a2274/n/nThrough the 1970s, Georgescu-Roegen had a short-lived cooperation with the Club of Rome. Whereas Georgescu-Roegen's own magnum opus went largely unnoticed by mainstream (neoclassical) economists, the report on The Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by the Club of Rome, created something of a stir in the economics profession.[26] In the heated controversies that followed the report, Georgescu-Roegen found himself largely on the same side as the club, and opposed to the mainstream economists. Teaming up with a natural ally, he approached the club and became a member there. Georgescu-Roegen's theoretical work came to influence the club substantially. One other important result of the cooperation was the publication of the pointed and polemical article on Energy and Economic Myths, where Georgescu-Roegen took issue with mainstream economists and various other debaters.[27] This article found a large audience through the 1970s. Later, the cooperation with the club waned: Georgescu-Roegen reproached the club for not adopting a definite anti-growth political stance; he was also sceptical of the club's elitist and technocratic fashion of attempting to monitor and guide global social reality by building numerous abstract computer simulations of the world economy, and then publish all the findings to the general public. In the early-1980s, the parties finally split up.[25][14]:\u200a33f\u200a[28]:\u200a11f/nIn continental Europe, Georgescu-Roegen and his work gained influence from the 1970s. When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher Jacques Grinevald.[29]:\u200a15f\u200a The ensuing cooperation and friendship between the two resulted in the French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled Demain la d\u00e9croissance: Entropie \u2013 \u00c9cologie \u2013 \u00c9conomie (\"Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy \u2013 Ecology \u2013 Economy\"), published in 1979.[30][note 1] Similar to his involvement with the Club of Rome (see above), Georgescu-Roegen's article on Energy and Economic Myths came to play a crucial role in the dissemination of his views among the later followers of the degrowth movement.[27][24]:\u200a544\u200a In the 1980s, Georgescu-Roegen met and befriended Catalan agricultural economist and historian of economic thought Juan Mart\u00ednez-Alier, who would soon after become a driving force in the establishing of both the International Society for Ecological Economics and the degrowth movement.[9]:\u200a307\u2013310\u200a[31]:\u200a2\u200a Since the degrowth movement formed in France and Italy in the early-2000s, leading French champion of the movement Serge Latouche has credited Georgescu-Roegen for being a \"main theoretical source of degrowth.\"[32]:\u200a13\u201316\u200a Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist Mauro Bonaiuti has considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be \"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.\"[14]:\u200axi/nApart from his involvement with the Club of Rome and a few European scholars, Georgescu-Roegen remained a solitary man throughout the years at Vanderbilt. He rarely discussed his ongoing work with colleagues and students, and he collaborated in very few joint projects during his career. In addition, several independent sources confirm the observation that Georgescu-Roegen's uncompromising personality and bad temper made him a rather unpleasant acquaintance to deal with. His blunt and demanding behaviour tended to offend most people in academia and elsewhere, thereby undermining his influence and standing.[12]:\u200a16\u201318\u200a[21]:\u200a126f\u200a[33]:\u200axvii\u200a[9]:\u200a310f\u200a[13][25]/nOn Georgescu-Roegen's formal retirement in 1976, a symposium in his honour was organised by three of his colleagues at Vanderbilt, and the papers presented there were later published as an anthology.[34] No fewer than four Nobel Prize laureates were among the contributing economists;[6]:\u200a150\u200a but none of the colleagues from Georgescu-Roegen's department at Vanderbilt participated, a fact that has since been taken as evidence of his social and academic isolation at the place.[13]:\u200a14f/nAfter Georgescu-Roegen's formal retirement from Vanderbilt in 1976, he continued to live and work as an emeritus in his home in Nashville until his death in 1994. Through these later years, he wrote several articles and papers, expanding on and developing his views.[35][36][37][38][39] He also corresponded extensively with his few friends and former colleagues.[14]:\u200a222\u2013241/nIn 1988, Georgescu-Roegen was invited to join the editorial board of the newly established academic journal Ecological Economics, published by the International Society for Ecological Economics; but although most of the people organising the journal and the society recognised and admired Georgescu-Roegen's work, he turned down the invitation: He regarded both the journal and the society as nothing but vehicles for promoting concepts like sustainable development and steady-state economics, concepts he himself dismissed as misdirected and wrong (see below, both here and here). Georgescu-Roegen had more ambitious goals in mind: He wanted to overturn and replace the prevailing, but flawed, mainstream paradigm of neoclassical economics with his own 'bioeconomics' (see below); to downscale (degrow) the economy as soon as possible (see below); and not merely be relegated to some arcane and insignificant\u00a0\u2013 so he believed\u00a0\u2013 economics sub-discipline such as ecological economics.[24]:\u200a547\u200a[25]:\u200a2271\u200a[14]:\u200a41\u201348\u200a[40]:\u200a146/nGeorgescu-Roegen lived long enough to survive the communist dictatorship in Romania he had fled earlier in his life (see above). He even received some late recognition from his fatherland: In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent Romanian Revolution in 1989, Georgescu-Roegen was elected to the Romanian Academy in Bucharest. He was pleased by his election.[12]:\u200a16/nHis last years were marked by seclusion and withdrawal from the world. By now, Georgescu-Roegen was an old man. Although he had a productive and successful academic career behind him, he was disappointed that his work had not received the dissemination and recognition he had expected for it in his own lifetime. He believed he had long been running against a current. As he likened himself to one unlucky heretic and legendary martyr of science out of the Italian Renaissance, Georgescu-Roegen grumbled and exclaimed: \"E pur si muove is ordinarily attributed to Galileo, although those words were the last ones uttered by Giordano Bruno on the burning stake!\"[15]:\u200a154\u200a He came to realise that he had failed in his life's work to warn the general public and change people's minds about the looming mineral resource exhaustion he himself was very concerned about. He finally grasped that philosophical pessimism may well be a stance favoured by a few solitary intellectuals like himself, but such a stance is normally shunned like a taboo in wider human culture: \"[A] considered pessimist is looked upon as a bearer of bad news and ... is not welcomed ever ...\", he lamented.[41]:\u200a165\u200a Yet, in spite of his deep disappointment and frustration, he continued to write down and propagate his views as long as he was physically able to do so.[42]:\u200a79/nBy the end, his health deteriorated. He was becoming rather deaf, and complications caused by his diabetes rendered him unable to climb stairs. In his final years, he isolated himself completely. He cut off all human contact, even to those of his former colleagues and students who appreciated his contribution to economics. He died bitter and (almost) lonely in his home at the age of 88. His wife Otilia survived him by some four years. The couple had no children.[6]:\u200a154\u200a[12]:\u200a18\u200a[14]:\u200a37\u200a At his express request, his ashes were brought to Romania and deposited at Bellu Cemetery, in the sector reserved for academics.[43]/nIn his obituary essay on Georgescu-Roegen, Herman Daly wrote admirably of his deceased teacher and mentor, concluding that \"He demanded a lot, but he gave more.\"[6]:\u200a154\u200a In another obituary article, Georgescu-Roegen was hailed for the \"novelty and importance of his contributions\", for which he should have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics.[44]:\u200a705/nIn his work as an economist, Georgescu-Roegen was influenced by the philosophy of Ernst Mach and the later school of logical positivism derived from Mach. Georgescu-Roegen found that two of his other main sources of inspiration, namely Karl Pearson and Albert Einstein, also had a largely Machian outlook. \"My philosophy is in spirit Machian: it is ... mainly [concerned] with the problem of valid analytical representations of the relations among facts.\"[15]:\u200a129f\u200a Much of his criticism of both neoclassical economics and of Marxism was based on this outlook.[12]:\u200a40/nComing to the U.S. after World War II, Georgescu-Roegen's background soon put him at odds with the dominant theoretical school of neoclassical economics in the country. Having lived in Romania, an underdeveloped and peasant-dominated economy, he realised that neoclassical economics could explain only those social conditions that prevailed in advanced capitalist economies, but not in other institutional settings. He was also critical of the increasing use of abstract algebraic formalism grounded in no facts of social reality. Both of these issues made him attentive to social phenomena that were either overlooked or misrepresented by mainstream neoclassical economic analysis.[15]:\u200a129f\u200a[25]:\u200a2273/nIt has been argued that an unbroken path runs from Georgescu-Roegen's work in pure theory in the early years, through his writings on peasant economies in the 1960s, leading to his preoccupation with entropy and bioeconomics in the last 25 years of his life.[45]:\u200a137f/nAccording to Georgescu-Roegen's own recollection, the ideas presented in his paradigmatic magnum opus were worked out in his mind over a period of twenty years or so before the final publication.[4]:\u200axiv\u200a The three most important sources of inspiration for his work were \u00c9mile Borel's monograph on thermodynamics he had read while studying in Paris (see above); Joseph Schumpeter's view that irreversible evolutionary changes are inherent in capitalism; and the Romanian historical record of the large oil refineries in Ploie\u0219ti becoming target of strategic military attacks in both world wars, proving the importance of natural resources in social conflict.[15]:\u200a146,\u200a153\u200a[41]:\u200a161f\u200a[45]:\u200a139f\u200a[39]:\u200a185f,\u200a196f\u200a[11]:\u200a6/nGeorgescu-Roegen outlines that both main streams of economic thought having dominated the world since the end of the 19th century\u00a0\u2013 namely neoclassical economics and Marxism\u00a0\u2013 share the shortcoming of not taking into account the importance of natural resources in man's economy.[4]:\u200a2\u200a Hence, Georgescu-Roegen engages himself in an intellectual battle with two fronts./nThe physical theory of thermodynamics is based on two laws: The first law states that energy is neither created nor destroyed in any isolated system (a conservation principle). The second law of thermodynamics\u00a0\u2013 also known as the entropy law\u00a0\u2013 states that in an isolated system, entropy, a measure of the disorder in a system, normally cannot decrease./nGeorgescu-Roegen argues that the relevance of thermodynamics to economics stems from the physical fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it. The usual economic terms of 'production' and 'consumption' are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process\u00a0\u2013 everything is being transformed.[4]:\u200a280/nThermodynamics has relevance to cosmology via the hypothesis of the heat death of the universe.  Georgescu-Roegen sees the transformation of energy\u00a0\u2013 whether in nature or in human society\u00a0\u2013 as moving the universe closer towards a final state of inert physical, statistical uniformity and maximum entropy. Georgescu-Roegen argues from this inspiration from cosmology that humanity's economic activities shorten the time frame to planetary heat death, locally on Earth.[4]:\u200a276\u2013283\u200a This view on the economy was later termed 'entropy pessimism'.[5]:\u200a116\u200a Some of Georgescu-Roegen's followers and interpreters have elaborated on this view.[46]:\u200a33\u201343\u200a[47]:\u200a107\u2013112\u200a[48]:\u200a46\u201349\u200a[49]:\u200a106\u2013109/nGeorgescu-Roegen's principal argument is that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality. Introducing the term 'low entropy' for valuable natural resources, and the term 'high entropy' for valueless waste and pollution, Georgescu-Roegen explains that all the economic process does from a physical point of view is to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy, thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on. The irreversibility of this economic process is the reason why natural resources are scarce: Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources plus an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat (according to the entropy law).[4]:\u200a277\u2013282/nGeorgescu-Roegen points out that the earth is a closed system in the thermodynamic sense of the term: the earth exchanges energy, but not matter (practically) with the rest of the universe. Hence, mainly two sources of low entropy are available to man, namely the stock of mineral resources in the crust of the earth; and the flow of radiation, received from the sun. Since the sun will continue to shine for billions of years to come, the earth's mineral stock is the scarcer one of these two main sources of low entropy. Whereas the stock of minerals may be extracted from the crust of the earth at a rate of our own choosing (practically), the flow of solar radiation arrives at the surface of the earth at a constant and fixed rate, beyond human control, Georgescu-Roegen maintains. This natural 'asymmetry' between man's access to the stock of minerals and the flow of solar energy accounts for the historical contrast between urban and rural life: The busy urban life, on the one hand, is associated with industry and the impatient extraction of minerals; the tranquil rural life, on the other hand, is associated with agriculture and the patient reception of the fixed flow of solar energy. Georgescu-Roegen argues that this 'asymmetry' helps explain the historical subjection of the countryside by the town since the dawn of civilisation, and he criticises Karl Marx for not taking this subjection properly into account in his theory of historical materialism.[4]:\u200a313/nGeorgescu-Roegen explains that modern mechanised agriculture has developed historically as a result of the growing pressure of population on arable land; but the relief of this pressure by means of mechanisation has only substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture\u00a0\u2013 and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it\u00a0\u2013 almost as dependent on earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of earth is decreasing.[4]:\u200a303\u200a[46]:\u200a136\u2013140\u200a[2]:\u200a163f\u200a[3]:\u200a20\u201344\u200a[50]:\u200a10f\u200a In effect, overpopulation on earth is largely a dynamic long run phenomenon, being a by-product of ever more constraining mineral scarcities.[4]:\u200a20f\u200a[51]:\u200a32\u201334/nGeorgescu-Roegen's model of the economy grew out of his dissatisfaction with neoclassical production theory as well as the input-output model of the economy, developed by Nobel Prize laureate Wassily Leontief. Georgescu-Roegen realised that production cannot be adequately described by stocks of equipment and inventories only, or by flows of inputs and outputs only. It was necessary to combine these two descriptions. In order to complete the picture, it was also necessary to add the new concept of a \"fund\".[12]:\u200a65\u201371\u200a [45]:\u200a147\u2013149\u200a [22]:\u200a70\u201372\u200a [52]:\u200a106\u2013109/nIn Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund model of production, a fund factor is either labour power, farmland, or man-made capital providing a useful service at any point in time. A \"stock\" factor is a material or energy input that can be decumulated at will; a \"flow\" factor is a stock spread out over a period of time. The fund factors constitute the agents of the economic process, and the flow factors are used or acted upon by these agents. Unlike a stock factor, a fund factor cannot be used (decumulated) at will, as its rate of utilisation depends on the distinct physical properties of the fund (labour power and farmland, for instance, may run the risk of overuse and exhaustion if proper care is not taken)./nContrary to neoclassical production theory, Georgescu-Roegen identifies nature as the exclusive primary source of all factors of production. According to the first law of thermodynamics, matter and energy are neither created nor destroyed in the economy (the conservation principle). According to the second law of thermodynamics\u00a0\u2013 the entropy law\u00a0\u2013 what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes to states unavailable for human purposes (the degradation principle). This transformation constitutes a unidirectional and irreversible process. Consequently, valuable natural resources (\"low entropy\") are procured by the input end of the economy; the resources flow through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; and unvaluable waste and pollution (\"high entropy\") eventually accumulate by the output end. Humankind lives in, by, and of nature, and we return our residues to nature. By so doing, the entropy of the combined nature-economy system steadily increases./nThe presence of natural resource flows in Georgescu-Roegen's model of production (production function) differentiates the model from those of both Keynesian macroeconomics, neoclassical economics, as well as classical economics, including most\u00a0\u2013 though not all\u00a0\u2013 variants of Marxism.[note 2] Only in ecological economics are natural resource flows positively recognised as a valid theoretical basis for economic modelling and analysis.[3]:\u200a1\u20133\u200a[7]:\u200a57\u201362\u200a[56]:\u200a266\u2013268/nLater, Georgescu-Roegen's production model formed the basis of his criticism of neoclassical economics (see below)./nFrom the 1980s, numerous economists have been working on Georgesu-Roegen's flow-fund model.[note 3] In 1992, Mario Morroni presented a development of the flow-fund model for applied analysis.[59] This model has been implemented in some case studies regarding the textile industry, electronic devices for telecommunication industry,[59][68] shoe industry,[69] and tie industry.[70]/nIn his social theory, Georgescu-Roegen argues that man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of his biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This biological struggle has prevailed since the dawn of man, and the nature of the struggle was not altered by the invention of money as a medium of exchange. Unlike animals, man has developed exosomatic instruments, that is, tools and equipment. These instruments are produced by man and are not a part of his body. At the same time, production is a social, and not an individual, undertaking. This situation has turned man's struggle to sustain life and survive into a social conflict which is unique when compared to animals. Contrasting his own view with those of Karl Marx, Georgescu-Roegen asserts:/n[L]ike Marx, I believe that the social conflict is not a mere creation of man without any root in material human conditions. But unlike Marx, I consider that, precisely because the conflict has such a basis, it can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind.[4]:\u200a306/nWhen man (some men) attempts to radically change the distribution of access to material resources in society, this may result in wars or revolutions, Georgescu-Roegen admits; but even though wars and revolutions may bring about the intended redistributions, man's economic struggle and the social conflict will remain. There will be rulers and ruled in any social order, and the ruling is largely a continuation of the biological struggle of sustaining life and survive, Georgescu-Roegen claims. Under these material conditions, the ruling classes of past and present have always resorted to force, ideology and manipulation to defend their privileges and maintain the acquiescence of the ruled. This historical fact does not end with  communism, Georgescu-Roegen points out; quite the opposite, it goes on during communism, and beyond it as well. It would be contrary to man's biological nature to organise himself otherwise.[4]:\u200a306\u2013315\u200a[12]:\u200a120\u2013124\u200a[71]/nLater, Georgescu-Roegen introduced the term 'bioeconomics' (short for 'biological economics') to describe his view that man's economic struggle is a continuation of the biological struggle.[27]:\u200a369\u200a[15]:\u200a152\u2013154\u200a[45]:\u200a149\u200a[48]:\u200a1f\u200a In his final years, he planned to write a book on the subject of bioeconomics, but due to old age, he was unable to complete it.[12]:\u200a120\u200a He did manage to write a sketch on it, though.[36]/nGeorgescu-Roegen takes a dismal view on human nature and the future of mankind. On the one hand, his general argument is that the carrying capacity of earth\u00a0\u2013 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels\u00a0\u2013 is decreasing as earth's finite stock of mineral resources are being extracted and put to use; but on the other hand, he finds that restraining ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of future generations runs counter to our biological nature as a species. We cannot help ourselves. Consequently, the world economy will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse. From that point on, he predicts, ever deepening scarcities will cause widespread misery, aggravate social conflict throughout the globe, and intensify man's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood. A prolonged 'biological spasm' of our species will follow, ultimately spelling the end of mankind itself, as man has already become completely and irreversibly dependent on the industrial economy for his biological existence. We are not going to make it. We are doomed to downfall, destruction, and demise. Predicts Georgescu-Roegen:/nIf we abstract from other causes that may knell the death bell of the human species, it is clear that natural resources represent the limitative factor as concerns the life span of that species. ... By using these resources too quickly, man throws away that part of solar energy that will still be reaching the Earth for a long time after he has departed. And everything man has done during the last two hundred years or so puts him in the position of a fantastic spendthrift. ... The realization of these truths will not make man willing to become less impatient and less prone to hollow wants.[4]:\u200a21\u200a ... Population pressure and technological progress bring ceteris paribus the career of the human species nearer to its end only because both factors cause a speedier decumulation of its dowry [of mineral resources]. ... [W]e must not doubt that, man's nature being what it is, the destiny of the human species is to choose a truly great but brief, not a long and dull, career.[4]:\u200a304/nGeorgescu-Roegen's radically pessimistic 'existential risk' perspective on global mineral resource exhaustion was later countered by Robert Ayres (see below).[72]/nIn the years following the publication of his magnum opus in 1971 and until his death in 1994, Georgescu-Roegen published a number of articles and essays where he further expanded on and developed his views.[note 4]/nCriticising neoclassical economics, Georgescu-Roegen argues that neoclassical production theory is false when representing the economy as a mechanical, circular and closed system, with no inlets and no outlets.[27]:\u200a347f\u200a A misrepresentation such as this fails to take into account the exhaustion of mineral resources at the input end, and the building up of waste and pollution at the output end. In Georgescu-Roegen's view, the economy is represented more accurately by his own flow-fund model of production (see above)./nIn addition, Georgescu-Roegen finds that neoclassical economics tends to overlook, or, at best, to misrepresent the problem of how to allocate the exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations. Georgescu-Roegen points out that the market mechanisms of supply and demand are systematically unable to work out the intergenerational allocation problem in a satisfactory way, since future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. This anomaly of the market mechanisms\u00a0\u2013 or ecological market failure\u00a0\u2013 is described by Georgescu-Roegen as 'a dictatorship of the present over the future'.[27]:\u200a375\u200a[73]:\u200a105\u200a[51]:\u200a33f\u200a[3]:\u200a156\u2013160\u200a[40]:\u200a143f\u200a On this issue, notable economists and Nobel Prize laureates Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz, Georgescu-Roegen's two main adversaries in academia in the 1970s, have stated their account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to the economics of exhaustible resources: They both claim that across the board substitutability of man-made capital for natural capital constitutes a real possibility. Hence, any concern with intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock should be relaxed somewhat (according to Solow);[74]:\u200a366f\u200a or even ignored altogether (according to Stiglitz).[75]:\u200a61f/nThe position of Solow and Stiglitz (as well as other, like-minded theorists in the neoclassical tradition) was later termed 'weak sustainability' by environmental economist Kerry Turner.[76]:\u200a9\u201313/nIn response to the position of Solow and Stiglitz, Georgescu-Roegen argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and energy resources in the economic process. This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu-Roegen's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. Energy resources, on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist\u00a0\u2013 usually as fuel or electricity\u00a0\u2013 in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu-Roegen's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a flow factor (resources transformed in the economy); but never that of a fund factor (man-made capital in the economy). Hence, substituting man-made capital for energy resources is physically impossible./nFurthermore, not all material resources are transformed into man-made capital; instead, some material resources are manufactured directly into consumer goods having only a limited durability. Finally, in the course of time, all man-made capital depreciates, wears out and needs replacement; but both old and new man-made capital is made out of material resources to begin with. All in all, the economic process is indeed a process with steadily increasing entropy, and the 'mechanical' notion of across the board substitutability prevalent in neoclassical economics is untenable, Georgescu-Roegen submits.[27]:\u200a359\u2013363\u200a[73]:\u200a98\u200a[21]:\u200a127\u2013136\u200a[71]/nContrary to the neoclassical position, Georgescu-Roegen argues that flow factors and fund factors (that is, natural resources and man-made capital) are essentially complementary, since both are needed in the economic process in order to have a working economy. Georgescu-Roegen's conclusion, then, is that the allocation of exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations is a large problem that cannot, and should not, be relaxed or ignored: \"There seems to be no way to do away with the dictatorship of the present over the future, although we may aim at making it as bearable as possible.\"[73]:\u200a105\u200a Georgescu-Roegen's followers and interpreters have since been discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way\u00a0\u2013 or only little way\u00a0\u2013 of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction. In effect, any conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.[20]:\u200a369\u2013371\u200a[46]:\u200a253\u2013256\u200a[2]:\u200a165\u200a[3]:\u200a168\u2013171\u200a[45]:\u200a150\u2013153\u200a[49]:\u200a106\u2013109\u200a[24]:\u200a546\u2013549\u200a[40]:\u200a142\u2013145\u200a This approach to mankind's prospects is absent in neoclassical economics./nThe position of Georgescu-Roegen, including his criticism of neoclassical economics, was later termed 'strong sustainability' by Kerry Turner.[76]:\u200a13\u201315\u200a Later still, Turner's taxonomy of 'weak' and 'strong' sustainability was integrated into ecological economics.[77]:\u200a205\u2013209\u200a[78]:\u200a14\u201319\u200a[5]:\u200a115f\u200a[79][80] However, contrary to the widely established use of Turner's simplifying taxonomy, Georgescu-Roegen never referred to his own position as 'strong sustainability' or any other variant of sustainability. Quite the opposite. Georgescu-Roegen flatly dismissed any notion of sustainable development as only so much 'snake oil' intended to deceive the general public.[45]:\u200a153\u200a[24]:\u200a547\u200a In his last years, he even denounced the notion bitterly as \"one of the most toxic recipes for mankind\": It is a gross contradiction in terms to speak of a 'sustainable' rate of extraction and use of a finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources\u00a0\u2013 any rate will obviously reduce the remaining stock itself.[14]:\u200a239f\u200a Consequently, the Industrial Revolution as a whole has brought about unsustainable economic development in the world (see below)./nLeading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly is a former student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Georgescu-Roegen. In the 1970s, Daly developed the concept of a steady-state economy, by which he understands an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (man-made capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a minimal flow of natural resources (or 'throughput', as he terms it). Daly argues that this steady-state economy is both necessary and desirable in order to keep human environmental impact within biophysical limits (however defined), and to create more allocational fairness between present and future generations with regard to mineral resource use.[20] In several articles, Georgescu-Roegen criticised his student's concept of a steady-state economy.[27]:\u200a366\u2013369\u200a[35]:\u200a270\u200a[73]:\u200a102\u2013105\u200a[41]:\u200a167f\u200a[39]:\u200a194\u200a[24]:\u200a547\u200a[40]:\u200a140\u2013148/nGeorgescu-Roegen argues that Daly's steady-state economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially not in the longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the earth, prospecting for and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics will work itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu-Roegen points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu-Roegen also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state./nInstead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring quantitative restrictions even more severe than those propounded by Daly.[27]:\u200a374\u2013379\u200a[45]:\u200a150\u2013153\u200a[28]:\u200a13f\u200a[40]:\u200a142\u2013146\u200a[note 5]/nHerman Daly on his part has readily accepted his teacher's judgement on this subject matter: In order to compensate for the principle of diminishing returns in mineral resource extraction, an ever greater share of capital and labour in the economy will gradually have to be transferred to the mining sector, thereby skewing the initial structure of any steady-state system. Even more important is it that the steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion anyway. \"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\", Daly concedes in his response to Georgescu-Roegen's criticism. In the same turn, Daly confirms Georgescu-Roegen's general argument that earth's carrying capacity is decreasing as mankind is extracting the finite mineral stock.[20]:\u200a369\u2013371/nLikewise, several other economists in the field besides Georgescu-Roegen and Daly have agreed that a steady-state economy does not by itself constitute a long-term solution to the 'entropy problem' facing mankind.[51]:\u200a30\u201334\u200a[2]:\u200a165\u2013167\u200a[81]:\u200a90f\u200a[47]:\u200a105\u2013107\u200a[42]:\u200a75f\u200a[82]:\u200a270\u200a[24]:\u200a548\u200a[50]:\u200a37/nIn his technology assessments, Georgescu-Roegen puts thermodynamic principles to use in a wider historical context, including the future of mankind.[37]:\u200a1041\u20131055\u200a [83][38]:\u200a14\u201318\u200a [39]:\u200a195f\u200a [77]:\u200a218f\u200a [12]:\u200a124\u2013126/nAccording to Georgescu-Roegen's terminology, a technology is 'viable' only when it is able to return an energy surplus sufficiently large to maintain its own operation, plus some additional energy left over for other use. If this criterion is not met, the technology in question is only 'feasible' (if workable at all), but not 'viable'. Both viable and feasible technologies depend on a steady flow of natural resources for their operation./nGeorgescu-Roegen argues that the first viable technology in human history was fire. By controlling fire, it was possible for man to burn a forest, or all forests. It was also possible to cook food and to obtain warmth and protection. Inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, Georgescu-Roegen terms fire 'the first Promethean recipe'. According to Georgescu-Roegen, a later important Promethean recipe (technology) of the same (first) kind was animal husbandry, feeding on grass and other biomass (like fire does)./n/nMuch later in the history of man, the steam engine came about as the crucial Promethean recipe of the second kind, feeding on coal. The invention of the steam engine made it possible to drain the groundwater flooding the mine shafts, and the mined coal could then be used as fuel for other steam engines in turn. This technology propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, whereby man's economy has been thrust into a long, never-to-return overshoot-and-collapse trajectory with regard to the earth's mineral stock. Georgescu-Roegen lists the internal combustion engine and the nuclear fission reactor as other, later examples of Promethean recipes of the second kind, namely heat engines feeding on a mineral fuel (oil and uranium (plus thorium), respectively)./nBy a Promethean recipe of the third kind, Georgescu-Roegen understands a solar collector returning a net energy output sufficiently large to supply all the energy input needed to manufacture an additional solar collector of the same kind, thereby constituting a full serial reproduction with regard to solar energy only. The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale for more than a century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu-Roegen to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day. Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available, functioning like what he labelled 'parasites' with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation\u00a0\u2013 and like any other parasite, these recipes cannot survive their host (the 'host' being the sources of the terrestrial inputs). Georgescu-Roegen believed that for a worldwide solar-powered economy to be truly energy self-supporting, a Promethean kind of solar collector had yet to be invented.[37]:\u200a1053\u20131055\u200a[15]:\u200a151\u200a[39]:\u200a196\u200a Later, some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu-Roegen made these assessments.[72]:\u200a479f\u200a[84]:\u200a176f/nGeorgescu-Roegen further points out that regardless of the efficiency of any particular kind of solar collector, the major drawback of solar power per se when compared to terrestrial fossil fuels and uranium (plus thorium) is the diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation. Hence, a lot of material equipment is needed as inputs at the surface of the earth to collect, concentrate and (when convenient) store or transform the radiation before it can be put to use on a larger industrial scale. This necessary material equipment adds to the 'parasitical' operation of solar power, Georgescu-Roegen maintains.[37]:\u200a1050\u200a[46]:\u200a196\u2013204\u200a[77]:\u200a219\u200a[50]:\u200a12f/nAssessing fusion power as a possible future source of energy, Georgescu-Roegen ventured the opinion that, regarding magnetic confinement fusion, no reactor will ever be built to be large enough to effectively withstand and confine the vehement thermal pressure of the plasmic deuterium/tritium fusion processes through an extended period of time (which is a prerequisite for the 'viability' of this technology).[39]:\u200a196\u200a He did not assess the other one of the two major fusion power technologies being researched in his day\u00a0\u2013 and still being researched\u00a0\u2013 namely inertial confinement fusion./nAll of these technology assessments have to do with energy resources only, and not with material resources. Georgescu-Roegen stressed the point that even with the proliferation of solar collectors throughout the surface of the globe, or the advent of fusion power, or both, any industrial economy will still depend on a steady flow of material resources extracted from the crust of the earth, notably metals. He repeatedly argued his case that in the (far) future, it will be scarcity of terrestrial material resources, and not of energy resources, that will prove to impose the most binding constraint on man's economy on earth.[27]:\u200a377\u200a[35]:\u200a268f\u200a[37]:\u200a1049\u200a[73]:\u200a98f\u200a As he held no space advocacy views, Georgescu-Roegen failed to assess the (still) emerging technology of asteroid mining or any other known type of space colonisation as potentials for compensating for this future scarcity constraint facing mankind: He was convinced that throughout its entire span of existence, our species will remain confined solely to earth for all practical purposes.[36]:\u200a361f\u200a His paradigmatic vision concluded thereby./nGeorgescu-Roegen's work was blemished somewhat by mistakes caused by his insufficient understanding of the physical science of thermodynamics. While working on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (see above), Georgescu-Roegen had the firm understanding that the entropy law applies equally well to both energy resources and to material resources, and much of the reasoning in the opus rests on this understanding;[4]:\u200a187\u2013195,\u200a277\u2013282,\u200aet passim\u200a but, regrettably for Georgescu-Roegen, this understanding was\u00a0\u2013 and still is\u00a0\u2013 false: In thermodynamics proper, the entropy law does apply to energy, but not to matter of macroscopic scale (that is, not to material resources).[85]:\u200a239\u2013276\u200a[note 6] Later, when Georgescu-Roegen realised his mistake, his reaction passed through several stages of contemplation and refinement, ultimately leading to his formulation of a new physical law, namely the fourth law of thermodynamics. This fourth law states that complete recycling of matter is impossible.[note 7] The purpose of Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law was to substantiate his initial claim that not only energy resources, but also material resources, are subject to general and irreversible physical degradation when put to use in economic activity. In addition, he introduced the term 'material entropy' to describe this physical degradation of material resources.[12]:\u200a104f/nGeorgescu-Roegen himself was not confident about this tentative solution to the problem. He remained embarrassed that he had misinterpreted, and consequently, overstretched the proper application of the physical law that formed part of the title of his magnum opus. He conceded that he had entered into the science of thermodynamics as something of a bold novice. Dedicated to interdisciplinarity, he was worried that physicists would dismiss all of his work as amateurism on this count. The predicament would trouble him for the rest of his life.[15]:\u200a148f\u200a[39]:\u200a196f\u200a[10][14]:\u200a238\u200a In his last published article on the subject matter before his death, Georgescu-Roegen recollected his encouragement when he had once earlier come across the concept of 'matter dissipation' used by German physicist and Nobel Prize laureate Max Planck to account for the existence of irreversible physical processes where no simultaneous transformation of energy was taking place. Georgescu-Roegen found consolation in the belief that the concept of 'matter dissipation' used by a physicist of Planck's authoritative standing would decisively substantiate his own fourth law and his own concept of material entropy.[39]:\u200a197\u200a[48]:\u200a57\u201360/nGeorgescu-Roegen's formulation of a fourth law of thermodynamics and the concept of material entropy soon generated some controversy, involving both physicists and ecological economists.[86][87][12]:\u200a103\u2013107\u200a[88]:\u200a21\u201328\u200a[84][48]:\u200a56f\u200a[89]:\u200a25\u201329\u200a[90][91]:\u200a110\u200a[92][93]:\u200a1215\u20131218/nA full chapter on the economics of Georgescu-Roegen reviews this controversy and has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics, and the details (Georgescu-Roegen's  mistakes) about the fourth law and material entropy are omitted there.[49]:\u200a95\u2013112/n/nModelling a possible future economic system for mankind, Robert Ayres has countered Georgescu-Roegen's position on the impossibility of complete and perpetual recycling of material resources. According to Ayres, it is possible to develop what he conceptualises as a 'spaceship economy' on earth on a stable and permanent basis, provided that a sufficient flow of energy is available to support it (for example, by an ample supply of solar energy). In this spaceship economy, all waste materials will be temporarily discarded and stored in inactive reservoirs\u00a0\u2013 or what he calls 'waste baskets'\u00a0\u2013 before being recycled and returned to active use in the economic system at some later point in time. It will not be necessary, or even possible, for materials recycling to form its own separate and continuous flow to be of use\u00a0\u2013 only, the waste baskets in question have to be large enough to compensate for the rate and the efficiency of the recycling effort. In effect, complete and perpetual recycling of material resources will be possible in a future spaceship economy of this kind specified, thereby rendering obsolete Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law of thermodynamics, Ayres submits.[72] In a later article, Ayres restated his case for a spaceship economy.[94]:\u200a290\u2013294/nIn ecological economics, Ayres' contribution vis-\u00e0-vis Georgescu-Roegen's proposed fourth law was since described as yet another instance of the so-called 'energetic dogma':[24]:\u200a547\u200a Earlier, Georgescu-Roegen had attached the label 'energetic dogma' to various theorists holding the view that only energy resources, and not material resources, are the constraining factor in all economic activity.[37]:\u200a1024\u20131029\u200a[77]:\u200a211f\u200a[71][note 8] Ayres appears to be the odd man out on this subject matter: Whatever the scientific status and validity of Georgescu-Roegen's fourth law may be, several other economists in the field besides Georgescu-Roegen deny the practical possibility of ever having complete and perpetual recycling of all material resources in any type of economic system, regardless of the amount of energy, time and information to be assigned to the recycling effort.[46]:\u200a36f\u200a [2]:\u200a164\u2013167\u200a [47]:\u200a105\u2013107\u200a [95][48]:\u200a60\u201364\u200a [54]:\u200a155\u2013161\u200a [96][50]:\u200a292\u2013294\u200a [97]:\u200a10f\u200a [98]:\u200a46\u201349/nEach year since 1987, the Georgescu-Roegen Prize has been awarded by the Southern Economic Association for the best academic article published in the Southern Economic Journal.[99]/nIn 2012, two awards in honour of Georgescu-Roegen's life and work were established by The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi, India: The Georgescu-Roegen Annual Awards.

Despite having no formal postgraduate training and working as a schoolteacher, he published extensively and became well known in recreational mathematics circles.[1]/nKaprekar received his secondary school education in Thane and studied at Cotton College in Guwahati. In 1927, he won the Wrangler R. P. Paranjpye Mathematical Prize for an original piece of work in mathematics.[2]/nHe attended the University of Mumbai, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1929. Having never received any formal postgraduate training, for his entire career (1930\u20131962) he was a schoolteacher at the government junior school in Devlali Maharashtra, India. Cycling from place to place he also tutored private students with unconventional methods, cheerfully sitting by a river and \"thinking of theorems\". He published extensively, writing about such topics as recurring decimals, magic squares, and integers with special properties. He is also known as \"Ganitanand\"./nWorking largely alone, Kaprekar discovered  a number of results in number theory and described various properties of numbers.[3] In addition to the Kaprekar's constant and the Kaprekar numbers which were named after him, he also described self numbers or Devlali numbers, the harshad numbers and Demlo numbers. He also constructed certain types of magic squares related to the Copernicus magic square.[4] Initially his ideas were not taken seriously by Indian mathematicians, and his results were published largely in low-level mathematics journals or privately published, but international fame arrived when Martin Gardner wrote about Kaprekar in his March 1975 column of Mathematical Games for Scientific American. Today his name is well-known and many other mathematicians have pursued the study of the properties he discovered.[1]/nIn 1949, Kaprekar discovered an interesting property of the number 6174, which was subsequently named the Kaprekar constant.[5] He showed that 6174 is reached in the end as one repeatedly subtracts the highest and lowest numbers that can be constructed from a set of four digits that are not all identical. Thus, starting with 1234, we have:/nRepeating from this point onward leaves the same number (7641 \u2212 1467 = 6174). In general, when the operation converges it does so in at most seven iterations./nA similar constant for 3 digits is 495.[6] However, in base 10 a single such constant only exists for numbers of 3 or 4 digits; for other digit lengths or bases other than 10, the Kaprekar's routine algorithm described above may in general terminate in multiple different constants or repeated cycles, depending on the starting value.[7]/nPython Code to test kaprekar's constant:/nAnother class of numbers Kaprekar described are Kaprekar numbers.[8] A Kaprekar number is a positive integer with the property that if it is squared, then its representation can be partitioned into two positive integer parts whose sum is equal to the original number (e.g. 45, since 452=2025, and 20+25=45, also 9, 55, 99 etc.) However, note the restriction that the two numbers are positive; for example, 100 is not a Kaprekar number even though 1002=10000, and 100+00 = 100. This operation, of taking the rightmost digits of a square, and adding it to the integer formed by the leftmost digits, is known as the Kaprekar operation./nSome examples of Kaprekar numbers in base 10, besides the numbers 9, 99, 999, ..., are (sequence A006886 in the OEIS):/nIn 1963, Kaprekar defined the property which has come to be known as self numbers,[9] as the integers that cannot be generated by taking some other number and adding its own digits to it. For example, 21 is not a self number, since it can be generated from 15:  15 + 1 + 5 = 21. But 20 is a self number, since it cannot be generated from any other integer. He also gave a test for verifying this property in any number. These are sometimes referred to as Devlali numbers (after the town where he lived); though this appears to have been his preferred designation,[9] the term \"self number\" is more widespread. Sometimes these are also designated Colombian numbers after a later designation./nKaprekar also described the harshad numbers which he named harshad, meaning \"giving joy\"  (Sanskrit harsha, joy +da taddhita pratyaya, causative); these are defined by the property that they are divisible by the sum of their digits. Thus 12, which is divisible by 1 + 2 = 3, is a harshad number.  These were later also called Niven numbers after  1977 lecture on these by the Canadian mathematician Ivan M. Niven.  Numbers which are harshad in all bases (only 1, 2, 4, and 6) are called all-harshad numbers.

During her early childhood, she lived with her parents and younger brother Henry (born 1850) in New York City.[2] In 1853 the family moved back to Windsor, Connecticut, where her sister Jane Augusta Ladd McCordia was born the following year. Family correspondence shows that Augusta and one of her sisters were both staunch supporters of women's rights. Before Ladd turned five, her mother had taken her to a lecture given by Elizabeth Oakes Smith, a well-known proponent of women's rights. Additionally, her father was a graduate professor who was supportive of his eldest daughter's education.[3]/nFollowing the death of her mother in spring 1860 of pneumonia, Ladd went to live with her paternal grandmother in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she attended school.[2] Ladd's father remarried in 1862 and had two further children, her half-sister Katherine (born 1862) and half-brother George (born 1867).[2] Ladd was reportedly a precocious child who sought to find \"a mean to continue her education beyond secondary school.\"[2] Her father enrolled her in a two-year program at the coeducational Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts. At Wesleyan Academy she took the same courses her male classmates took to prepare for entrance to colleges such as Harvard.[4]/nIn 1865 Ladd graduated as valedictorian from Wesleyan Academy and pursued further education at Vassar College,[1][unreliable source] supported by her family.[3]/nIn the fall of 1866 Ladd enrolled in Vassar College financed by a loan from her aunt, Juliet Niles,[1] but left at the end of the spring term due to financial hardship.[4] Ladd then worked as a public school teacher until her aunt's aid allowed her to re-enroll in Vassar. She earned an A.B. degree in 1869. While attending Vassar, Ladd began working under the mentorship of astronomy professor, Maria Mitchell, who was famous for having been \"the first woman to discover a new comet, using a telescope, in 1847\".[5] Mitchell was also a suffragette and strove to inspire women to gain more self-confidence to enter into the male-dominated academia of the time. Under the guidance of Mitchell, Ladd became proficient and developed a love for physics and mathematics.[6] Because women in nineteenth-century America were prohibited from working physics laboratories, Ladd chose to study mathematics.[5] Later in life, Ladd would reflected her decision, saying, \"had it not been for the impossibility, in those days, in the case of women, of obtaining access to laboratory facilities\" she would have studied physics.[5]/nIn 1887, Vassar College awarded Ladd an honorary LL.D.[7]/nAfter graduating from Vassar, Ladd taught science and mathematics at secondary level in Washington, Pennsylvania; Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania; Massachusetts; and New York for nine years,[7] although her diary entries indicate that her interest in teaching may have diminished over time.[1] During this time, Ladd contributed seventy-seven mathematical problems and solutions to the Educational Times of London. She also published six items in The Analyst: A Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics and three in the American Journal of Mathematics.[4]/nIn 1878, Ladd was accepted into Johns Hopkins University with the help of James J. Sylvester, an English mathematician among the university's faculty who remembered some of Ladd's earlier works in the Educational Times.[4] Ladd's application for a fellowship was signed \"C. Ladd\", and the university offered her the position without realizing she was a woman.[8] When they did realize her gender, the board tried to revoke the offer, but Sylvester insisted that Ladd should be his student, and so she was.[8] She held a fellowship at Johns Hopkins University for three years, but the trustees did not allow her name to be printed in circulars with those of other fellows, for fear of setting a precedent.[8] Furthermore, dissension over her continued presence forced one of the original trustees to resign.[8]/nSince the university did not approve of coeducation, at first Ladd was only allowed to attend classes taught by Sylvester. However, after displaying exceptional work in his courses, Ladd was allowed to take courses with additional professors. Even though she was awarded a stipend, she was not allowed to have the title of \"fellow\".[1] During 1879 and 1880, Ladd took classes taught by Charles Sanders Peirce, who has been called the first American experimental psychologist.[4]  She wrote a dissertation \"On the Algebra of Logic\" with Peirce as her thesis advisor. The dissertation was published in Studies in Logic (C.S. Peirce, ed.) in 1883. In 1884, Ladd attended William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin's master class and met her future husband, Fabian Franklin./nDue to her studies with Sylvester and Peirce, Ladd became the first American woman to formally receive graduate instruction in both mathematics and symbolic logic.[5] Since women were not allowed to graduate from Johns Hopkins University at that time, Ladd was refused a PhD in mathematics and logic, although she was the first woman to complete all the university's requirements for a PhD. Completing the work for a PhD in mathematics and logic at Johns Hopkins University gave her the tools and the legitimacy she needed, as a woman taking up scientific work. The university eventually officially awarded her a PhD during its 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1926[9] (44 years after she had earned it) when she was seventy-eight.[4]/nIn 1893, she applied for a teaching position at Johns Hopkins University, but was denied.[1]  Laurel Furumoto, in her work discussing the sociopolitical environment of the time, notes that Ladd's \"inability to secure a regular academic position was a predictable consequence, in that time period, of her decision to marry.\"[10] Eleven years later, in 1904, she was at last given permission to teach one class per year. For the next five years her position at Johns Hopkins University had to be approved and renewed on a yearly basis. Women who were able to obtain academic positions in universities at this time often chose these positions despite their lack of compensation. Ladd was no different. Many of the teaching positions that she held were on a volunteer basis, creating substantial financial strain on her and her family. Yet, it is evident that Ladd placed a high value on her ability to earn the academic affiliations necessary to become a successful contributor to her field.[1]/nAfter marriage to Fabian Franklin on August 24, 1882,[1] she adopted the name Christine Ladd-Franklin. The couple had two children, one of whom died in infancy. The other, Margaret Ladd-Franklin, became a prominent member in the women's suffrage movement.[4] Ladd-Franklin often wrote of the injustice she observed in the oppression of the female sex. In one such journal entry while at Vassar College she describes her disappointment with the views in society about and among women, stating, \"I so despise the idea that women are not as competent to take care of themselves as men, that they cannot decide for themselves when to go to bed and when to get up, how much exercise to take, how much to pray and go to church. Still my greatest objection is to the class of girls who come here and to the social and political atmosphere of the place...I know of but one girl who declares herself for the rights of women\" (September 22, 1866).[7] In another journal entry she writes about the lack of recognition of women who have earned advanced educational degrees, \"That is the case with our clever girls -- they go to Germany and get the parchments, beautifully signed and sealed, that proclaim them to be doctors of philosophy, but no further consequences follow. They have nothing but the empty satisfaction of exhibiting their 'tickets'\".[7]/nShe died on March 5, 1930 in New York, New York.[4]/nAfter leaving Hopkins, Ladd-Franklin worked with German psychologist G. E. M\u00fcller, where she carried out experimental work on vision. Although women in academic settings and laboratories were viewed as equally unwelcome as in the United States, she managed to secure a position.[7] Ladd-Franklin was also able to work in the laboratory of Hermann von Helmholtz, where she attended his lectures on theory of color vision. After attending these lectures, Ladd-Franklin developed her own theory of color vision.[4] In 1929 she published Color and Color Theories./nOne of the major contributions that Ladd-Franklin made to psychology was her theory of color vision, which was based on evolution. Ladd-Franklin noted that: \"some animals are color blind and assumed that achromatic vision appeared first in evolution and color vision came later.\" She assumed further that the human eye carries fragments of its earlier evolutionary development. She observed that the most highly evolved part of the eye is the fovea, where, at least in daylight, visual acuity and color sensitivity are greatest. Ladd-Franklin assumed that peripheral vision (provided by the rods of the retina) was more primitive than foveal vision (provided by the cones of the retina) because night vision and movement detection are crucial for survival.\"[11]/nLadd-Franklin concluded that color vision evolved in three stages: achromatic vision (black and white), blue-yellow sensitivity and red-green sensitivity.[11] Since red-green sensitivity was the last to evolve it explains why many people suffer from red-green color blindness. The next one that affects a small population is blue-yellow color blindness. Since achromatic vision was the first to evolve it explains why the majority of the population are not affected by black-white color blindness.[11]/nLadd-Franklin was the first woman to have a published paper in the Analyst. She was also the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics and logic.[12] The majority of her publications were based on visual processes and logic. Her views on logic influenced Charles S. Peirce's logic and she was highly praised by Arthur Prior.[4]/n/nLadd-Franklin was among the first women to join the American Psychological Association in December 1893. From 1894 to 1925, Ladd-Franklin presented ten papers at APA meetings.[4] She was also the first woman member of Optica (formerly the Optical Society of America) in 1919 - member number 118.[13] During their meetings she presented six papers and two exhibits.[4] In 1959, Ladd-Franklin also joined Charlotte Moore Sitterly, Dorothy Nickerson, Gertrude Rand, Louise L Sloan, and Mary E Warga as the five women part of the first Optica Fellow class.[14]/nLadd-Franklin was included in the Who's Who in America during 1901-1902 and 1914-1915. Ladd-Franklin remained a member of both scientific societies until her death.[4] She was also a prominent member of the women's rights movement./nIn 1948, Bertrand Russell wrote: \"I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd-Franklin, saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician and a solipsist, her surprise surprised me.\"[15]/nThis article incorporates material from Christine Ladd-Franklin on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.", "9070151": "Robert Connelly (born July 15, 1942) is a mathematician specializing in discrete geometry and rigidity theory.

H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse,[29] after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951.[30] Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose finished his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1958, with a thesis on tensor methods in algebraic geometry[31] supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd.[32] He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as \"impossibility in its purest form\", and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it.[33][34] Escher's Waterfall, and Ascending and Descending were in turn inspired by Penrose.[35]/nAs reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:/nAs a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar \u2013 a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a staircase that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.[36]/nPenrose spent the academic year 1956\u201357 as an assistant lecturer at Bedford College, London and was then a research fellow at St John's College, Cambridge. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a NATO Research Fellowship for 1959\u201361, first at Princeton and then at Syracuse University. Returning to the University of London, Penrose spent two years, 1961\u201363, as a researcher at King's College, London, before returning to the United States to spend the year 1963\u201364 as a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin.[37] He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva, Princeton, and Cornell during 1966\u201367 and 1969./nIn 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge)[26] in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\".[38][39] Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of perturbation theory, as developed under the leadership of John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton.[40] The other, and more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its conformal structure, since it is the latter \u2013 as determined by the lay of the lightcones \u2013 that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper \"Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities\"[41] was not its only result, summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological Big Bang, which he dealt with in collaboration with Dennis Sciama's most famous student, Stephen Hawking.[42][43][44]/nIt was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture,[45] to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.[46][47][48]/nFollowing up his \"weak cosmic censorship hypothesis\", Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the \"strong censorship hypothesis\". Together with the Belinski\u2013Khalatnikov\u2013Lifshitz conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979, dates Penrose's influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics.[49] Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the Terrell rotation or Penrose\u2013Terrell rotation.[50][51]/nIn 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory, which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).[52][53]/nPenrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]/nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward./nIn 2004, Penrose released The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory.  The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.[60][61]/nPenrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.[62]/nIn 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data of the cosmic microwave background sky, of an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe.[63] He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book Cycles of Time,[64] a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it.[65][66] He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory.[67] In this theory, Penrose postulates that at the end of the universe all matter is eventually contained within black holes, which subsequently evaporate via Hawking radiation. At this point, everything contained within the universe consists of photons, which \"experience\" neither time nor space. There is essentially no difference between an infinitely large universe consisting only of photons and an infinitely small universe consisting only of photons. Therefore, a singularity for a Big Bang and an infinitely expanded universe are equivalent.[68]/nIn simple terms, Penrose believes that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole.[46] The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang.[69] One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation, which disrupts time.[70][71] Alternatively, one can use the Einstein\u2013Maxwell\u2013Dirac equations.[72]/nPenrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In The Emperor's New Mind (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness.[73] Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls correct quantum gravity).[74] Penrose uses a variant of Turing's halting theorem to demonstrate that a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system's state is ON when a given Turing machine halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system's state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)[75][76]/nPenrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer.[77] This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because factors such as the insolubility of the halting problem and G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight.[77] These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.[78]/nThe Penrose\u2013Lucas argument about the implications of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers.  Many experts in these fields assert that Penrose's argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.[79] Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose \"tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle.\" Minsky's position is exactly the opposite \u2013 he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that \"one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what I see in Penrose's quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness.\"[80]/nPenrose responded to criticism of The Emperor's New Mind with his follow-up 1994 book Shadows of the Mind, and in 1997 with The Large, the Small and the Human Mind. In those works, he also combined his observations with those of anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff.[81]/nPenrose and Hameroff have argued that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in Physical Review E,[82] calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: \"Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John A. Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'\".[83] Tegmark's paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose\u2013Hameroff position./nIn their reply to Tegmark's paper, also published in Physical Review E, the physicists Scott Hagan, Jack Tuszy\u0144ski and Hameroff[84][85] claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24\u00a0nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25\u00a0ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40\u00a0Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.[84] They supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and gel states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits.[84] Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy.[86]/nFinally, he suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction.[86]/nHameroff, in a lecture in part of a Google Tech[clarification needed] talks series exploring quantum biology, gave an overview of current research in the area, and responded to subsequent criticisms of the Orch-OR model.[87] In addition to this, a 2011 paper by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff published in the Journal of Cosmology gives an updated model of their Orch-OR theory, in light of criticisms, and discusses the place of consciousness within the universe.[88]/nPhillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose's views, acknowledges that Penrose's ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky's criticisms and quoting science journalist Charles Seife's description of Penrose as \"one of a handful of scientists\" who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.[83]/nIn January 2014, Hameroff and Penrose ventured that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan[89] supports the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory.[90] A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of Physics of Life Reviews.[91]/nHis popular publications include:/nHis co-authored publications include:/nHis academic books include:/nHis forewords to other books include:/nPenrose has been awarded many prizes for his contributions to science.\nIn 1971, he was awarded the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics.

She was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, and inductee of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency Hall of Fame. Fischer became one of two internationally known women scientists in the field of geodesy during the golden age of the Project Mercury and the Apollo program. Her Mercury datum (or Fischer ellipsoid 1960 and 1968),[2][3] as well as her work on the lunar parallax, were instrumental in conducting these missions. \"In his preface to the ACSM publication, Fischer's former colleague, Bernard Chovitz, referred to her as one of the most renowned geodesists of the third quarter of the twentieth century. Yet this fact alone makes her one of the most renowned geodesists of all times, because, according to Chovitz, the third quarter of the twentieth century witnessed \"the transition of geodesy from a regional to a global enterprise.\"[4]/nBorn and educated in Vienna, she studied descriptive and projective geometry at the Technical University of Vienna and mathematics at the University of Vienna.[5] Her teachers Moritz Schlick and Hans Hahn were among the luminaries of the Vienna Circle; and her fellow students included physicist Victor Weisskopf, sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld, and social psychologist Marie Jahoda. Her father, Rabbi Armand Aharon Kaminka\u00a0[de], was head of the Maimonides Institute, and regularly led high holiday services at the famed Vienna Musikverein. He worked for the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle investigating pogroms in Eastern Europe and raised money in the U.S. and Western Europe to help victims./nIn 1931 she married historian and geographer Eric Fischer, who helped introduce American, as distinct from British, history to Vienna. The Fischer family established and ran the 1843-founded Vienna Israelitische Kinderbewahranstalt, the first professional kindergarten and kindergarten teacher training school in Vienna, a place that also became a refuge for immigrants to Vienna from Eastern Europe./nIn 1939, the Fischers, with their young daughter, Gay, fled Nazi Austria, traveling by rail to Italy, by boat to Palestine and in 1941 by boat around East Africa and the Cape of Good Hope to Boston, where they lived with Eric Fischer's sister, mother, and brother in law, the physician Otto Ehrentheil and their two daughters. Looking for jobs, Fischer first worked as a seamstress\u2019 assistant, then she graded blue books for Wassily Leontief at Harvard and for Norbert Wiener at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She also worked on stereoscopic projective geometry trajectories for John Rule at MIT. She taught mathematics at Brown and Nichols Preparatory School in Cambridge, and then at Sidwell Friends in Washington, D.C./nAfter World War II, and after her son, Michael, born in 1946, had reached school age, she found a job at the then Army Map Service,[6] now the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Army Geospatial Center in Potomac, Md., working under John A. O'Keefe in the Geodesy Branch and rising through the ranks to become the chief. Her twenty-five-year career at AMS, working on what became the World Geodetic System, produced over 120 scientific publications. On the side, she published a high school geometry textbook in 1965 one of her many endeavors as an educator. After retiring in 1975, she wrote a memoir of her scientific career that was first serialized in the ACSM Bulletin (an official publication of the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, which then included five surveying and mapping professional organizations, 2004 \u2013 06) covering the field of geodesy in the years 1951\u20131975, and discussing doing science in a man's world in a government bureaucracy. It was published as a book in 2005./nAt the very beginning of her career in mathematics and geodesy, Dr. Fischer had quickly taught herself the basics of geodetic tables, datums, transformations, gravity studies, astronomy, long lines, flare triangulation, and guided missile ballistics. Her updates to geodetic science helped determine the parallax of the Moon. Irene Fischer was also intrigued by research into post glacial uplift, and her geoid studies went hand in hand with investigations of the lingering effects of the last ice age./nFischer disagreed with the established figure for the oblateness of the Earth (the fraction by which the polar axis is foreshortened by the equatorial radius), which had remained unchallenged since 1924. She was forbidden to use her updated figures in her own work because that result was in disagreement with the accepted literature. However, after the flight of the first satellites, she was vindicated by the data and observations from the instruments, and she was allowed to amend her previous works with her newly derived figures. In commenting on the lack of faith others put on her research, Dr. Fischer goodheartedly quipped that the satellites had not accepted the accepted literature, either./nA pioneer during a time when there were few women in surveying, in 1967, Fischer was the first Army Map Service employee, and only the third woman ever, to receive the Distinguished Civilian Service Award.

From the algebraic structure of the Gauss equation and the Simons formula, Chen and Koichi Ogiue derived a number of information on submanifolds of complex space forms which are totally real and minimal. By using Shiing-Shen Chern, Manfredo do Carmo, and Shoshichi Kobayashi's estimate of the algebraic terms in the Simons formula, Chen and Ogiue showed that closed submanifolds which are totally real and minimal must be totally geodesic if the second fundamental form is sufficiently small.[11] By using the Codazzi equation and isothermal coordinates, they also obtained rigidity results on two-dimensional closed submanifolds of complex space forms which are totally real./nIn 1993, Chen studied submanifolds of space forms, showing that the intrinsic sectional curvature at any point is bounded below in terms of the intrinsic scalar curvature, the length of the mean curvature vector, and the curvature of the space form. In particular, as a consequence of the Gauss equation, given a minimal submanifold of Euclidean space, every sectional curvature at a point is greater than or equal to one-half of the scalar curvature at that point. Interestingly, the submanifolds for which the inequality is an equality can be characterized as certain products of minimal surfaces of low dimension with Euclidean spaces./nChen introduced and systematically studied the notion of a finite type submanifold of Euclidean space, which is a submanifold for which the position vector is a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. He also introduced and studied a generalization of the class of totally real submanifolds and of complex submanifolds; a slant submanifold of an almost Hermitian manifold is a submanifold for which there is a number k such that the image under the almost complex structure of an arbitrary submanifold tangent vector has an angle of k with the submanifold's tangent space./nIn Riemannian geometry, Chen and Kentaro Yano initiated the study of spaces of quasi-constant curvature. Chen also introduced the \u03b4-invariants (also called Chen invariants), which are certain kinds of partial traces of the sectional curvature; they can be viewed as an interpolation between sectional curvature and scalar curvature. Due to the Gauss equation, the \u03b4-invariants of a Riemannian submanifold can be controlled by the length of the mean curvature vector and the size of the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold. Submanifolds of space forms which satisfy the equality case of this inequality are known as ideal immersions; such submanifolds are critical points of a certain restriction of the Willmore energy./nMajor articles/nSurveys/nBooks", "15066763": "John Colin Stillwell (born 1942) is an Australian mathematician on the faculties of the University of San Francisco and Monash University.[1]/nHe was born in Melbourne, Australia and lived there until he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his doctorate.[1]  He received his PhD from MIT in 1970, working under Hartley Rogers, Jr,[2] who had himself worked under Alonzo Church.[3] From 1970 until 2001, he taught at Monash University back in Australia and in 2002 began teaching in San Francisco.[1]/nIn 2005, Stillwell was the recipient of the Mathematical Association of America's prestigious Chauvenet Prize for his article \"The Story of the 120-Cell,\"[4] Notices of the AMS, January 2001, pp.\u00a017\u201324.[5] In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[6]/nStillwell is the author of many textbooks and other books on mathematics including:", "57927311": "Eduard Wirsing (28 June 1931 \u2013 22 March 2022) was a German mathematician, specializing in number theory.[1]/nWirsing was born on 28 June 1931 in Berlin.[2]/nWirsing studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and the Free University of Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1957 under the supervision of Hans-Heinrich Ostmann with thesis \u00dcber wesentliche Komponenten in der additiven Zahlentheorie (On Essential Components in Additive Number Theory).[3] In 1967/68 he was a professor at Cornell University and from 1969 a full professor at the University of Marburg, where he was since 1965.

His father was Daniel De Silva, a principal, and his mother was Jayline Perera, a school teacher. De Silva was the eldest of eight siblings. He had primary education at Bauddhaloka Maha Vidyalaya, Thurstan College Colombo and secondary education at Royal College Colombo.  He captained the Sinhala Debating team at Royal College and won the Weerasooriya medal for oratory.[10]\nHe entered the University of Ceylon in 1963 and graduated in mathematics in 1967.

As a result, in 1986, he wrote Mage Lokaya (My World), criticizing the basis of the established western system of knowledge, and its propagation, which he refers as \"domination throughout the world\".He explained in this book that mind independent reality is impossible and knowledge is not found but constructed./nThis has further evolved into a study of epistemology and ontology, and in the process he has introduced and developed the concept of \"constructive relativism\"[11] as the basis on which knowledge is constructed relative to the sense organs, culture and the mind completely based on Avidya. Though he was identified as a representative of \"Jathika Chinthanaya\" an idea proposed by Gunadasa Amarasekara based on national thought concept of Erich Fromm, Nalin de Silva's concept Chinthanaya is a different epistemological concept.[12]/nVidyalankara interpretation was presented based on the theoretical and experimental work conducted by Dr. Nalin de Silva and his student Suraj Chandana at University of Kelaniya (Vidyalankara) in which Dr. de Silva rejects the wave nature of particles. According to him what gives rise to a bright and dark fringe pattern in the Young's double slit experiment is not the so called wave nature but the particle nature itself though not necessarily those of ordinary classical particles. Dr. de Silva theorizes that each particle that hit the screen on a double slit experiment appears at both the slits simultaneously prior to reaching the screen. According to Janaka Wansapura, Ph.D. this is a paradigm shift in the knowledge of quantum nature. [13][14]/nDr. Nalin de Silva has given a model for the universe with both acceleration and deceleration.[15]/nThe Rajarata chronic kidney disease (RCKD) has been an ailment prevalent in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka for several decades. In 2010 a team of scientists headed by Priyani Paranagama, head of the chemistry department at Kelaniya University, conducted a study to find the cause of the disease. The team was advised by Nalin de Silva, dean of the faculty of science, Kelaniya University.[16] The team presented their findings in June 2011. They stated that they had found high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water, vegetation, rice and other samples in the region.[17] The team, however, refused to release their data to the public, raising questions about their methodology.[18] Their finding were followed by allegations that the arsenic was being introduced to the system through foreign pesticides and fertilizers.[19]/nAs this statement caused a huge uproar in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka, the Industrial Technology Institute stated that they had used Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry on rice samples which showed no high levels of arsenic.[20] The ITI study also found that in samples of 28 different pesticides only 3 showed any signs of arsenic, and even then not in the concentrations that De Silva's team alleged.[18] The Kelaniya University team stated that they had used new methods to locate the Arsenic in the samples they collected but did not feel a need to submit their findings for peer-review.[21] De Silva stated that they did not publish their results in a \"so-called peer reviewed journal due to our concern regarding the authorship of the paper as the original idea was given by 'samyak drshtika devivaru'  also known as Devas[22]/nWhen the authenticity of the findings made by the University of Kelaniya team were questioned by other scientists, De Silva stated that the god \"Natha\" had first told them about the arsenic through a mystic./nThe merit (pina) in this regard should go to the \"samyak drshtika devivaru\" who first told that Arsenic is present in Rajarata drinking water and later revealed to us that Arsenic which is not found naturally in Sri Lanka has found its way to the wells and the wewas in Rajarata through Agrochemicals.[6]/nIt's simply like this. We can see professors. Professors cannot see Arsenic. We cannot see gods. Gods can see Arsenic. I like this because there is certain symmetry in it... I know very well that the so-called objective scientific method is a lie.[23]/nParanagama too has stood by De Silva and defended their methods. She said that they had first been told of the arsenic by the wife of \"a university lecturer who had developed her mental faculties to communicate with a higher being\", but then used scientific methods to deduce it.[24]/nThe Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science released a statement in July 2011 questioning the validity of the findings and the process and individuals involved in the study. Their statement laid the blame for the scandal firmly on Prof Nalin De Silva, and they called for other scientists and researchers in the group to distance themselves from De Silva to have their work taken seriously[citation needed]./nThere is another serious issue which casts grave doubts on the credibility of the claims made by the Kelaniya group. The press has publicly identified as the leader of this group an individual, who despite holding a responsible position, professes a disdain for 'Western' science. He has publicly claimed supernatural revelations ('samyak drushtika devivaru') as the source of his group's information and even methods. While recognising that many scientists are deeply religious, the SLAAS wishes to state categorically that superstition and the supernatural have no place in science, and that scientific results inspired by such sources are highly suspect because of a probable bias on the part of the investigator.\nWe also note that other researchers in the group have yet to distance themselves from the eccentric statements of their leader, and they need to do this if they wish to be taken seriously as scientists.[7]/nDe Silva has also been a vocal opponent of what he calls western cultural dominance which he claims is in its final phase./nThe western Christian modernity (WCM) is in the last phase of its hegemony and is acting like an insane person. It has no respect for the sovereignty of the other countries as has been exemplified from invasions, killings and supporting so called rebel groups in the countries in Asia and Africa. The USA that became the leader of WCM after the so called second world war is trying desperately to hold to the hegemony of WCM. After more than five hundred years of world domination WCM will have to leave the planet without making the people suffer more and more.[25]/nDe Silva has also referred to linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky as a puppet of the Western Christian Modernity./nThe west also maintains people such as Chomsky who is not known to the average American in order to show to the world that there is freedom for the intellectuals to champion their views heard more by the rest of the world than by the Americans themselves.[25]/nNalin de Silva who is influenced by Paul Feyerabend rejected the existence of scientific method and propose proliferation of sciences on various chinthanayas.[26]/nHe proposes theories are stories constructed by abductive reasoning to explain phenomena.[27]/nHe refuses ideas that science is truth or science is advancing towards the truth.[28]/nDe Silva was sacked from the University of Colombo for engaging in unlawful political activity within the campus. In subsequent letters he has described the event./nWhen I was in the University of Colombo, not the best place to fight the cultural pentagon, I was asked by the then Vice Chancellor G. L. Peiris why I was teaching Jathika Chinthanaya to a captive audience. The audience was not that captive and had the backing of the Vice Chancellor and some members of the senior staff, and of course the cultural pentagon.

After Professor Ernest Rutherford of the University of Manchester declined it, Priestley's application was considered and voted favourably upon.[5] Priestley would become Professor of mathematics and physics. He and his wife arrived in Brisbane in 1911, on the same boat as his colleague Professor John Lundie Michie. However Priestley soon realised he couldn't teach all the necessary subjects alone, and so Thomas Parnell, who was teaching at the University of Melbourne, found his application to lecture in physics successful.[5] By 1919 the senate of the University decided to create separate departments of mathematics and physics. Priestley was offered either chair and chose mathematics.[1] Thomas Parnell was offered the physics chair./nIn 1912 Priestley became a member of the London Mathematical Society and subsequently published papers in its proceedings and in other journals, mainly in the areas of applied mathematics and mathematical physics. He believed the University would not succeed unless its academics published extensively to improve its reputation.[3] Priestley had considerable influence on university affairs, and despaired at the state of the buildings and library.[3] He served as Dean of the Faculty of Science (1911\u201319).

He studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy as an undergraduate,[2] and began his graduate studies concentrating in algebra and algebraic geometry, but switched to point set topology, the subject of his thesis, despite the general disinterest in the subject in the Netherlands at the time after Brouwer, the Dutch giant in that field, had left it in favor of intuitionism.[3] For several years after leaving the university, De Groot taught mathematics at the secondary school level, but in 1946 he was appointed to the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam, in 1947 he began a lecturership at the University of Amsterdam, in 1948 he moved to a position as professor of mathematics at the Delft University of Technology, and in 1952 he moved again back to the University of Amsterdam, where he remained for the rest of his life. He was head of pure mathematics at the Mathematisch Centrum from 1960 to 1964, and dean of science at Amsterdam University from 1964 on.[4] He also visited Purdue University (1959\u20131960), Washington University in St. Louis (1963\u20131964), the University of Florida (1966\u20131967 and winters thereafter), and the University of South Florida (1971\u20131972).[2][3] He died on September 11, 1972, in Rotterdam.[2]/nDe Groot had many students, and over 100 academic descendants;[5] Koetsier and van Mill[1] write that many of these younger topologists experienced compactification at first hand while trying to squeeze into the back seat of De Groot's small Mercedes. McDowell[3] writes, \"His students essentially constitute the topology faculties at the Dutch universities.\" The deep influence of de Groot on Dutch topology may be seen in the complex academic genealogy of his namesake Johannes Antonius Marie de Groot (shown in the illustration): the later de Groot, a 1990 Ph.D. in topology, is the senior de Groot's academic grandchild, great-grandchild, and great-great-grandchild via four different paths of academic supervision.[6]/nDe Groot was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1969.[4][7]/n/nDe Groot published approximately 90 scientific papers.[8] His mathematical research concerned, in general, topology and topological group theory, although he also made contributions to abstract algebra and mathematical analysis./nHe wrote several papers on dimension theory (a topic that had also been of interest to Brouwer). His first work on this subject, in his thesis, concerned the compactness degree of a space: this is a number, defined to be \u22121 for a compact space, and 1\u00a0+\u00a0x if every point in the space has a neighbourhood the boundary of which has compactness degree x. He made an important conjecture, only solved much later in 1982 by Pol and 1988 by Kimura,[1] that the compactness degree was the same as the minimum dimension of a set that could be adjoined to the space to compactify it.[3] Thus, for instance the familiar Euclidean space has compactness degree zero; it is not compact itself, but every point has a neighborhood bounded by a compact sphere. This compactness degree, zero, equals the dimension of the single point that may be added to Euclidean space to form its one-point compactification. A detailed review of de Groot's compactness degree problem and its relation to other definitions of dimension for topological spaces is provided by Koetsier and van Mill[1]/nIn 1959, his work on the classification of homeomorphisms led to the theorem that one can find a large cardinal number, \u05d12, of pairwise non-homeomorphic connected subsets of the Euclidean plane, such that none of these sets has any nontrivial continuous function mapping it into itself or any other of these sets. The topological spaces formed by these subsets of the plane thus have a trivial automorphism group; de Groot used this construction to show that all groups are the automorphism group of some compact Hausdorff space, by replacing the edges of a Cayley graph of the group by spaces with no nontrivial automorphisms and then applying the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification.[3][9] A related algebraic result is that every group is the automorphism group of a commutative ring.[2]/nOther results in his research include a proof that a metrizable topological space has a non-Archimedean metric (satisfying the strong triangle inequality d(x,z) \u2264 max(d(x,y),d(y,z)) if and only if it has dimension zero, description of completely metrizable spaces in terms of cocompactness, and a topological characterization of Hilbert space.[2][3] From 1962 onwards, his research primarily concerned the development of new topological theories: subcompactness, cocompactness, cotopology, GA-compactification, superextension, minusspaces, antispaces, and squarecompactness.[2]", "9561807": "Michinori Yamashita (born 1953 in Japan) is a professor (Japanese mathematician) at the Rissho University.

Ash led a team that invented a nitrogenated dispense system for Guinness stout first released in 1959, which evolved to become the beer now sold globally as Draught Guinness. As the manager in charge of the Easy Serve project, Ash is credited as the inventor of nitrogenated beer[2] (sometimes known as \"nitro beer\" colloquially).[3] He was Managing Director of Crookes Laboratories[4] (1962\u20131972) where he was responsible for securing the license for an early anti-depressant in the UK, Prothiaden./nBorn in Calcutta, India to civil engineer father, Wilfrid Cracroft Ash[5] and mother Maud (n\u00e9e Harper), Ash had a brother, environmentalist Maurice, and a sister, Marjorie.[citation needed]Ash attended two prep schools in the UK, The old Ride School and then Yarlet Hall. He then went on to Canford School, Wimborne, Dorset, and was further educated at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1945\u20131948. At Trinity, he read mathematics, received a first in the Mathematical Tripos, won the Rouse Ball prize, and the Senior Wrangler Title[5] for 1948./nFollowing graduation from Cambridge, Ash lectured in mathematics at The Bedford College for women[6] for three years[5] before joining Guinness & Co. as a mathematician at their London Brewery in Park Royal in January 1951.[7] Ash was the first non-brewer to join Guinness.[5]/nAfter training as a brewer, by 1954 Ash also had experience of running two departments (Brewing and Forwarding) and in 1955 he was given his own department the 'Sample Room', which had facilities for experimentation, and a team of 20 men.[8] The 'Draught problem' was given to Ash as part of his briefing from the managing Director, Hugh Beaver; Ash assigned two men from his Sample Room team to help.[8] At the time, Guinness used a convoluted draught system in which highly conditioned beer was blended with aged, nearly still beer.[9] It was a slow, arduous process that limited the ability of draught dispense to reach a more global market./nGuinness had for years been looking for a system in which a bartender with no special training could pour a glass of draught beer in a matter of seconds to settle quickly with a head (3/8\" in a normal \u00bd pint glass).[5] Ash realized that the solution lay in the use of a blend of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (as opposed to only the latter), but it took him four years to devise a mechanism to dispense nitrogenated beer. Inside Guinness, Ash\u2019s quest to produce a 'Draught Guinness' was regarded as quixotic, and other brewers chided it as \"Daft Guinness\". Eventually, working with keg designer, Eric Lewis, Ash developed a self-contained two-part keg (initially known as the 'Ash Can'[8]), with one chamber full of beer and the other full of mixed gas under pressure, and the introduction of nitrogen. Finally, after being redesigned, the new keg was released to pubs in 1959, the 200th anniversary of Guinness.[10][11] Ash, and his team, asked Hugh Beaver, the managing director, how large the head should be, but he didn't know, so they had to decide themselves. Speaking at Guinness in March 2016, Ash said:/n\u201c\u2026We had to decide ourselves that the perfect head was three eighths of an inch\u2026it just looked right.\u201d[3]/nNitrogen is less soluble than carbon dioxide, which allows the beer to be put under high pressure without making it fizzy. The high pressure of dissolved gas is required to enable very small bubbles to be formed by forcing the draught beer through fine holes in a plate in the tap, which causes the characteristic 'surge'.[3]/nUltimately called the \"easy serve system,\"[7] in late 1959 it began to replace the old \"high and low\" taps used in Ireland, before spreading to Great Britain and beyond beginning in the 1960s.[5] At a board meeting on 9 December 1959, Benjamin Guinness (then Viscount Elveden) reported that:/n\"...about half the draught Guinness outlets have now been changed to the Easy Serve system, and the changeover of the remainder should take place by mid-January 1960.\"[6]/nThe invention, which made for a smoother, less characterful beer, was not without controversy, and for years a minority of Irish drinkers complained about the change. Eventually, nitrogenated stout became a standard, not just at Guinness but among all Irish makers of stout./nAsh left the brewing side of Guinness in 1962 to become managing director of Crookes Laboratories in Park Royal (owned by Guinness). Crookes moved to Basingstoke in 1965. At Crookes, Ash was responsible for acquiring the licence for the anti-depressant Prothiaden (Dosulepin) in 1967.

He began working as a Privatdozent at K\u00f6nigsberg in 1910 and as Professor ordinarius at the University of Basel in 1913. He taught at the University of Frankfurt in 1915 and the University of Berlin from 1921\u201345./nBieberbach wrote a habilitation thesis in 1911 about groups of Euclidean motions \u2013 identifying conditions under which the group must have a translational subgroup whose vectors span the Euclidean space \u2013 that helped solve Hilbert's 18th problem. He worked on complex analysis and its applications to other areas in mathematics. He is known for his work on dynamics in several complex variables, where he obtained results similar to Fatou's.  In 1916 he formulated the Bieberbach conjecture, stating a necessary condition for a holomorphic function to map the open unit disc injectively into the complex plane in terms of the function's Taylor series. In 1984 Louis de Branges proved the conjecture (for this reason, the Bieberbach conjecture is sometimes called de Branges' theorem). There is also a Bieberbach theorem\u00a0[ru] on space groups. In 1928 Bieberbach wrote a book with Issai Schur titled \u00dcber die Minkowskische Reduktiontheorie der positiven quadratischen Formen./nBieberbach was a speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Zurich in 1932./nBieberbach joined the Sturmabteilung in 1933 and the NSDAP in 1937. He was enthusiastically involved in the efforts to dismiss  his Jewish colleagues, including Edmund Landau and his former coauthor Issai Schur, from their posts. He also facilitated the Gestapo arrests of some close colleagues, such as Juliusz Schauder. Bieberbach was heavily influenced by Theodore Vahlen, another German mathematician and anti-Semite, who along with Bieberbach founded the \"Deutsche Mathematik\" (\"German mathematics\") movement and journal of the same name. The purpose of the movement was to encourage and promote a \"German\" (in this case meaning intuitionistic) style in mathematics. For example, Bieberbach claimed that \"the Cauchy\u2013Goursat theorem arouses intolerable displeasure\" in Germans, and was representative of an abstract style of reasoning and \"pronounced shrewdness\" characteristic of \"Jewish mathematics\".[3] Bieberbach's and Vahlen's idea of German mathematics was part of a wider trend in the scientific community in Nazi Germany towards giving the sciences racial character; there were also pseudoscientific movements for \"Deutsche Physik\", \"German chemistry\", and \"German biology\"./nIn 1945, Bieberbach was dismissed from all his academic positions because of his support of Nazism, but in 1949 was invited to lecture at the University of Basel by Ostrowski, who considered Bieberbach's political views irrelevant to his contributions to the field of mathematics.[4]", "4187898": "Martin (Maarten) van den Hove (Latinized as Martinus Hortensius (Ortensius)) (1605 \u2013 7 August 1639) was a Dutch astronomer and mathematician.

Van den Hove became an enthusiastic supporter of Landsberge, who was by now quite aged, and helped Landsberge complete his project to \"restore astronomy\" (i.e. create new systematic observations to replace old, insufficient data).

Van den Hove had attacked many of Tycho Brahe's claims in his preface to his Latin translation of a work by Landsbergen.  This was the Commentationes in motum terrae diurnum, & annuum (Middelburg, 1630).  The first Latin edition of Landsberge's illustrated treatise, the Commentationes taught the probability of earth\u2019s motion according to the Copernican theory.  Van den Hove regarded Landsberge, not Tycho Brahe, as the one who was restoring astronomy.  \"Only Landsberge held all ancient observations in esteem,\" Van den Hove wrote, \"whereas Tycho, Longomontanus, and Kepler tended to neglect them.\"/nAt the encouragement of Gerard Vossius and Caspar Barlaeus, Van den Hove began lecturing on the mathematical sciences at the Amsterdam Atheneum (Athenaeum Illustre) in 1634.  The Athenaeum Illustre, which had its seat in the fourteenth century Agnietenkapel, is commonly regarded as the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam.  Upon assuming his new duties, Van den Hove delivered an inaugural speech, later published as De dignitate et utilitate Matheseos (\"On the dignity and utility of the mathematical sciences\")./nVan den Hove also lectured on optics at Amsterdam (1635), and on navigation (1637).  In 1638, Van den Hove was made a member of the commission negotiating with Galileo on the determination of longitude by the method of Jupiter's moons./nVan den Hove developed a method for measuring the diameters of planets based on the measured visual angle that his telescope revealed. His was probably the first independent set of measurements of the apparent sizes of the planets and fixed stars since the work of Hipparchus in his On Sizes and Distances some seventeen centuries earlier.[2] Van den Hove corresponded with Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Marin Mersenne, Pierre Gassendi, Christiaan Huygens, and Galileo Galilei.

He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, and graduated in 1578. Hues became interested in geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe. During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England the following year./nIn 1594, Hues published his discoveries in the Latin work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu (Treatise on Globes and Their Use) which was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593, and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch, English, French and Latin./nHues continued to have dealings with Raleigh in the 1590s, and later became a servant of Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton. While Grey was imprisoned in the Tower of London for participating in the Bye Plot, Hues stayed with him. Following Grey's death in 1614, Hues attended upon Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, when he was confined in the Tower; one source states that Hues, Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner were Northumberland's constant companions and known as his \"Three Magi\", although this is disputed. Hues tutored Northumberland's son Algernon Percy (who was to become the 10th Earl of Northumberland) at Oxford, and subsequently (in 1622\u20131623) Algernon's younger brother Henry. In later years, Hues lived in Oxford where he was a fellow of the University, and discussed mathematics and related subjects with like-minded friends. He died on 24 May 1632 in the city and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral./nRobert Hues was born in 1553 at Little Hereford in Herefordshire, England. In 1571, at the age of 18 years, he entered Brasenose College, University of Oxford.[1][2] English antiquarian Anthony \u00e0 Wood (1632\u20131695) wrote that when Hues arrived at Oxford he was \"only a poor scholar or servitor\u00a0... he continued for some time a very sober and serious servant\u00a0... but being sensible of the loss of time which he sustained there by constant attendance, he transferred himself to St Mary's Hall\".[3] Hues graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree on 12 July 1578,[4] having shown marked skill in Greek. He later gave advice to the dramatist and poet George Chapman for his 1616 English translation of Homer,[5] and Chapman referred to him as his \"learned and valuable friend\".[6] According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, there is unsubstantiated evidence that after completing his degree Hues was held in the Tower of London, though no reason is given for this, then went abroad after his release.[1] It is possible he travelled to Continental Europe.[7]/nHues was a friend of the geographer Richard Hakluyt, who was then regent master of Christ Church. In the 1580s, Hakluyt introduced him to Walter Raleigh and explorers and navigators whom Raleigh knew. In addition, it is likely that Hues came to know astronomer and mathematician Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner at Thomas Allen's lectures in mathematics. The four men were later associated with Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland,[1][8] who was known as the \"Wizard Earl\" for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library.[9]/nHues became interested in geography and mathematics \u2013 an undated source indicates that he disputed accepted values of variations of the compass after making observations off the Newfoundland coast. He either went there on a fishing trip, or may have joined a 1585 voyage to Virginia arranged by Raleigh and led by Richard Grenville, which passed Newfoundland on the return journey to England. Hues perhaps become acquainted with the sailor Thomas Cavendish at this time, as both of them were taught by Harriot at Raleigh's school of navigation. An anonymous 17th-century manuscript states that Hues circumnavigated the world with Cavendish between 1586 and 1588 \"purposely for taking the true Latitude of places\";[11] he may have been the \"NH\" who wrote a brief account of the voyage that was published by Hakluyt in his 1589 work The Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation.[12] In the year that book appeared, Hues was with Edward Wright on the Earl of Cumberland's raiding expedition to the Azores to capture Spanish galleons.[1]/nBeginning in August 1591, Hues joined Cavendish on another attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Sailing on the Leicester, they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the Desire. Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the Strait of Magellan between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, as Davis intended to sail to America to search for the Northwest Passage. The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands.[13] In the meantime, delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members dying from the cold, illness and starvation, Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England. He was plagued by mutinous crewmen, and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore. Increasingly depressed, Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, possibly a suicide.[7][14]/nDuring the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations of the Southern Cross and other stars of the Southern Hemisphere while in the South Atlantic, and also observed the variation of the compass there and at the Equator. He returned to England after Cavendish died,[15] and published his discoveries in the work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu (Treatise on Globes and Their Use, 1594),[16] which he dedicated to Raleigh.[1] The book was written to explain the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593.[17] Apparently, the book was also intended to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation,[1] although Lesley Cormack has observed that the fact it was written in Latin suggests that it was aimed at scholarly readers on the Continent.[18] In 1595, William Sanderson, a London merchant who had largely financed the globes' construction, presented a small globe together with Hues' \"Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes\"[19] to Robert Cecil, a statesman who was spymaster and minister to Elizabeth\u00a0I and James\u00a0I. Hues' work subsequently went into at least 12 other printings in Dutch (1597, 1613 and 1622), English (1638 and 1659), French (1618) and Latin (1611, 1613, 1617, 1627, 1659 and 1663).[20] In his book An Accidence or The Path-way to Experience: Necessary for all Young Sea-men (1626),[21] John Smith, who founded the first permanent English settlement in North America at Jamestown, Virginia, listed Hues' book among the works that a young seaman should study.[22]/nTractatus de globis begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I's reign. However, he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese if they had a complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry, which were essential to successful navigation.[23] In the preface of the book, Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere, and refuted opposing theories.[24] The treatise was divided into five parts. The first part described elements common to Molyneux's terrestrial and celestial globes, including the circles and lines inscribed on them, zones and climates, and the use of each globe's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian.[25] The second part described planets, fixed stars and constellations; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe, and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle.[26] Part 4, which Hues considered the most important part of the work, explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun's position, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and azimuths, and time and declination.[27] The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines.[26][28] In the work, Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the \"nautical triangle\" used for plane sailing. Difference of latitude and departure (or longitude) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle, the distance travelled is the hypotenuse, and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course. If any two elements are known, the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines, tangents and secants.[29]/nIn the 1590s, Hues continued to have dealings with Raleigh \u2013 he was one of the executors of Raleigh's will[15] \u2013 and he may have been the \"Hewes\" who dined with Northumberland regularly in 1591. He later became a servant of Thomas Grey, the 15th and last Baron Grey de Wilton (1575\u20131614). For participating in the Bye Plot, a conspiracy by Roman Catholic priest William Watson to kidnap James\u00a0I and force him to repeal anti-Catholic legislation, Grey was attainted and forfeited his title in 1603. The following year, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Grey was given consent for Hues to stay in the Tower with him.[1] Between 1605 and 1621, Northumberland was also confined in the Tower; he was suspected of involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 because his relative Thomas Percy was among the conspirators./nIn 1616, following Grey's death, Hues began to be \"attendant upon th'aforesaid Earle of Northumberland for matters of learning\",[30] and was paid a yearly sum of \u00a340 to support his research until Northumberland's death in 1632.[1][15] Wood stated that Harriot, Hues and Warner were Northumberland's \"constant companions, and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's Three Magi. They had a table at the Earl's charge, and the Earl himself did constantly converse with them, and with Sir Walter Raleigh, then in the Tower\".[31] Together with the scientist Nathanael Toporley and the mathematician Thomas Allen, the men kept abreast of developments in astronomy, mathematics, physiology and the physical sciences, and made important contributions in these areas.[32] According to the letter writer John Chamberlain, Northumberland refused a pardon offered to him in 1617, preferring to remain with Harriot, Hues and Warner.[33] However, the fact that these companions of Northumberland were his \"Three Magi\" studying with him in the Tower of London has been regarded as a romanticisation by the antiquarian John Aubrey and disputed for lack of evidence.[1][34] Hues was tutor to Northumberland's sons: first Algernon Percy, who subsequently became the 10th Earl of Northumberland, at Oxford where he matriculated at Christ Church in 1617; and later Algernon's younger brother Henry in 1622\u20131623. Hues lived at Christ Church at this time, but may have occasionally attended upon Northumberland at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex, and at Syon House in London after the latter's release from the Tower in 1622.[32] Hues sometimes met Walter Warner in London, and they are known to have discussed the reflection of bodies.[1]/nIn later years, Hues lived in Oxford where he discussed mathematics and allied subjects with like-minded friends.[1][35] Cormack states he was a fellow at the University.[18] Under the terms of the will of Thomas Harriot, who died on 2 July 1621, Hues and Warner were given the responsibility of helping Harriot's executor Nathaniel Torporley to prepare Harriot's mathematical papers for publication. Hues was also required to help price Harriot's books and other possessions for sale to the Bodleian Library.[1]/nHues, who did not marry, died on 24 May 1632 in Stone House, St. Aldate's (opposite the Blue Boar in central Oxford).[36] This was the house of John Smith, M.A., the son of a cook at Christ Church named J. Smith.[15] In his will, Hues made many small bequests to his friends, including a sum of \u00a320 to his \"kinswoman\" Mary Holly (of whom nothing is known), and 20 nobles to each of her three sisters. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, and a monumental brass to him was placed in Christ Church with the following inscription:[1]/nDepositum viri literatissimi, morum ac religionis integerrimi, Roberti Husia, ob eruditionem omnigenem [sic: omnigenam?], Theologicam tum Historicam, tum Scholasticam, Philologicam, Philosophiam, pr\u00e6sertim vero Mathematicam (cujus insigne monumentum in typis reliquit) Primum Thom\u00e6 Candishio conjunctissimi, cujus in consortio, explorabundis [sic: explorabundus?] velis ambivit orbem: deinde Domino Baroni Gray; cui solator accessit in arca Londinensi.

During World War II, he worked at Britain's secret  decryption centre at Bletchley Park, where he was one of the most important contributors./nAfter the war he moved to the US and worked on the design of military communications systems.[1]/nGordon Welchman was born, the youngest of three children, at Fishponds in Bristol, to William Welchman (1866\u20131954) and Elizabeth Marshall Griffith. William was a Church of England priest who had been a missionary overseas before returning to England as a country vicar, eventually becoming archdeacon of Bristol. Elizabeth was the daughter of another priest, the Revd Edward Moule Griffith.[2]/nWelchman was educated at Marlborough College and then studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1925 to 1928.[3] In 1929, he became a Research Fellow in Mathematics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He became a Fellow in 1932, and later Dean of the College./nJust before World War II, Welchman was invited by Commander Alastair Denniston to join the Government Code and Cypher School in the event of war. GCCS established a centre (\"Station X\") for decryption and analysis of enemy (mostly German) encrypted messages at Bletchley Park (BP)./nWelchman was one of four early recruits to BP, the others being Alan Turing, Hugh Alexander, and Stuart Milner-Barry. They all made significant contributions at BP and became known as \"the wicked uncles\". They were also the four signatories to a letter to Winston Churchill in October 1941, asking for more resources for the code-breaking work at BP. Churchill responded with one of his \"Action This Day\" written comments./nMuch of Welchman's work at Bletchley was in \"traffic analysis\" of encrypted German communications. This was the collection and analysis of data about which enemy units sent and received messages, including where and when. Such metadata analysis can reveal a lot about enemy organization, movements, and activities, even when the content of the messages remains unknown. Welchman is credited with developing this technique./nHowever, Welchman's main contributions were to the process of breaking the German Enigma machine cipher. Welchman became head of Hut Six, the section at BP responsible for breaking German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers.[4]/nPolish cryptanalysts had developed the bomba, an electromechanical device for finding the Enigma settings used by German operators; Turing improved the Polish design. Welchman invented the \"Diagonal Board\", an addition which made the British Bombe immensely more powerful./nThe Diagonal Board exploited the self-reciprocity of the plugboard element of the Enigma; that is, if on the plugboard, letter B is Steckered (plugged) to letter G, then G is also Steckered to B. If 26 rows of 26 way connectors are stacked up, then any connection point can be referenced by its row letter and column letter. A physical piece of wire can now connect (row B element G) to (row G element B.) Each such wire runs diagonally across the board; thus its name./nThe Diagonal Board enabled the bombe to solve the Enigma plugboard setting separately from the wheel setting. This reduced the time required to find the complete setting from days to hours.[citation needed]/nAs head of Hut Six, Welchman was also closely involved in other work which yielded breaks into Enigma by taking advantage of German operational weaknesses and lapses. These were quite extensive, and Welchman's experience in this area informed his later work on making communications secure.[4] His team of young women included Ethel Houston, who would later become the first woman to be made senior partner at a Scottish law firm.[5][6]/nWelchman left Hut Six in 1943, to become Assistant Director for Mechanization. His responsibilities in this post included the construction, deployment, and operation of additional bombes. By the end of the war, hundreds of bombes were in use at BP and satellite locations. Welchman had responsibility for cryptographic liaison with the US, which constructed and used additional bombes. He was responsible for making sure that the British and American bombes were not wastefully working on the same keys, and that all solutions by one group were reported to the other group./nHis main interest at this time was the development of similar machines for attacking more advanced German ciphers, such as the Geheimschreiber.

Welchman taught the first computer programming course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1951, and Frank Heart was among his students.[9] He followed this by employment with Remington Rand and Ferranti.[4] Welchman became a naturalised US citizen in 1962. In that year, he joined the Mitre Corporation, working on secure communications systems for the US military. He retired in 1971, but was retained as a consultant./nIn 1982 his book The Hut Six Story[4] was published, initially by McGraw-Hill in the US and by Allen Lane in Britain. The National Security Agency disapproved. The book was not banned, but as a result of it, Welchman lost his American and British security clearances, and therefore his consultancy with Mitre, and was forbidden to discuss either the book or his wartime work.[10] The impact on Welchman of withdrawal of his security clearance by the NSA has been described as \"devastating\".[11]/nWelchman died in 1985; his final conclusions and corrections to the story of wartime code breaking were published posthumously in 1986 in the paper \"From Polish Bomba to British Bombe: the birth of Ultra\" in Intelligence & National Security, Vol 1, No l.

Otto and Margarete then settled in Joensuu, where Otto taught physics, and there their four children were born: Frithiof (born 1894; also a mathematician), Rolf (born 1895), Anna (born 1896) and Erik (born 1901).[3]/nNevanlinna began his formal education at the age of 7. Having already been taught to read and write by his parents, he went straight into the second grade but still found the work boring and soon refused to attend the school. He was then homeschooled before being sent to a grammar school in 1903 when the family moved to Helsinki, where his father took up a new post as a teacher at Helsinki High School. At the new school, Nevanlinna studied French and German in addition to the languages he already spoke: Finnish and Swedish. He also attended an orchestra school and had a love of music, which was encouraged by his mother:/nMargarete was an excellent pianist and Frithiof and Rolf would lie under the piano and listen to her playing. At 13 they went to orchestra school and became accomplished musicians \u2013 Frithiof on the cello and Rolf on the violin. Through free tickets from the orchestra school they got to know and love the music of the great composers, Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, as well as the early symphonies of Sibelius. Rolf first met Sibelius's music in 1907, when he heard his Third Symphony. Although later he met Hilbert, Einstein, Thomas Mann and other famous people, Rolf said that none had had such a strong effect on him as Sibelius. The boys played trios with their mother and their love of music \u2013 in particular of chamber music \u2013 lasted all their lives.[4]/nNevanlinna then progressed onto the Helsinki High School, where his main interests were classics and mathematics. He was taught by a number of teachers during this time but the best of them all was his own father, who taught him physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1913 having performed very well, although he was not the top student of his year. He then went beyond the school syllabus in the summer of 1913 when he read Ernst Leonard Lindel\u00f6f's Introduction to Higher Analysis; from that time on, Nevanlinna had an enthusiastic interest in mathematical analysis. (Lindel\u00f6f was also a cousin of Nevanlinna's father, and so a part of the Neovius-Nevanlinna mathematical family.)[3]/nNevanlinna began his studies at the University of Helsinki in 1913, and received his Master of Philosophy in mathematics in 1917. Lindel\u00f6f taught at the university and Nevanlinna was further influenced by him. During his time at the University of Helsinki, World War I was underway and Nevanlinna wanted to join the 27th J\u00e4ger Battalion, but his parents convinced him to continue with his studies. He did however join the White Guard in the Finnish Civil War, but did not see active military action.[5] In 1919, Nevanlinna presented his thesis, entitled \u00dcber beschr\u00e4nkte Funktionen die in gegebenen Punkten vorgeschriebene Werte annehmen (\"On limited functions prescribed values at given points\"), to Lindel\u00f6f, his doctoral advisor. The thesis, which was on complex analysis, was of high quality and Nevanlinna was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy on 2 June 1919./nWhen Nevanlinna earned his doctorate in 1919, there were no university posts available so he became a school teacher. His brother, Frithiof, had received his doctorate in 1918 but likewise was unable to take up a post at a university, and instead began working as a mathematician for an insurance company. Frithiof recruited Rolf to the company, and Nevanlinna worked for the company and as a school teacher until he was appointed a Docent of Mathematics at the University of Helsinki in 1922. During this time, he had been contacted by Edmund Landau and requested to move to Germany to work at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, but did not accept./nAfter his appointment as Docent of Mathematics, he gave up his insurance job but did not resign his position as school teacher until he received a newly created full professorship at the university in 1926. Despite this heavy workload, it was between the years of 1922\u201325 that he developed what would become to be known as Nevanlinna theory.[3]/nFrom 1947 Nevanlinna had a chair in the University of Zurich, which he held on a half-time basis after receiving in 1948 a permanent position as one of the 12 salaried Academicians in the newly created Academy of Finland./nRolf Nevanlinna's most important mathematical achievement is the value distribution theory of meromorphic functions. The roots of the theory go back to the result of \u00c9mile Picard in 1879, showing that a non-constant complex-valued function which is analytic in the entire complex plane assumes all complex values save at most one. In the early 1920s Rolf Nevanlinna, partly in collaboration with his brother Frithiof, extended the theory to cover meromorphic functions, i.e. functions analytic in the plane except for isolated points in which the Laurent series of the function has a finite number of terms with a negative power of the variable. Nevanlinna's value distribution theory or Nevanlinna theory is crystallised in its two Main Theorems. Qualitatively, the first one states that if a value is assumed less frequently than average, then the function comes close to that value more often than average. The Second Main Theorem, more difficult than the first one, states roughly that there are relatively few values which the function assumes less often than average./nRolf Nevanlinna's article Zur Theorie der meromorphen Funktionen which contains the Main Theorems was published in 1925 in the journal Acta Mathematica. Hermann Weyl has called it \"one of the few great mathematical events of the [twentieth] century.\"[6] Nevanlinna gave a fuller account of the theory in the monographs Le th\u00e9oreme de Picard \u2013 Borel et la th\u00e9orie des fonctions m\u00e9romorphes (1929) and Eindeutige analytische Funktionen (1936).[7]/nNevanlinna theory touches also on a class of functions called the Nevanlinna class, or functions of \"bounded type\"./nWhen the Winter War broke out (1939), Nevanlinna was invited to join the Finnish Army's Ballistics Office to assist in improving artillery firing tables. These tables had been based on a calculation technique developed by General Vilho Petter Nenonen, but Nevanlinna now came up with a new method which made them considerably faster to compile. In recognition of his work he was awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty, Second Class, and throughout his life he held this honour in especial esteem./nAmong Rolf Nevanlinna's later interests in mathematics were the theory of Riemann surfaces (the monograph Uniformisierung in 1953) and functional analysis (Absolute analysis in 1959, written in collaboration with his brother Frithiof).  Nevanlinna also published in Finnish a book on the foundations of geometry and a semipopular account of the Theory of Relativity. His Finnish textbook on the elements of complex analysis, Funktioteoria (1963), written together with Veikko Paatero, has appeared in German, English and Russian translations./nRolf Nevanlinna supervised at least 28 doctoral theses. His first and most famous doctoral student was Lars Ahlfors, one of the first two Fields Medal recipients.  The research for which Ahlfors was awarded the prize (proving the Denjoy Conjecture, now known as the Denjoy\u2013Carleman\u2013Ahlfors theorem) was strongly based on Nevanlinna's work./nNevanlinna's work was recognised in the form of honorary degrees which he held from the universities of Heidelberg, the University of Bucharest, the University of Giessen, the Free University of Berlin, the University of Glasgow, the University of Uppsala, the University of Istanbul and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. He was an honorary member of several learned societies, among them the London Mathematical Society and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. \u2014 The 1679 Nevanlinna main belt asteroid is named after him./nFrom 1954, Rolf Nevanlinna chaired the committee which set about the first computer project in Finland./nRolf Nevanlinna served as President of the International Mathematical Union (IMU) from 1959 to 1963 and as President of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1962.[8]/nIn 1964, Nevanlinna's connections with President Urho Kekkonen were instrumental in bringing about a total reorganization of the Academy of Finland.[9]/nFrom 1965 to 1970 Nevanlinna was Chancellor of the University of Turku.[10]/nAlthough Nevanlinna did not participate actively in politics, he was known to sympathise with the right-wing Patriotic People's Movement and, partly because of his half-German parentage, was also sympathetic towards Nazi Germany; with many mathematics professors fired in the 1930s due to the Nuremberg Laws, mathematicians sympathetic to the Nazi policies were sought as replacements, and Nevanlinna accepted a position as professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1936 and 1937.[11] His sympathy towards the Nazis led to his removal from his position as Rector of the University of Helsinki after Finland made peace with the Soviet Union in 1944.[citation needed]/nIn the spring of 1941, Finland contributed a Volunteer Battalion to the Waffen-SS. In 1942, a committee was established for the Volunteer Battalion to take care of the battalion's somewhat strained relations with its German commanders, and Nevanlinna was chosen to be the chairman of the committee, as he was a person respected in Germany but loyal to Finland.[9][12] He stated in his autobiography that he accepted this role due to a \"sense of duty\"./nNevanlinna's collaboration with Nazi Germany did not prevent mathematical contacts with Allied countries; after World War II, the Soviet mathematical community was isolated from the Western mathematical community and the International Colloquium on Function Theory in Helsinki in 1957, directed by Nevanlinna, was one of the first post-war occasions when Soviet mathematicians could contact their Western colleagues in person.[13] In 1965, Nevanlinna was an honorary guest at a function theory congress in Soviet Armenia.[9]/nWhen the IMU in 1981 decided to create a prize, similar to the Fields Medal, in theoretical computer science and the funding for the prize was secured from Finland, the Union decided to give Nevanlinna's name to the prize;  the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize is awarded every four years at the ICM.[8] In 2018, the General Assembly of the IMU approved a resolution to remove Nevanlinna's name from the prize.[14] As of 2022 it's known as the IMU Abacus Medal.[15]", "6874950": "Helaman Rolfe Pratt Ferguson (born 1940 in Salt Lake City, Utah) is an American sculptor and a digital artist, specifically an algorist.

In 2010, the Simons Foundation, a private institution committed to the advancement of science and mathematics, commissioned him to create the Umbilic Torus SC, a massive 8.5 m (28\u00bd') high sculpture in cast bronze and granite weighing more than nine tons. With its installation completed in 2012, the torus sculpture was donated to Stony Brook University in Long Island, N.Y., and sits outside the Math and Physics buildings of the same university, near the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. Mounted on a stainless steel column, the torus sits on a 7.7 m (25\u00bc') diameter granite base, where various mathematical formulas defining the torus are inscribed.[6] To create the huge sculpture, Ferguson wrote a program consisting of 25,000 movements to control a 4.9 m (16') x 6.1 m (20') robot arm and its affixed 30\u00a0cm (12\") long industrial diamond-encrusted cutting tool.[7]/nIn 1987 Ferguson ran 50 miles in 16 hours while joggling.

John Kingman described him as \"one of the giants of statistical theory\".[1]/nHarald Cram\u00e9r was born in Stockholm, Sweden on 25 September 1893. Cram\u00e9r remained close to Stockholm for most of his life. He entered the University of Stockholm as an undergraduate in 1912, where he studied mathematics and chemistry. During this period, he was a research assistant under the famous chemist, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, with whom he published his first five articles from 1913 to 1914.[2] Following his lab experience, he began to focus solely on mathematics. He eventually began his work on his doctoral studies in mathematics which were supervised by Marcel Riesz at the University of Stockholm. Also influenced by G. H. Hardy, Cram\u00e9r's research led to a PhD in 1917 for his thesis \"On a class of Dirichlet series\"./nFollowing his PhD, he served as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Stockholm University from 1917 to 1929. Early on, Cram\u00e9r was highly involved in analytic number theory. He also made some important statistical contributions to the distribution of primes and twin primes. His most famous paper on this subject is entitled \"On the order of magnitude of the difference between consecutive prime numbers\",[3] which provided a rigorous account of the constructive role in which probability applied to number theory[4] and included an estimate for prime gaps that became known as Cram\u00e9r's conjecture./nIn the late 1920s, Cram\u00e9r became interested in the field of probability, which at the time was not an accepted branch of mathematics. Cram\u00e9r knew that a radical change was needed in this field, and in a paper in 1926 said, \"The probability concept should be introduced by a purely mathematical definition, from which its fundamental properties and the classical theorems are deduced by purely mathematical operations.\"[5] Cram\u00e9r took an interest in the rigorous mathematical formulation of probability in the work of French and Russian mathematicians such as Kolmogorov, L\u00e9vy, Bernstein, and Khinchin in the early 1930s. Cram\u00e9r also made significant development to the revolution in probability theory.[5]\nCram\u00e9r later wrote his careful study of the field in his Cambridge publication Random variables and probability distributions which appeared in 1937 (with a 2nd edition in 1962 and a 3rd edition in 1970).[6] Shortly after World War II, Cram\u00e9r went on to publish the influential Mathematical Methods of Statistics in 1946.[7][8] This text was one that \"showed the way in which statistical practice depended on a body of rigorous mathematical analysis as well as Fisherian intuition.\"[1] His 1955 book Elements of Probability Theory and Some of its Applications introduces probability theory at a more elementary level than Mathematical Methods of Statistics.[9]/nIn 1929, Cram\u00e9r was appointed to a newly created chair in Stockholm University, becoming the first Swedish professor of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics. Cram\u00e9r retained this position up until 1958.[10] During his tenure at Stockholm University, Cram\u00e9r was a PhD advisor for 10 students, most notably Herman Wold and Kai Lai Chung. In 1950 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[11] Starting in 1950, Cram\u00e9r took on the additional responsibility of becoming the President of Stockholm University. In 1958, he was also appointed to be Chancellor of the entire Swedish university system. Cram\u00e9r retired from the Swedish university system in 1961./nA large portion of Cram\u00e9r's work concerned the field of actuarial science and insurance mathematics. During the period from 1920 to 1929, he was an actuary for the life insurance company Svenska livf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsbolaget. His actuarial work during this time led him to study probability and statistics which became the main area of his research.[12] In 1927 he published an elementary text in Swedish Probability theory and some of its applications. Following his work for Svenska livf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsbolaget, he went on to work for \u00c5terf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsaktiebolaget Sverige, a reinsurance company, up until 1948. He was also known for his pioneering efforts in insurance risk theory. After this period, he remained as a consultant actuary to Sverige from 1949 to 1961. Later in his life, he was elected to be the Honorary President of the Swedish Actuarial Society.[4]/nCram\u00e9r remained an active contributor to his professional career for an additional 20 years. Following his retirement in 1961, he became extremely active in research, which had been slowed due to his Chancellorship. During the years from 1961 to 1983, Cram\u00e9r traveled throughout the United States and Europe to continue his research, making significant stops at Berkeley, Princeton, and at the Research Triangle Institute of North Carolina./nCram\u00e9r received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1972.[13]/nHis academic career spanned over seven decades, from 1913 to 1982.[14]/nHarald Cram\u00e9r married Marta Hansson in 1918, and they remained together up until her death in 1973.

He is best known as one of the observers appointed by the Royal Society to observe the 1761 transit of Venus with Nevil Maskelyne on the island of Saint Helena. On that voyage they made successful use of the lunar-distance method of establishing longitude at sea. Waddington subsequently taught the method at his academy in London and published a navigation manual, A Practical Method for Finding the Longitude and Latitude of a Ship at Sea, by Observations of the Moon (1763).[1][2]/nLittle is known about Waddington's early life, although he was probably the \"Mr. Rob. Waddington of Hull\" who appeared in The Gentleman's Diary or The Mathematical Repository in 1758 and Benjamin Martin's General Magazine of Arts and Sciences in 1759. The papers of the gentleman astronomer Nathaniel Pigott[3] show that Waddington was living in his household, in Whitton, Middlesex, immediately before his appointment as an observer by the Royal Society. It is from these manuscripts that we have a detailed knowledge of Waddington's experience of the Saint Helena expedition and his subsequent attempts to forge a career as a teacher, mathematical practitioner and longitude projector./nIn 1760 Waddington was appointed by the Royal Society to accompany Nevil Maskelyne on a voyage to Saint Helena as one of two expeditions being organised by the Society, and paid for by George II, to observe the 1761 Transit of Venus.[1] The expedition's equipment was ordered by Maskelyne and the Society arranged transport from the East India Company. The Directors of the East India Company in London wrote to The Governor of St Helena on 31 December 1760 to inform them that \"Revd. Mr. Nevil Maskelyne and Mr. Robert Waddington take passage on the Prince Henry to St. Helena. As this is done to make some improvements in Astronomy which will be of general utility the two last named gentlemen are upon their arrival and during their stay to be accommodated by you in a suitable manner with diet and apartments at the Company's expense and you are to give them all the assistance as to materials, workmen, and whatsoever else the service they are employed upon may require.\" The reply confirmed their readiness to help and stated \"We have already erected\nan observatory for them in the country\".[4]/nIn the event, Waddington and Maskelyne's view of the transit of Venus on 6 July 1761 was thwarted by clouds. However, the voyages to and from the island proved to be very significant to the subsequent careers of both men as they used it to make longitude determinations by the lunar-distance method testing the accuracy of lunar tables calculated by Tobias Mayer. Maskelyne's log of the voyage records their efforts to do this, with the assistance of officers from the ship, and refers to the use of \"Mr Waddington's Quadrant\", a Hadley's quadrant adapted by him to better facilitate lunar-distance observations[5] Waddington kept his own account of the voyages, and seems to have produced more accurate observations than Maskelyne. He told Piggott that their observations \"finds a Practical & Certain Method\" of determining longitude \"& may be depended upon to one Degree of Longitude\".[1] This wording and degree of accuracy echoes that in the 1714 Longitude Act, which offered a reward of \u00a310,000 for methods that kept or found longitude to within a degree./nWaddington returned from Saint Helena before Maskelyne, who stayed on to attempt observations of the parallax of Sirius. He arrived back in London on 21 September 1761 and began to forge a career around providing teaching and texts on navigation, particularly the lunar-distance method of finding longitude. Waddington, having announced publicly by his method longitude \"may be generally obtained to less than half a Degree, and always to less than One Degree\", hoped that he might be in a position to receive a reward from the Board of Longitude.[1] His contribution was a method of observing and computing the data, but was based on Mayer's lunar tables and the earlier publication of precomputed tables and rules by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. His 1763 Practical Method for Finding the Longitude included such instructions and tables, which he claimed would reduce the necessary computation from several hours to three-quarters of an hour.[2] Maskelyne, on his return to London, produced his own version of such a text in the same year, The British Mariner's Guide, although never seems to have expected a reward from the Board of Longitude for his effort.[6]/nWaddington styled himself \"Teacher of Mathematics at the Mathematical Academy in Three Tun-court, Mile's-lane, London\", where he taught officers of the East India Company and also sold Hadley's quadrants. In 1763 he attempted, unsuccessfully, to gain employment from the Royal Society. By 1764 he had moved to Rolls Building, Chancery Lane.[1] He reported to Piggott his hopes that he and Maskelyne might gain the interest of the Board of Longitude but his only formal approach to them seems to have been in 1771, when a petition was read at a meeting on 11 May stating that he had much improved, and successfully trialled, the steering compass, or binnacle.[7]/nIn 1777 he published his longest and most comprehensive work, An Epitome of Theoretical and Practical Navigation.[8] As The Edinburgh Magazine reported in 1778, he claimed that the book could \"teach the young navigator every particular essential to his art, without his being under the necessity of having recourse to any other author.\"[9]/nWaddington's will, dated 12 May 1775 and proved posthumously in 1779, states his address as Downing Street, Westminster.

He is most noted for the introduction of the notion of a dissipative system and for the development of the behavioral approach to systems theory.[1]/nJan Willems was born in Bruges in 1939. He studied engineering at the University of Ghent, obtained the M.Sc. degree from the University of Rhode Island,  and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in electrical engineering in 1968. He was an assistant professor in the department of electrical engineering at MIT from 1968 to 1973. On 1 February 1973 he was appointed professor of systems and control in the mathematics department of the University of Groningen. In 2003 he became emeritus professor. Afterwards, he became guest professor at the KU Leuven. He served terms as chairperson of the European Union Control Association and of the Dutch Mathematical Society (Wiskundig Genootschap). He was managing editor of the SIAM Journal of Control and Optimization and as founding and managing editor of Systems & Control Letters./nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, Willems worked on input/output stability.  In an often-cited 1972 paper[pub 1] he introduced the notion of a dissipative system. This notion is a generalization of Lyapunov function to input/state/output systems. The construction of the storage function, as the analogue of a Lyapunov function is called, led to the study of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) in control theory.  Applied to linear-quadratic-Gaussian control, the construction of the storage function leads to the  Kalman\u2013Yakubovich\u2013Popov lemma. In the 1980s Willems worked on the geometric theory of linear systems, where he introduced the notion of almost invariant subspace. Since the 1990s, he has devoted his interest to the development of the behavioral approach to systems theory and control.[pub 2][pub 3] In the behavioral approach a dynamical system is simply viewed as a family of trajectories. This approach avoids having to separate the system variables into inputs and outputs./nWillems was a fellow of the IEEE, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the American Mathematical Society[2] and International Federation of Automatic Control. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.[3] In 1998, he received the IEEE Control Systems Award \"for seminal contributions to control theory and leadership in systems research\".

Near the end of the Second World War, his entire class of military cadets was taken to Germany, where he became a prisoner of war./nOn his return to his native town from a prisoner-of-war camp in the fall of 1945, he enrolled in the 6th grade of Ferenc De\u00e1k High School (now Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi High School).

While there, he was a resident of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s College, a residential college for elite students of the university. During his second year he published a paper that resulted in controversy, as some could not believe that such a paper on differential geometry had been written by a young student. Attending lectures by Istv\u00e1n F\u00f6ldes raised his interest in celestial mechanics. During his college years, he was an assistant at the observatory founded by Mikl\u00f3s Konkoly-Thege. He continued working there after earning his degree in the summer of 1951. In the observatory, he worked under the supervision of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Detre and J\u00falia Bal\u00e1zs and started working on his advanced degree at the age of 22./nIn 1953 he joined the Szabads\u00e1ghegyi Observatory. He later taught at the University of Arts and Sciences in Szeged./nIzs\u00e1k was interested in the three-body problem and the n-body problem. He studied the light emissions of quasars. After defending his doctorate and ignoring the prevailing wisdom that celestial mechanics was a resolved field, he returned to his favorite topic and started working on the trajectories of rockets and satellites. Putting his work into practice would have been possible only in the Soviet Union or the USA; international connections in Hungary at that time were limited to the occasional conference in the Soviet Union. Therefore, in November 1956, during the Hungarian revolution, he took advantage of the open borders and emigrated to Austria./nSoon after, he traveled to Switzerland, where the director of the Z\u00fcrich Observatory offered him a position. He arrived in Z\u00fcrich on January 9, 1957. By April, he was a full-time researcher at the institute for solar physics. Besides his research, he taught celestial navigation and time measurement to college students. He started learning English and became part of the international scientific community. His results on computing satellite orbits earned him an invitation to Cincinnati, Ohio. Soon he became one of the most respected authorities on the topic. He got a new offer for a position at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This was the primary institute for processing the orbital data of U.S. satellites. The work he started in Cambridge in 1959 led to his greatest successes. He had access to computers, which he needed to carry out much more precise computations than previously. The pace of the work was intense. He and his collaborators published one paper after another and extended their work to the geodesic applications of satellites./nThe ultimate goal of his computations was the determination of the precise shape of the Earth, which had long been known to be approximately an ellipsoid of revolution. He used observations of satellite orbits to compute deviations from this shape. The classic problem of celestial mechanics is to compute the orbit of a moon, given a known distribution of mass. He solved the inverse problem. He used harmonic approximation in his computations, i.e. he reconstructed the Earth's gravitational field from monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles, etc. The shape indicated by such a computation may not match the shape of the Earth exactly, but it has exactly the same gravitational field. Izs\u00e1k found that the shape of the equator was not a precise circle, but deviated from one by about 400 meters. This result was magnitudes better than any previous approximation./nOn June 1, 1961, he officially announced his computations of the shape of the Earth and its surface. They brought him to the center of scientific attention and rapidly earned him international fame. He received frequent invitations and gave lectures all over the world. He continued to work hard, agreeing to write a college textbook on the motions of satellites while lecturing at Harvard University.

Son of Don Ambrosio Ricalde Moguel and Isidra Gamboa and studied at Hocab\u00e1 until 1885, the year he received a scholarship to the Normal School for teachers of the State in the city of M\u00e9rida. He graduated as a teacher at the age of 16 years, and because of his young age, was granted special permission by the State Congress./nHe studied accounting and for several years was a professor of commercial arithmetic books and accounts at the School of Commerce of M\u00e9rida. For the purpose of continuing his education, he studied civil engineering at the Institute for Literature of the state of Yucatan, under the wise leadership of Manuel Cepeda Sales. At that time, facing the danger of a collapse of one of the towers of the Cathedral of Yucatan, the authorities asked professor Sales Cepeda to assist in determining the weight of the church bell that had been ignored. The teacher passed the problem on to Ricalde Gamboa who did the calculations exactly. Since then he was appointed a professor of rational arithmetic at the Institute where he studied. For various reasons he could no longer continue his desire to study engineering, but soon after, in 1902, he was appointed professor and later director of his own engineering school, a position he continued until 1905 when he resigned to devote himself to the studies of mathematics and became a correspondent for various specialized institutions abroad./nHe assembled a large library of over 5000 titles and was a collaborator of the French academic journal L'Interm\u00e9diaire des Math\u00e9maticiens, published in Paris in the early twentieth century. He was also interested in astronomy.\nHe worked on various research projects in the city of M\u00e9rida to his death in 1942 the victim of a throat infection./nHe achieved recognition for having calculated in 1910 the orbit dish of Halley's Comet.

In the town of Ticop\u00f3, in the municipality of Acanceh, Yucatan, a high school is named after the mathematician.\nIn 2006, an award for Science and Mathematics was named in his honor./nOne of the problems that have troubled most the mathematicians of all times is the resolution of algebraic equations of all grades. Such solutions were found for polynomial equations of degree 3 and 4 by Cardano and Ferrari in the 16th century. For polynomial equations of degree 5 and more, it was proven by Abel and Galois that the solution cannot be expressed in terms of radicals (meaning the roots cannot necessarily be expressed). However, there are other ways one can solve such equations. Hermite instead found a solution involving certain functions in advanced calculus that are called elliptic functions. (They generalize trig functions and are related to elliptic curves and originally to the problem of calculating the perimeter of an ellipse.) His solution was simplified and clarified by Kronecker and Klein./nAmong Ricalde's greatest accomplishments is that of his contribution to the resolution of the general equation of 5th-degree grade by elliptic functions, a feat that is analyzed and evaluated in the second part of this biography in Enciclopedia Yucanense IV, 1944. Additionally, Ricalde corresponded in a French question-and-answer journal called L'Interm\u00e9diaire des math\u00e9maticiens. In one entry that was published in circa 1898 (Graciano would have been 25 years of age), he asked about solving the quintic equation. More specifically, his question was about reducing the general quintic equation to the reduced Bring-Jerrard form (to solve the Bring-Jerrard equation requires elliptic functions). However, in modern mathematical literature, Ricalde is rarely cited. A citation in the arXiv (funded by Cornell University) is a review by Lemmermeyer concerning another algebra problem called Pell's equation. (Lemmermeyer includes Ricalde in a list of people who solved special cases of Pell's equation, citing the 1901 issue of L'Interm\u00e9diaire des Math\u00e9maticiens).[1]/nSince there are no radical solutions to polynomial equations of degrees greater than 4, roots cannot necessarily be expressed. Also, for applications in science and engineering, \u201csolving an equation\u201d usually means \u201cfinding a close approximation of a solution\u201d. For example, if there is a real number which solves this equation, it can be said that it lies somewhere between 1.16730398 and 1.16730399. One can provide more precision, but obtaining the full decimal expansion of the solution remains impossible, yet sufficient enough. The code can still make the right decision, and a bridge will still hold if it is a sufficiently accurate approximation. Today's computers also solve polynomial equations by using iterative approximation techniques.[citation needed]/nHe amazed the Scientist of the Intermediare Mathematicians of Paris, France with his solution to the Pell equation.  Ricalde then accepted Professorship of the State College of Civil Engineering.  In a moment of stillness and recollection, Graciano Ricalde remembers he was encouraged and led by Lic. and Eng. Capeda Manuel Sales, an eminent scientist Yucatan to begin his serious studies of actual mathematics./nGraciano joined his wife and life partner who was then, then a professor Srita Normal, Carmen Manza\u00f1illa Camomile.
