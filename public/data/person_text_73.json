Instead of collapsing directly to form a flat continuous disk, due to 'turbulent stress' the gas temporarily remains puffed up in a vast rotating spheroidal atmosphere around the protosolar core. This atmosphere spins faster as it slowly contracts. It rids itself of excess angular momentum by sequentially shedding gas rings from its equator. The same process repeats itself on a much smaller scale for each of the giant planets to produce their regular satellite systems.
