{"878498": "Sir Harold Jeffreys, FRS[1][3] (22 April 1891 \u2013 18 March 1989) was a British geophysicist who made significant contributions to mathematics and statistics. His book, Theory of Probability, which was first published in 1939, played an important role in the revival of the objective Bayesian view of probability.[4][5][6]/nJeffreys was born in Fatfield, County Durham, England, the son of Robert Hal Jeffreys, headmaster of Fatfield Church School, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Sharpe, a school teacher.[7] He was educated at his father's school and at Rutherford Technical College, then studied at Armstrong College in Newcastle upon Tyne (at that time part of the University of Durham) and with the University of London External Programme.[8][9]/nJeffreys subsequently won a scholarship to study the Mathematical Tripos at St John's College, Cambridge, where he established a reputation as an excellent student: obtaining first-class marks for his papers in Part One of the Tripos, he was a Wrangler in Part Two, and in 1915 he was awarded the prestigious Smith's Prize.[9]/nJeffreys became a fellow of St John's College in 1914, retaining his fellowship until his death 75 years later. At the University of Cambridge he taught mathematics, then geophysics and finally became the Plumian Professor of Astronomy./nIn 1940, he married fellow mathematician and physicist, Bertha Swirles (1903\u20131999), and together they wrote Methods of Mathematical Physics./nOne of his major contributions was on the Bayesian approach to probability (also see Jeffreys prior), as well as the idea that the Earth's planetary core was liquid.[10]/nBy 1924 Jeffreys had developed a general method of approximating solutions to linear, second-order differential equations, including the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Although the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was developed two years later, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were apparently unaware of this earlier work, so Jeffreys is often neglected when credit is given for the WKB approximation.[11]/nJeffreys received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1937, the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1960, and the Royal Statistical Society's Guy Medal in Gold in 1962. In 1948, he received the Charles Lagrange Prize from the Acad\u00e9mie royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique.[12] He was knighted in 1953./nFrom 1939 to 1952 he was established as Director of the International Seismological Summary further known as International Seismological Centre./nThe textbook Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, written by the physicist and probability theorist Edwin T. Jaynes, is dedicated to Jeffreys. The dedication reads, \"Dedicated to the memory of Sir Harold Jeffreys, who saw the truth and preserved it.\"/nIt is only through an appendix to the third edition of Jeffreys' book Scientific Inference that we know about Mary Cartwright's method of proving that the number \u03c0 is irrational./nJeffreys, like many of his peers, staunchly opposed the concept of continental drift as put forth by Alfred Wegener and Arthur Holmes. This opposition persisted even into the 1960s among his colleagues at Cambridge. For him, continental drift was \"out of the question\" because no force even remotely strong enough to move the continents across the Earth's surface was evident.[13] As geological and geophysical evidence for continental drift and plate tectonics mounted in the 1960s and after, to the point where it became the unifying concept of modern geology, Jeffreys remained a stubborn opponent of the theory to his death.", "3958696": "Tatyana Alexeyevna Afanasyeva (Russian: \u0422\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f\u0301\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0301\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430) (Kiev, 19 November 1876 \u2013 Leiden, 14 April 1964) (also known as Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanaseva or spelled Afanassjewa) was a Russian-Dutch mathematician and physicist who made contributions to the fields of statistical mechanics and statistical thermodynamics.[1]  On 21 December 1904, she married Austrian physicist Paul Ehrenfest (1880\u20131933).

At the time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russian territory, so after graduating from normal school, Tatyana began studying mathematics and physics at the Women's University in St Petersburg under Orest Chvolson.  In 1902, she transferred to University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany to continue her studies with Felix Klein and David Hilbert.[2]/nAt the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Tatyana met Paul Ehrenfest.  When Ehrenfest discovered that Tatyana could not attend a mathematics club meeting, he argued with the school to have the rule changed.  A friendship developed between the two, and they married in 1904, later returned to St Petersburg in 1907.  Under Russian law, marriage was not allowed between two people of different religions. Since Tatyana was a Russian Orthodox and Ehrenfest was Jewish, they both decided to officially renounce their religions in order to remain married.[1]/nIn 1912 they moved to Leiden in the Netherlands, where Paul Ehrenfest was appointed to succeed Hendrik Lorentz as professor at the University of Leiden,[3] and where the couple lived throughout their career./nInitially, Tatyana collaborated closely with her husband, most famously on their classic 1911 review of the statistical mechanics of Boltzmann.[4] The Conceptual Foundations of the Statistical Approach in Mechanics, by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest was originally published in 1911 as an article for the German Encyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften (Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences), and has since been translated and republished./nShe published many papers on various topics such as randomness[5] and entropy,[6] and teaching geometry to children.[7][8]/nAlbert Einstein was a frequent guest in the 1920s at her home Witte Rozenstraat 57 in Leiden, witness the many signatures on the wall. Later Einstein departed for Princeton University and Afanasyeva corresponded. The archives of Museum Boerhaave in Leiden has three letters to her from Einstein.[9]/nAfanasjeva contacted Einstein for his advice on her manuscript on thermodynamics and inquired about a translator. She wanted to give thermodynamics a rigorous mathematical foundation which was lacking and describe pressure, temperature and entropy in changing systems. Einstein responded on 12 August 1947 that he applauded her approach but he also had some criticisms:/nEinstein did not suggest a translator and sent the manuscript back to Afanasjeva who paid herself for its publication in 1956 as Die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik with Brill Publishers in Leiden with some, but not all of Einstein's corrections.[9]/nThe Dutch Physics Council sponsors the Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa thesis award.[10]", "12019625": "Jacobus Hendricus (\"Jack\") van Lint (1 September 1932 \u2013 28 September 2004) was a Dutch mathematician, professor at the Eindhoven University of Technology, of which he was rector magnificus from 1991 till 1996./nHe gained his Ph.D. from Utrecht University in 1957 under the supervision of Fred van der Blij.[1] He was professor of mathematics at Eindhoven University of Technology from 1959 to 1997./nHe was appointed a full professor at Eindhoven University of Technology at the age of 26 years.

Although she is best known as the author of the Alexiad, Anna played an important part in the politics of the time and attempted to depose her brother, John II Komnenos, as emperor and seize the throne herself.[3]/nAt birth, Anna was betrothed to Constantine Doukas,[3] and she grew up in his mother's household.[4] She was well-educated in \"Greek literature and history, philosophy, theology, mathematics, and medicine.\"[3] Anna and Constantine were next in the line to throne[5] until Anna's younger brother, John II Komnenos, became the heir in 1092.[6] Constantine died around 1094,[6] and Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios in 1097.[7] The two had several children before Nikephoros' death around 1136.[6]/nFollowing her father's death in 1118, Anna and her mother attempted to usurp John II Komnenos.[8] Her husband refused to cooperate with them, and the usurpation failed.[3] As a result, John exiled Anna to the Kecharitomene Monastery, where she spent the rest of her life.[9] In confinement there, she wrote the Alexiad.[10]/nAnna was born on 1 December 1083[2] to Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina.[5] Her father, Alexios I Komnenos, became emperor in 1081, after usurping the previous Byzantine Emperor, Nikephoros Botaneiates.[4] Her mother, Irene Doukaina, was part of the imperial Doukas family.[11] In the Alexiad, Anna emphasises her affection for her parents in stating her relationship to Alexios and Irene.[12] She was the eldest of seven children; her younger siblings were (in order) Maria, John II, Andronikos, Isaac, Eudokia, and Theodora.[13]/nAnna was born in the Porphyra Chamber of the imperial palace in Constantinople, making her a porphyrogenita,[14] which underscored her imperial status. She noted this status in the Alexiad, stating that she was \"born and bred in the purple.\"[15]/nAccording to Anna's description in the Alexiad, her mother asked Anna to wait to be born until her father returned from war.[16] Obediently, Anna waited until her father came home.[16]/nAt birth, Anna was betrothed to Constantine Doukas,[3] the son of Emperor Michael VII and Maria of Alania.[17] The two were the heirs to the empire until sometime between c.1088 and 1092, after the birth of Anna's brother, John II Komnenos.[18] Various scholars point out that the betrothal was probably a political match intended to establish the legitimacy of Anna's father, who had usurped the previous emperor.[19]/nStarting around 1090, Constantine's mother \u2013 Maria of Alania \u2013 raised Anna in her home.[20] It was common in Byzantium for mothers-in-law to raise daughters-in-law.[21] In 1094, Maria of Alania was implicated in an attempt to overthrow Alexios I Komnenos.[18] Some scholars argue that Anna's betrothal to Constantine Doukas may not have ended there, as he was not implicated in the plot against Alexios,[7] but it certainly ended when he died around 1094.[6]/nSome scholars have also now started to look at Anna's relationships to her mother-in-law Maria of Alania, her paternal grandmother Anna Dalassene, and her mother Irene Doukaina as sources of inspiration and admiration for Anna.[22] For example, Thalia Gouma-Peterson argues that Irene Doukaina's \"maternal ability to deal with the speculative and the intellectual enables the daughter to become the highly accomplished scholar she proudly claims to be in the opening pages of the Alexiad.\"[23]/nAnna wrote at the beginning of the Alexiad about her education, highlighting her experience with literature, Greek language, rhetoric, and sciences.[15] Tutors trained her in subjects that included astronomy, medicine, history, military affairs, geography, and mathematics. Anna was noted for her education by the medieval scholar, Niketas Choniates, who wrote that Anna \"was ardently devoted to philosophy, the queen of all sciences, and was educated in every field.\"[24][25] Anna's conception of her education is shown in her testament, which credited her parents for allowing her to obtain an education.[26] This testament is in contrast to a funeral oration about Anna given by her contemporary, Georgios Tornikes. In his oration he said that she had to read ancient poetry, such as the Odyssey, in secret because her parents disapproved of its dealing with polytheism and other \"dangerous exploits,\" which were considered \"dangerous\" for men and \"excessively insidious\" for women. Tornikes went on to say that Anna \"braced the weakness of her soul\" and studied the poetry \"taking care not to be detected by her parents.\"[27]/nAnna proved to be capable not only on an intellectual level but also in practical matters. Her father placed her in charge of a large hospital and orphanage that he built for her to administer in Constantinople. The hospital was said to hold beds for 10,000 patients and orphans. Anna taught medicine at the hospital, as well as at other hospitals and orphanages. She was considered an expert on gout. Anna treated her father during his final illness.[28]/nIn roughly 1097, Anna's parents married her to Caesar Nikephoros Bryennios,[7] a member of the Bryennios family that had held the throne before the accession of Anna's father, Alexios I.[6] Nikephoros was a soldier and a historian.[3]/nMost scholars agree that the marriage was a political one \u2013 it created legitimacy for Anna's paternal family through Bryennios' connections to past emperor's family.[29] The two were an intellectual couple, and Nikephoros Bryennios tolerated and possibly encouraged Anna's scholarly interests by allowing her to participate in various scholarly circles.[30] The couple had six known children: Eirene, Maria, Alexios, John, Andronikos, and Constantine.[31] Only Eirene, John, and Alexios survived to adulthood.[31]/nIn 1087, Anna's brother, John II, was born. Several years after his birth, in 1092, John was designated emperor.[6] According to Choniates, Emperor Alexios \"favoured\" John and declared him emperor while the Empress Irene \"threw her full influence on [Anna's] side\" and \"continually attempted\" to persuade the emperor to designate Nikephoros Bryennios, Anna's husband, in John's place.[32] Around 1112, Alexios fell sick with rheumatism and could not move. He therefore turned the civil government over to his wife, Irene; she in turn directed the administration to Bryennios.[33] Choniates states that, as Emperor Alexios lay dying in his imperial bedchamber, John arrived and \"secretly\" took the emperor's ring from his father during an embrace \"as though in mourning.\"[34] Anna also worked in her husband's favour during her father's illness.[2] In 1118, Alexios I Komnenos died.[35]  A cleric acclaimed John emperor in Hagia Sophia.[9]/nAccording to Dion C. Smythe, Anna \"felt cheated\" because she \"should have inherited.\"[36] Indeed, according to Anna Komnene in the Alexiad, at her birth she was presented with \"a crown and imperial diadem.\"[37] Anna's \"main aim\" in the depiction of events in the Alexiad, according to Vlada Stankov\u00edc, was to \"stress her own right\" to the throne and \"precedence over her brother, John.\"[38]/nIn view of this belief, Susan C. Jarratt et al. record that Anna was \"almost certainly\" involved in the murder plot against John at Alexios's funeral.[39] Indeed, Anna, according to Barbara Hill, attempted to create military forces to depose John.[9] According to Choniates, Anna was \"stimulated by ambition and revenge\" to scheme for the murder of her brother.[39] Smythe states the plots \"came to nothing.\"[6] Jarratt et al., record that, a short time afterward, Anna and Bryennios \"organized another conspiracy.\"[39] However, according to Hill, Bryennios refused to overthrow John, making Anna unable to continue with her plans.[9] With this refusal, Anna, according to Choniates, exclaimed \"that nature had mistaken their sexes, for he ought to have been the woman.\"[2] According to Jarratt et al., Anna shows \"a repetition of sexualized anger.\"[39] Indeed, Smythe asserts that Anna's goals were \"thwarted by the men in her life.\"[40] Irene, however, according to Hill, had declined to participate in plans to revolt against an \"established\" emperor.[9] Hill, however, points out that Choniates, whom the above sources draw upon, wrote after 1204, and accordingly was \"rather far removed\" from \"actual\" events and that his \"agenda\" was to \"look for the causes\" of the toppling of Constantinople in 1204.[9]/nIn contrast, Leonora Neville argues that Anna was probably not involved in the attempted usurpation.[41] Anna plays a minor role in most of the available medieval sources \u2013 only Choniates portrays her as a rebel.[41] Choniates' history is from around 1204, almost a hundred years after Alexios I's death.[9] Instead, most of the sources question whether John II Komnenos' behaviour at his father's deathbed was appropriate.[42]/nThe plots were discovered and Anna forfeited her estates.[2] After her husband's death, she entered the convent of Kecharitomene, which had been founded by her mother. She remained there until her death.[43]/nIn the seclusion of the monastery, Anna dedicated her time to studying philosophy and history. She held esteemed intellectual gatherings, including those dedicated to Aristotelian studies.[44] Anna's intellectual genius and breadth of knowledge is evident in her few works. Among other things, she was conversant with philosophy, literature, grammar, theology, astronomy, and medicine. It can be assumed because of minor errors that she may have quoted Homer and the Bible from memory when writing her most celebrated work, the Alexiad.  Her contemporaries, like the metropolitan Bishop of Ephesus, Georgios Tornikes, regarded Anna as a person who had reached \"the highest summit of wisdom, both secular and divine.\"/nAnna wrote the Alexiad in the mid-1140s or 1150s.[30] Anna cited her husband's unfinished work as the reason why she began the Alexiad.[45] Before his death in 1137, her husband, Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, was working on a history, which was supposed to record the events before and during the reign of Alexios I.[45] His death left the history unfinished after recording the events of the reign of Emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates.[45] Ruth Macrides argues that while Bryennios' writing may have been a source of inspiration for the Alexiad, it is incorrect to suggest that the Alexiad was Bryennios' work edited by Anna (as Howard-Johnston has argued on tenuous grounds).[46]/nIn a statement on how she gathered her sources for the Alexiad, Anna wrote, \"My material ... has been gathered from insignificant writings, absolutely devoid of literary pretensions, and from old soldiers who were serving in the army at the time that my father seized the Roman sceptre ... I based the truth of my history on them by examining their narratives and comparing them with what I had written, and what they told me with what I had often heard, from my father in particular and from my uncles \u2026 From all these materials the whole fabric of my history \u2013 my true history \u2013 has been woven\".[47] Beyond just eyewitness accounts from veterans or her male family members, scholars have also noted that Anna used the imperial archives, which allowed her access to official documents.[48]/nIn the Alexiad, Anna provided insight on political relations and wars between Alexios I and the West. She vividly described weaponry, tactics, and battles. It has been noted that she was writing about events that occurred when she was a child, so these are not eye-witness accounts. Her neutrality is compromised by the fact that she was writing to praise her father and denigrate his successors. Despite her unabashed partiality, her account of the First Crusade is of great value to history because it is the only Byzantine eyewitness account available. She had the opportunity to gather information from key figures in the Byzantine elite; her husband, Nikephorus Bryennios, had fought in the clash with crusade leader Godfrey of Bouillon outside Constantinople on Maundy Thursday 1097; and her uncle, George Palaeologos, was present at Pelekanon in June 1097 when Alexios I discussed future strategy with the crusaders. Thus, the Alexiad allows the events of the First Crusade to be seen from the Byzantine elite's perspective. It conveys the alarm felt at the scale of the western European forces proceeding through the Empire, and the dangers they might have posed to the safety of Constantinople. Anna also identified for the first time, the Vlachs from Balkans with Dacians, in Alexiad (Chapter XIV), describing their places around Haemus mountains: \"...on either side of its slopes dwell many very wealthy tribes, the Dacians and the Thracians on the northern side, and on the southern, more Thracians and the Macedonians\". Special suspicion was reserved for crusading leader Bohemond of Taranto, a southern Italian Norman who, under the leadership of his father Robert Guiscard, had invaded Byzantine territory in the Balkans in 1081./nAnna referred to the crusaders as \"Celts\", reflecting old Greek terminology for western barbarians.[49]/nThe Alexiad was written in Attic Greek,[50] and the literary style is fashioned after Thucydides, Polybius, and Xenophon.[51] Consequently, it exhibits a struggle for an Atticism characteristic of the period, whereby the resulting language is highly artificial.[51] Peter Frankopan argues that the lapses in some of the chronology of events can in part be attributed to errors in, or lack of, source material for those events.[52] Anna herself also addressed these lapses, explaining them as a result of memory loss and old age.[53] But regardless of errors in chronology, her history meets the standards of her time.[54]/nMoreover, the Alexiad sheds light on Anna's emotional turmoil, including her grief over the deaths of her father, mother, and husband, among other things. At the end of the Alexiad, Anna wrote \"But living I died a thousand deaths \u2026 Yet I am more grief-stricken than [Niobe]: after my misfortunes, great and terrible as they are, I am still alive \u2013 to experience yet more \u2026 Let this be the end of my history, then, lest as I write of these sad events I become even more resentful.\"[55]", "19228635": "Alexander Ivanovich Molev (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u043e\u0301\u043b\u0435\u0432) FAA (born 1961) is a Russian-Australian mathematician./nHe completed his Ph.D. in 1986 under the supervision of Alexandre Kirillov at Moscow State University.

Excelling in a variety of fields, he was accomplished in mathematics, astronomy, cartography, geography, horology, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy, zoology, botany, mechanical engineering, hydraulic engineering, civil engineering, invention, art, poetry, philosophy, antiquities, and statesmanship during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279)./nSu Song was the engineer for a hydro-mechanical astronomical clock tower in medieval Kaifeng, which employed an early escapement mechanism.[2][3][4][5] The escapement mechanism of Su's clock tower had been invented by Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Yi Xing and government official Liang Lingzan in 725 AD to operate a water-powered armillary sphere, although Su's armillary sphere was the first to be provided with a mechanical clock drive.[5][6][7] Su's clock tower also featured the oldest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, called the tian ti (\u5929\u68af), or \"celestial ladder\", as depicted in his horological treatise.[8] The clock tower had 133 different clock jacks to indicate and sound the hours.[9] Su Song's treatise about the clock tower, Xinyi Xiangfayao (\u65b0\u5100\u8c61\u6cd5\u8981), has survived since its written form in 1092 and official printed publication in 1094. The book has been analyzed by many historians, such as the British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham. The clock itself, however, was dismantled by the invading Jurchen army in 1127 AD, and although attempts were made to reassemble it, the tower was never successfully reinstated./nThe Xinyi Xiangfayao was Su's best-known treatise, but the polymath compiled other works as well. He completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps, several terrestrial maps, as well as a treatise on pharmacology. The latter discussed related subjects on mineralogy, zoology, botany, and metallurgy./nEuropean Jesuit visitors to China like Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault briefly wrote about Chinese clocks with wheel drives,[10] but others mistakenly believed that the Chinese had never advanced beyond the stage of the clepsydra, incense clock, and sundial.[11] They thought that advanced mechanical clockworks were new to China and that these mechanisms were something valuable that Europeans could offer to the Chinese.[11]  Although not as prominent as in the Song period, contemporary Chinese texts of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) described a relatively unbroken history of mechanical clocks in China, from the 13th century to the 16th.[12] However, Su Song's clock tower still relied on the use of a waterwheel to power it, and was thus not fully mechanical like late medieval European clocks./nSu Song was of Hokkien ancestry [13] who was born in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou.[14] Like his contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different fields of study. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077\u20131148)[15] that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose to the top of the examination list for writing the best article on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar.[16] From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time, he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049\u20131106).[17][18] He was also an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.[18]/nIn matters of administrative government, he had attained the rank of Ambassador and President of the Ministry of Personnel at the capital of Kaifeng, and was known also as an expert in administration and finance.[19] After serving in the Ministry of Personnel, he became a Minister of Justice in 1086.[18] He was appointed as a distinguished editor for the Academy of Scholarly Worthies, where in 1063 he edited, redacted, commented on, and added a preface for the classic work Huainanzi of the Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013220 AD).[20] Eventually, Su rose to the post of Vice President of the Chancellery Secretariat. Among many honorable positions and titles conferred upon him, Su Song was also one of the 'Deputy Tutors of the Heir Apparent'. At court, he chose to distance himself from the political rivalries of the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Sima Guang (1019\u20131086), and the Reformists, led by Prime Minister Wang Anshi (1021\u20131086); although many of his associates were of the Conservative faction.[14]/nIn 1077, he was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to the Liao dynasty of the Khitan people to the north,[21] sharing ideas about calendrical science, as the Liao state had created its own calendar in 994 AD.[7] In a finding that reportedly embarrassed the court, Su Song acknowledged to the emperor that the calendar of the Khitan people was in fact a bit more accurate than their own, resulting in the fining and punishment of officials in the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar.[16] Su was supposed to travel north to Liao and arrive promptly for a birthday celebration and feast on a day which coincided with the winter solstice of the Song calendar, but was actually a day behind the Liao calendar.[22] Historian Liu Heping states that Emperor Zhezong of Song sponsored Su Song's clocktower in 1086 in order to compete with the Liao for \"scientific and national superiority.\"[23] In 1081, the court instructed Su Song to compile into a book the diplomatic history of Song-Liao relations, an elaborate task that, once complete, filled 200 volumes.[24] With his extensive knowledge of cartography, Su Song was able to settle a heated border dispute between the Song and Liao dynasties.[25]/nSu Song also created a celestial atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection on each side of the equator,[27] and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances.[28] Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo.[29] Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (\u2212350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube.[29] There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the star maps published by Su represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.[30]/nIn 1070, Su Song and a team of scholars compiled and edited the Bencao Tujing ('Illustrated Pharmacopoeia', original source material from 1058 to 1061), which was a groundbreaking treatise on pharmaceutical botany, zoology, and mineralogy.[31] In compiling information for pharmaceutical knowledge, Su Song worked with such notable scholars as Zhang Yuxi, Lin Yi, Zhang Dong, and many others.[32]/nThis treatise documented a wide range of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug.[14] It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica that could be used to cure ills through digestion.[33] He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form.[34] Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate.[34] Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants.[35] According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.[36]/nCiting evidence from an ancient work by Zheng Xuan (127\u2013200), Su believed that physicians of the ancient Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC) used realgar as a remedy for ulcers.[37] As believed in Su's day, the \"five poisons\" used by Zhou era physicians for this purpose were thought to be cinnabar, realgar, chalcanthite, alum, and magnetite.[37] Su made systematic descriptions of animals and the environmental regions they could be found, such as different species of freshwater, marine, and shore crabs.[38] For example, he noted that the freshwater crab species Eriocher sinensis could be found in the Huai River running through Anhui, in waterways near the capital city, as well as reservoirs and marshes of Hebei.[38] Su's book was preserved and copied into the Bencao Gangmu of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) physician and pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518\u20131593).[39]/nSu Song compiled one of the greatest Chinese horological treatises of the Middle Ages, surrounding himself with an entourage of notable engineers and astronomers to assist in various projects. Xinyi Xiangfayao (lit. \"Essentials of a New Method for Mechanizing the Rotation of an Armillary Sphere and a Celestial Globe\"), written in 1092, was the final product of his life's achievements in horology and clockwork. The book included 47 different illustrations of great detail of the mechanical workings for his astronomical clock tower.[40]/nSu Song's greatest project was the 40-foot-tall water-powered astronomical clock tower constructed in Kaifeng, the wooden pilot model completed in 1088, the bronze components cast by 1090, while the wholly finished work was completed by 1094 during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song.[41][42]  The emperor had previously commissioned Han Gonglian, Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel, to head the project, but the leadership position was instead handed down to Su Song. The emperor ordered in 1086 for Su to reconstruct the hun yi, or \"armillary clock\", for a new clock tower in the capital city. Su worked with the aid of Han Gong-lian, who applied his extensive knowledge of mathematics to the construction of the clock tower.[43] A small-scale wooden model was first crafted by Su Song, testing its intricate parts before applying it to an actual full-scale clock tower.[44] In the end, the clock tower had many impressive features, such as the hydro-mechanical, rotating armillary sphere crowning the top level and weighing some 10 to 20 tons,[44] a bronze celestial globe located in the middle that was 4.5 feet in diameter,[44] mechanically timed and rotating mannequins dressed in miniature Chinese clothes that exited miniature opening doors to announce the time of day by presenting designated reading plaques, ringing bells and gongs, or beating drums,[45] a sophisticated use of oblique gears and an escapement mechanism,[46] as well as an exterior facade of a fanciful Chinese pagoda. Upon its completion, the tower was called the Shui Yun Yi Xiang Tai, or \"Tower for the Water-Powered Sphere and Globe\". Joseph Needham writes:/nAfter the invention of the escapement in [AD] 725 [during the Tang dynasty], there was a great flourishing of gear-wheels in clockwork and jackwork, culminating in the bronze and iron of Su Sung's elaborate masterpiece in [AD] 1088.[47]/nYears after Su's death, the capital city of Kaifeng was besieged and captured in 1127 by the Jurchens of the Manchuria-based Jin dynasty during the Jin\u2013Song wars.[40][48] The clock tower was dismantled piece by piece by the Jurchens, who carted its components back to their own capital in modern-day Beijing. However, due to the complexity of the tower, they were unable to piece it back together. The new Emperor Gaozong of Song instructed Su's son, Su Xie, to construct a new astronomical clock tower in its place, and Su Xie set to work studying his father's texts with a team of other experts. However, they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower, and Su Xie was convinced that Su Song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas./nAs the sinologist historian Derk Bodde points out, Su Song's astronomical clock did not lead to a new generation of mass-produced clockworks throughout China since his work was largely a government-sponsored endeavor for the use of astronomers and astrologers in the imperial court.[49] Yet the mechanical legacy of Su Song did not end with his work. In about 1150, the writer Xue Jixuan noted that there were four types of clocks in his day, the basic waterclock, the incense clock, the sundial, and the clock with 'revolving and snapping springs' ('gun tan').[50] The rulers of the continuing Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368 AD) had a vested interest in the advancement of mechanical clockworks.[51]  The astronomer Guo Shoujing helped restore the Beijing Ancient Observatory beginning in 1276, where he crafted a water-powered armillary sphere and clock with clock jacks being fully implemented and sounding the hours.[52]  Complex gearing for uniquely Chinese clockworks were continued in the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), with new designs driven by the power of falling sand instead of water to provide motive power to the wheel drive, and some Ming clocks perhaps featured reduction gearing rather than the earlier escapement of Su Song.[12]  The earliest such design of a sand-clock was made by Zhan Xiyuan around 1370, which featured not only the scoop wheel of Su Song' device, but also a new addition of a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated, much like new European clocks of the same period.[53]/nIn Su Song's waterwheel linkwork device, the action of the escapement's arrest and release was achieved by gravity exerted periodically as the continuous flow of liquid filled containers of a limited size.[50] In a single line of evolution, Su Song's clock therefore united the concept of the clepsydra and the mechanical clock into one device run by mechanics and hydraulics. In his memorial, Su Song wrote about this concept:/nAccording to your servant's opinion there have been many systems and designs for astronomical instruments during past dynasties all differing from one another in minor respects. But the principle of the use of water-power for the driving mechanism has always been the same. The heavens move without ceasing but so also does water flow (and fall). Thus if the water is made to pour with perfect evenness, then the comparison of the rotary movements (of the heavens and the machine) will show no discrepancy or contradiction; for the unresting follows the unceasing.[54]/nIn his writing, Su Song credited, as the predecessor of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78\u2013139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist.[54] Su Song was also strongly influenced by the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead of water in the waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time).[55] However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.[56]/nThe mechanical clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower featured a great driving-wheel that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, into each of which water poured at a uniform rate from the \"constant-level tank\" (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in a pinion, which engaged a gear wheel at the lower end of the main vertical transmission shaft.[57]/nJoseph Needham gives a general description of the clock tower itself:/n(Su Song's) clockwork, driven by a water-wheel, and fully enclosed within the tower, rotated an observational armillary sphere on the top platform and a celestial globe in the upper story. Its time-announcing function was further fulfilled visually and audibly by the performances of numerous jacks mounted on the eight superimposed wheels of a time-keeping shaft and appearing at windows in the pagoda-like structure at the front of the tower. Within the building, some 40 ft. high, the driving-wheel was provided with a special form of escapement, and the water was pumped back into the tanks periodically by manual means. The time-annunciator must have included conversion gearing, since it gave 'unequal' as well as equal time signals, and the sphere probably had this. Su Song's treatise on the clock, the Hsin I Hsiang Fa Yao, constitutes a classic of horological engineering.[58]/nThat was figure Fig. 650, while Fig. 656 displays the upper and lower norias with their tanks and the manual wheel for operating them./nFig. 657 displays a rather miniature and scaled-down picture for the basics of the escapement mechanism in an illustration (from Su's book), with Needham's caption here in this quote: \"The 'celestial balance' or escapement mechanism of Su Song's clockwork (Xinyi Xiangfayao, ch. 3, p. 18b)\".[59] The latter figure carefully labels:/nFigure 658 displays a more intricate and most-telling half-page scale drawing of Su Song's large escapement mechanism, labeling these individual parts as they interact with one another:/nThe world's oldest illustrated depiction of an endless power-transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise.[8] It was used in the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions),[61] as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652.[8] This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft.[46] The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole.[62] Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power,[61] the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously driven chain pump known in China since the Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013220 AD).[61] From his horological treatise, Su Song states:/nThe chain drive (lit. celestial ladder) is 19.5\u00a0ft long (5.9\u00a0m). The system is as follows: an iron chain with its links joined together to form an endless circuit hangs down from the upper chain-wheel which is concealed by the tortoise-and-cloud (column supporting the armillary sphere centrally), and passes also round the lower chain-wheel which is mounted on the main driving-shaft. Whenever one link moves, it moves forward one tooth of the diurnal motion gear-ring and rotates the Component of the Three Arrangers of Time, thus following the motion of the heavens.[61]/nIn addition, the motion gear rings and the upper drive wheel both had 600 teeth, which by Su's mathematical precision carefully calculated measured units of the day in a division of 1/600.[63] These gears, having 600 teeth, thus ensured the division of the day into measurements of 2 minutes and 24 seconds each.[63]/nIn Joseph Needham's third volume of Science and Civilization in China, the drawing for Fig. 159 displays a drawing of Su Song's armillary sphere (as depicted in his 11th century treatise), complete with three 'nests' or layers of mechanically rotated rings. It was the earlier Chinese astronomer Li Chun-feng of the Tang dynasty who in 633 AD created the first armillary sphere with three layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observation.[64] Zhang's armillary sphere has often been compared to that of the 13th century monarch Alfonso X of Castile in Islamic-era Spain. The chief difference was that Alfonso's instrument featured an arrangement for making measurements of the azimuth and altitude, which was present in the Arabic tradition, while Su Song's armillary sphere was duly graduated.[65] For the drawing of Su's armillary sphere, the listing of components are:/nWhen Su Song's Xinyi Xiangfayao was written in 1092 and the horological monograph finalized and presented in 1094, his work was published and widely printed in the north (see woodblock printing and movable type of Bi Sheng). In the south, printing and circulation of his work was not widely distributed until Shi Yuanzhi of Jiangsu had it printed there in 1172.[3]/nWhen presenting his clocktower design to the Emperor Zhezong, Su Song equated the constant flow of water with the continuous movements of the heavens, the latter of which symbolized the unceasing power of the emperor.[66] This appealed to the emperor, who featured artwork representing the clocktower on vehicles of major imperial processions, as illustrated in the Illustration of the Imperial Grand Carriage Procession of 1053.[67]/nThe later Ming dynasty/Qing dynasty scholar Qian Zeng (1629\u20131699) held an old volume of Su's work, which he faithfully reproduced in a newly printed edition. He took special care in avoiding any rewording or inconsistencies with the original text as well.[3] Again, it was later reprinted by Zhang Xizu (1799\u20131844).[3]/nSu Song's treatise on astronomical clockwork was not the only one made in China during his day, as the Song Shi (compiled in 1345) records the written treatise of the Shuiyunhun Tianjiyao (Wade\u2013Giles: Shui Yun Hun Thien Chi Yao; lit. Essentials of the [Technique of] making Astronomical Apparatus revolve by Water-Power), written by Juan Taifa. However, this treatise no longer survives.[68]/nIn the realm of modern research, the late British biochemist and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900\u20131995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources on the life of Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering.[69] A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London.[15] In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.[70]", "58484716": "Sergio Doplicher (born 30 December 1940) is an Italian mathematical physicist,[1] who mainly dealt with the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory and quantum gravity./nSergio Doplicher graduated in Physics at the Sapienza University of Rome in 1963 under the supervision of Giovanni Jona-Lasinio.[2] From 1976 to 2011 he was full professor[3] of quantum mechanics in the mathematics department of Sapienza University, retiring there in 2011 as professor emeritus.[4]/nHe is known for his research based on the Haag\u2013Kastler axioms and for his collaboration with Rudolf Haag.

The Archduke had received an astronomical telescope with two convex lenses which showed objects upside down and the wrong way round. Scheiner added a third lens, thus manufacturing a terrestrial telescope which allowed Maximilian to see the beautiful stretches of his country while standing upright. A portable camera obscura was developed by Scheiner in Innsbruck. Furthermore, a walkable camera obscura was constructed./nAfter the death of Maximilian III in 1618, Archduke Leopold V was appointed imperial representative of Tyrol and of the Upper Provinces. Like his predecessor Maximilian, Leopold V put his trust in Father Scheiner. Scheiner's \"Oculus hoc est: Fundamentum opticum,\" containing many new insights into the physiological nature of the eye, was published in Innsbruck in 1619. The book had been written earlier in Ingolstadt. Oculus is subdivided into three parts: the first part treats the anatomy of the eye, the second part the refraction of the light ray inside the eye, and the third part deals with the retina and the visual angle. Scheiner once again chooses the way of observation and experiment. Like Kepler before him, he found that the retina is the seat of vision and that the optic nerve transmits the images from the retina to the brain. Scheiner was rebuked once more for going from Innsbruck to Hall in a heavily loaded coach drawn by six horses. Father General Vitelleschi wrote him a letter. Archduke Leopold V and Father Scheiner carried on a sizeable correspondence from 1620 until 1632. One of Scheiner's letters to Leopold from 1626 informs the Archduke that Galilei is not to hear of Scheiner's work concerning the sunspots./nThe inventory of Leopold's library contains works by Tycho Brahe and Galileo Galilei: Leopold lead a friendly correspondence with Galilei. On 23 May 1618, Leopold received telescopes from Galilei, along with a treatise on the sunspots, the Discorso del Flusso e Reflusso del Mare./nScheiner was the builder of the new Jesuit church in Innsbruck. Craftsmen began to work on the roof in July 1624, but September saw a sudden collapse of the middle part of the gallery and the sidewall facing the street. According to a new decision, the church had to be turned by 90\u00b0 and be reconstructed./nFreiburg University was facing a decline at the beginning of the 17th century. It was on 16 November 1620, that Archduke Leopold summoned the Jesuit Fathers, first of all, the \"most excellent by far\" Christoph Scheiner. In the spring of 1621, Scheiner was recalled for reasons confirmed to be unknown: in fact it was Archduke Karl's wish to have Scheiner as his father confessor. Archduke Karl had travelled with Scheiner from Brixen to Vienna, from where he did not return to Neisse until sometime between 1621 and 1622. In February 1623, Scheiner was appointed Superior of the future college. Then the Spanish King Philipp IV chose Karl of Austria for the office of a vice-king of Portugal. Archduke Karl travelled to Madrid. Scheiner had to travel to Rome, to instigate the foundation of the new college in Neisse. Scheiner stayed in Rome longer than his duty required. In Rosa Ursina sive Sol, he wrote that he had been sent to Rome \"ad summum pontificem, ob certa peragenda negotia\" (Latin meaning \"to the pontifical summons...\"). Other theories, contending that Scheiner had been summoned to Rome as an expert astronomer because of Galilei, or that he felt his transfer to Neisse was a punishment, have not been confirmed. It was only 13 years later, that he returned to Neisse via Vienna, where he stayed for some time./nWhen Scheiner went to Rome in 1624, friends asked him to write about his solar observations. At last he had time for mathematical books, among them Galilei\u2019s Il saggiatore, which contains Galileo's work on sunspots. This was similar to Scheiner's own work (unsurprisingly, since both were observing at the same time) but led to allegations from both of plagiarism by the other, and to a deep enmity between the two scientists.\nIn 1629 and 1630, Scheiner observed a series of mock suns (parhelia) and haloes, including a complex display on 24 January 1630.[2] These were described in his book Parhelia, which had a profound influence on the work of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and later on Christiaan Huygens. His observations also included an eclipse on 8 April 1633. \nOn 22 June 1633, Galilei received his sentence and had to renounce his claims, despite the protest sounding even from the Aristotelian side. Scheiner's influence on the trial cannot be proven. The trial files merely contain a small note mentioning that he had opposed the Copernicans. At the time of the trial, Scheiner was still in Rome, staying at the seminary for future priests./nScheiner wrote three of his books in Rome: Rosa Ursina sive Sol (Bracciano, 1626\u20131630), on sunspots, which served as a standard work for research work on the sunspots for a long time. Rosa Ursina sive Sol contains four books. In the first part, Scheiner discusses the question of priority of discovery in regard to sunspots. The second part not only describes telescopes, different kinds of projection and the helioscope but also compares the optics of the telescope to the physiological optics of the eye. In the third book, Scheiner presents a comprehensive collection of the data from his observation of sunspots. Book 4 consists of two parts: the first part deals once again with solar phenomena like sunspots and sun flares, the sun's rotation period of 27 days and the inclination of its axis of rotation. In the second part, Scheiner mentions numerous passages and quotations from the Bible, the writings of the Church Fathers and philosophers to prove that his geocentric view is in accordance with the teachings of the Catholic Church. \nScheiner published Pantographice, about the pantograph which he had invented as early as 1603, and finally in 1632/1633, Scheiner published his last work Prodromus, a pamphlet against the heliocentric theory which was published posthumously in 1651./nFather General Mutio Vitelleschi wrote his first letter to Scheiner in Vienna on 21 January 1634. Thus Scheiner must have returned to Vienna between December 1633 and January 1634. Scheiner was unwilling to go back to Neisse. In Vienna, Scheiner was forced to confront the insecure funding for his book Rosa Ursina sive Sol./nAfter 15 November 1637, Scheiner was  in Neisse in Silesia. Scheiner's activities in Neisse: Advisor, Councilor of the Rector, Mentor and Father Confessor to the students. He died there, and his obituary from 1650 maintains that Scheiner had to stay in Vienna because of the war, that he had had to flee from Neisse with all his astronomical instruments, that he usually got up early, to write or read, take care of the garden and plant trees with his own hands. The author of this obituary mentions Scheiner's modesty and chastity while pointing out that he was envied by many and \"struggled with envy himself.\" Christoph Scheiner died on 18 June 1650 in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland).[1][3]/nThe primary school in Markt Wald is named in memory of Christoph Scheiner. In Markt Wald, there is also a street and a plaque hangs in the town hall and an observation tower to his remembrance. In Ingolstadt, there is the Christoph-Scheiner-Gymnasium (a High School). The street to the observatory of the university in Munich and a road in Berlin (Charlottenburg) are named after Scheiner. In 1999, a coin (35-mm diameter), with Scheiner's face on it, was minted in Ingolstadt. Also a lunar crater is named after Scheiner (diameter: 110\u00a0km [68\u00a0mi], height of embankment: 5,500 m [18,000\u00a0ft], named by Riccoli). A postage stamp was issued in Austria (2005).

The Bogolyubovs relocated to the village of Velikaya Krucha in the Poltava Governorate (now in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine) in 1919, where the young Nikolay Bogolyubov began to study physics and mathematics. The family soon moved to Kyiv in 1921, where they continued to live in poverty as the elder Nikolay Bogolyubov only found a position as a priest in 1923.[1]/nHe attended research seminars in Kyiv University and soon started to work under the supervision of the well-known contemporary mathematician Nikolay Krylov. In 1924, at the age of 15, Nikolay Bogolyubov wrote his first published scientific paper On the behavior of solutions of linear differential equations at infinity. In 1925 he entered Ph.D. program at the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR and obtained the degree of Kandidat Nauk (Candidate of Sciences, equivalent to a Ph.D.) in 1928, at the age of 19, with the doctoral thesis titled On direct methods of variational calculus. In 1930, at the age of 21, he obtained the degree of Doktor nauk (Doctor of Sciences, equivalent to Habilitation), the highest degree in the Soviet Union, which requires the recipient to have made a significant independent contribution to his or her scientific field./nThis early period of Bogolyubov's work in science was concerned with such mathematical problems as direct methods of the calculus of variations, the theory of almost periodic functions, methods of approximate solution of differential equations, and dynamical systems. This earlier research had already earned him recognition. One of his essays was awarded the Bologna Academy of Sciences Prize in 1930, and the author was awarded the erudite degree of doctor of mathematics. This was the period when the scientific career of the young Nikolay Bogolyubov began, later producing new scientific trends in modern mathematics, physics, and mechanics./nSince 1931, Krylov and Bogolyubov worked together on the problems of nonlinear mechanics and nonlinear oscillations. They were the key figures in the \"Kyiv school of nonlinear oscillation research\", where their cooperation resulted in the paper \"On the quasiperiodic solutions of the equations of nonlinear mechanics\" (1934) and the book Introduction to Nonlinear Mechanics (1937; translated to English in 1947) leading to a creation of a large field of non-linear mechanics./nAnd this can explain, as the authors believe, the need to shape the collection of problems of non-linear perturbation theory into a special science, which could be named NON-LINEAR MECHANICS./nDistinctive features of the Kyiv School approach included an emphasis on the computation of solutions (not just a proof of its existence), approximations of periodic solutions, use of the invariant manifolds in the phase space, and applications of a single unified approach to many different problems. From a control engineering point of view, the key achievement of the Kyiv School was the development by Krylov and Bogolyubov of the describing function method for the analysis of nonlinear control problems./nIn the period 1928\u20131973, Nikolay Bogolyubov worked in the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR holding the position of the Director of the institute since 1965. He lectured at Kyiv University in the period 1936\u20131959./nAfter the German attack against the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (beginning of the Great Patriotic War), most institutes and universities from the western part of Russia were evacuated into the eastern regions, far from the battle lines. Nikolay Bogolyubov moved to Ufa, where he became Head of the Departments of Mathematical Analysis at Ufa State Aviation Technical University and at Ufa Pedagogical Institute, remaining on these positions during the period of July 1941 \u2013 August 1943./nIn autumn 1943, Bogolyubov came from evacuation to Moscow and on 1 November 1943 he accepted a position in the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Moscow State University (MSU). At that time the Head of the Department was Anatoly Vlasov (for a short period in 1944 the Head of the Department was Vladimir Fock). Theoretical physicists working in the department in that period included Dmitri Ivanenko, Arseny Sokolov, and other physicists./nIn the period 1943\u20131946, Bogolyubov's research was essentially concerned with the theory of stochastic processes and asymptotic methods. In his work[citation needed] a simple example of an anharmonic oscillator driven by a superposition of incoherent sinusoidal oscillations with continuous spectrum was used to show that depending on a specific approximation time scale the evolution of the system can be either deterministic, or a stochastic process satisfying Fokker\u2013Planck equation, or even a process which is neither deterministic nor stochastic. In other words, he showed that depending on the choice of the time scale for the corresponding approximations the same stochastic process can be regarded as both dynamical and Markovian, and in the general case as a non-Markov process. This work was the first to introduce the notion of time hierarchy in non-equilibrium statistical physics which then became the key concept in all further development of the statistical theory of irreversible processes./nIn 1945, Bogolyubov proved a fundamental theorem on the existence and basic properties of a one-parameter integral manifold for a system of non-linear differential equations. He investigated periodic and quasi-periodic solutions lying on a one-dimensional manifold, thus forming the foundation for a new method of non-linear mechanics, the method of integral manifolds./nIn 1946, he published in JETP two works on equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics which became the essence of his fundamental monograph Problems of dynamical theory in statistical physics (Moscow, 1946)./nOn 26 January 1953, Nikolay Bogolyubov became the Head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at MSU, after Anatoly Vlasov decided to leave the position on January 2, 1953./nIn 1947, Nikolay Bogolyubov organized and became the Head of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. In 1969, the Department of Theoretical Physics was separated into the Departments of Mathematical Physics (Head Vasily Vladimirov), of Statistical Mechanics, and of Quantum Field Theory (Head Mikhail Polivanov). While working in the Steklov Institute, Nikolay Bogolyubov and his school contributed to science with many important works including works on renormalization theory, renormalization group, axiomatic S-matrix theory, and works on the theory of dispersion relations./nIn the late 1940s and 1950s, Bogolyubov worked on the theory of superfluidity and superconductivity, where he developed the method of BBGKY hierarchy for a derivation of kinetic equations, formulated microscopic theory of superfluidity, and made other essential contributions. Later he worked on quantum field theory, where introduced the Bogoliubov transformation, formulated and proved the Bogoliubov's edge-of-the-wedge theorem and Bogoliubov\u2013Parasyuk theorem (with Ostap Parasyuk), and obtained other significant results. In the 1960s his attention turned to the quark model of hadrons; in 1965 he was among the first scientists to study the new quantum number color charge./nIn 1946, Nikolay Bogolyubov was elected as a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He was elected a full member (academician) of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR and in full member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1953./nSince 1956, he worked in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, where he was a founder (together with Dmitry Blokhintsev) and the first director of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics. This laboratory, where Nikolay Bogolyubov worked for a long time, has traditionally been the home of the prominent Russian schools in quantum field theory, theoretical nuclear physics, statistical physics, and nonlinear mechanics. Nikolay Bogolyubov was Director of the JINR in the period 1966\u20131988./nHe had two sons - Pavel and Nikolay (jr).

Senator was part of his surname, not his rank. He also founded a monastery, Vivarium (or \"Castellum\"), where he worked extensively the last three decades of his life.[5]/nCassiodorus was born at Scylletium, near Catanzaro in Calabria, Italy, into a family of Syrian origin.[6][7][8][9][10] His ancestry included some of the most prominent ministers of the state extending back several generations.[11] His great-grandfather held a command in the defense of the coasts of southern Italy from Vandal sea-raiders in the middle of the fifth century; his grandfather appears in a Roman embassy to Attila the Hun, and his father (who bore the same name) served as comes sacrarum largitionum and comes rerum privatarum to Odovacer[11] and as Praetorian Prefect to Theoderic the Great.[12]/nCassiodorus began his career under the auspices of his father, about in his twentieth year, when the latter made him his consiliarius upon his own appointment to the Praetorian Prefecture. In the judicial capacity of the prefect, he held absolute right of appeal over any magistrate in the empire (or Gothic kingdom, later) and the consiliarius served as a sort of legal advisor in cases of greater complexity. Evidently, therefore, Cassiodorus had received some education in the law.[13] During his working life he worked as quaestor sacri palatii c. 507\u2013511, as a consul in 514, then as magister officiorum under Theoderic, and later under the regency for Theoderic's young successor, Athalaric. Cassiodorus kept copious records and letterbooks concerning public affairs. At the Gothic court his literary skill, which seems mannered and rhetorical to modern readers, was so esteemed that when in Ravenna he was often entrusted with drafting significant public documents. His culminating appointment was as praetorian prefect for Italy, effectively the prime ministership of the Ostrogothic civil government[14] and a high honor to finish any career. Cassiodorus also collaborated with Pope Agapetus I to establish a library of Greek and Latin texts that were intended to support a Christian school in Rome./nJames O'Donnell notes:/n[I]t is almost indisputable that he accepted advancement in 523 as the immediate successor of Boethius, who was then falling from grace after less than a year as magister officiorum, and who was sent to prison and later executed. In addition, Boethius' father-in-law (and step-father) Symmachus, by this time a distinguished elder statesman, followed Boethius to the block within a year. All this was a result of the worsening split between the ancient senatorial aristocracy centered in Rome and the adherents of Gothic rule at Ravenna. But to read Cassiodorus' Variae one would never suspect such goings-on.[15]/nThere is no mention in Cassiodorus' selection of official correspondence of the death of Boethius./nAthalaric died in early 534, and the remainder of Cassiodorus' public career was dominated by the Byzantine reconquest and dynastic intrigue among the Ostrogoths. His last letters were drafted in the name of Vitiges. Around 537\u201338, he left Italy for Constantinople, from where his successor was appointed; Cassiodorus remained in the eastern capital for almost two decades, concentrating on religious questions. He notably met Junillus, the quaestor of Justinian I there. His Constantinopolitan journey contributed to the improvement of his religious knowledge./nCassiodorus spent his career trying to bridge the 6th-century cultural divides: between East and West, Greek culture and Latin, Roman and Goth, and between an orthodox people and their Arian rulers. He speaks fondly in his Institutiones of Dionysius Exiguus, the calculator of the Anno Domini era./nIn his retirement, he founded the monastery of Vivarium[11] on his family estates on the shores of the Ionian Sea, and his writings turned to religion./nCassiodorus' Vivarium \"monastery school\"[16] was composed of two main buildings: a coenobitic monastery and a retreat, for those who desired a more solitary life. Both were located on the site of the modern Santa Maria de Vetere near Squillace. The twin structure of Vivarium was to permit coenobitic monks and hermits to coexist. The Vivarium appears not to have been governed by a strict monastic rule, such as that of the Benedictine Order. Rather Cassiodorus' work Institutiones was written to guide the monks' studies. To this end, the Institutiones focus largely on texts assumed to have been available in Vivarium's library. The Institutiones seem to have been composed over a lengthy period of time, from the 530s into the 550s, with redactions up to the time of Cassiodorus' death. Cassiodorus composed the Institutiones as a guide for introductory learning of both \"divine\" and \"secular\" writings, in place of his formerly planned Christian school in Rome:/nI was moved by divine love to devise for you, with God's help, these introductory books to take the place of a teacher. Through them I believe that both the textual sequence of Holy Scripture and also a compact account of secular letters may, with God's grace, be revealed.[17]/nThe first section of the Institutiones deals with Christian texts, and was intended to be used in combination with the Expositio Psalmorum. The order of subjects in the second book of the Institutiones reflected what would become the Trivium and Quadrivium of medieval liberal arts: grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy. While he encouraged study of secular subjects, Cassiodorus clearly considered them useful primarily as aids to the study of divinity, much in the same manner as St. Augustine. Cassiodorus' Institutiones thus attempted to provide what Cassiodorus saw as a well-rounded education necessary for a learned Christian, all in uno corpore, as Cassiodorus put it.[18]/nThe library at Vivarium was still active c. 630, when the monks brought the relics of Saint Agathius from Constantinople, dedicating to him a spring-fed fountain shrine that still exists.[19] However, its books were later dispersed, the Codex Grandior of the Bible being purchased by the Anglo-Saxon Ceolfrith when he was in Italy in 679\u201380, and  taken by him to Wearmouth Jarrow, where it served as the source for the copying of the Codex Amiatinus, which was then brought back to Italy by the now aged Ceolfrith.[20] Despite the demise of the Vivarium, Cassiodorus' work in compiling classical sources and presenting a sort of bibliography of resources would prove extremely influential in Late Antique Western Europe.[21]/nCassiodorus devoted much of his life to supporting education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted.[22] His Variae shows that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, with which the untrained reader would need to begin because of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods.[23] By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it is fair to assess that, as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.[23]/nBeyond demanding the pursuit of discipline among his students, Cassiodorus encouraged the study of the liberal arts. He believed these arts were part of the content of the Bible, and some mastery of them\u2014especially grammar and rhetoric\u2014was necessary for a complete understanding of it.[23]  These arts were divided into trivium (which included rhetoric, idioms, vocabulary and etymology) and quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. He also encouraged the Benedictine monks to study the medical texts of that era, the known herbals and texts of Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen.[24]/nCassiodorus is rivalled only by Boethius in his drive to preserve and explore classical literature during the 6th century AD.[25][26]  He found the writings of the Greeks and Romans valuable for their expression of higher truths where other arts failed.[23] Though he saw these texts as vastly inferior to the perfect word of Scripture, the truths presented in them played to Cassiodorus' educational principles. Thus he is unafraid to cite Cicero alongside sacred text, and acknowledge the classical ideal of good being part of the practice of rhetoric.[23]/nHis love for classical thought also influenced his administration of Vivarium. Cassiodorus connected deeply with Christian neoplatonism, which saw beauty as concomitant with the Good.  This inspired him to adjust his educational program to support the aesthetic enhancement of manuscripts within the monastery, something which had been practiced before, but not in the universality that he suggests.[27]/nClassical learning would by no means replace the role of Scripture within the monastery; it was intended to augment the education already under way. It is also worth noting that all Greek and Roman works were heavily screened to ensure only proper exposure to text, fitting with the rest of the structured learning.[28]/nCassiodorus' legacy is quietly profound. Before the founding of Vivarium, the copying of manuscripts had been a task reserved for either inexperienced or physically infirm devotees, and was performed at the whim of literate monks. Through the influence of Cassiodorus, the monastic system adopted a more vigorous, widespread, and regular approach to reproducing documents within the monastery.[29] This approach to the development of the monastic lifestyle was perpetuated especially through German religious institutions.[29]/nThis change in daily life also became associated with a higher purpose: the process was not merely associated with disciplinary habit, but also with the preservation of history.[30] During Cassiodorus' lifetime, theological study was on the decline and classical writings were disappearing. Even as the victorious Ostrogoth armies remained in the countryside, they continued to pillage and destroy Christian relics in Italy.[25] Cassiodorus' programme helped ensure that both classical and Christian literature were preserved through the Middle Ages./nDespite his contributions to monastic order, literature, and education, Cassiodorus' labors were not well acknowledged. After his death he was only partially recognized by historians of the age, including Bede, as an obscure supporter of the Church. In their descriptions of Cassiodorus, medieval scholars have been documented to change his name, profession, place of residence, and even his religion.[25] Some chapters from his works have been copied into other texts, suggesting that he may have been read, but not generally known.[28]/nThe works not assigned as a part of Cassiodorus' educational program must be examined critically. Because he had been working under the newly dominant power of the Ostrogoths, the writer demonstrably alters the narrative of history for the sake of protecting himself. The same could easily be said about his ideas, which were presented as non-threatening in their approach to peaceful meditation and its institutional isolationism.[31]", "67496024": "Rudolf Ernst Rothe (15 October 1873, Berlin \u2013 26 October 1942, Berlin)[1] was a German applied mathematician.[2]/nAfter graduating from the Sophien-Gymnasium in Berlin, Rothe studied from 1892 under Hermann Amandus Schwarz, Johannes Knoblauch, Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs, and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius[3] at the Humboldt University of Berlin.

Earlier, he worked on computational solutions of problems emerging in theoretical physics. He is also known for his contributions to economics, specifically for proposing corrections and calculating price formation for the USSR. Later, Kronrod gave his fortune and life to medicine to care for terminal cancer patients. Kronrod is remembered for his captivating personality and was admired as a student, teacher and leader./nHe is the author of several well known books, including \"Nodes and weights of quadrature formulas. Sixteen-place tables\" and \"Conversations on Programming\". A biographer wrote Kronrod gave ideas \"away left and right, quite honestly being convinced that the authorship belongs to the one who implements them.\"/nKronrod was born in Moscow. Growing up, he studied math with D. O. Shklyarsky in school and in 1938 entered the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at Moscow State University. He did his first independent mathematical work as a freshman with Professor Alexander Gelfond. Kronrod was honored as a student with the first prize of the Moscow Mathematical Society and was the only person to win the prize twice./nDuring World War II he was rejected for military service because at the time graduate level students were exempt. They did help to build trenches around Moscow, and when he returned, Kronrod reapplied and was accepted. He served twice, and was injured twice. He was awarded several medals, including Order of the Red Star. The second injury in 1943 hospitalised him for a year and he was discharged from the army in 1944.[3] This injury made him an invalid of sorts for life./nKronrod was married and about this time his son was born. During next four years he continued his studies at the University, simultaneously working at the Atomic Energy Kurchatov Institute.[3] There he chose to leave pure mathematics and pursue computational mathematics./nIn his last undergraduate year, Kronrod studied with Nikolai Luzin the teacher of many of the Soviet Union's finest scientists. Kronrod and Georgy Adelson-Velsky were colleagues and Luzin's last students. Like his teacher, Kronrod led a series of supplementary seminars for younger mathematics students. Unusually for the time, instead of students merely reporting on the content of courses, Kronrod made his students undertake training exercises, even proving basic theorems themselves. The preparation required for this reduced the numbers of participants, but those who remained, including Robert Minlos and Anatoli Vitushkin, derived great benefit. Vitushkin described him as \"witty and friendly\". At his own request, Kronrod was called simply \"Sasha\" by his students.[3] He was considered to be a prophet in his field. The Kronod circle met between 1946 and 1953. Kronrod's position was formally at the Institute of Physics, which meant that his students had to register with other advisers, accounting for the decline of the circle into a series of friendly meetings.[3] When he defended thesis in 1949, his committee including Mstislav Keldysh, Andrey Kolmogorov and Dmitrii Menshov bypassed the Candidate of Sciences degree and awarded him a Doctor of Sciences degree in the physical-mathematical sciences./nKronrod taught at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute.

They could surpass the results achieved outside the USSR by far faster machines, in the case of CERN in Geneva, five hundred times faster.

He held what today are controversial views on the role of gender in computing. He employed women in ITEP's coding and card punching groups, believing that female computing staff members are more accurate than males. He also believed that in order to think, the male scientists qualified to use the computers needed to be free from operating them. The women did the input and quality assurance side by side with the men and for each month without an error received a 20% raise in salary./nHe applied computing resources to the USSR planned economy and to cancer research. He served with Leonid Kantorovich and others on a cabinet ministry commission and oversaw the computation of the country's material expenditures to correct price formation. Kronrod's student V. D. Belkin further developed this work. At the Gertsen cancer research institute during the 1960s, with his student P. E. Kunin he studied the differential diagnostics of lung cancer and pneumonia to help doctors determine when surgery is needed./nKronrod had a profound interest in artificial intelligence known in the USSR at the time as heuristic programming.

The developers included Adelson-Velsky who used Alexander Brudno's adversarial search algorithm and a \"general recursive search scheme\" by Kronrod. They were advised by Russian chess master A.R. Bitman and world champion Mikhail Botvinnik[6] in what was the first test of Shannon brute force vs. selective search.[7]/nKronrod's participation came at great cost. The physics users at ITEP complained, thinking that the lab was being used for game playing, when the division was writing the Crazy Eights card game and chess trying to teach a machine to think./nWhen the Communist Party reprimanded him in 1968 for cosigning a letter with many mathematicians in defense of the mathematician and logician Alexander Esenin-Volpin, a son of the poet Sergei Yesenin, the physicists were able to oust him from ITEP. He was also fired from his professorship.[8]/nHe then directed the mathematics laboratory at the Central Scientific Research Institute of Patent Information (CNIIPI) where he proposed patent reform to stimulate inventions. After gaining support he lost this position to an unsympathetic director. His last position was heading a Central Geophysical Expedition laboratory that processed drilling data where he made calculations for gas and oil exploration, but he was not challenged by this work. He re-examined his goals and soon changed course./nKronrod decided that his best work was to help others and most importantly the terminally ill. He spent his fortune developing milil from a sour milk extract for cancer patients, to fill a shortage of anabol, an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance Bogdanov in Bulgaria. He was promised but never acquired an animal testing laboratory so he tested the medicine on himself. Kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine. Milil was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward A.A. Vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by Kronrod's method. Kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free. The drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him. He regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required milil for treatment and the case was dismissed./nHe slowly recovered when a stroke took his speech and ability to read and write but was forced to resign at the Central Geophysical Expedition and stop all work on math.

C. Crombie writes/nWhen the Western Schism broke out in 1378, Henry sided with Urban VI against Clement VII, and wrote various treatises in defence of the former. In 1379 he composed \"Epistola pacis\" (see Helmst\u00e4dter Program, 1779 and 1780) in which, under the form of a disputation between an Urbanist and a Clementine, he advocates the suppression of the schism by way of a general council or a compromise. In his Epistola concilii pacis, composed in 1381, and based on a similar work, the Epistola Concordiae of Conrad of Gelnhausen, he urges still more strongly the necessity of a general council and severely criticises the many abuses that were permitted to go on within the Church./nThese two treatises of Henry, and the Epistola Concordiae of Conrad, formed the basis of a discourse delivered by Cardinal Pietro Philargi, the future Alexander V, at the first session of the Council of Pisa (26 March 1409; see Bliemetzrieder in Historisches Jahrbuch (Munich, 1904), XXV, 536-541). Henry's Epistola concilii pacis is printed in von der Hardt's Concilium Constantiense, II, 1, 3-60, with the exception of the first and the second chapter, which were afterwards published by the same author in Discrepantia mss. et editionum (Helmstadt, 1715), 9-11./nWhen in 1382 the French court compelled the professors of the College of Sorbonne (University of Paris) to acknowledge the antipope Clement VII, Henry left the university and spent some time at Eberbach Abbey, a Cistercian monastery near Wiesbaden. A letter which he wrote here to Bishop Eckard of Worms, and which bears the title De scismate was edited by Sommerfeldt in Historisches Jahrbuch (Munich, 1909), XXX, 46\u201361. Another letter which he wrote here to the same bishop, on the occasion of the death of the bishop's brother, is entitled De contemptu mundi (edited by Sommerfeldt in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr kath. Theologie (Innsbruck, 1905), XXIX, 406-412). A second letter of condolence, written about 1384, was edited by Sommerfeldt in \"Hist. Jahrbuch\" (Munich, 1909), XXX, 298\u2013307./nFollowing the invitation of Albert III, Duke of Austria, he went to the University of Vienna in 1384, and assisted in the foundation of a theological faculty. Here he spent the remainder of his life, teaching dogmatic theology, exegesis, and Canon law, and writing numerous treatises./nIn 1384 Heinrich von Langenstein, together with his colleague and friend Heinrich Totting von Oytha (who descended from the Northern German town now known as Friesoythe), took up teaching and administrative duties at the newly established University of Vienna (founded 1365, first students subscribed 1385)./nHe died at Vienna, having refused an episcopal see which was offered him by Urban VI./nIn 2008 the University of Vienna attached a third memorial plaque to Heinrich von Langenstein and Heinrich Totting in the University Church, St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna (first: 1397 upon their burial in the Apostelchoir, second: upon re-burial of the two friends in the Katharinenkapelle 1510) near the Apostelchoir, acknowledging the two teachers the \"founding professors\" of the University of Vienna./nRoth (see below) ascribes to him seven works on astronomy, eighteen historico-political treatises on the schism, seventeen polemics, fifty ascetical treatises, and twelve epistles, sermons and pamphlets. Among his printed works are:", "780445": "Thomas Harriot (/\u02c8h\u00e6ri\u0259t/;[2] c.\u20091560 \u2013 2 July 1621), also spelled Harriott, Hariot or Heriot, was an English astronomer, mathematician, ethnographer and translator to whom the theory of refraction is attributed. Thomas Harriot was also recognized for his contributions in navigational techniques,[3] working closely with John White to create advanced maps for navigation.[3] While Harriot worked extensively on numerous papers on the subjects of astronomy, mathematics and navigation, he remains obscure because he published little of it,[4] namely only The Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588).[3] This book includes descriptions of English settlements and financial issues in Virginia at the time.[3] He is sometimes credited with the introduction of the potato to the British Isles.[5] Harriot invented binary notation and arithmetic several decades before Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, but this remained unknown until the 1920's.[6]  He was also the first person to make a drawing of the Moon through a telescope, on 5 August 1609, about four months before Galileo Galilei.[7]/nAfter graduating from St Mary Hall, Oxford, Harriot travelled to the Americas, accompanying the 1585 expedition to Roanoke island funded by Sir Walter Raleigh and led by Sir Ralph Lane. He learned the Carolina Algonquian language from two Native Americans, Wanchese and Manteo, and could translate it, making him a vital member of the expedition. On his return to England, he worked for the 9th Earl of Northumberland./nBorn in 1560 in Oxford, England, Thomas Harriot attended St Mary Hall, Oxford. His name appears in the hall's registry dating from 1577.[8]/nHarriot started to study navigation shortly after receiving a bachelor's degree from Oxford University.[4] The study of navigation that Harriot studied concentrated on the idea of the open seas and how to cross to the New World from the Atlantic Ocean.[3] He used instruments such as the astrolabe and sextants to aide his studies of navigation.[3] After educating himself by incorporating ideals from his astronomic and nautical studies, Harriot taught other captains his navigational techniques in Raleigh.[4] His findings were recorded in the Articon but were later never found.[3]/nAfter his graduation from Oxford in 1580, Harriot was first hired by Sir Walter Raleigh as a mathematics tutor; he used his knowledge of astronomy/astrology to provide navigational expertise, help design Raleigh's ships, and serve as his accountant. Prior to his expedition with Raleigh, Harriot wrote a treatise on navigation.[9] He made efforts to communicate with Manteo and Wanchese, two Native Americans who had been brought to England.  Harriot devised a phonetic alphabet to transcribe their Carolina Algonquian language./nHarriot and Manteo spent many days in one another's company; Harriot interrogated Manteo closely about life in the New World and learned much that was to the advantage of the English settlers.[10] In addition, he recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:/nHe made only one expedition, around 1585\u201386, and spent some time in the New World visiting Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina, expanding his knowledge by improving his understanding of the Carolina Algonquian language. As the only Englishman who had learned Algonquin prior to the voyage, Harriot was vital to the success of the expedition.[11] Hariot smoked tobacco before Raleigh, and may have taught him to do so.[12]/nHis account of the voyage, named A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, was published in 1588 (probably written a year before). The True Report contains an early account of the Native American population encountered by the expedition; it proved very influential upon later English explorers and colonists. He wrote: \"Whereby it may be hoped, if means of good government be used, that they may in short time be brought to civility and the embracing of true religion.\"[13]  At the same time, his views of Native Americans' industry and capacity to learn were later largely ignored in favor of the parts of the \"True Report\" about extractable minerals and resources.[citation needed]/nAs a scientific adviser during the voyage, Harriot was asked by Raleigh to find the most efficient way to stack cannonballs on the deck of the ship. His ensuing theory about the close-packing of spheres shows a striking resemblance to atomism and modern atomic theory, which he was later accused of believing. His correspondence about optics with Johannes Kepler, in which he described some of his ideas, later influenced Kepler's conjecture.[citation needed]/nHarriot was employed for many years by Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland, with whom he resided at Syon House, which was run by Henry Percy's cousin Thomas Percy.[citation needed]/nThe Duke was surrounded by many scholars and learned men and provided a more stable form of patronage than Raleigh, In 1595 the Duke of Northumberland made property in Durham over to Harriot, moving him up the social ladder into 'the landed gentry'. Not long after the Durham transactions, the Duke gave Harriot the use of one of the houses on the estate at Syon, to work on optics and the sine law of refraction.[14]/nHarriot's sponsors began to fall from favor: Raleigh was the first, and Harriot's other patron Henry Percy, the Earl of Northumberland, was imprisoned in 1605 in connection with the Gunpowder Plot as he was closely connected to one of the conspirators, Thomas Percy. Harriot himself was interrogated and briefly imprisoned but was soon released.[3] Walter Warner, Robert Hues, William Lower, and other scientists were present around the Earl of Northumberland's mansion as they worked for him and assisted in the teaching of the family's children.[8]/nWhile this was occurring, Harriot continued his work involving mainly astronomy, and in 1607 Harriot used his notes from the observations of Halley's Comet to elaborate on his understanding of its orbit.[3] Soon after, in 1609 and 1610 respectively, Harriot turned his attention towards the physical aspects of the Moon and his observations of the first sightings of sunspots.[4]/nIn early 1609, he bought a \"Dutch trunke\" (telescope), invented in 1608, and his observations were among the first uses of a telescope for astronomy. Harriot is now credited as the first astronomer to draw an astronomical object after viewing it through a telescope: he drew a map of the Moon on 5 August 1609 [O.S. 26 July 1609], preceding Galileo by several months. By 1613, Harriot had created two maps of the whole Moon, with many identifiable features such as lunar craters depicted in their correct relative positions that were not to be improved upon for several decades.[15][16] He also observed sunspots in December 1610.[17]/nFrom 1614 Harriot was consulting Theodore de Mayerne, who was among James I's doctors, for an apparent cancer of the left nostril that was gradually eating away the septum[18] and was apparently linked to a cancerous ulcer on his lip. This progressed until 1621, when he was living with a friend named Thomas Buckner on Threadneedle Street. There he died, apparently from skin cancer. It was suspected that Harriot's cancer was due to excessive tobacco consumption.[3]/nHe died on 2 July 1621, three days after writing his will (discovered by Henry Stevens).[19] His executors posthumously published his Artis Analyticae Praxis on algebra in 1631; Nathaniel Torporley was the intended executor of Harriot's wishes, but Walter Warner in the end pulled the book into shape.[20] It may be a compendium of some of his works but does not represent all that he left unpublished (more than 400 sheets of annotated writing). It is not directed in a way that follows the manuscripts and it fails to give the full significance of Harriot's writings.[8]/nThomas Harriot was buried in the church of St Christopher le Stocks in Threadneedle Street, near where he died. The church was subsequently damaged in the Great Fire of London, and demolished in 1781 to enable expansion of the Bank of England./nHarriott also studied optics and refraction, and apparently discovered Snell's law 20 years before Snellius did; like so many of his works, this remained unpublished. In Virginia he learned the local Algonquian language, which may have had some effect on his mathematical thinking.[citation needed] He founded the \"English school\" of algebra. Around 1600, he introduced an algebraic symbolism close to modern notation; thus, computation with unknowns became as easy as with numbers.[21] He is also credited with discovering Girard's theorem, although the formula bears Girard's name as he was the first to publish it.[22]/nHis algebra book Artis Analyticae Praxis[23] (1631) was published posthumously in Latin. Unfortunately, the editors did not understand much of his reasoning and removed the parts they did not comprehend such as the negative and complex roots of equations. Because of the dispersion of Harriot's writings the full annotated English translation of the Praxis was not completed until 2007.[24] A more complete manuscript, De numeris triangularibus et inde de progressionibus arithmeticis: Magisteria magna, was finally published in facsimile form with commentary by Janet Beery and Jackie Stedall in 2009.[25]/nThe first biography of Harriot was written in 1876 by Henry Stevens of Vermont but not published until 1900[19] fourteen years after his death. The publication was limited to 167 copies and so the work was not widely known until 1972 when a reprint edition appeared.[26] Prominent American poet, novelist and biographer Muriel Rukeyser wrote an extended literary inquiry into the life and significance of Hariot (her preferred spelling), The Traces of Thomas Hariot (1970, 1971). Interest in Harriot continued to revive with the convening of a symposium at the University of Delaware in April 1971 with the proceedings published by the Oxford University Press in 1974.[27] John W. Shirley the editor (1908-1988) went on to publish A Sourcebook for the Study of Thomas Harriot[28] and his Harriot biography (1983).[29] The papers of John Shirley are held in Special Collections at the University of Delaware.[30]/nHarriot's accomplishments remain relatively obscure because he did not publish any of his results and also because many of his manuscripts have been lost; those that survive are in the British Museum and in the archives of the Percy family at Petworth House (Sussex) and Alnwick Castle (Northumberland). He was frequently accused of being an atheist, and it has been suggested that he deliberately refrained from publishing for fear of intensifying such attacks; as the literary historian Stephen Greenblatt writes \"... he preferred life to fame. And who can blame him?\"[31]/nAn event was held at Syon House, West London, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Harriot's first observations of the Moon on 26 July 2009. This event, Telescope400,[32] included the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Harriot by Lord Egremont. The plaque can now be seen by visitors to Syon House, the location of Harriot's historic observations. His drawing made 400 years earlier is believed to be based on the first observations of the Moon through a telescope. The event (sponsored by the Royal Astronomical Society) was run as part of the International Year of Astronomy (IYA)./nThe original documents showing Harriot's Moon map of c. 1611, observations of Jupiter's satellites, and first observations of sunspots were on display at the Science Museum, London, from 23 July 2009 until the end of the IYA.[33]/nThe observatory in the campus of the College of William & Mary is named in Harriot's honor. A crater on the Moon was named after him in 1970; it is on the Moon's far side and hence unobservable from Earth.[citation needed]/nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for this planet. (55 Cancri in the constellation Cancer). The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer.[citation needed]/nThe Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC is named in recognition of this Harriot's scientific contributions to the New World such as his work A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia.[10]/nAn alternate history short story, \"Harriott Publishes\", depicts the consequences of Harriott publishing his observations before Galileo.  It appears in anthology of similar stories, Altered Times, pages 13\u201315./nHarriot's 5 August [O.S. 26 July] 1609 drawings of his observations of the Moon have been noted as the first recorded telescopic observations ever made, predating Galileo Galilei's 30 November 1609 observation by almost four months.[34][35] Galileo's drawings, which were the first such observations to be published, contained greater detail such as identifying previously unknown features including mountains and craters.[34] Harriot inaccurately drew how far the crescent Moon would be illuminated around its limb, inaccurately drew the position of the craters, and did not draw the relief details that one would see along the Moon's light/dark terminator.[36] Critics, such as Terrie Bloom, accused Harriot of plagiarizing depictions directly from Galileo's works and argued that Harriot's representation of the Moon was an inadequate representation that needed to be improved.[36] However, both descriptions were also deemed valuable due to the scientists focusing on different specific observations.[34] Galileo describes the arrangement in a topographical way while Harriot used cartographical concepts to illustrate his views of the Moon.[34] Harriot used a 6X Dutch telescope for his observations of the Moon.[34] Harriot's recordings and descriptions were very simple with minimal detail causing his sketches to be difficult to analyze by later scientists.[36]  Galileo's astronomical observations regarding the Moon were published in his book Sidereus Nuncius in 1610 and Harriot's observations were published in 1784 with some not coming to light until 1965.[34] Harriot's lack of publication is presumed to be connected to the issues with the Ninth Earl of Northumberland and the Gunpowder Plot.[34] Harriot was also known to have read and admired the work of Galileo in Sidereus Nuncius. Harriot continued his observations of the Moon until 1612.[34]/nThomas Harriot is recognized as the first person to observe sunspots in 1610 with the use of a telescope.[37] Harriot observed the sunspot with the use of a telescope in a direct and hazardous way.[38] Even though Harriot observed the Sun directly through his telescope, there were no recorded injuries to his eyes.[4] Harriot's depiction of the sunspots were documented in 199 drawings that provided details about the solar rotation and its acceleration.[38] Like many of Harriot's other notes, depictions of the sunspots were not published.[38] Similar to the early observation of the Moon, Galileo was also known to contribute his observations of sunspots and published his findings in 1613.[37] The specifics as to how Harriot's telescope was set up remains largely unknown.[38] However, it is known that Harriot used different magnifications of telescopes with 10X and 20X power being used most often.[38] Harriot chose to observe the sunspots after sunrise because it made the vertical easier to analyze.[38] According to Harriot's notes there was a total of 690 observations of sunspots recorded.[38] Harriot's findings challenged the idea of the unchanging heavens by explaining the Sun's axial rotation and provided further support for the heliocentric theory.[4]/nAround 1620, Harriot's unpublished papers include the early basis of continuous compounding.[39] Harriot uses modern mathematical concepts to explain the process behind continuous compounding.[39] The concept of compounded interest occurs when the more times interest is added within the year assuming the rate stays the same then the final interest will be larger.[39] Based on this observation, Harriot created mathematical equations that included logarithms and series calculations to illustrate his concepts.[39]", "65366177": "Nina Holden is a Norwegian mathematician interested in probability theory and stochastic processes, including graphons, random planar maps, the Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution, and their applications to quantum gravity.

My old parents (77-year-old father and 74-years-old mother) and brother asked me to write. My mother told me that before the end of my exile she and my father could die.

Vazif Meylanov wrote about it in his \"Letter to Russian writers.\" This essay, written in the form of an appeal to people, who glorify the Party's new course and speak about the changes in society and are reticent about the latest unbroken people still serving time in prison and exile - for the word.\u201d/n\"Lovers of mankind!

The article criticizes the views of Shafarevich on history and draws attention to basic mistakes of \"Russian national consciousness.\"/nIn early 1990 Vazif Meylanov was nominated for the deputies of the public organization - the Union of Cooperators of DASSR. However, the district election commission refused to register him as a candidate even after direct reference of the Central Election Commission. The representative of the CEC of the RSFSR during telephone call admitted that the demand not to register Vazif Meylanov as a candidate had come directly from Magomedali Magomedov, who was the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Dagestan ASSR at that time. The documentary chronicle of the story was published in the \"Komsomolets of Dagestan\u201d newspaper./nIn the summer of 1990 Meylanov participated in resolving the ethnic conflict in the village of Tiwi, Kvareli region of Georgia. The conflict was provoked by supporters of Gamsakhurdia, who was against the Avars. After the publication of Meylanov's points on Georgia in the newspaper \"Komsomolets of Dagestan\" its editor Tatyana Voronina was removed from her post. Journalists Alexander Torba, Dmitry Gorbanev, Sharapudin Magomedov resigned from the newspaper in protest at the decision of the Regional Committee of the Dagestan Young Communist League (Komsomol)./nIn 1990 Vazif Meylanov published a brochure \"At first hand\", which includes works written in the Chistopol prison./nIn 1990 Vazif Meylanov was rehabilitated. The rehabilitation decision was made by the authorities, without any effort of the former prisoner. On December 6, 1989, First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court RSFSR Radchenko sent an application No. 1646 on Vazif Meylnov's rehabilitation to the Presidium of the Supreme Court. On January 3, 1990, resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Court dismiss charges from Meylanov for the distribution of books of Solzhenitsyn, Bunin, Khodasevich, Panin and charges for going to the square with a banner in support of Andrei Sakharov. The rest of the sentence was upheld, that is Meylanov still was considered to be guilty of \"writing slanderous anti-Soviet works.\" The criminal case against Vazif Meylanov was completely closed for absence of a crime in the act by the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR No. 2004-90 November 29, 1990, after repeated protest of the Prosecutor General of the USSR Sukharev No.13 / 209\u201380 on July 18, 1990.

At the same time he examined mistakes and false stereotypes of democratic leaders, which became evident in the view of the Chechen crisis. The book  \"Another Sky. False stereotypes of Russian democracy. Analysis of the Chechen crisis\" was published in 100 copies in the printing-office of Dawood Zulumhanov in Makhachkala. Vazif Meylaniv attempted to publish this book in Moscow due to various publishers and foundations, but all publishers rejected - his point of view on the issue came into conflict with the opinion of the \"progressive community\" that supported Dudayev: \"I found necessary to express my opinion about the Chechen war, because all formal and informal teachers of Russia and the world took the side of Chechen nationalists, Chechen national liberators, Chechen national revolutionists, and It\u2019s them (national liberators), who I regard as the wrong side\".[8]/nIn the 1990s Vazif Meylanov continued to elaborate on the definition of freedom and its conditionality precisely metered by the lack of freedom for all and the ban to violate the freedom of others. He criticized nationalism (giving the examples of Chechnya and Georgia) pointed out the danger of Islamism./nIn 1999 he was nominated by a group of young people as a candidate of the National Assembly of the Dagestan Republic in Lezgin constituency. The district election commission refused to register the initiative group, because it found inaccuracies in the design of the subscription lists. The initiative group filed a suit and won the trial, according to the decision of the Leninsky District Court of Makhachkala Vazif Meylanov was registered as a candidate 2 days before the end of the election campaign./nIn 2003  the third edition of the \"Analysis of the Chechen crisis\" and \"False stereotypes of Russian democracy\" were published under the title \"The experience of private political activity in Russia.\"/nIn 2001 the magazine \"Znamya\" (Banner) published an article of Vazif Meylanov \"On abolition of civil rights in Russia.\" The article is devoted to the discovery, which was made by the author at the end of legal battles with the state in the case of compensation for harm caused by illegal imprisonment and exile for 9 years. The Court awarded compensation to the author in the amount of 311 thousand rubles. But officers of justice returned the judgment with a note that according to Article 110 of the Federal Law \"On the Federal Budget for 2001\" claimant presents himself the decision of the court to the debtor. That is, in fact, enforcement of claims to the state in Russia were canceled (the bailiff service guarantees the enforcement, if the debtor \u2013 is a private or legal entity). And the enforcement is not canceled by the procedural law (e.g., the Enforcement law), but by substantive law adopted per year \u2013 by the budget. That is, in Russia - according to law - the state has the right not to pay its debts, despite the court's decision. The principle of compulsory execution of court decisions has an exception for the state - it now executes the court decisions voluntary. After analyzing this issue and summarizing the Russian practice of non-compliance with court decisions on claims to the state since 2001 (article, which repeals the enforcement, was repeated in subsequent law on the budget). In 2006 Vazif Meylanov wrote and published the book \u201cMistaken constants of Russian consciousness\" with the subtitle \"Why court decision satisfying the claims of citizens against the state are not implemented in Russia\u201d in publishing house \"Socium\"./nIn 2005 due to the universal obligatory exchange of old Russian national passports for new passports Vazif Meylanov handed in application for a new passport in the passport and visa service of the Leninsky district of Makhachkala. But Meylanov didn't receive a new passport under the pretext of the absence of residence registration his old passport. He went to court and on July 29, 2005, the Leninsky District Court of Makhachkala held:/n\"To recognize illegal the inaction of officials of the passport and visa service of the Leninsky district Police Department of Makhachkala, which left unanswered the application of Russian citizen Meylanov for a new passport.

Vazif Meylanov handed over documents for execution to the bailiffs, who two months later stated that they could not make the passport office issue the new passport to Vazif Meylanov. Finally, Vazif Meylanov received the new passport in Foreigner Regional Registrational Office. The story about the exchange of passport was described in details by Natalia Krainova in the series of articles, published in the newspaper \"New Business\" in 2005\u20132006./nIn the 2000s the articles of Vazif Meylanov were published in the regional newspapers \u201cChernovik\u201d (Rough copy) and \u201cNovoe delo Archived 2015-08-01 at the Wayback Machine\u201d (New affair)./nVazif Meylanov died on January 11, 2015, in Makhachkala after suffering from Alzheimer disease for years.[1] He was buried on the New Cemetery in Makhachkala, Russia./nDocuments from the investigation file and the identification record of the prisoner remain deposited in the private archive of Vazif Meylanov.

I remember the early months of his struggle, few believed that Vazif would hold his position. \"We have broken even stronger prisoners!\" - said the cops. \"We have seen more brave men,\" - said those prisoners who were weaker in spirit and the most jealous. But four years later, when, even without knowing it, I was living the last months in prison, sitting together with Meylanov in punishment cell, he also stood firm on his own, as at the beginning. The years of punishment cells and prisons fell behind, his health was destroyed, but KGB didn't manage to break his spirit.

Two years into its success, Mead and Conway received Electronics magazine's annual award of achievement.[35] Since then, MOSIS has fabricated more than 50,000 circuit designs for commercial firms, government agencies, and research and educational institutions around the world.[36] VLSI researcher Charles Seitz commented that \"MOSIS represented the first period since the pioneering work of Eckert and Mauchley on the ENIAC in the late 1940s that universities and small companies had access to state-of-the-art digital technology.\"[34]/nThe research methods used to develop the Mead\u2013Conway VLSI design methodology and the MOSIS prototype are documented in a 1981 Xerox report[37] and the Euromicro Journal.[38] The impact of the Mead\u2013Conway work is described in a number of historical overviews of computing.[34][39][40][41][42] Conway and her colleagues have compiled an online archive of original papers that documents much of that work.[43][44] The methods also came under ethnographic study in 1980 by PARC anthropologist Lucy Suchman, who published her interviews with Conway in 2021.[45][46]/nIn the early 1980s, Conway left Xerox to join DARPA, where she was a key architect of the Defense Department's Strategic Computing Initiative, a research program studying high-performance computing, autonomous systems technology, and intelligent weapons technology.[13][47]/nIn a USA Today article about Conway's joining DARPA, Mark Stefik, a Xerox scientist who worked with her, said \"Lynn would like to live five lives in the course of one life\" and that she's \"charismatic and very energetic\".[48] Douglas Fairbairn, a former Xerox associate, said \"She figures out a way so that everybody wins.\"[48]/nConway joined the University of Michigan in 1985 as professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and associate dean of engineering. There she worked on \"visual communications and control probing for basic system and user-interface concepts as applicable to hybridized internet/broadband-cable communications\".[13] She retired from active teaching and research in 1998, as professor emerita at Michigan.[49]/nAs sociologist Thomas Streeter discusses in The Net Effect:[50][51] \"By taking this job, Conway was demonstrating that she was no antiwar liberal. (In response to critics, she has said, 'if you have to fight, and sometimes you must in order to deal with bad people, history tells us that it really helps to have the best weapons available)\".[12] But Conway carried a sense of computers as tools for horizontal communications that she had absorbed at PARC right into DARPA \u2013 at one of the hottest moments of the cold war.\"/nIn the fall of 2012, the IEEE published a special issue of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine devoted to Lynn Conway's career,[52][53] including a career memoir by Conway[20] and peer commentaries by Chuck House,[54] former Director of Engineering at HP, Carlo S\u00e9quin, Professor of EECS at U.C. Berkeley,[55] and Ken Shepard, of Columbia University.[56] Subsequently the scope of Conway's contributions gained wider retrospective attention. \"Since I didn't #LookLikeanEngineer, few people caught on to what I was really doing back in the 70s and 80s,\" says Conway.[21]/n\"Clearly a new paradigm had emerged ... Importantly, imaginative support in terms of infrastructure and idea dissemination proved as valuable as the concepts, tools, and chips. The \"electronic book\" and the \"foundry\" were both prescient and necessary, providing momentum and proof-points.\"[54] James F. \"Jim\" Gibbons, former dean of engineering at Stanford University, further states that Lynn Conway, from his perspective, \"...was the singular force behind the entire 'foundry' development that emerged.\"[54] Kenneth Shepard, Professor of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, stated that \"Lynn's amazing story of accomplishment and personal triumph in the face of personal adversity and overt discrimination should serve as an inspiration to all young engineers.\"[56][57]/nIn 2020, NAE President John L. Anderson stated that \"Lynn Conway is not only a revolutionary pioneer in the design of VLSI systems ... But just as important, Lynn has been very brave in telling her own story, and her perseverance has been a reminder to society that it should not be blind to the innovations of women, people of color, or others who don't fit long outdated \u2013 but unfortunately, persistent \u2013 perceptions of what an engineer looks like.\"[21]/nWhen nearing retirement, Conway learned that the story of her early work at IBM might soon be revealed through the investigations of Mark Smotherman that were being prepared for a 2001 publication.[6] She began quietly coming out in 1999 to friends and colleagues about her past gender transition,[58][59][60] using her personal website to tell the story in her own words.[12] Her story was then more widely reported in 2000 in profiles in Scientific American[14] and the Los Angeles Times.[19] In a later Forbes interview, Conway commented \"From the 1970s to 1999 I was recognized as breaking the gender barrier in the computer science field as a woman, but in 2000 it became the transgender barrier I was breaking.\"[21]/nAfter going public with her story, she began work in transgender activism, intending to \"illuminate and normalize the issues of gender identity and the processes of gender transition\".[61] She has worked to protect and expand the rights of transgender people. She has provided direct and indirect assistance to numerous other transgender women going through transition and maintains a website providing medical resources and emotional advice. Parts have been translated into most of the world's major languages.[62] She maintained a listing of many successful post-transition transgender people, to, in her words \"provide role models for individuals who are facing gender transition\".[63] Her website also provided news related to transgender issues and information on sex reassignment surgery for transsexual women, facial feminization surgery, academic inquiries into the prevalence of transsexualism[64] and transgender and transsexual issues in general.[65][66]/nShe has also advocated for equal opportunities and employment protections for transgender people in high-technology industry,[67][68][69][70][71][72] and for elimination of the pathologization of transgender people by the psychiatric community.[73][74]/nConway has been a critic of the Blanchard, Bailey, and Lawrence theory of male-to-female transsexualism that all trans women are motivated either by feminine homosexuality or autogynephilia.[75] Along with American transgender rights activist Andrea James and University of Chicago economics professor Dierdre McCloskey, she was also a key person in the campaign against J. Michael Bailey's book about the theory, The Man Who Would Be Queen.[76][77] Conway and McCloskey wrote letters to Northwestern University, accusing Bailey of \"conducting intimate research observations on human subjects without telling them that they were objects of the study.\"[75] American bioethicist Alice Dreger in her book Galilieo's Middle Finger criticized Conway for filing a lawsuit against Bailey which had \"no legal basis\", referring to her allegation that Bailey lacked a license as a clinical psychologist when he wrote letters in support of a young trans woman seeking to transition. According to Dreger, as Bailey did not receive compensation for his services, he would not have needed a license in Illinois, and was \"completely forthright in his letters supporting the women, both about the fact that he had only had brief conversations with them (as opposed to having provided them with extensive counseling) and about his own qualifications and expertise... [and] even attached copies of his CV.\" As Dreger argues, \"presumably all this was why [Illinois] never bothered to pursue the charge.\"[78] In response, Conway argued that Dreger \"deflects attention away from Bailey's book and the massive trans community protest, and caricatures the entire controversy as nothing more than a vicious effort by three rather witch-like women to 'ruin the life' of a brilliant scientist.[79]/nConway was a cast member in the first all-transgender performance of The Vagina Monologues in Los Angeles in 2004,[80] and appeared in a LOGO-Channel documentary film about that event entitled Beautiful Daughters.[58][81]/nIn 2009, Conway was named one of the \"Stonewall 40 trans heroes\" on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots by the International Court System, one of the oldest and largest predominantly gay organizations in the world, and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.[82][83]/nIn 2013, with support from many thought-leaders in high-technology, Conway and her colleague Leandra Vicci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill successfully lobbied the board of directors of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for transgender inclusion in the IEEE's Code of Ethics.[84] That Code, known within the profession as much as a code of honor as one of ethics, became fully LGBT inclusive in January 2014, thus impacting the world's largest engineering professional society, with 425,000 members in 160 countries.[85][86][87] In 2014, Time Magazine named Lynn as one of \"21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture\".[5] In 2015 she was selected for inclusion in \"The Trans100\"[88] and was interviewed in 2020 for inclusion in the Trans Activism Oral History Project.[89]/nIn 1987, Conway met her husband Charles \"Charlie\" Rogers, a professional engineer who shares her interest in the outdoors, including whitewater canoeing and motocross racing.[19][90] They soon started living together, and bought a house with 24 acres (9.7\u00a0ha) of meadow, marsh, and woodland in rural Michigan in 1994.[19] On August 13, 2002, they were married.[15][58][91] In 2014, the University of Michigan's The Michigan Engineer alumni magazine documented the connections between Conway's engineering explorations and the adventures in her personal life.[92][93]/nConway has received a number of awards and distinctions:/nIn 2020, 52 years after IBM fired her for being transgender, IBM officially and publicly apologized to Conway;[150][151][152][153][154][155] IBM held a public event \"Tech Trailblazer and Transgender Pioneer Lynn Conway in conversation with Diane Gherson\" (IBM's senior VP of HR); IBM's Director of Research Dario Gil said \"Lynn was recently awarded the rare IBM Lifetime Achievement Award, given to individuals who have changed the world through technology inventions.

He was a scholar of the Zulu language. In his role as an Anglican theologian, Colenso is now remembered for views of the Bible that set off intense controversy./nColenso was born at St Austell, Cornwall, on 24 January 1814 the son of John William Colenso and Mary Ann Blackmore. His surname is Cornish and possibly originates from Colenso in the parish of St Hilary, near Penzance in West Cornwall. It is a place name from the  Cornish language Kelyn dhu, meaning \"dark hollies\".[dubious  \u2013 discuss] His father (John William Colenso) invested his capital into a mineral works in Pentewan, Cornwall, but the speculation proved to be ruinous when the investment was lost following a sea flood. His cousin William Colenso was a missionary in New Zealand./nFamily financial problems meant that Colenso had to take a job as an usher in a private school before he could attend university. These earnings and a loan of \u00a330 raised by his relatives paid for his first year at St John's College, Cambridge where he was a sizar.[1]  Showing talent in mathematics, in 1836 he was Second Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman at the University of Cambridge, and in 1837 he became fellow of St John's.[1] Two years later he went to Harrow School as mathematical tutor, but the step proved an unfortunate one. The school was at its lowest ebb, and Colenso not only had few pupils, but lost most of his property in a fire. He returned to Cambridge burdened by an enormous debt of \u00a35,000. However, within a relatively short period he paid off this debt by diligent tutoring and the sale to Longmans of his copyright interest in the highly successful and widely read manuals he had written on algebra (in 1841) and arithmetic (in 1843).[2]/nColenso's early theological thinking was heavily influenced by F. D. Maurice to whom he was introduced by his wife and by Samuel Taylor Coleridge./nIn 1846 he became rector of Forncett St Mary, Norfolk,[2] and in 1853 he was recruited by the Bishop of Cape Town, Robert Gray, to be the first Bishop of Natal.[3]/nColenso was a significant figure in the history of the published word in 19th-century South Africa. He first wrote a short but vivid account of his initial journeying in Natal, Ten Weeks in Natal: A Journal of a First Tour of Visitation Among the Colonists and Zulu Kaffirs of Natal.[4] Using the printing press he brought to his missionary station at Ekukhanyeni in Natal, and with William Ngidi he published the first Zulu Grammar and English/Zulu dictionary.[5][6] His 1859 journey across Zululand to visit Mpande (the then Zulu King) and meet with Cetshwayo (Mpande's son and the Zulu King at the time of the Zulu War) was recorded in his book First Steps of the Zulu Mission.[7] The same journey was also described in the first book written by native South Africans in Zulu \u2013 Three Native Accounts by Magema Fuze, Ndiyane and William Ngidi.[8]  He also translated the New Testament and other portions of Scripture into Zulu./nThrough the influence of his talented and well-educated wife, Sarah Frances Bunyon, Colenso became one of only a handful of theologians to embrace Frederick Denison Maurice, who was raised a Unitarian but joined the Church of England to help it \"purify and elevate the mind of the nation\".[10] Before his missionary career Colenso's volume of sermons dedicated to Maurice signalled the critical approach he would later apply to biblical interpretation and the baleful impact on native Africans of colonial expansion in southern Africa./nColenso first courted controversy with the publication in 1855 of his Remarks on the Proper Treatment of Polygamy;[11] one of the most cogent Christian-based arguments for tolerance of polygamy.[12]/nColenso's experiences in Natal informed his development as a religious thinker. In his commentary upon St Paul's Epistle to the Romans (1861)[13] he countered the doctrine of eternal punishment and the contention that Holy Communion was a condition to salvation. He also questioned the presence of any Christian Church in Rome, stating - \"Was there, in fact, any Christian Church at Rome at all, at this time, distinct and definitely marked off from the Jewish community? There would seem to have been none whatever...\"[14] Colenso, as a missionary, would not preach that the ancestors of newly Christianised Africans were condemned to eternal damnation.  The thought-provoking questions put to him by students at his missionary station encouraged him to re-examine the contents of the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua and question whether certain sections of these books should be understood as literally or historically accurate. His conclusions, positive and negative, were published in a series of treatises on the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua, from 1862 to 1879.[15][16] The publication of these volumes created a scandal in England and were the cause of a number of counter-blasts from those (clergy and laity alike) who refused to countenance the possibility of biblical fallibility. Colenso's work attracted the notice of biblical scholars on the continent such as Abraham Kuenen and played an important role in the development of Old Testament criticism in Britain.[17]/nColenso's biblical criticism and his high-minded views about the treatment of African natives created a frenzy of alarm and opposition from the High Church party in South Africa and in England.  As controversy raged in England, the South African bishops headed by Bishop Robert Gray pronounced Colenso's deposition in December 1863.[18] Colenso, who had refused to appear before this tribunal otherwise than by sending a proxy protest (delivered by his friend Wilhelm Bleek), appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. The Privy Council eventually decided that the Bishop of Cape Town had no coercive jurisdiction and no authority to interfere with the Bishop of Natal.[2] In view of this finding of ultra vires there was no opinion given upon the allegations of heresy made against Colenso.  The first Lambeth Conference was convened in 1867 to address concerns raised by the Privy Council's decision in favour of Colenso./nHis adversaries, though unable to remove him from his episcopal office, succeeded in restricting his ability to preach both in Natal and in England.  Bishop Gray not only excommunicated him but consecrated a rival bishop (William Macrorie), who took the title of \"Bishop of Maritzburg\" (the latter a common name for Pietermaritzburg). The contributions of the missionary societies were withdrawn, but an attempt to deprive him of his episcopal income and the control of St Peter's Cathedral in Pietermaritzburg was frustrated by another court ruling. Colenso, encouraged by a handsome testimonial raised in England to which many clergymen subscribed, returned to his diocese.[2] A rival cathedral was built but it has long been sold and moved. The new Cathedral of the Nativity, beside St Peter's, honours both Bishop Colenso and Bishop Macrorie in the names it has given to its halls./nColenso devoted the latter years of his life to further labours as a biblical commentator and as an advocate for native Africans in Natal and Zululand who had been unjustly treated by the colonial regime in Natal.  In 1874 he took up the cause of Langalibalele and the Hlubi and Ngwe tribes in representations to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Carnarvon.[19] Langalibalele had been falsely accused of rebellion in 1873 and, following a charade of a trial, was found guilty and imprisoned on Robben Island.  In taking the side of Langalibalele against the Colonial regime in Natal and Theophilus Shepstone, the Secretary for Native Affairs, Colenso found himself even further estranged from colonial society in Natal./nColenso's concern about the misleading information that was being provided to the Colonial Secretary in London by Shepstone and the Governor of Natal prompted him to devote much of the final part of his life to championing the cause of the Zulus against Boer oppression and official encroachments.[2]  He was a prominent critic of Sir Bartle Frere's efforts to depict the Zulu kingdom as a threat to Natal.  Following the conclusion of the Anglo-Zulu War he interceded on behalf of Cetshwayo with the British government and succeeded in getting him released from Robben Island and returned to Zululand./nHe was known as Sobantu (father of the people) to the native Africans in Natal and had a close relationship with members of the Zulu royal family; one of whom, Mkhungo (a son of Mpande), was taught at his school in Bishopstowe. After his death his wife and daughters continued his work supporting the Zulu cause and the organisation[20][21] that eventually became the African National Congress./nColenso was a polygenist; he believed in Co-Adamism, i.e. that races had been created separately. Colenso pointed to monuments and artefacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock, i.e. from Adam and Eve. Ancient Egyptian representations of races, for example, showed exactly how the races looked today. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that it was impossible that all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that the climate could change racial variation. With other biblical polygenists, Colenso believed that monogenists had interpreted the Bible incorrectly.[22]\nColenso said \"It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair.\" Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists, he claimed that monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races had been created as equals by God.[22]/nColenso died at Durban, South Africa, on 20 June 1883. His daughter Frances Colenso (1849\u20131887) published two books on the relations of the Zulus to the British (History of the Zulu War and Its Origin[23] in 1880 and The Ruin of Zululand[24] in 1885) that explained recent events in Zululand from a pro-Zulu perspective.  His oldest daughter, Harriette Colenso (1847 \u2013 1932), took up Colenso's mantle as advocate for the Zulus in opposition to their treatment by the authorities appointed by Natal, especially in the case of Dinizulu in 1888\u20131889 and in 1908\u20131909.[2]/nColenso married Sarah Frances Bunyon in 1846,[10] and they had five children, Harriette Emily, Frances Ellen, Robert John, Francis \"Frank\" Ernest, and Agnes.  (In the marriage register, her name is spelt Bunyan. There had long been variations in the spelling of a surname that goes back at least to the 12th century in England and in Normandy.)[citation needed] Sarah's sister Harriette McDougall was a missionary.", "28862740": "David Oliver Siegmund (born November 15, 1941)[1] is an American statistician who has worked extensively on sequential analysis.[2]/nSiegmund grew up in Webster Groves, Missouri.

It is known as New Chronology. Fomenko claims that he has discovered that many historical events do not correspond mathematically with the dates on which they are supposed to have occurred. He asserts from this that all of ancient history (including the history of Greece, Rome, and Egypt) is just a reflection of events that occurred in the Middle Ages and that all of Chinese and Arab history are fabrications of 17th- and 18th-century Jesuits./nHe also claims that Jesus lived in the 12th century A.D. and was crucified on Joshua's Hill; that the Trojan War and the Crusades were the same historical event; and that Genghis Khan and the Mongols were actually Russians, that the lands west of the Thirteen Colonies that now constitute the American West and Middle West were a far eastern part of \"Siberian-American Empire\" prior to its disintegration in 1775, and many other theories, that contradict the conventional historiography.

He studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Edinburgh, and then went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman in 1852.[2] As a fellow and lecturer of his college he remained at the University for a further two years, before leaving to take up the professorship of mathematics at Queen's College, Belfast. There he made the acquaintance of Thomas Andrews, whom he joined in researches on the density of ozone and the action of the electric discharge on oxygen and other gases, and by whom he was introduced to Sir William Rowan Hamilton and quaternions./nIn 1860, Tait succeeded his old master, James D. Forbes, as professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and occupied the Chair until shortly before his death. The first scientific paper under Tait's name only was published in 1860. His earliest work dealt mainly with mathematical subjects, and especially with quaternions, of which he was the leading exponent after their originator, William Rowan Hamilton. He was the author of two text-books on them\u2014one an Elementary Treatise on Quaternions (1867), written with the advice of Hamilton, though not published till after his death, and the other an Introduction to Quaternions (1873), in which he was aided by Philip Kelland (1808\u20131879), one of his teachers at the University of Edinburgh. Quaternions was also one of the themes of his address as president of the mathematical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1871./nHe also produced original work in mathematical and experimental physics. In 1864, he published a short paper on thermodynamics, and from that time his contributions to that and kindred departments of science became frequent and important. In 1871, he emphasised the significance and future importance of the principle of the dissipation of energy (second law of thermodynamics). In 1873 he took thermoelectricity for the subject of his discourse as Rede lecturer at Cambridge, and in the same year he presented the first sketch of his well-known thermoelectric diagram before the Royal Society of Edinburgh./nTwo years later, researches on \"Charcoal Vacua\" with James Dewar led him to see the true dynamical explanation of the Crookes radiometer in the large mean free path of the molecule of the highly rarefied air. From 1879 to 1888, he engaged in difficult experimental investigations. These began with an inquiry into what corrections were required for thermometers operating at great pressure. This was for the benefit of thermometers employed by the Challenger expedition for observing deep-sea temperatures, and were extended to include the compressibility of water, glass, and mercury.[3] This work led to the first formulation of the Tait equation, which is widely used to fit liquid density to pressure. Between 1886 and 1892 he published a series of papers on the foundations of the kinetic theory of gases, the fourth of which contained what was, according to Lord Kelvin, the first proof ever given of the Waterston-Maxwell theorem (equipartition theorem) of the average equal partition of energy in a mixture of two gases. About the same time he carried out investigations into impact and its duration./nMany other inquiries conducted by him might be mentioned, and some idea may be gained of his scientific activity from the fact that a selection only from his papers, published by the Cambridge University Press, fills three large volumes. This mass of work was done in the time he could spare from his professorial teaching in the university. For example, in 1880 he worked on the Four color theorem and proved that it was true if and only if no snarks were planar./nIn addition, he was the author of a number of books and articles. Of the former, the first, published in 1856, was on the dynamics of a particle; and afterwards there followed a number of concise treatises on thermodynamics, heat, light, properties of matter and dynamics, together with an admirably lucid volume of popular lectures on Recent Advances in Physical Science./nWith Lord Kelvin, he collaborated in writing the well-known Treatise on Natural Philosophy. \"Thomson and Tait,\" as it is familiarly called (\" T and T' \" was the authors' own formula), was planned soon after Lord Kelvin became acquainted with Tait, on the latter's appointment to his professorship in Edinburgh, and it was intended to be an all-comprehensive treatise on physical science, the foundations being laid in kinematics and dynamics, and the structure completed with the properties of matter, heat, light, electricity and magnetism. But the literary partnership ceased in about eighteen years, when only the first portion of the plan had been completed, because each of the members felt he could work to better advantage separately than jointly. The friendship, however, endured for the remaining twenty-three years of Tait's life./nTait collaborated with Balfour Stewart in the Unseen Universe, which was followed by Paradoxical Philosophy. It was in his 1875 review of The Unseen Universe, that William James first put forth his Will to Believe Doctrine. Tait's articles include those he wrote for the ninth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica on light, mechanics, quaternions, radiation, and thermodynamics, and the biographical notices of Hamilton and James Clerk Maxwell./nHe died in Edinburgh on 4 July 1901.

Shaposhnikova gave various applications of this theory to the study of solutions to second order linear and quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations and systems of such equations: this was a consequence of the fact that, in several cases, such solutions can be considered as multipliers in certain spaces of differentiable functions on a given domain (1986, 1987).[16] She described the structure of composition operators in spaces of multipliers between Sobolev spaces and gave applications of those results to semilinear elliptic systems of equations (1987).[17] She also showed that multipliers can be naturally suited to deal with the Lp coercivity of the Neumann problem (1989).[18] Various other applications of multipliers, for example to the problem of higher regularity in single and double layer potential theory for Lipschitz domains,[19] to the problem of regularity at the boundary in the Lp-theory of elliptic boundary value problems and to singular integral operators in Sobolev spaces are summarized in the book (Maz'ya & Shaposhnikova 2009).[20]/nHer prize winning book on Jacques Hadamard, coauthored with V.

He was a friend of Marino Ghetaldi and successor of Galileo Galilei in Pisa, then in Padua./nGiovanni Camillo Glorioso was born in the village of Mercato or Santa Maria a Vico of Giffoni Valle Piana. He had a correspondence with Galileo Galilei in 1604 and he replaced him at the University of Padua, with an income of 350 florins per year, in 1613. He led observations on the 1618 comet, on Mars, and on some aspects of Saturn. He came closer to Antonio Santini (1577-1662) and he had contrasts with Scipione Chiaramonti and his successor at the university of Pisa, Barth\u00e9lemy Souvey, student of Fortunio Liceti. Glorioso was particularly harsh in his attack on Scipione Chiaramonti's efforts to defend traditional Aristotelian cosmology. He criticised Chiaramonti's De tribus novis stellis and in 1636 Charamonti published a refutation, Examen censurae Gloriosi, to which Glorioso replied the following year Castigatio examinis. To this Chiaramonti responded in turn with Castigatio Ioannis Camilli Gloriosi aduersus Scipionem Claramontium Caesenatem (1638). Glorioso's final contribution to this dispute was his Responsio (1641). As he died soon after, this allowed Chiaramonti the last word, which he took with a volume of more than 500 pages, summarising his Aristotelian positions on a wide range of topics, his Opus Scipionis Claramontis Caesenatis de Universo (1644).[2]/nGlorioso considered, following the theme of the parallax, that comets were in fact celestial bodies, against Galileo's opinion. In a 1610 letter to his friend Giovanni Terrenzio, he asserted that Galileo erroneously attributed the invention of the telescope and of the sector to himself, instead to Michel Coignet, accusations that appeared to be unfounded: Rosen (1954) shows that Galileo did not affirm to be the inventor of the telescope, which he called the \"Dutch tube\", but he considered himself as the inventor of its tools, and that was probably cause of confusion. The situation is the same for what concerns the sector, which, in its different forms, had several inventors.[3] It was excluded, for chronological reasons, that Coignet's tool could have inspired Galileo.[4]/nOne of his works took the title from the last work of Alexander Anderson, published in 1619 in Paris: Alexandri Andersoni Exercitationum Mathematicarum Decas Prima.[5]\nThis work shows that Glorioso wrote his algebrical calculations in a language inherited from the algebra of Vi\u00e8te.[6] It's one of the first work to use the notation \n\n\n\nA\nq\nq\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle Aqqc}\n\n for the equivalent of the current \n\n\n\n\nA\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A^{8}}\n\n./nHe died in Naples in 1643./nGlorioso had a brother, Alessandro, and a sister, Porzia.

He was the grandson of Rabbi Moshe Shmuel Glasner./nWald was born on 31 October 1902 in Kolozsv\u00e1r, Transylvania, in the Kingdom of Hungary. A religious Jew, he did not attend school on Saturdays, as was then required by the Hungarian school system, and so he was homeschooled by his parents until college.[1] His parents were quite knowledgeable and competent as teachers.[3]/nIn 1928, he graduated in mathematics from the King Ferdinand I University.[4] In 1927, he had entered graduate school at the University of Vienna, from which he graduated in 1931 with a Ph.D. in mathematics. His advisor there was Karl Menger.[1]/nDespite Wald's brilliance, he could not obtain a university position because of Austrian discrimination against Jews. However, Oskar Morgenstern created a position for Wald in economics. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, the discrimination against Jews intensified. In particular, Wald and his family were persecuted as Jews. Wald immigrated to the United States at the invitation of the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics, to work on econometrics research.[1]/nDuring World War II, Wald was a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG) at Columbia University, where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems.[5] They included methods of sequential analysis and sampling inspection.[5] One of the problems that the SRG worked on was to examine the distribution of damage to aircraft returning after flying missions to provide advice on how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. Wald derived a useful means of estimating the damage distribution for all aircraft that flew from the data on the damage distribution of all aircraft that returned.[2][6] His work is considered seminal in the discipline of operational research, which was then fledgling./nWald and his wife died in 1950 when the Air India plane (VT-CFK, a DC-3 aircraft[7]) in which they were travelling crashed near the Rangaswamy Pillar in the northern part of the Nilgiri Mountains, in southern India, on an extensive lecture tour at the invitation of the Indian government.[1] He had visited the Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta and was to attend the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore in January.

This paper was published in July 1984 and was regarded as equally important by international experts.[11]/nIn spite of his heavy teaching duties, he carried on with his private mathematical research, often working until after midnight. He also made occasional trips to Beijing to find library resources.[7][2][5] He told his colleagues that while he liked physics more, certain material conditions were required for physics research, but he only needed paper to do mathematics.[4]/nUnfortunately, laborious work and harsh living conditions made his health deteriorate over time. His family of four lived in a small house of ten-odd square meters. The only table at home was used by his daughters, so he had to do his calculations on a broken kang bed-stove. On his trips to Beijing, he bought hard seat tickets since he could not afford sleeper tickets. He ate his dried food in a library in the daytime and slept on a bench in a train station at night.[2][5] He sometimes wrote in his diary about how his mental fatigue affected his research and his teaching, and that he needed to get healthier for his research. After he had received dozens of copies of the journal issue containing his first three papers, his family and friends reminded him to get some rest, but he said that he could not since he had not much time.[7] To have a better research environment, he tried to get transferred to university with his friends' help since 1978, but he could not find any suitable position after several years of effort.[2]/nHis Western peers discovered a leader in the field with exceptional achievements, while he still remained largely unknown to the Chinese mathematical community. In the first ever combinatorial mathematics conference in China held in Dalian in July 1983, when two Canadian mathematicians Eric Mendelsohn and John Adrian Bondy, who were the referees of Lu's papers, arrived and asked for Lu Jiaxi, one of the organizers thought they were looking for the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the same sounding name. It was the first time the Chinese combinatorialists got to know him.[5] Upon hearing Lu present his work in a session, Wu Lisheng of Soochow University recommended that he should give a talk on it at the closing ceremony. After his talk, he received a unanimous accolade. In August, he took part in a combinatorics workshop in Hefei as a helper and gave a talk there.[2][1]/nAlthough he had gained recognition from scholars in his field, he was still living in poverty. School leaders did not appreciate his engagement in research, seeing it as a deviation from his work duties. They even assigned him more duties such as timekeeping on sports day to keep him occupied. In a school general meeting, the principal reprimanded him, saying, \"We are a middle school. Someone wants to be a scientist, he may as well be transferred to the Academy of Sciences.\"[4] When he was finally invited to mathematical conferences in China, his middle school refused to support his travel fee, saying that according to the rules allowances were provided only for teaching related activities. He had to borrow from his friends to attend the conferences.[7][2]/nThe conferences brought him into the mathematical community. He was invited as a speaker to the fourth national conference of the Chinese Mathematical Society in late October. Several universities in China wanted to offer him positions, and he decided to go to South China Normal University. The Canadian mathematicians were planning to invite him for a visit at University of Toronto.[2][5]/nAfter attending the national conference of the Chinese Mathematical Society in Wuhan, which ended on October 27, he hurried back to Baotou by train in order not to miss his classes. After stopping briefly at Beijing for the libraries, he arrived home at about 6 in the evening of Sunday, October 30, 1983.[6] He told his wife joyfully about the praises he received in the last few months and his future research plan.[5] At about 1 am that night, he suffered from a sudden heart attack in his sleep and died.[6] Although his wife was a doctor, she did not have any equipment to save him, not even a telephone at home to call for help.[2] He was survived by his wife Zhang Shuqin (Chinese: \u5f20\u6dd1\u7434) and two daughters.[1]/nOnly two days before his death, his middle school received a letter from the President of University of Toronto David Strangway written on September 30. In the letter, he asked the school principal for permission to transfer Lu to a university for the development of Chinese mathematics. On November 23, David Strangway sent a letter of condolences to Lu's middle school and family, in which he said that people would greatly miss \"Prof. Lu Jiaxi\" for his knowledge and contributions.[7]/nIn January 1984, an editor of Mathematical Reviews sent Lu an invitation letter to be a reviewer, not knowing of his death.[1]/nAfter his death, the Inner Mongolia government helped his family repay their debts and honored him for his achievements. On the first anniversary of his death, a memorial gathering was held by the government officials at Baotou First Workers' Cultural Palace, and the Chairman of the Autonomous Region issued a document titled \"Learn from Comrade Lu Jiaxi\" (Chinese: \u5411\u9646\u5bb6\u7fb2\u540c\u5fd7\u5b66\u4e60).[11] He was given Special Class Award in the first Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Science and Technology Progress Award in 1985.[1]/nAn investigation on his research was carried out by a number of Chinese mathematicians. Although his 1961 and 1963 papers were lost, they found the manuscript of his 1965 paper and confirmed that it was the first paper to solve the generalized Kirkman's schoolgirl problem completely.[2][5] In fact, according to Zhu Lie, it contained an asymptotically stronger result than that in the paper by Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson.[8]/nEric Mendelsohn praised Lu's large set theorem as one of the most significant achievements in the field in the past 20 years.[5] He wrote an article on Lu's work, in which he regretted that \"Lu Jia-xi should have had a distinguished career as a mathematician. ... He, however, spent too many years as a high school teacher with virtually no time to do research and virtually no contact with the research community\".[8]/nThe seventh paper in the series on disjoint Steiner triple systems treating the cases for the last six values in the theorem, which he had announced to have solved in the Dalian combinatorial mathematics conference, was left unfinished as a 24-page manuscript, with an outline and a few results.[9][8] (Actually, once the cases for three of the values were proved, the cases for the other three values would follow immediately from previous results.) A few Chinese mathematicians tried to use the procedure sketched in the manuscript or other methods to solve the cases without success.[11] The very last part of the theorem the proof of which Lu had not finished writing down before his death was finally completed by Luc Teirlinck in 1989. Although Teirlinck's proof did not follow the outline in the manuscript, it nevertheless made use of the combinatorial structures that Lu had constructed.[12]/nLu Jiaxi was awarded posthumously in 1987 the First Class Award of the State Natural Science Award, then the highest honor in science in China, for his work on large sets of disjoint Steiner triple systems.[1]/nSee the reference for a more complete list.[1][13]", "6023571": "Gyula V\u00e1lyi (25 January 1855,[1] Neumarkt am Mieresch, Austrian Empire (now T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, Romania) \u2013 13 October 1913, Kolozsv\u00e1r, Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania)) was a Hungarian mathematician and theoretical physicist, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, known for his work on mathematical analysis, geometry, and number theory./nV\u00e1lyi was born in Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, the town of the famous mathematicians Farkas Bolyai and J\u00e1nos Bolyai. \nHe attended the Reformed College in Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely .

The first volume includes set theory, Lebesgue and Stieltjies integrals, calculus and differential equations.  Feny\u0151, along with his coauthors, proved Titchmarsh's theorem, which is important to integral theory.

The first volume \"is devoted to the theory of linear operators\", and the second volume discusses the theory of integral equations \"of the second kind\".  In the third volume, Feny\u0151 explores the applications of integral transforms to mathematical physic and types of integral equations.  Based on A E Heins' review of the three final volumes, those volumes focus on classical theory of linear integral equations that helped the \"development of integral equations\"./nFeny\u0151 also made a huge number of contributions to functional equations.  One of his works, \"The solution of a functional equation by Laplace transformation\", focuses on proving two theorems that the functional equation has an analytic solution.  He also discovered the \"most general solution \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n\" of the following functional equation:/nIn 1980's, he proved the theorem, using D.H.

For the rest of his contributions, he worked on inverse of the linear operators in Hilbert spaces./nA few of Feny\u0151 works also focus on differential equations.

He was the faculty senator for twelve years, and also taught various mathematics courses including, but not limited to calculus, combinatorics, discrete mathematics, graph theory, and number theory. Hobbs and his colleague taught a course in the intersection of graph theory and number theory, he explains:/nWe taught enough of the elements of our specialties that students could read a research paper including elements of both subjects. Then students were asked to select a paper from a list we provided, read it, and report on it to the class. An important aspect of the course was gaining a feeling for the discovery process involved in research. We asked about each idea presented, \"Are there questions that are not addressed here? Can these ideas be extended in ways the authors did not discuss?\" There was a test on each of number theory and graph theory just after the lectures on that topic, and the grade was based on the results of those tests and on the presentations made. One consequence of this course was a published research paper.[1]/nHobbs' research before entering graduate school was on thickness of graphs. Later, in graduate school and for ten years following, he concentrated on Hamiltonian cycles, particularly in squares and higher powers of graphs. He then spent a couple of years working on the Gyarfas and Lehel conjecture that any family of trees T1; T2;\u00a0:\u00a0:\u00a0: Tn, with 1; 2;\u00a0:\u00a0:\u00a0:\u00a0; n vertices respectively, can be packed in an edge-disjoint manner into the complete graph on n vertices.

They studied mathematics, physics, and propaedeutics at Berlin and G\u00f6ttingen. L\u00f6benstein's field of expertise was algebraic geometry. Together with Kahn she made a contribution to Hilbert's sixteenth problem.[3] Hilbert's sixteenth problem concerned the topology of algebraic curves in the complex projective plane; as a difficult special case in his formulation of the problem Hilbert proposed that there are no algebraic curves of degree 6 consisting of 11 separate ovals. L\u00f6benstein and Kahn developed methods to address this problem./nL\u00f6benstein obtained a doctorate in 1910 under David Hilbert in G\u00f6ttingen, with a dissertation titled \u00dcber den Satz, da\u00df eine ebene, algebraische Kurve 6.

He wrote textbooks widely used by generations of students of physics and mathematics. He is also known for founding the institute now bearing his name./nCourant was born in Lublinitz, in the Prussian Province of Silesia. His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Courant n\u00e9e Freund of Oels. Edith Stein was Richard's cousin on the maternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to Glatz, then to Breslau and in 1905 to Berlin. He stayed in Breslau and entered the university there, then continued his studies at the University of Z\u00fcrich and the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He became David Hilbert's assistant in G\u00f6ttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in World War I, but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the University of M\u00fcnster in 1921 to take over Erich Hecke's position at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[2] There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933./nCourant left Germany in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being Jewish, as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the social-democratic left was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.[3]/nIn 1936, after one year at Cambridge, Courant accepted a professorship at New York University in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in applied mathematics. The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.[4]/nCourant and David Hilbert authored the influential textbook Methoden der mathematischen Physik, which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With Herbert Robbins he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled What is Mathematics?. With Fritz John he also coauthored the two-volume work Introduction to Calculus and Analysis, first published in 1965./nCourant's name is also attached to the finite element method,[5] with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943.[6]\nThis method is now one of the ways to solve partial differential equations numerically. Courant is a namesake of the Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy condition and the Courant minimax principle./nCourant was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society (1953) and the United States National Academy of Sciences (1955).[7][8]/nCourant died of a stroke in New Rochelle, New York on January 27, 1972.[9]/nCommenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant explained why the existence of a physical solution does not obviate mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:/nEmpirical evidence can never establish mathematical existence\u2013nor can the mathematician's demand for existence be dismissed by the physicist as useless rigor. Only a mathematical existence proof can ensure that the mathematical description of a physical phenomenon is meaningful.[10]/nIn 1912, Courant married Nelly Neumann, who had earned her doctorate at Breslau in synthetic geometry in 1909.  They lived together in G\u00f6ttingen until they were divorced in 1916.  She was later murdered by the Nazis in 1942 for being Jewish.[11]/nIn 1919, Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge (1891\u20131991), a daughter of the G\u00f6ttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, Carl Runge (of Runge\u2013Kutta fame)./nRichard and Nerina had four children: Ernest, a particle physicist and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (1922\u20132014), a PhD biologist and wife of the mathematician J\u00fcrgen Moser (1928\u20131999); Hans (1924-2019 [12][13]), a physicist who participated in the Manhattan Project; and Leonore (known as \"Lori,\" 1928\u20132015), a professional violist and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928\u20131998) and subsequently wife of mathematician Peter Lax until her death.[14]", "31189476": "Stefan Langerman false Swarzberg is a Belgian computer scientist and mathematician whose research topics include computational geometry, data structures, and recreational mathematics.

He was professor in the Mathematics Department at Princeton University. He was known for his work on mathematical physics and mathematical logic.  In mathematical logic, he was noted especially for his internal set theory, and views on ultrafinitism and the consistency of arithmetic. In philosophy of mathematics he advocated the view of formalism rather than platonism or intuitionism. He also wrote on the relationship between religion and mathematics.[1][2][3]/nEdward Nelson was born in Decatur, Georgia, in 1932. He spent his early childhood in Rome where his father worked for the Italian YMCA. At the advent of World War II, Nelson moved with his mother to New York City, where he attended high school at the Bronx High School of Science. His father, who spoke fluent Russian, stayed in St. Petersburg in connection with issues related to prisoners of war. After the war, his family returned to Italy and he attended the Liceo Scientifico Giovanni Verga in Rome.[4]/nHe received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Chicago, where he worked with Irving Segal. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 to 1959.  He held a position at Princeton University starting in 1959, attaining the rank of professor there in 1964 and retiring in 2013./nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[5] He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on September 10, 2014.[6]/nNelson made contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional group representations, the mathematical treatment of quantum field theory, the use of stochastic processes in quantum mechanics, and the reformulation of probability theory in terms of non-standard analysis. For many years he worked on mathematical physics and probability theory, and he retained a residual interest in these fields, particularly in connection with possible extensions of stochastic mechanics to field theory./nIn 1950, Nelson formulated a popular variant of the four color problem: What is the chromatic number, denoted \n\n\n\n\u03c7\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\chi }\n\n, of the plane? In more detail, what is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring the points of the Euclidean plane such that no two points of the same color are unit distance apart?[7] We know by simple arguments that 4\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03c7\u00a0\u2264\u00a07. The problem was introduced to a wide mathematical audience by Martin Gardner in his October 1960 Mathematical Games column. The chromatic number problem, also now known as the Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem, was a favorite of Paul Erd\u0151s, who mentioned it frequently in his problems lectures. In 2018, Aubrey de Grey showed that \u03c7\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.[8]/nIn the later part of his career, he worked on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. One of his goals was to extend IST (Internal Set Theory\u2014a version of a portion of Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis) in a natural manner that includes external functions and sets, in a way that provides an external function with specified properties unless there is a finitary obstacle to its existence. Other work centered on fragments of arithmetic, studying the divide between those theories interpretable in Raphael Robinson's arithmetic and those that are not; computational complexity, including the problem of whether P is equal to NP or not; and automated proof checking./nIn September 2011, Nelson announced that he had proved that Peano arithmetic was logically inconsistent.[9] An error was found in the proof by Terence Tao, and Nelson retracted the claim.[10]", "2157035": "Chauncey Wright (September 10, 1830 \u2013 September 12, 1875) was an American philosopher and mathematician, who was an influential early defender of Darwinism and an important influence on American pragmatists such as Charles Sanders Peirce and William James./nWright was born in Northampton, Massachusetts, the son of a merchant and a pillar of the local Unitarian church.[1] With financial help from a benefactor, Wright attended Harvard, where his reading of Ralph Waldo Emerson led him to abandon his youthful Unitarianism. In 1852 he graduated from Harvard and became a computer to the Nautical Almanac. In college, he was mainly interested in science and mathematics. In the 1850s, however, he began reading philosophers such as Francis Bacon, John Stuart Mill, and William Hamilton, and he became a frequent contributor to the North American Review and the Nation, becoming a well-known defender of Darwinism and a critic of the English philosopher and social theorist Herbert Spencer./nIn 1870-71 he lectured on psychology at Harvard. Although he was best known to the reading public as a defender of Darwinism, he was an eclectic free-lancer in thought. Among his essays may be mentioned \"The Evolution of Self-Consciousness\" (1873) and two articles on evolution published in the early 1870s. Of these, the former endeavors to explain the most elaborate psychical activities of men as developments of elementary forms of conscious processes in the animal kingdom as a whole; the latter is a defense of the theory of natural selection against the attacks of St George Mivart and Alfred Russel Wallace. From 1863 to 1870 he was secretary and recorder to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in the last year of his life he lectured on mathematical physics at Harvard.[2] He never married and was subject to periodic bouts of depression and alcoholism.[3] He died of a stroke just after his forty-fifth birthday.[4] Following his death, his close friend Charles Eliot Norton spoke of his great devotion to truth and his eagerness to hear criticisms of his own views. \"To argue with him,\" Norton wrote, \"was a moral no less than an intellectual discipline.\"[5]/nIn 1872, Wright helped found The Metaphysical Club with other Harvard intellectuals such as Charles Sanders Peirce, William James and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. His views on Darwinism played a significant role in shaping the ideas of the other members of the club.[6]/nReligiously, Wright was an agnostic, arguing that we should suspend judgment on the existence of God because there is no firm evidence either way.[7] William James's famous will-to-believe argument was partly aimed at Wright's brand of agnosticism.[8]  In ethics, he embraced utilitarianism, agreeing with John Stuart Mill that pleasures differ in quality as well as quantity. He was a staunch critic of Herbert Spencer's attempt to extend Darwinism into a law of cosmic and social progress. Like Mill and Auguste Comte, Wright embraced a positivistic approach to science that rejects the possibility (or even meaningfulness) of metaphysics.[9] His claim that scientific principles are \"working hypotheses\" influenced John Dewey and other later pragmatists. Wright's claim that science is metaphysically neutral (being uncommitted to naturalism, idealism, or any other general philosophical worldview or ontology) is seen by some as Wright's central contribution to philosophy.[10]/nHis essays were collected and published, with a biographical sketch, by Charles Eliot Norton in 1877, and his Letters were edited and privately printed at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1878 by James Bradley Thayer.[2]/nSources/nAttributio", "72706540": "Debra Lynn Boutin is an American mathematician, the Samuel F.

Alfred did so even though he was an avowed atheist.[10][11]/nAfter becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the university, and served as \u0141ukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school;[12] before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the Polish\u2013Soviet War. They had two children; a son Jan Tarski, who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina, who married the mathematician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht.[13]/nTarski applied for a chair of philosophy at Lw\u00f3w University, but on Bertrand Russell's recommendation it was awarded to Leon Chwistek.[14] In 1930, Tarski visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Karl Menger's colloquium, and met Kurt G\u00f6del. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the Unity of Science movement, an outgrowth of the Vienna Circle. Tarski's academic career in Poland was strongly and repeatedly impacted by his heritage. For example, in 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at Pozna\u0144 University but the chair was abolished to avoid assigning it to Tarski (who was undisputedly the strongest applicant) because he was a Jew.[15] Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at Harvard University. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II. Tarski left reluctantly, because Le\u015bniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the Nazi threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities./nOnce in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), City College of New York (1940), and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (1942), where he again met G\u00f6del. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.[16] Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.[17] At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an astounding and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:/nHis seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians, noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.[18]/nTarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative \u2014 sometimes working all night with a colleague \u2014 and was very fastidious about priority.[19]/nA charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women \u2014 in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field.[20]/nTarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of Andrzej Mostowski, Bjarni J\u00f3nsson, Julia Robinson, Robert Vaught, Solomon Feferman, Richard Montague, James Donald Monk, Haim Gaifman, Donald Pigozzi, and Roger Maddux, as well as Chen Chung Chang and Jerome Keisler, authors of Model Theory (1973),[21] a classic text in the field.[22][23] He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, Dana Scott, and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time.[23] However, he had extra-marital affairs with at least two of these students. After he showed another of his female student's[who?] work to a male colleague[who?], the colleague published it himself, leading her to leave the graduate study and later move to a different university and a different advisor.[24]/nTarski lectured at University College, London (1950, 1966), the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris (1955), the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in Berkeley (1958\u201360), the University of California at Los Angeles (1967), and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (1974\u201375). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958,[25] received honorary degrees from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from Marseilles' Paul C\u00e9zanne University in 1977 and from the University of Calgary, as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the Association for Symbolic Logic, 1944\u201346, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956\u201357. He was also an honorary editor of Algebra Universalis.[26]/nTarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see \"Interludes I\u2013VI\" in Feferman and Feferman.[27]/nTarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on set theory, a subject to which he returned throughout his life.[28] In 1924, he and Stefan Banach proved that, if one accepts the Axiom of Choice, a ball can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox.[29]/nIn A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry, Tarski showed, by the method of quantifier elimination, that the first-order theory of the real numbers under addition and multiplication is decidable. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because Alonzo Church proved in 1936 that Peano arithmetic (the theory of natural numbers) is not decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem. In his 1953 Undecidable theories, Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras, are all undecidable. The theory of Abelian groups is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not./nIn the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school geometry.[where?] Using some ideas of Mario Pieri, in 1926 Tarski devised an original axiomatization for plane Euclidean geometry, one considerably more concise than Hilbert's.[30] Tarski's axioms form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are points, and having only two primitive relations. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers./nIn 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean solid geometry could be recast as a second-order theory whose individuals are spheres (a primitive notion), a single primitive binary relation \"is contained in\", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment partially orders the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of mereology far easier to exposit than Lesniewski's variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.[31]/nCardinal Algebras studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. Ordinal Algebras sets out an algebra for the additive theory of order types. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes./nIn 1941, Tarski published an important paper on binary relations, which began the work on relation algebra and its metamathematics that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most axiomatic set theory and Peano arithmetic. For an introduction to relation algebra, see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised cylindric algebras, which are to first-order logic what the two-element Boolean algebra is to classical sentential logic. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).[32]/nTarski's student, Robert Lawson Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time \u2014 along with Aristotle, Gottlob Frege, and Kurt G\u00f6del.[7][33][34]  However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly for his pioneering work in the logic of relations./nTarski produced axioms for logical consequence and worked on deductive systems, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.\nAround 1930, Tarski developed an abstract theory of logical deductions that models some properties of logical calculi. Mathematically, what he described is just a finitary closure operator on a set (the set of sentences).  In abstract algebraic logic, finitary closure operators are still studied under the name consequence operator, which was coined by Tarski. The set S represents a set of sentences, a subset T of S a theory, and cl(T) is the set of all sentences that follow from the theory. This abstract approach was applied to fuzzy logic (see Gerla 2000)./nIn [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.[35]/nTarski's 1936 article \"On the concept of logical consequence\" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion.[36] In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies.[28] His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences.[37]/nTarski's 1969 \"Truth and proof\" considered both G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems and Tarski's undefinability theorem, and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics./nIn 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled \"Poj\u0119cie prawdy w j\u0119zykach nauk dedukcyjnych\",[38] \"Setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages.\" The 1935 German translation was titled \"Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen\", \"The concept of truth in formalized languages\", sometimes shortened to \"Wahrheitsbegriff\". An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century analytic philosophy, a contribution to symbolic logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language. For a brief discussion of its content, see Convention T (and also T-schema)./nSome recent[when?] philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a correspondence theory of truth. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a true definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:/n(where p is the proposition expressed by \"p\")/nThe debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as/n\"Snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white/nas expressing merely a deflationary theory of truth or as embodying truth as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations[why?] of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.[citation needed]/nIn 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture, \u201cOn the Concept of Following Logically\",[39]\nhe had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris.  A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).[39]/nThis publication[which?] set out the modern model-theoretic definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different cardinalities).[citation needed] This question is a matter of some debate in the current[when?] philosophical literature. John Etchemendy stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.[40]/nTarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. \"What are Logical Notions?\" can thus be viewed as continuing \"On the Concept of Logical Consequence\".[citation needed]/nAnother theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent[when?] philosophical literature is that outlined in his \"What are Logical Notions?\" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in Buffalo; it was edited without his direct involvement by John Corcoran. It became the most cited paper in the journal History and Philosophy of Logic.[41]/nIn the talk, Tarski proposed demarcation of logical operations (which he calls \"notions\") from non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the Erlangen program of the 19th-century German mathematician Felix Klein. Mautner (in 1946), and possibly[clarification needed] an article by the Portuguese mathematician Jos\u00e9 Sebasti\u00e3o e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.[citation needed]/nThat program[which?] classified the various types of geometry (Euclidean geometry, affine geometry, topology, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, \"rotate 30 degrees\" and  \"magnify by a factor of 2\" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.[citation needed]/nAs the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.[citation needed]/nTarski's proposal[which?] was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations (automorphisms) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the universe of discourse of a model for the semantic theory of logic. If one identifies the truth value True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:/nIn some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of  Bertrand Russell's and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).[42]/nSolomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal[which?] in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary homomorphisms. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with a sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.[citation needed]/nVann McGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. \"Arbitrarily\" includes a countable infinity.[43]", "32401936": "Hugh Hamilton FRS (26 March 1729 \u2013 1 December 1805) was a mathematician, natural philosopher (scientist) and professor at Trinity College Dublin, and later a Church of Ireland bishop, Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh and then Bishop of Ossory./nHe was born at Knock, near Balrothery in County Dublin (now Fingal), on 26 March 1729, the eldest son of Alexander (died 1768)[1][2] and Isabella Hamilton.[3] His father was a solicitor and politician who represented the Killyleagh constituency in the Irish House of Commons from 1739 to 1759.[4] Alexander's great-grandfather Hugh Hamilton migrated from Scotland to County Down in the early 17th century. The Scottish architect James Hamilton of Finnart was an ancestor.[3] Isabella Hamilton was born Isabella Maxwell, the daughter of Robert Maxwell of Finnebrogue, Downpatrick.[4] Hugh's siblings included George Hamilton,  Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) and Charles, father of the wealthy  Canadian lumber merchant and politician  George Hamilton./nHamilton entered Trinity College Dublin on 17 November 1742 at the age of 13 with Thomas McDonnell as his tutor. He graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1747 and Trinity Master of Arts (MA Dubl) in 1750.[3] He took the competitive examination for a vacant fellowship of the college in 1750, but the position was secured instead by his friend Richard Murray, who was a few years older. Two fellowships became vacant the following year and Hamilton was elected to one of them at the age of 22.[5] He was appointed Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin in 1759[6] and that same year graduated Bachelor of Divinity (BD).[3] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 19 February 1761[7] and graduated Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1762.[3]/nTrinity College presented him to the rectory of Kilmacrenan in the diocese of Raphoe, County Donegal, in 1764. This was a small living in the gift of the college, for which he resigned his fellowship. He retained the Erasmus Smith's chair, however,[5] being succeeded in that by Thomas Wilson in 1769.[8] He resigned from Kilmacrenan in 1767 and become vicar of St. Anne's in Dublin./nHe then became Dean of Armagh, the chief resident cleric of St Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, from April 1768 to 1796.[3] Finding the existing dean's house inconvenient and poorly situated, he had a new one built in a better location[5] just off Portadown Road, now known as Dean's Hill. The house, of three stories and a semi-basement,[9] was built in 1772\u201374.[10] The house was later sold by the church and the present owners provide bed and breakfast accommodation in it.[9] While dean he also acted as treasurer for the infirmary or county hospital, he established Sunday schools in the districts of the parish, and he founded a charitable loan for poor tradesmen. He was also instrumental in planning a piped water supply for the town, which was later put into effect.[5] Hamilton was one of the 38 original members of the Royal Irish Academy when it was founded in 1785.[11] Gilbert Stuart painted his portrait in about 1790.[12]/nHe was promoted to Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh on 20 January 1796, without seeking it.[13] On 24 January 1799 he was translated to Ossory,[14] where he was bishop until 1805.[15] He died of a fever  at Kilkenny on 1 December 1805.[16] He was buried in the graveyard of St Canice's Cathedral at Kilkenny, and there is a memorial to him inside the cathedral./nHamilton wrote a mathematical treatise on conic sections called De Sectionibus Conicis: Tractatus Geometricus, published in 1758.[3] In this book he \"was the first to deduce the properties of the conic section from the properties of the cone, by demonstrations which were general, unencumbered by lemmas, and proceeding in a more natural and perspicuous order\", according to writer James Wills in 1847.[13] The work was acclaimed for its lucidity and Leonhard Euler described it as a perfect book.[17] It was \"soon adopted in all the British universities\"[13] and was translated from Latin into English as A Geometrical Treatise of the Conic Sections in 1773./nHe also wrote Philosophical Essays on Vapours (1767), Four Introductory Lectures on Natural Philosophy (1774), and An Essay on the Existence and Attributes of the Supreme Being (1784).

Clean-shaven. Hair red-/nbrown, 'en brosse.' Eyes very dark brown with whites showing all round iris. Small, rather \nfeminine mouth. False teeth of expensive quality. Ears small, with large lobes, indicating \nsome Jewish blood. Hands small, well-tended, hirsute. Feet small. Racially, subject is probably a mixture of Mediterranean with Prussian or Polish strains. Dresses well and meticulously, generally in dark double-breasted suits. Smokes incessantly Caporals, using a denicotinizing holder. At frequent intervals inhales from benzedrine inhaler. Voice soft and even. Bilingual in French and English. Good German. Traces of Marseillais accent. Smiles infrequently. Does not laugh./nHabits: Mostly expensive, but discreet. Large sexual appetites. Flagellant. Expert driver of fast cars. Adept with small arms and other forms of personal combat, including knives. Carries three Eversharp razor blades, in hatband, heel of left shoe, and cigarette case. Knowledge of accountancy and mathematics. Fine gambler./nIn the novel, he serves as the paymaster for the Syndicat des Ouvriers d'Alsace, an important Communist trade union in Alsace. MI6 also believes the union would serve as a fifth column in the event of a Third World War between NATO and the Eastern Bloc, capable to mobilizing its 50,000 members to seize control of a substantial portion of the French\u2013West German borderlands. He makes a major investment in the Cordon Jaune string of brothels with 50 million francs in subsidies belonging to SMERSH. The investment fails after the Loi Marthe Richard is signed into law banning prostitution in France. Le Chiffre then goes to the casino Royale-les-Eaux with the union's remaining 25 million francs in funds in an attempt to replace his lost money before the Soviet government notices. Le Chiffre is suggested to be a genuinely committed Communist, with his MI6 dossier inferring that he probably only invested in the brothels because he believed it would increase his union's funds./nMI6 sends Bond, an expert baccarat player, to the casino to bankrupt Le Chiffre and force him to take refuge with the British government and inform on SMERSH. Bond bests Le Chiffre in a game of Chemin de Fer, taking all of his money. Le Chiffre kidnaps Bond's love interest, Vesper Lynd, to lure Bond into a trap and get back his money. The trap works, and Le Chiffre tortures Bond by beating his genitals with a carpet-beater to get him to give up the money. He is interrupted by a SMERSH agent, however, who shoots him between the eyes with a silenced TT pistol as punishment for losing the money./nThe French press reports that Le Chiffre committed suicide, throwing the French Communist Party into disarray after Maurice Thorez's stroke. Le Chiffre's union is also bankrupted. These events are seen by the Soviet Union as an embarrassment, which in addition to the death and defeat of Mr. Big in Live and Let Die, leads to the events of From Russia, with Love./nLe Chiffre is a secondary villain in the 1967 satire and appears in one of the few segments of the film actually adapted from Fleming's book. As in the novel, Le Chiffre is charged with recovering a large sum of money for SMERSH after he loses it at the baccarat table. He first attempts to raise the funds by holding an auction of embarrassing photographs of military and political leaders from China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but this is foiled by Sir James Bond's daughter, Mata Bond. With no other option, he returns to the baccarat table to try to win back the money. Later, he encounters baccarat Master Evelyn Tremble, who has been recruited by Bond to stop Le Chiffre from raising the money. Le Chiffre attempts to distract Tremble by performing elaborate magic tricks, but fails to prevent Tremble from winning. Afterwards, he arranges for Tremble to be kidnapped and subjects the agent to psychedelic torture in order to get back the money. The torture session is interrupted when his SMERSH masters, led by the film's main villain, Dr. Noah, shoot him dead./nIn the 2006 film adaptation of Casino Royale, Le Chiffre is portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen. Believed by MI6 to be Albanian and officially stateless, Le Chiffre is a private banker who finances international terrorism. M implies that Le Chiffre conspired with al-Qaeda in orchestrating the September 11 attacks, or at least deliberately profiteered from the attacks by short selling large quantities of airline stocks beforehand. In the video game version of Quantum of Solace, it is said that his birth name is \"Jean Duran\", in the MI6 mission briefings. A mathematical genius and a chess prodigy, his abilities enable him to earn large sums of money on games of chance and probabilities, and he likes to show off by playing poker. He has haemolacria, which causes him to weep blood out of a damaged vessel in his left eye. As in Fleming's novel, he dresses in immaculate black suits and uses a Salbutamol inhaler, here plated with platinum. Unlike in the novel Le Chiffre has no ideological motivations, saying that his driving belief is in a \"reasonable rate of return.\"/nAt the start of the movie, Le Chiffre is contacted by Mr. White, a representative of an elite criminal organisation later revealed to be Quantum (and, later still, Spectre). White introduces Steven Obanno, a leader of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, to Le Chiffre, and arranges to launder several briefcases of money for Obanno. Le Chiffre invests the money along with his other creditors' funds into the aircraft manufacturer SkyFleet. Though SkyFleet's shares have been skyrocketing in wake of a new aircraft they are rolling out, Le Chiffre plans to  short the company by purchasing put options, and ordering the destruction of the company's new prototype airliner, set to make its first flight out of Miami International Airport. Bond intervenes and foils the plan by killing Le Chiffre's first contractor for the job, as well as the backup contractor Le Chiffre hires to take his place.[5]/nThe failure of his airline scheme causes Le Chiffre to lose over $100 million. He sets up and enters a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro in an attempt to recoup his losses before his clients find out that their money has been misappropriated and seek revenge against him. Bond is sent to make sure that Le Chiffre does not win back the money, hoping to force him to turn to MI6 for asylum in exchange for information on his creditors and employers. An accountant from HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd, is sent to accompany Bond to make sure the money is used properly./nDuring the tournament, an irate Obanno and his lieutenant break into Le Chiffre's hotel room, restrain his girlfriend Valenka, and strangle him with a cord. Le Chiffre asks for, and is granted one last chance to win their money back. He offers not one word of objection to Obanno's feigned amputation of Valenka's arm, leading the ruthless warlord to advise her to find a new partner. As Obanno leaves the room, his bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper in the hallway, and hears Valenka's cries coming from Bond's earpiece. Bond kills the bodyguard by throwing him over a railing, then chokes Obanno to death with Vesper's assistance after relieving Obanno of his machete. Rene Mathis arranges the blame to be placed on Le Chiffre's bodyguard Leo by planting the bodies in the trunk of Leo's car./nOn the second day of the tournament, Le Chiffre initially outwits and bankrupts Bond, who cannot get additional funding approved by Vesper. However, Felix Leiter, a Central Intelligence Agency agent sent to participate in the game, also in hopes of bankrupting Le Chiffre, agrees to bankroll Bond, on the condition that CIA is allowed to take Le Chiffre in afterwards. Desperate, Le Chiffre has Valenka spike Bond's drink. Bond almost dies, but, thanks to an antitoxin kit in his car, a defibrillator, and Vesper's timely assistance, he is revived at the last moment and returns to the game. During the final round, Le Chiffre's full house bests the hands of the two players preceding him, but loses to Bond's straight flush.[6]/nLe Chiffre kidnaps Vesper, forcing Bond to give chase, and leads him straight into a trap. Le Chiffre leaves Vesper, bound at the feet and hands, in the middle of the road, and Bond is forced to swerve to avoid hitting her and crashes his car./nSemiconscious, Bond is stripped naked and bound to a chair with the seat removed. Le Chiffre proceeds to whip Bond in the testicles repeatedly with the knotted end of a ship's lanyard, each time demanding the password for the account into which the tournament winnings will be transferred. Bond refuses to give in, telling him that no matter what torture he is subjected to, he will not give up the password and that Le Chiffre's clients will find and kill him. The spy also asserts that if the banker takes his life, no hiding place will be safe. Le Chiffre counters that even if he does kill Bond and Vesper, MI6 will still give him shelter in exchange for invaluable information. When Bond continues to defy him, Le Chiffre brandishes a knife and prepares to castrate him, only to be interrupted by the sound of gunfire outside. Mr. White enters the room with a pistol in hand, having just killed Valenka and Kratt; Le Chiffre pleads for his life and promises to recover the lost funds, but White denounces him as untrustworthy and shoots him in the head. To date, he is the only main Bond villain to die before the film's final act./nLe Chiffre is mentioned in the direct sequel, Quantum of Solace and is also seen in a background image inside MI6./nIn Spectre, it is revealed that Le Chiffre - along with Dominic Greene, the main antagonist of Quantum of Solace, and Raoul Silva, the main antagonist of Skyfall - was an agent of the titular criminal organization and its leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.", "11692574": "Edwin Bidwell Wilson (April 25, 1879 \u2013 December 28, 1964) was an American mathematician, statistician, physicist and general polymath.[1]  He was the sole prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Yale University physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs and was mentor to MIT economist Paul Samuelson.[2]  Wilson had a distinguished academic career at Yale and MIT, followed by a long and distinguished period of service as a civilian employee of the US Navy in the Office of Naval Research.  In his latter role, he was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the highest honorary award available to a civilian employee of the US Navy.  Wilson made broad contributions to mathematics, statistics and aeronautics, and is well-known for producing a number of widely used textbooks.  He is perhaps best known for his derivation of the eponymously named Wilson score interval, which is a confidence interval used widely in statistics./nEdwin Bidwell Wilson was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to Edwin Horace Wilson (a teacher and superintendent of schools in Middletown, Connecticut) and Jane Amelia (Bidwell) Wilson.[3]  He had two sisters and two brothers; he and his siblings all went on to achieve high levels of education and professional success.[4]  Although born in Hartford, Wilson grew up in Middleton, and for a period he attended a private school that had been set up by his father, where he was substantially younger than the other students.[5]  Wilson performed at a high level academically from a young age.  He recounts that (according to his mother) he taught himself arithmetic at the age of four using his mother's sixty-inch tape measure; he learned multiplication by folding a tape measure into equal-length increments and then counting the number of folded parts.[6]  At the age of fifteen, Wilson sat and passed the entrance examination for Yale University (his father's alma mater), but his father would not allow him to attend at this age, as he considered him too young; he waited until he was sixteen and then attended Harvard College, being admitted on the basis of his entrance examination at Yale.[7]/nWilson attended Harvard College as an undergraduate, receiving his AB summa cum laude in 1899.  He then attended Yale University for his PhD, graduating in 1901.[8]  He also studied mathematics from 1902-1903 in Paris, primarily at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, before returning to teach at Yale.[9]  At Yale, Wilson worked under the supervision of Josiah Willard Gibbs and compiled an important textbook on vector analysis from Gibbs' lecture notes.  Gibbs died when Wilson had just turned twenty-four, but he exerted a strong influence on Wilson through his early supervision and through Wilson's experience compiling Gibbs' notes.  Wilson became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Yale in 1906, then Associate Professor of Mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1907, then Professor of Mathematics in 1911, then Head of the Department of Physics in 1917, and then Professor of Vital Statistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1922.[10]/nDuring World War I, Wilson gave a course in aeronautical engineering to US Army and Navy officers at MIT.[11]  Wilson retired from academic work in 1945 and worked as a consultant at the Office of Naval Research until his death in 1964.[12]  For his service to the US Navy during and after the war, Wilson was awarded the Superior Civilian Service Award in 1960 and the Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 1964.[13]  The latter award is the highest honorary award available for a civilian employee of the US Navy.  Wilson was also awarded an honorary LLD degree form Wesleyan University in 1955.[14]  Wilson had a broad range of interests and skills, and he served in a number of distinguished roles in national academies for the arts and sciences.  He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and served as its Vice-President from 1949-1953; he was a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and the American Statistical Association, serving as President of the latter in 1929;[15] he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, serving as President from 1927-1931; and he was a member of the American Philosophical Society.[16]  Wilson won the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1963.[17]/nWilson married Ethel Sentner on 5 July 1911 and they had two daughters, Doris and Enid.[18]  Doris Wilson graduated from McGill University in 1946 and became an analytical chemist working at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health.[19]  Enid Wilson graduated from Brown University and Simmons College Library School and worked as a cataloguer at the University of Rhode Island and Boston University, also serving as a secretary in the Wellesley Historical Society.[20]  Ethel Wilson (Edwin's wife) died in 1957 and he died seven years later on 28 December 1964.  His daughters survived him by almost fifty years, and both died within a month of each other in 2014.  Wilson and his wife and daughters are buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[21]/nWilson published scholarly papers on a wide range of topics in mathematics, statistics, physics, and economics, but most of his work was in mathematics.  During his career, Wilson wrote three widely used textbooks.  At the age of twenty-two he compiled the textbook Vector Analysis based on the lectures of his doctoral advisor Josiah Willard Gibbs, as Gibbs was at the time busy preparing his book on thermodynamics.[22]  This textbook was widely used by mathematicians and physicists and had a lasting effect on notation in the field.[23]  Wilson gave a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 in Heidelberg[24] where he summarised some further unpublished work by Gibbs (which he later published)./nLater in his career,  Wilson published the textbook Advanced Calculus based on his own lecture materials, and the textbook Aeronautics based on his lectures to US Army and Navy students in the first world war, as well as special tutoring sessions held with his students at MIT.[25]  In Wilson (1927) harvtxt error: no target: CITEREFWilson1927 (help) he introduced the Wilson score interval, a binomial proportion confidence interval, and also derived the \"plus four rule\", which uses a pseudocount of two (add two to both your count of successes and failures, so four total) for estimating the probability of a Bernoulli variable with a confidence interval of two standard deviations in each direction (approximately 95% coverage).[26]/nWilson published a substantial number of papers on geometry, statistics, biostatistics, and other areas.  He also conducted a number of reviews of scientific theories and works, and he was known to be critical of aspects of the works of Hilbert and Einstein.[27]  In 1904 Wilson published a review of Bertrand Russell's works The Principles of Mathematics and An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry where he highlighted the strong role of Peano in shaping the foundations of mathematics.  At the time Peano's works were not well-known in the US and so this review helped to establish interest in Peano's work.", "31451680": "Evgenii Solomonovich Golod  (Russian: \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434, 21 October 1935 \u2013 5 July 2018) was a Russian mathematician who proved the Golod\u2013Shafarevich theorem on class field towers.

In 1893, he joined the faculty of the Polytechnic School, first as instructor of astronomy and geodesy. During the WWI, his techniques of finding approximate solutions to the transcendental equations of plastic deformation allowed French gunmakers to implement autofrettage on an industrial scale and boost the output of artillery pieces. In early 1912, he became chair of geometry. In 1901, he became president of the Mathematical Society of France. In 1922, he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences.[1]/nOriginally from the province of Alen\u00e7on in Normandy, his family can be traced to the 8th century. D'Ocagne's lineage came from the du Plessis family, and he used the pseudonym Philbert du Plessis in some of his scientific publications.[1] Mortimer d'Ocagne, Maurice's father, published widely on economic and financial topics and wrote a book on French higher education Les Grandes Ecoles de France.

This was intended to include maps of every Italian region with exact nomenclature and historical notes. A major project, its production (begun in 1594) proved expensive and Magini assumed various additional posts in order to fund it, including becoming tutor in mathematics to the sons of Vincenzo I of Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, a major patron of the arts and sciences. He also served as court astrologer. The Duke of Mantua, to whom the atlas is dedicated, assisted him with this project and allowed for maps of the various states of Italy to be brought to Magini.

Yet Pepys was noted for the accuracy of his reporting, so his description of the frequent hot-tempered exchanges between them is probably accurate enough. When Brereton angrily denounced Pepys for questioning the Committee's reading of the Statute empowering them to act, Pepys replied that any Englishman may read and form his own interpretation of a public statute.[12] When Brereton sarcastically asked if Pepys would defy the whole world, Pepys replied that he would \"defy the whole world and Lord Brereton in particular\".[13] Brereton was hampered by the fact that King Charles II and his brother James, Duke of York, were present for most of the hearings and made their support for Pepys evident. James on one occasion rebuked Brereton for improper language, and when Brereton produced what he described as written proof that Pepys had taken a bribe, the King asked drily if anyone could believe that Pepys would stoop to take such a paltry sum.[14] When the committee was dissolved, having produced no lasting results, Brereton effectively retired from public life.[15]/nBrereton married Frances, daughter and co-heiress of Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham and his wife Elizabeth Cecil.

The cosmological redshift that motivates the expanding universe theory is due to curvature of the cosmos, according to Segal. Spacetime symmetry is expressed by the Lorentz group and its extension the Poincare group. \u201cThe inclusion of the Einstein temporal evolution among the fundamental symmetries gives rise to the conformal group...\u201d[9] But conformal compactification introduces closed timelike curves so Segal portrayed the spatial part of the cosmos as a large 3-sphere with an auxiliary real line for time.

At each point in the cosmos there is a convex future direction, meaning, \"the future can never merge into the past\", no spacetime curvature can close or loop.[10]/nSegal reviewed redshift data to verify his cosmology. He claimed confirmation, but generally his chronometric cosmology has not found favor.\nFor instance, Abraham\u00a0H. Taub reviewed Mathematical Cosmology and Extragalactic Astronomy, saying/nThe chronometric theory as described in this book is not a theory concerning the nature of the universe nor the behaviour of objects in it.

Daigneault spoke on \"Irving Segal's Axiomatization of Spacetime and its Cosmological Consequences\" in Budapest.[13]/nThe cosmological consequences of [Segal's] assumptions fly in the face of present day dogmas in cosmology: the universe is eternal; there is no such thing as the expansion of the universe and no such thing as a Big Bang; space is a hypersphere i.e. a three-dimensional sphere of fixed radius; the principle of energy conservation is reestablished; the redshift phenomenon is no Doppler effect but is an effect of the curvature of space\u00a0...

However, Corneil did not have the assumed programming background. Thus, in the two-week window that Corneil had been given to learn how to grasp programming the IBM 1401, he learned how to write code from scratch by relying heavily on the instruction manual.

Initially he had planned to do his graduate studies before becoming a high school teacher, but his acceptance into the brand new graduate program in computer science at the University of Toronto changed that. At the University of Toronto, Corneil earned a master's degree and then in 1968 a doctorate in computer science under the supervision of Calvin Gotlieb.[2][3] (His post-doctoral supervisor was Jaap Seidel.) It was during this time that Corneil became interested in graph theory. He and Gotlieb eventually became good friends.

She was a Fulbright Scholar at the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris the following year.  At this time, in addition to solo work on the Tricomi equation and compressible flows, she began working with her husband Robert Sibner on a problem suggested by Lipman Bers: do there exists compressible flows on a Riemann surface?  As part of her work in this direction, she studied differential geometry and Hodge theory eventually proving a nonlinear Hodge\u2013DeRham theorem with Robert Sibner based on a physical interpretation of one-dimensional harmonic forms on closed manifolds.

It ran: \"Bede [and Bayma too] was handsome of stature, grave of gait, rich and sonorous of voice, eloquent of speech, noble of countenance, a blend of affability and severity. He was affable to the good and devout, formidable to the proud and negligent. He was always reading, always writing, always teaching, and always praying.\"[1]/nTo posterity, he must be known for his \"Molecular Mechanics\", a metaphysical and mathematical work treating the constitution of matter. With Roger Joseph Boscovich, Bayma reduces all matter to unextended points, centres of force acting in the inverse square of the distance, thus acting upon one another, but of course not touching, for Bayma abhorred continuous matter and upheld actio in distans. These points were bound up into molecules, and molecules into bodies. Boscovich made his points, or elements, attractive at molar distances and repulsive at molecular distances. Bayma divides elements into attractive and repulsive, the former always attracting and the latter always repelling; the attractive elements preponderating in the nucleus of the molecule, the repulsive in the envelope. The work drew attention at Cambridge, and at Trinity College, Dublin.

In 1752 he became canon,[1] and in 1755[1] he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral of Senigallia.[2]/nFagnano is known for Fagnano's problem, the problem of inscribing a minimum-perimeter triangle within an acute triangle. As Fagnano showed, the solution is the orthic triangle, whose vertices are the points where the altitudes of the original triangle cross its sides.[3] Another property of the orthic triangle, also proven by Fagnano, is that its angle bisectors are the altitudes of the original triangle.[1]/nFagnano also partially solved the problem of finding the geometric median of sets of four points in the Euclidean plane; this is the point minimizing the sum of its distances to the four given points. As Fagnano showed, when the four points form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, the geometric median is the point where the two diagonals of the quadrilateral cross each other. In the other possible case, not considered by Fagnano, one point lies within the triangle formed by the other three, and this inner point is the geometric median.

In 1997 Cambridge University Press published his book 'Introduction to mathematical reasoning: numbers, sets and functions\u2019.[5]/nAs a research mathematician, Eccles specialised in topology and homotopy theory, publishing numerous journal papers in this area of study[4]. Eccles's most significant contributions are concerned with the multiple points of immersions of manifolds in Euclidean space and their relationship with classical problems in the homotopy groups of spheres.  His interest in this area began when he clarified the relationship between multiple points and the Hopf invariant (disproving a conjecture by Michael Freedman) and the Kervaire invariant. His teaching ranged over most areas of pure mathematics as well as the history of mathematics, relativity theory and probability theory.  He became particularly interested in the transition from school to university mathematics and this led in 1967 to the publication by Cambridge University Press of his book 'Introduction to mathematical reasoning: numbers, sets and functions\u2019.[5] which continues to be used at universities in Britain and North America./nPeter Eccles has been a Quaker since birth, having been brought up with the faith, and started to become involved nationally and internationally in his early twenties, following his attendance at the Fourth World Conference of Friends in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1967 as one of the British representatives./nHe became treasurer of the Friends World Committee for Consultation from 1982 until 1995.

The astronomical observatory, Osservatorio Ximeniano in Florence, is named after him in recognition of his services to the field./nLeonardo Ximenes was born in Trapani into a noble family of Spanish origin. As a boy, he was educated at the Jesuit school in his native town. In 1731 he entered the Jesuit Order and continued to study at the school in Trapani, where he completed the curriculum. At the age of 20 he was sent to the Roman College to pursue advanced studies. Ordained at Trapani in 1743, at the age of 27, he returned to Rome and was then sent to Florence as a priest in training. In February 2, 1750, he professed the four vows, thus divesting himself of all his property, which he left in usufruct to his mother and his paternal uncle. Only after their deaths would it have gone to the Society, save an annual allowance of 40 onze for himself, which he posthumously donated to establish a chair of experimental physics at a Jesuit college./nThe obscure Jesuit from Trapani entered the exclusive sphere of Florentine culture in 1748, when he began service as a math tutor for the sons of an important Florentine nobleman, the marchese Vincenzo Riccardi. In Florence Ximenes befriended the Tuscan scholar Giovanni Lami, editor of the journal Novelle letterarie (1740\u201370).[2] In the spring of 1755, he presented a brief memorandum to Emmanuel de Nay, count of Richecourt (1697\u20131768), the prime minister of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, concerning an ambitious project: measuring the variation in the obliquity of the ecliptic with the great gnomon in Santa Maria del Fiore. The document, preserved in the archives of the Opera del Duomo, bears in the margin the order to start work on the project immediately. That same year, on July 18, Ximenes sent the Grand Duke of Tuscany a memorandum asking to be appointed professor of Geography at the Florentine \"studio\", or university, and the administration was so efficient that, exactly three months after the request, he was appointed Reader in Geography to His Imperial Majesty with a salary of 700 lire (equivalent to that of a workman) and a grant of 9,000 lire to buy the instruments necessary for practicing his profession./nIn Ximenes' day, one of the astronomical problems debated in scientific circles was how to measure the secular variation in the obliquity of the ecliptic. Its solution was thought to be a kind of benchmark for the new theory of gravity, since it could be calculated by taking into account the gravitational perturbation of Venus and the other planets. Like others who had studied the obliquity of the ecliptic without sufficiently precise instruments, Ximenes had to compare the modern measurements with the ancient ones. The result of his research, Del vecchio e nuovo Gnomone fiorentino (On the old and the new Florentine Gnomon, 1757), is considered his masterpiece./nThe work was prodigious, consisting of nearly 400 printed pages, illustrated by copperplate engravings.[3] It described the condition of the Florentine gnomon constructed by Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli in Santa Maria del Fiore, and gave all of its measurements, which, if they had ever been known, had been lost; more importantly, it scientifically justified the need for a new gnomon.[3] So convincing were Ximenes' reasons that the politicians of the time and the Opera del Duomo financed the construction of this instrument, which was completed in a remarkably short time.[4]/nXimenes worked also as a hydraulic engineer for the Grand Duchy. He is known for building canals, including the Imperial Canal situated nearby to the locality Dogana di Tiglio and the hamlet Caccialupi in Tuscany. These canals were part of an effort to drain the Lago di Bientina, at the time the largest lake in Tuscany. In 1756 Ximenes founded an observatory in the Collegio di S. Giovannino in Florence. The observatory  was the first to be established in Florence and the first in Italy to be set up in a Jesuit college.[5] Upon the temporary suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, the laboratory was entrusted to the Scolopi fathers, with whom Ximenes continued working./nXimenes died in Florence on 3 May 1786.[5] He was member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and correspondent of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences of Paris.[5] He was among the first members of the Italian National Academy of Sciences.[5]/nXimenes had various scientific disputes with his fellow Jesuit Roger Joseph Boscovich. Relations between the two got gradually worse especially after the case about the water of Lake Bientina which, at the end of the 1750s, led the two Jesuits to oppose each other in front of the Emperor in Vienna.[6]/nThis article about an Italian astronomer is a stub.

Immediately after his graduation he became head of Applied Mathematics of the same faculty and in 1918 passed the exam for the master's degree. His first scientific magazine was published already earlier in 1915 containing a number of issues on elasticity theory. From 1917 to 1920 he worked as assistant director of the Petrograd University and also taught mathematics in other institutions in Saint Petersburg. At request of the short-lived Democratic Republic of Georgia he moved back to his native country in 1920 in order to organize the establishment of a national scientific school. There Muskhelishvili conducted lessons in the Tbilisi State University and Polytechnic Institute as an assistant professor and from 1922 to 1938 as head professor.

His works solved all major problems of the Plane Elasticity Theory opening a wide class of domains reducing the plane problem to finite systems of linear algebraic equations c singular kernels. He is also credited with major contributions to the theory of linear boundary value problems for analytic functions and one-dimensional integral equations. Muskhelishvili is the author of various scientific articles, monographs and textbooks on mathematics which have been used by universities since their publishing. Highest regarded ones are the monographs \"Some basic problems of the mathematical theory of elasticity\" (1933) and \"Singular Integral Equations\" (1947)./nDuring World War II Muskhelishvili was responsible for retargeting the preoccupation of the Academy of Science to national defense.

When the end of the siphon was opened in a reservoir, the water level in that limb would sink to about 10 m above the reservoir.[2] Galileo responded with an explanation of the phenomenon: he proposed that it was the power of a vacuum that held the water up, and at a certain height the amount of water simply became too much and the force could not hold any more, like a cord that can support only so much weight.[2][3]/nAt Savona, from the Priamar Fortress, he repeated Galileo's experiment of the Tower of Pisa, obtaining more precise measurements which allowed him to underline the effect of air attrition. He also conducted an experiment to show the heat generated by a pot full of water, which he had boiled after rotating it at high speed./nHis main work is entitled De motu naturali gravium, fluidorum et solidorum (\"About the motion of bodies, fluids and solids\"), published in 1638; in it, he was the first to enunciate the law of acceleration of a body and to distinguish between mass and weight.[citation needed] He also studied tides, supporting Galileo's theory that they were generated by the Earth's motion around the Sun.

He was their only son. He also had two half-sisters from his father's first marriage. One of the girls died at the age of seven.[1] Both of Georg's parents came from old-established families in Canton of Zug; Many of his ancestors had been involved in local and cantonal politics. His paternal grandfather, Georg Damian held a number of offices; most notably he served as a Landvogt (bailiff) in the Valle Maggia in Ticino. Sidler's father became a politician himself, first in his home, Canton of Zug, then in Z\u00fcrich and in the newly established federal government.[2] From 1810-1833, he served as delegate of Canton of Zug in the Tagsatzung. Georg Joseph was a liberal politician, but as the conservatives gained power in Zug his influence dwindled, and as a result the family moved to Unterstrass, near Z\u00fcrich, in 1839.[3] Georg Joseph also had a great interest in astronomy and mathematics, having attended lectures in both subjects during his law studies. In his house, both in Zug and in Unterstrass, he had a little observatory, and Graf reports in that 'he always took K\u00e4stner's Foundations of Mathematics or Lacroix's Introduction to Differential and Integral Calculus along to meetings of the National Court'. Georg Joseph did not publish any scientific papers, but he might have played a role in sparking his son's interest in mathematics and astronomy.[4] Sidler attended primary school first in Zug and then in Unterstrass. He attended the Gymnasium in Z\u00fcrich from 1843-1850. There, he continued to excel in mathematics and ancient languages.[5] After having obtained his Matura, he matriculated at the University of Z\u00fcrich to study mathematics.

He is widely considered to be the father of American bouldering.[1][2][3]/nAs a child, Gill lived in several southern U.S. cities, including Atlanta, Georgia, where he graduated from Bass High School in 1954. He attended Georgia Tech from 1954 to 1956, and graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in mathematics in 1958.

In 1967 he enrolled as a graduate student at Colorado State University, and received his PhD in classical complex analysis in 1971. His dissertation on M\u00f6bius transformations was supervised by Arne Magnus.[5]/nDuring his career as a college professor, Gill wrote approximately thirty research papers on the analytic theory of continued fractions, complex functions, linear fractional transformations, and related topics.[6][7][8][9] He also started a minor mathematical journal entitled Communications in the Analytic Theory of Continued Fractions with John McCabe of St Andrews University.,[10] served terms as mathematics department chair, president of the Sigma Xi (research) Club, Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America, and received an Outstanding Faculty Award. Gill retired as professor of mathematics from the University of Southern Colorado in 2000.[11]/nJohn Gill began mountain and rock climbing in 1953 as a traditional climber. By the mid-1950s he had begun to specialize in very short, acrobatic routes on outcrops and boulders, establishing problems in the 1950s and early 1960s considerably harder than those existing at the time./nBeing a gymnast and thinking of climbing as an extension of gymnastics rather than hiking, in the mid-1950s he introduced the use of gymnastic chalk into American rock climbing. The use of chalk then spread internationally throughout the climbing world. At the same time he introduced controlled dynamics, recommending it as a technique of choice, as well as one of necessity./nAccording to Alpinist magazine, \"His introduction of chalk and dynamic movement marked the beginning of modern climbing in America.\"[12]/nGill's climbing style showed the influence of formal gymnastics. He emphasized form and grace of motion over simple efficiency, the cornerstone of contemporary climbing. His performances, as recorded on film taken when he was forty (Disciples of Gill, 2009), [1], and forty-five [2], demonstrate straight lines and minimal contact with the rock. He preferred an application of strength and sometimes avoided efficient moves like the heel hook, which he considered unaesthetic. Gill's approach to bouldering \u2013 artistic style being on par with difficulty \u2013 was rarely followed by climbers of his generation and is considered unusual today, difficulty remaining paramount. He also practiced bouldering as a form of moving meditation.[4]/nAlthough certainly not the first serious boulderer \u2014 his notable predecessors include Oscar Eckenstein (1859\u20131921) and Pierre Allain (1904\u20132000) \u2014  Gill was probably the first climber in the history of rock climbing to make bouldering his primary specialty and to advocate acceptance of bouldering as a legitimate sport in its own right. His focus on bouldering and the high difficulty level climbs he established inspired a number of traditional climbers to take a more serious view of the sport, which, for the most part had been seen merely as training for longer roped climbs./nAfter retiring, Gill spent several years researching the origins of rock climbing, particularly bouldering. He also compiled a chronicle of bodyweight feats associated with climbing. These results, along with a history of gymnastic rope climbing, may be found on his website.[13]/nGill received the 2008 American Alpine Club's Pinnacle Award for outstanding climbing achievement.[14] He received the club's highest award, Honorary Membership, in 2023./nIn the Tetons, in 1958, John Gill climbed a short route on Baxter's Pinnacle that lies in the 5.10 realm, before that grade was formally recognized \u2014 one of the first to be done in America.[15] By the end of the 1950s, Gill had reached what would now be considered V9 levels on a few eliminate boulder problems. (He later stated he probably never progressed beyond V10 throughout his climbing career.[13])./nTwo of his problems on Red Cross Rock in the Tetons \u2014 a V8 in 1957 and a V9 in 1959 \u2014 set new standards of bouldering difficulty. And his 1961 route on a steep face of a small granite spire named the Thimble[16] (Needles of South Dakota) \u2014 an unrehearsed and unroped 30-foot 5.12a free-solo climb (or V4 or V5 highball)\u2014 is considered one of the great classics of modern climbing, and \u2014 if considered a climb (as Gill did) \u2014 may well be the first at the 5.12 grade.[15][17]  Gill climbed the route without the benefit of modern climbing shoes, significantly increasing the difficulty of the climb./nIn the 1950s, John Gill introduced a very early \u2013 if not the first \u2013 grading system specifically designed for bouldering and not restricted to a particular area.[1] The system, (B1, B2, B3), had two subjective levels of difficulty, and one objective level, and was predicated on prevailing and future standards attained in traditional rock climbing. The introduction of sport climbing some twenty years later and more intense competition weakened the philosophical underpinnings of the three-tiered structure, although climbers such as Jim Holloway adopted personal three-level systems similar to Gill's.  Today, Gill's B-system is rarely used, abandoned in favor of open-ended grading systems such as the V-scale./nFrom his early ascent of the east face of Longs Peak in 1954, throughout his climbing career until he left the sport in the early 2000s, a recurring theme of Gill's climbing was exploratory free soloing (at times with a light rappel rope) - usually, but not always, at moderate levels of difficulty. In fact, the Thimble \u2013 which he considered a climb and not a boulder problem - was a test of how far he was willing to go in that direction.[18][19] Once he completed a route (most were unreported) he might return to it, perhaps many times, to enjoy the  continuous movement and flow of the climb.[4]/nAs an amateur gymnast in the 1950s, 6'2\" and 180 pounds, Gill specialized in the competitive rope climb and the still rings, achieving a time of 3.4 seconds for the 20' rope climb (from seated position on the floor, arms only). The existing record - set in the 1950s - is 2.8 seconds.[20] He accomplished a number of difficult stunts on the rings, including inverted and olympic crosses, giant swings, and slow pulls from hang to handstand. He also engaged in what are now called bodyweight exercises similar to gymnastics, achieving seven one-arm pullups with the right arm and five with the left, several one-finger one-arm pullups, one-arm pullups carrying twenty pounds, one-arm pullups on a one-half inch ledge, and one-arm front levers.[13][21]", "26438577": "Gilles I.

He chose the south Atlantic island of Saint Helena (west of Africa), from which he would be able to observe not only the southern stars, but also some of the northern stars with which to cross-reference them.[14] King Charles II supported his endeavour.[15] Halley sailed to the island in late 1676, then set up an observatory with a large sextant with telescopic sights. Over a year, he made observations with which he would produce the first telescopic catalogue of the southern sky,[16] and observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun. Focusing on this latter observation, Halley realised that observing the solar parallax of a planet\u2014more ideally using the transit of Venus, which would not occur within his lifetime\u2014could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth, Venus, and the Sun.[17][c]/nHalley returned to England in May 1678, and used his data to produce a map of the southern stars.[19] Oxford would not allow Halley to return because he had violated his residency requirements when he left for Saint Helena. He appealed to Charles II, who signed a letter requesting that Halley be unconditionally awarded his Master of Arts degree, which the college granted on 3 December 1678.[20] Just a few days before,[21] Halley had been elected as a fellow of the Royal Society, at the age of 22.[22] In 1679, he published Catalogus Stellarum Australium ('A catalogue of the stars of the South'), which includes his map and descriptions of 341 stars.[19][23][d] Robert Hooke presented the catalogue to the Royal Society.[25] In mid-1679, Halley went to Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) on behalf of the Society to help resolve a dispute: because astronomer Johannes Hevelius' observing instruments were not equipped with telescopic sights, Flamsteed and Hooke had questioned the accuracy of his observations; Halley stayed with Hevelius and checked his observations, finding that they were quite precise.[24]/nBy 1681, Giovanni Domenico Cassini had told Halley of his theory that comets were objects in orbit.[26] In September 1682, Halley carried out a series of observations of what became known as Halley's Comet; his name became associated with it because of his work on its orbit and predicting its return in 1758[27] (which he did not live to see). In early 1686, Halley was elected to the Royal Society's new position of secretary, requiring him to give up his fellowship and manage correspondence and meetings, as well as edit the Philosophical Transactions.[28][e] Also in 1686, Halley published the second part of the results from his Helenian expedition, being a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons. The symbols he used to represent trailing winds still exist in most modern day weather chart representations. In this article he identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. He also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level. His charts were an important contribution to the emerging field of information visualisation.[29]/nHalley spent most of his time on lunar observations, but was also interested in the problems of gravity. One problem that attracted his attention was the proof of Kepler's laws of planetary motion. In August 1684, he went to Cambridge to discuss this with Isaac Newton, much as John Flamsteed had done four years earlier, only to find that Newton had solved the problem, at the instigation of Flamsteed with regard to the orbit of comet Kirch, without publishing the solution. Halley asked to see the calculations and was told by Newton that he could not find them, but promised to redo them and send them on later, which he eventually did, in a short treatise titled On the motion of bodies in an orbit. Halley recognised the importance of the work and returned to Cambridge to arrange its publication with Newton, who instead went on to expand it into his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica published at Halley's expense in 1687.[30] Halley's first calculations with comets were thereby for the orbit of comet Kirch, based on Flamsteed's observations in 1680\u20131681.[f] Although he was to accurately calculate the orbit of the comet of 1682, he was inaccurate in his calculations of the orbit of comet Kirch. They indicated a periodicity of 575 years, thus appearing in the years 531 and 1106, and presumably heralding the death of Julius Caesar in a like fashion in 45 BC. It is now known to have an orbital period of circa 10,000 years./nIn 1691, Halley built a diving bell, a device in which the atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface.[32] In a demonstration, Halley and five companions dived to 60 feet (18\u00a0m) in the River Thames, and remained there for over an hour and a half. Halley's bell was of little use for practical salvage work, as it was very heavy, but he made improvements to it over time, later extending his underwater exposure time to over 4 hours.[33] Halley suffered one of the earliest recorded cases of middle ear barotrauma.[32] That same year, at a meeting of the Royal Society, Halley introduced a rudimentary working model of a magnetic compass using a liquid-filled housing to damp the swing and wobble of the magnetised needle.[34]/nIn 1691, Halley sought the post of Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. While a candidate for the position, Halley faced the animosity of the Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, and the Anglican Church questioned his religious views,[g] largely on the grounds that he had doubted the Earth's age as given in the Bible.[35][h] After Flamsteed wrote to Newton to rally support against Halley, Newton wrote back in hopes of reconciliation, but was unsuccessful.[35] Halley's candidacy was opposed by both the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Tillotson, and Bishop Stillingfleet, and the post went instead to David Gregory, who had Newton's support.[38]/nIn 1692, Halley put forth the idea of a hollow Earth consisting of a shell about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) thick, two inner concentric shells and an innermost core.[39] He suggested that atmospheres separated these shells, and that each shell had its own magnetic poles, with each sphere rotating at a different speed. Halley proposed this scheme to explain anomalous compass readings. He envisaged each inner region as having an atmosphere and being luminous (and possibly inhabited), and speculated that escaping gas caused the aurora borealis.[40] He suggested, \"Auroral rays are due to particles, which are affected by the magnetic field, the rays parallel to Earth's magnetic field.\"[41]/nIn 1693 Halley published an article on life annuities, which featured an analysis of age-at-death on the basis of the Breslau statistics Caspar Neumann had been able to provide. This article allowed the British government to sell life annuities at an appropriate price based on the age of the purchaser. Halley's work strongly influenced the development of actuarial science. The construction of the life-table for Breslau, which followed more primitive work by John Graunt, is now seen as a major event in the history of demography./nThe Royal Society censured Halley for suggesting in 1694 that the story of Noah's flood might be an account of a cometary impact.[42][failed verification \u2013 see discussion] A similar theory was independently suggested three centuries later, but is generally rejected by geologists.[43]/nIn 1696, Newton was appointed as warden of the Royal Mint and nominated Halley as deputy comptroller of the Chester mint. Halley spent two years supervising coin production. While there, he caught two clerks pilfering precious metals. He and the local warden spoke out about the scheme, unaware that the local master of the mint was profiting from it.[44]/nIn 1698, the Czar of Russia (later known as Peter the Great) was on a visit to England, and hoped Newton would be available to entertain him. Newton sent Halley in his place. He and the Czar bonded over science and brandy. According to one disputed account, when both of them were drunk one night, Halley jovially pushed the Czar around Deptford in a wheelbarrow.[45]/nIn 1698, at the behest of King William III, Halley was given command of the Paramour, a 52 feet (16\u00a0m) pink, so that he could carry out investigations in the South Atlantic into the laws governing the variation of the compass, as well as to refine the coordinates of the English colonies in the Americas.[46] On 19 August 1698, he took command of the ship and, in November 1698, sailed on what was the first purely scientific voyage by an English naval vessel. Unfortunately problems of insubordination arose over questions of Halley's competence to command a vessel. Halley returned the ship to England to proceed against officers in July 1699. The result was a mild rebuke for his men, and dissatisfaction for Halley, who felt the court had been too lenient.[47] Halley thereafter received a temporary commission as a captain in the Royal Navy, recommissioned the Paramour on 24 August 1699 and sailed again in September 1699 to make extensive observations on the conditions of terrestrial magnetism. This task he accomplished in a second Atlantic voyage which lasted until 6 September 1700, and extended from 52 degrees north to 52 degrees south. The results were published in General Chart of the Variation of the Compass (1701).[9] This was the first such chart to be published and the first on which isogonic, or Halleyan, lines appeared.[48][49] The use of such lines inspired later ideas such as those of isotherms by Alexander von Humboldt in his maps.[50] In 1701, Halley made a third and final voyage on the Paramour to study the tides of the English Channel.[51] In 1702, he was dispatched by Queen Anne on diplomatic missions to other European leaders.[51]/nThe preface to Awnsham and John Churchill's collection of voyages and travels (1704), supposedly written by John Locke or by Halley, valourised expeditions such as these as part of a grand expansion of European knowledge of the world:/nWhat was cosmography before these discoveries, but an imperfect fragment of a science, scarce deserving so good a name? When all the known world was only Europe, a small part of Africk, and the lesser portion of Asia; so that of this terraqueous globe not one sixth part had ever been seen or heard of. Nay so great was the ignorance of man in this particular, that learned persons made a doubt of its being round; others no less knowing imagin'd all they were not acquainted with, desart and uninhabitable. But now geography and hydrography have receiv'd some perfection by the pains of so many mariners and travelers, who to evince the rotundity of the earth and water, have sail\u2019d and travell'd round it, as has been here made appear; to show there is no part uninhabitable, unless the frozen polar regions, have visited all other countries, tho never so remote, which they have found well peopl'd, and most of them rich and delightful\u2026.\nAstronomy has receiv'd the addition of many constellations never seen before. Natural and moral history is embelish'd with the most beneficial increase of so many thousands of plants it had never before receiv'd, so many drugs and spices, such variety of beasts, birds and fishes, such rarities in minerals, mountains and waters, such unaccountable diversity of climates and men, and in them of complexions, tempers, habits, manners, politicks, and religions\u2026. To conclude, the empire of Europe is now extended to the utmost bounds of the earth, where several of its nations have conquests and colonies. These and many more are the advantages drawn from the labours of those, who expose themselves to the dangers of the vast ocean, and of unknown nations; which those who sit still at home abundantly reap in every kind: and the relation of one traveler is an incentive to stir up another to imitate him, whilst the rest of mankind, in their accounts without stirring a foot, compass the earth and seas, visit all countries, and converse with all nations.[52]/nIn November 1703, Halley was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford, his theological enemies, John Tillotson and Bishop Stillingfleet having died. In 1705, applying historical astronomy methods, he published the paper Astronomiae cometicae synopsis (A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets); in this, he stated his belief that the comet sightings of 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682 were of the same comet, and that it would return in 1758.[53][b] Halley did not live to witness the comet's return, but when it did, the comet became generally known as Halley's Comet./nBy 1706 Halley had learned Arabic and completed the translation started by Edward Bernard[55] of Books V\u2013VII of Apollonius's Conics from copies found at Leiden and the Bodleian Library at Oxford. He also completed a new translation of the first four books from the original Greek that had been started by the late David Gregory. He published these along with his own reconstruction of Book VIII[56] in the first complete Latin edition in 1710. The same year, he received an honorary degree of doctor of laws from Oxford.[9]/nIn 1716, Halley suggested a high-precision measurement of the distance between the Earth and the Sun by timing the transit of Venus. In doing so, he was following the method described by James Gregory in Optica Promota (in which the design of the Gregorian telescope is also described). It is reasonable to assume Halley possessed and had read this book given that the Gregorian design was the principal telescope design used in astronomy in Halley's day.[57] It is not to Halley's credit that he failed to acknowledge Gregory's priority in this matter. In 1717\u201318 he discovered the proper motion of the \"fixed\" stars (publishing this in 1718)[58] by comparing his astrometric measurements with those given in Ptolemy's Almagest. Arcturus and Sirius were two noted to have moved significantly, the latter having progressed 30 arc minutes (about the diameter of the moon) southwards in 1800 years.[59]/nIn 1720, together with his friend the antiquarian William Stukeley, Halley participated in the first attempt to scientifically date Stonehenge. Assuming that the monument had been laid out using a magnetic compass, Stukeley and Halley attempted to calculate the perceived deviation introducing corrections from existing magnetic records, and suggested three dates (460 BC, AD 220 and AD 920), the earliest being the one accepted. These dates were wrong by thousands of years, but the idea that scientific methods could be used to date ancient monuments was revolutionary in its day.[60]/nHalley succeeded John Flamsteed in 1720 as Astronomer Royal, a position Halley held until his death in 1742 at the age of 85.[13] He was buried in the graveyard of the old church of St Margaret's, Lee (since rebuilt), at Lee Terrace, Blackheath.[61] He was interred in the same vault as the Astronomer Royal John Pond; the unmarked grave of the Astronomer Royal Nathaniel Bliss is nearby.[62] His original tombstone was transferred by the Admiralty when the original Lee church was demolished and rebuilt \u2013 it can be seen today on the southern wall of the Camera Obscura at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. His marked grave can be seen at St Margaret's Church, Lee Terrace.[63][64]/nDespite the persistent misconception that Halley received a knighthood, it is not the case. The idea can be tracked back to American astronomical texts such as William Augustus Norton's 1839 An Elementary Treatise on Astronomy, possibly due to Halley's royal occupations and connections to Sir Isaac Newton.[65]/nHalley married Mary Tooke in 1682 and settled in Islington. The couple had three children.[11]/nThere are three pronunciations of the surname Halley. These are /\u02c8h\u00e6li/,  /\u02c8he\u026ali/, and  /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/.  \nAs a personal surname, the most common pronunciation in the 21st century, both in Great Britain[4] and in the United States,[5] is /\u02c8h\u00e6li/ (rhymes with \"valley\"). This is the personal pronunciation used by most Halleys living in London today.[66]\nThis is useful guidance but does not, of course, tell us how the name should be pronounced in the context of the astronomer or the comet.  \nThe alternative /\u02c8he\u026ali/ is much more common in the latter context than it is when used as a modern surname.   \nColin Ronan, one of Halley's biographers, preferred /\u02c8h\u0254\u02d0li/. Contemporary accounts spell his name Hailey, Hayley, Haley, Haly, Halley, Hawley and Hawly, and presumably pronunciations varied similarly.[67]/nAs for his given name, although the spelling \"Edmund\" is quite common, \"Edmond\" is what Halley himself used, according to a 1902 article,[2] though a 2007 International Comet Quarterly article disputes this, commenting that in his published works, he used \"Edmund\" 22 times and \"Edmond\" only 3 times,[68] with several other variations used as well, such as the Latinised \"Edmundus\". Much of the debate stems from the fact that, in Halley's own time, English spelling conventions were not yet standardised, and so he himself used multiple spellings.[3]", "37579702": "Edgar Raymond Lorch (July 22, 1907 \u2013 March 5, 1990) was a Swiss American mathematician.

Augenstein headed a team that examined research on lighter, smaller warheads, re-entry speeds, mathematical models of bomb destruction, and other information from disparate sources.   He laid out his analysis in the 1954 RAND memorandum \u201cA Revised Development Program for Ballistic Missiles of Intercontinental Range.\u201d This document outlined a program that would provide the United States with a new level of strategic power,[1] and is widely regarded as the most important document of the missile age.[2][3][4]/nIn 1958 he left RAND to join Lockheed Missiles and Space Corporation.

In 1978 Augenstein wrote a report for NASA on LANDSAT policy issues to help them set a future direction for US earth remote sensing programs.[5]  During his Spectravision years, he worked increasingly for RAND as a resident consultant, and he rejoined RAND full-time in 1981./nIn the 1980s he led RAND\u2019s U.S. Air Force studies on antimatter science and technology, and co-authored a book on antiproton technology.

Since the support from his parents was not sufficient, he gave private lessons to students, some of whom were found for him by Weierstrass and Kronecker. He graduated in 1863 and returned to Switzerland as a Privatdozent at Z\u00fcrich Polytechnikum. He pursued graduate studies at the University of Bern with doctorate (Promotion) in 1866 under Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli with dissertation Beitr\u00e4ge zur synthetischen Geometrie.[3][4] At the Z\u00fcrich Polytechnikum, Geiser, together with Theodor Reye, temporarily fulfilled the duties of a professorial chair upon the death of Joseph Wolfgang von Deschwanden (1819\u20131866), until the professorial chair was given in 1867 to Wilhelm Fiedler.

He graduated from the Physics and Mathematics department of Moscow State University in 1867 and became a Professor of Physics in 1875. He studied theoretical physics by reading works of Gabriel Lam\u00e9, Clebsch and Clausius, that made a significant impact on the originality of his later ideas in physics./nUmov became the head of the Physics department of Moscow State University (MSU) after Aleksandr Stoletov died in 1896. Together with Pyotr Lebedev, Umov actively participated in founding the Physical Institute at the MSU./nHe organized several educational societies. He was the president of the Moscow Society of Nature Explorers for 17 years. He was among the first Russian scientists who acknowledged the importance of the theory of relativity. In 1911, along with a group of leading professors, he left Moscow University in protest of reactionary actions of the government. Umov died in 1915 in Moscow./nUmov was the first who introduced in physics such basic concepts as speed and direction of movement of energy, which are now associated with Umov-Poynting vector, and density of energy in a given point of space. During his work in Odessa from 1873 to 1874, Umov published first papers containing the major ideas of energy movement. In his first works of this period, Umov considered potential energy as kinetic energy of some environments \"imperceptible for us\". From this hypothesis, he made a conclusion: it is always possible to specify a place where the energy is in. Therefore, it is natural to raise the question about movement of energy. In his following works, Umov did not bind himself to this hypothesis about the nature of potential energy, but was guided by the principle of energy conservation only. After formulating the concept of density and movement of energy, he wrote differential equations for energy movement in the elastic media and in the fluid. The authoritative Encyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften states:/nN. Umov in 1874 had already solved a problem of the movement of energy in liquid and elastic media in completely generalized view. However, the intense attention to this view has been attracted only after Poynting had presented a stream of electromagnetic energy based on Maxwell equations [ten years later than Umov's publications]./nHe was the first scientist to indicate interrelation between mass and energy proposing the formula E = kmc2 with 0,5 \u2264 k \u2264 1 as early as in 1873.[1] In 1875, Umov solved a general problem of distribution of electric currents in conducting surfaces of any kind. Between 1888 and 1891, he investigated experimentally the diffusion in water solutions, the polarization of light in opaque media, and discovered the effect of chromatic depolarization of light. In 1900, he conducted a thorough analysis of many Gauss formulae regarding terrestrial magnetism, which allowed the definition of secular changes of the Earth's magnetic field.", "486365": "Peter David Lax (born Lax P\u00e9ter D\u00e1vid; 1 May 1926) is a Hungarian-born American mathematician and Abel Prize laureate working in the areas of pure and applied mathematics./nLax has made important contributions to integrable systems, fluid dynamics and shock waves, solitonic physics, hyperbolic conservation laws, and mathematical and scientific computing, among other fields./nIn a 1958 paper Lax stated a conjecture about matrix representations for third order hyperbolic polynomials which remained unproven for over four decades. Interest in the \"Lax conjecture\" grew as mathematicians working in several different areas recognized the importance of its implications in their field, until it was finally proven to be true in 2003.[1]/nLax was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family.[2] Lax began displaying an interest in mathematics at age twelve, and soon his parents hired R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter as a tutor for him.[3] His parents Klara Kornfield and Henry Lax were both physicians and his uncle Albert Kornfeld (also known as Albert Korodi) was a mathematician, as well as a friend of Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd./nThe family left Hungary on 15 November 1941, and traveled via Lisbon to the United States. As a high school student at Stuyvesant High School, Lax took no math classes but did compete on the school math team. During this time, he met with John von Neumann, Richard Courant, and Paul Erd\u0151s, who introduced him to Albert Einstein./nAs he was still 17 when he finished high school, he could avoid military service, and was able to study for three semesters at New York University. He attended a complex analysis class in the role of a student, but ended up taking over as instructor. He met his future wife, Anneli Cahn (married to her first husband at that time) in this class.[3][4]/nBefore being able to complete his studies, Lax was drafted into the U.S. Army. After basic training, the Army sent him to Texas A&M University for more studies.

He is known for his view that medical technology may enable human beings alive today not to die from age-related causes.[9] As an amateur mathematician, he has contributed to the study of the Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem in geometric graph theory, making the first progress on the problem in over 60 years.[10]/nDe Grey is an international adjunct professor of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.[11] In August 2021, he was removed as the Chief Science Officer of the SENS Research Foundation after he had allegedly attempted to interfere in a probe investigating sexual harassment allegations against him. In September 2021, an independent investigation concluded that he had made offensive remarks to two women.[12]/nDe Grey was born and brought up in London, England.[13] He told The Observer that he never knew his father, and that his mother Cordelia, an artist, encouraged him in the areas in which she herself was weakest: science and mathematics.[14] De Grey was educated at Sussex House School[15] and Harrow School. He attended university at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in computer science in 1985.[16]/nAfter graduation in 1985, de Grey joined Sinclair Research as an artificial intelligence researcher and software engineer. In 1986, along with SRL colleague Aaron Turner, he co-founded Man-Made Minions Ltd. in order to pursue the development of an automated formal program verifier.[17] At a graduate party in Cambridge, de Grey met fruit fly geneticist Adelaide Carpenter[18] whom he would marry in 1991.[19] Through her he was introduced to the intersection of biology and programming when her boss needed someone who knew about computers and biology to take over the running of a database on fruit flies.[20] In the early 1990s, he switched fields from AI research to biomedical gerontology, after realising that \"biologists by and large were not terribly interested in doing anything about aging\".[21] He educated himself in biology by reading journals and textbooks, attending conferences, and being tutored by Professor Carpenter.[22][23] From 1992 to 2006, he was in charge of software development at the university's Genetics Department for the FlyBase genetic database.[24]/nCambridge awarded de Grey a Ph.D. by publication in biology on 9 December 2000.[16][25] The degree was based on his 1999 book The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging, in which de Grey wrote that obviating damage to mitochondrial DNA might by itself extend lifespan significantly, though he said it was more likely that cumulative damage to mitochondria is a significant cause of senescence, but not the single dominant cause.[citation needed]/nIn 2005, de Grey argued that most of the fundamental knowledge needed to develop effective anti-aging medicine already exists, and that the science is ahead of the funding. He described his work as identifying and promoting specific technological approaches to the reversal of various aspects of aging, or, as he puts it, \"... the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us.\"[26]/nAs of 2005[update], de Grey's work centered on a detailed plan called strategies for engineered negligible senescence (SENS), which is aimed at preventing age-related physical and cognitive decline. In March 2009, he co-founded the SENS Research Foundation (named SENS Foundation until early 2013), a non-profit organisation based in California, United States, where he served until 2021 as Chief Science Officer. The foundation \"works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to regenerative medicine solutions to the disabilities and diseases of aging,\"[27] focusing on the strategies for engineered negligible senescence. Before March 2009, the SENS research program was mainly pursued by the Methuselah Foundation, co-founded by de Grey./nA major activity of the Methuselah Foundation is the Methuselah Mouse Prize,[28] a prize designed to incentivize research into effective life extension interventions by awarding monetary prizes to researchers who stretch the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths. De Grey stated in March 2005 \"if we are to bring about real regenerative therapies that will benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today, we must encourage scientists to work on the problem of aging.\" The prize reached 4.2 USD million in February 2007./nIn 2007, de Grey wrote the book Ending Aging with the assistance of Michael Rae.[29]/nIn a 2008 broadcast on Franco-German TV network Arte, de Grey claimed that the first human to live 1,000 years was probably already alive, and might even be between 50 and 60 years old already.[30]/nIn 2012, de Grey inherited more than US$16 million, US$13 million of which he donated to the SENS Research Foundation.[31]/nIn 2022, de Grey started the Longevity Escape Velocity Foundation.[32]/nOn 8 April 2018, de Grey posted a paper to arXiv explicitly constructing a unit-distance graph in the plane that cannot be colored with fewer than five colors, increasing the previously known lower bound by one. The previous lower bound of four was due to the problem's original proposal in 1950 by Hugo Hadwiger and Edward Nelson.[33] De Grey's graph has 1581 vertices, but it has since been reduced to 510 by independent researchers.[34][35][36]/nDe Grey was formerly Vice President of New Technology Discovery at AgeX Therapeutics, a startup in the longevity space helmed by Michael D. West. He was appointed to the position within the company in July 2017.[37][38][39]/nXenocatabolism is a concept in medical bioremediation that relies upon introducing into the body microbial enzymes that break down pathogenic lysosomal, cytosolic and extracellular aggregates. The term, also called xenohydrolysis, was coined by de Grey, building upon the work of others.[40][41] De Grey posited that there are microbes that feed on substances such as amyloid, cholesterol and other related substances in places that are full of human remains, such as graveyards. This was based on the microbial infallibility hypothesis. He states that \"the biomedical approach would be to identify the genetic basis for that capacity, and to put one or two genes into ourselves, thereby enhancing our own ability to break things down, and to thereby get rid of things that we cannot naturally break down\".[42] In order to add credibility to the concept, de Grey created an experiment using soil from a graveyard and took the bacteria from it. He used lipofuscin, \"one of the major things that accumulates indigestibly in the body\" \u2013 which some of the bacteria broke down, lending credibility to the hypothesis. De Grey presented this theory on May 29, 2007, at the Googleplex Google TechTalks.[citation needed]/nAubrey de Grey coined the term Methuselarity, which he defines as the moment when medical therapies will rejuvenate people enough to continue living healthily until the next improved generation of rejuvenation biotechnology, and so on, indefinitely. According to de Grey, that is synonymous with the point where science achieves longevity escape velocity\u2013the minimum rate at which those therapies need to be improved in order to allow people not to suffer from age-related ill-health at any age.[43] In 2022, he stated that there is a 50% chance that this breakthrough was only 15 years away.[44]/nHowever, de Grey views the fatalistic attitude toward aging in society, as he sees it, as a hurdle in the rapid development of anti-aging medicine, which he calls \"pro-aging trance\".[45]/nIn 2005, MIT Technology Review, in cooperation with the Methuselah Foundation, announced a US$20,000 prize for any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that SENS was \"so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate.\" The judges of the challenge were Rodney Brooks, Anita Goel, Vikram Sheel Kumar, Nathan Myhrvold, and Craig Venter. Five submissions were made, of which three met the terms of the challenge. De Grey wrote a rebuttal to each submission, and the challengers wrote responses to each rebuttal. The judges concluded that none of the challengers had disproved SENS, but the magazine opined that Preston Estep's submission was particularly eloquent and well written, and awarded the contestant US$10,000. The judges also noted \"the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for SENS\", and wrote that many of its proposals could not be verified with the current level of scientific knowledge and technology, concluding that \"SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong.\"[46] The critics single out three proposed therapies for criticism: somatic telomerase deletion, somatic mitochondrial genome engineering, and the use of transgenic microbial hydrolase.[47]/nLater in 2005, he was the subject of an associated critical editorial article in the MIT Technology Review, which viewed his theories as oversimplifying anti-aging as a scientific goal, and expressed concern at a lack of ethical and moral considerations towards anti-aging research.[48]/nA 2005 article about SENS published in the viewpoint section of EMBO Reports by 28 scientists concluded that none of de Grey's hypotheses \"have ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans\".[49] The SENS Research Foundation, of which de Grey was a co-founder, acknowledged this, stating, \"If you want to reverse the damage of aging right now I'm afraid the simple answer is, you can't.\"[50] Moreover, de Grey argued that this reveals a serious gap in understanding between basic scientists and technologists and between biologists studying aging and those studying regenerative medicine.[51]/nThe 31-member Research Advisory Board of de Grey's SENS Research Foundation have signed an endorsement of the plausibility of the SENS approach.[52] In 2021, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), showcased a SENS research project and provided a grant for the research.[53][54]/nAccording to de Grey, automation will take over most jobs in the future.[55] He also believes that the introduction of a universal basic income will be necessary to find \"some new way to distribute wealth that doesn\u2019t depend on being paid to do things we wouldn\u2019t otherwise do\".[55]/nDe Grey is a cryonicist, having signed up with Alcor.[56] When asked in an interview about his views on cryonics, he answered that \"[...] it's an absolute tragedy that cryonics is still such a backwater publicly and that a large majority of people still believe that it has no chance of ever working\", arguing \"If people understood it better, there would be more research done to develop better cryopreservation technologies, and more people would have a chance at life.\"[57]/nIn August 2021, following allegations of sexual harassment by two women, de Grey was put on administrative leave by SENS.[58]/nBoth women describe situations in which he, {...} explicitly spoke with them about sex. According to Halioua\u2019s account, he told her that it was her responsibility to sleep with SENS donors to encourage financial contributions. Deming was 17 when, she alleges, de Grey told her he wanted to speak with her about his \u201cadventurous love life.\u201d Deming says that when she recently became aware that this was not a one-off incident, she was \u201cangry to realize that Aubrey inappropriately propositioned more than one woman, many in the community knew about it, and no one did anything,\u201d she writes.[59]/nThe SENS board of directors decided to remove de Grey from his position as chief science officer, severing all ties with him following the report that he had allegedly attempted to interfere with the investigation.[60]/nThe independent investigator determined that de Grey made inappropriate remarks to Deming and Halioua. The investigator also decided de Grey's attempt to communicate with Halioua via a third party constituted interference, although de Grey stated he believed that phase of the investigation had concluded. The investigator found that various other allegations against de Grey were not substantiated.[61][62]/nIn March 2022, the SENS Research Foundation released a statement regarding de Grey's employment affirming that while his actions \"did substantiate instances of poor judgment and boundary-crossing behaviors, Dr. de Grey is not a sexual predator.\"[63]", "2976742": "Mary Ellen Rudin (December 7, 1924 \u2013 March 18, 2013)[1] was an American mathematician known for her work in set-theoretic topology.[2] In 2013, Elsevier established the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award, which is awarded annually to a young researcher, mainly in fields adjacent to general topology.[3]/nMary Ellen (Estill) Rudin was born in Hillsboro, Texas to Joe Jefferson Estill and Irene (Shook) Estill.

His insights then led to later important results, such as the proof by Ben Green and Terence Tao that the sequence of prime numbers includes arbitrary large arithmetic progressions./nHe proved unique ergodicity of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces in the early 1970s. The Furstenberg boundary and Furstenberg compactification of a locally symmetric space are named after him, as is the Furstenberg\u2013S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy theorem in additive number theory./nIn 1958, Furstenberg married Rochelle (n\u00e9e) Cohen, a journalist and literary critic.

His most important contributions were within number theory and he advised the young, aspiring Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel in a decisive way. Degen has received much of the credit for the introduction of more modern and advanced mathematics in the Danish-Norwegian school system./nHe was born in Braunschweig in Germany, but the family moved to Copenhagen in 1771 when his father Johan Philip Degen got a position in the Royal Danish Orchestra. As a musician he had a low salary, but his son Carl Ferdinand received a fellowship so that he could go to school in Helsing\u00f8r. He graduated from there in 1783 and continued at the University of Copenhagen. Instead of following the normal path of studies, the young Degen followed his own interests and read classical languages, philosophy, natural sciences and in particular mathematics.[1] When the university in 1792 for the first time announced a prize essay contest in several different fields with an award of 40 riksdaler in each, Degen won the prize both in theology and in mathematics.  He was fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, was well-acquainted with Romance and Germanic languages and could read Russian and Polish. In this period he was tutor in mathematics for the young prince who later became king Christian VIII of Denmark.  In 1798 Degen was made a Doctor of Philosophy based on a thesis on Kant's philosophy[2] and was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in 1800.[1]/nIn 1802 Degen got his first academic position as head teacher in mathematics and physics at the Odense cathedral school. After a few years there he was appointed rector at the corresponding school in  Viborg. There he remained until 1814 when he became professor in mathematics at the University of Copenhagen. Although his lectures were not so well organized, he was loved by his students and he infused the courses with new and more modern mathematics. At the same time he pursued his own research and published results in many different directions. All this made him the most esteemed mathematician in Scandinavia at that time.[2]/nWhen Niels Henrik Abel as a student visited Degen in Copenhagen, he described him as very kind, but a little strange, with a large, private library.[2] Degen remained there until his death in 1825. For that reason he did not live to see the great fame the young Abel shortly afterwards obtained from his discovery of elliptic functions which Degen had encouraged. He is buried on the Assistens Kirkeg\u00e5rd at N\u00f8rrebro in Copenhagen./nDegen worked in many branches of what was then modern mathematics. Most of his contributions had to do with problems within number theory, but he also wrote papers on geometry and mechanics.[1]/nIn 1817 Degen got printed his large work on the fundamental solutions (x, y) of Pell's equation x2 \u2013 ny2 = 1 where n is a positive integer. Euler had earlier shown that these could be systematically calculated with the use of continued fractions. Degen used this method and presented integer solutions for all n < 1000.[3] The same calculations also gave approximate, but very accurate rational results for the square root of n. In addition, he also found solutions of the adjoint equation with \u22121 on the right hand side for the n-values when they existed. These tables of numerical results became in the following years a standard reference for the Pell equation.[4]/nWhile his work on the Pell equation can be considered a continuation of previous contributions made by Euler, Lagrange and Legendre to this problem, Degen's discovery of the  eight-square identity was his most important and original discovery. Most probably it resulted from his attempts to generalize the Pell equation./nThe two-square identity/nhad been known from the times of Diophantus. At the end of the 17th century it explained why the norm of the product of two complex numbers equals the product of their norms.  Around the same time Euler showed that there is also a similar four-square identity. Later it turned out to be related to the norm of quaternions discovered by William Rowan Hamilton. In 1818 Degen presented to the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg where Euler had worked, his eight-square identity of exactly the same structure as the two previous identities.[5] The following year he was elected as a \u00abcorresponding member\u00bb to the same academic society./nHis work on the eight-square identity was first published in 1822.[6]  Almost thirty years later his identity was rediscovered by John T. Graves and Arthur Cayley as obeyed by the norm of octonions. These were an extension of Hamilton's quaternions. In 1898 Adolf Hurwitz proved that such identities involving 2k squares can exist only for k = 0, 1, 2 and 3./nIn 1821 Niels Henrik Abel was a very gifted student in his last year at the cathedral school in Oslo.  He was convinced that he had found a way to solve the quintic equation. None of his teachers or professors at the University of Oslo could find anything wrong with his work. The astronomy professor Christopher Hansteen recommended then that the paper ought to be published by the Science Academy in Copenhagen. It thus came in the hands of Degen to be evaluated.[2] He again could not pinpoint any mistakes, but asked that this new method should first be tried out on a practical example. In a letter to Hansteen he proposed the equation  x5 \u2212 2x4 + 3x2 \u2212 4x + 5 = 0. He ended the letter with the wish that/n.... the time and efforts that Mr. Abel in my eyes spends on this rather sterile subject ought to be invested in a problem whose development will have the greatest consequences for Mathematical Analysis and its applications to practical investigations. I refer to elliptic transcendentals. A serious investigator with suitable qualifications for research of this kind would by no means be restricted to the many strange and beautiful properties of these most remarkable functions, but could discover a Strait of Magellan leading into the wide expanses of a vast Analytic Ocean./nThis would soon turn out to be a very prophetic piece of advice. Abel himself soon discovered a mistake in his investigations of the quintic equation, but continued to work on the existence of solutions. Two years later he could prove that they in general have no algebraic solutions./nDegen's recommendation to concentrate instead on the elliptic integral had most probably made some impression on the young student. In the summer of 1823 Abel was on a short visit to Copenhagen where he met Degen. In a letter to his friend and former teacher Bernt Michael Holmboe in Oslo he wrote that he had constructed elliptic functions by inverting the corresponding integrals. The following year in a letter to Degen he could report that these new functions had two periods.[7] Although this discovery marks the beginning of a new and very important branch of modern mathematics, Abel waited with the publication of his results. That happened first in 1827. Degen had in the meantime died and was therefore unaware of the beautiful discoveries Abel had made and which he had prophesied.", "25750508": "Adolph-Andrei Pavlovich Yushkevich (Russian: \u0410\u0434\u043e\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0444-\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0301\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u042e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0447; 15 July 1906 \u2013 17 July 1993) was a Soviet historian of mathematics, leading expert in medieval mathematics of the East and the work of Leonhard Euler.

Unlike most pure mathematicians of the time, Miller implemented simulations of his models on early supercomputers. In the 1970s Miller was recognized not only as a leading mathematician but also as an expert on the CRAY line of supercomputer./nMiller maintained an academic affiliation with George Washington University as an adjunct professor after retiring from the Naval Research Laboratory in 1991. He published actively until his death from a heart embolism on August 15, 2010.[1]/nMiller made numerous contributions in the area of special functions and addressed several significant open problems. Notable among these include his work with Emanuel Vegh in formulating an exact closed-form solution for the grazing angle for specular reflection on a sphere (Alhazen's problem).[2]/nThe Miller-Brown-Vegh model (developed at NRL) is commonly used to describe scattering from the ocean surface. It has been adopted in the US Navy's models for propagation over the ocean and appears in the Radar Handbook./nMiller, with Ira S. Moskowitz, made several contributions to the mathematical analysis of covert channels in computer security.  In particular he showed how special functions could simplify the closed form for the Shannon channel capacity and how the difference of divergent series could also be used to express channel capacity in certain physical situations that arise in anonymity networks.[3][4][5]/nAllen Miller published around 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and numerous other non-refereed technical reports and articles.

He is perhaps best known today for his result on the existence of the Schur decomposition and for his work on group representations (Schur's lemma)./nSchur published under the name of both I. Schur, and J. Schur, the latter especially in Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This has led to some confusion.[2]/nIssai Schur was born into a Jewish family, the son of the businessman Moses Schur and his wife Golde Schur (n\u00e9e Landau). He was born in Mogilev on the Dnieper River in what was then the Russian Empire. Schur used the name Schaia  (Isaiah as the epitaph on his grave) rather than Issai up in his middle twenties.[3] Schur's father may have been a wholesale merchant.[4]/nIn 1888, at the age of 13, Schur went to Liep\u0101ja (Courland, now in Latvia), where his married sister and his brother lived, 640\u00a0km north-west of Mogilev. Kurland was one of the three Baltic governorates of Tsarist Russia, and since the Middle Ages the Baltic Germans were the upper social class.[5][6] The local Jewish community spoke mostly German and not Yiddish.[7]/nSchur attended the German-speaking Nicolai Gymnasium in Libau from 1888 to 1894 and reached the top grade in his final examination, and received a gold medal.[8] Here he became fluent in German./nIn October 1894, Schur attended the University of Berlin, with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated summa cum laude under Frobenius and Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs with his dissertation On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix,[9] which contains a general theory of the representation of linear groups. According to Vogt,[10] he began to use the name Issai at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor,[11] and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.[12]/nIn 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of Felix Hausdorff at the University of Bonn. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur's name was mentioned in a letter dated 27 June 1913[13] from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH) as a possible successor to Carl Friedrich Geiser.[14] Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: \"That is why I can't even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He's too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin\". Hermann Weyl got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on 3 August 1917. Schur and Carath\u00e9odory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose Constantin Carath\u00e9odory in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired Friedrich Hermann Schottky. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]/nAfter the takeover by the Nazis and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were \"Jewish\" in origin; a subsequent regulation[15] extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague Erhard Schmidt fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the First World War,[16] he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his application for leave from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison for the academic year 1933\u201334.[17] One element that likely played a role in the rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.[18]/nAlready in 1932, Schur's daughter Hilde had married the doctor Chaim Abelin in Bern.[19] As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with George P\u00f3lya, with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.[20]/nOn such a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1935, a letter reached Schur from Ludwig Bieberbach signed on behalf of the Rector's, stating that Schur should urgently seek him out in the University of Berlin.[21] They needed to discuss an important matter with him. It involved Schur's dismissal on 30 September 1935.[22]/nSchur remained a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, but a little later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy.[23] His membership in the Advisory Board of Mathematische Zeitschrift was ended in early 1939.[24]/nSchur found himself lonely after the flight of many of his students and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer.[25] The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo,[26] in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors./nSchur was able to leave Germany in early 1939.[27] His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine. Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on 10 January 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.[citation needed]/nSchur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for group theory and representation theory. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected works[28] are proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found./nIn his doctoral thesis \u00dcber eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group \n\n\n\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\n\nC\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {C} )}\n\n on the field \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n of complex numbers. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today.[29] In his book, J.A. Green determined the polynomial representations of \n\n\n\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\n\nK\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL(n,\\mathbb {K} )}\n\n over infinite fields \n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {K} }\n\n with arbitrary characteristic.[30] It is mainly based on Schur's dissertation. Green writes, \"This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each irreducible one is \"homogeneous\" of some degree \n\n\n\nr\n\u2265\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r\\geq 0}\n\n, and that the equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of \n\n\n\nG\n\nL\n\nn\n\n\n(\n\nC\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GL_{n}(\\mathbb {C} )}\n\n, of fixed homogeneous degree \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n, are in one-one correspondence with the partitions \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n=\n(\n\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\n\n,\n\u2026\n,\n\n\u03bb\n\nn\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda =(\\lambda _{1},\\ldots ,\\lambda _{n})}\n\n of \n\n\n\nr\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r}\n\n into not more than \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n parts.

This work of Schur was once very well known.[citation needed]/nSchur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.[31] Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).[32] Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to Hermann Weyl, were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Noether (1882\u20131935).[33]/nWhen Schur's lectures were canceled in 1933, there was an outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and liked him.[34] By the efforts of his colleague Erhard Schmidt Schur was allowed to continue lecturing until the end of September 1935 for the time being.[35] Schur was the last Jewish professor who lost his job at this time.[36]/nIn Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George P\u00f3lya were informed of the dismissal of Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could.[37] On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on 12 December 1935[38] the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Schur to une s\u00e9rie de conf\u00e9rences sur la th\u00e9orie de la repr\u00e9sentation des groupes finis. At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l'autorisation du minist\u00e8re comp\u00e9tent de donner ces conf\u00e9rences. George P\u00f3lya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on 16 December.[39] Meanwhile, on 14 December the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Schur.[40] Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500./nSchur did not reply until 28 January 1936, on which day he was first in the possession of the required approval of the local authority.[41] He declared himself willing to accept the invitation. He envisaged beginning the lecture on 4 February.[42] Schur spent most of the month of February in Switzerland. Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on 27 February he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to P\u00f3lya from Berne, he concludes with the words: From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart.[43]/nIn Berlin, meanwhile, Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated 20 February 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.[44]/nSchur had a total of 26[45] graduate students, some of whom acquired a mathematical reputation. Among them are/nAmong others, the following concepts are named after Issai Schur:/nIn his commemorative speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate of Schur) spoke about Issai Schur as follows:[46] As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation \u2013 During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students./nHeinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held \u2013 as is clear from oral statements and also from letters \u2013 Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George P\u00f3lya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. \u2013 If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him./nSchur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur's former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.[47]", "30862391": "James Dickson Murray FRSE FRS, (born 2 January 1931) is professor emeritus of applied mathematics at University of Washington and University of Oxford.

His parents were Carlos de Lyra Filho, a sugarcane plantation owner and owner of the Pernambuco Daily newspaper which received a lot of national attention, and Elizabeth Lau de Lyra, a German woman that came to Brazil with her family. The marriage between them was arranged due to how close the two families were in business and faith. Carlos de Lyra Filho came from an earlier marriage, where he had five sons, where after the death of his first wife he remarried with Elizabeth, where they had two children: Carlos and George.[1][2]/nCarlos Benjamin de Lyra's father died when he was 9 years old. Widowed, his mother married Paul Nortz, a stockbroker at Wall Street. Together, the family, including the children, moved to New York City.[1][2]/nLyra did not go to school during his early years, he was instead home schooled by a tutor who taught German in this time. In the United States, he studied in Catholic schools, and finished his primary education and middle school at Iona High School, New Rochelle. Around the age of 15, Lyra met the researcher and founder of the Institute of New York University, Richard Courant (1888\u20131972), during one of his daily train journeys. It was Courant that provided Lyra his interest in Mathematics, whereas his earlier stated interest was in astronomy.[1][2]/nBy the end of middle school, Lyra had the opportunity to obtain US citizenship and follow the wishes of his stepfather who wanted to see him work in Wall Street and study in a university which would accept him, including Yale. But he refused this, as he had an attachment to Brazil and was critical of US society and culture. In 1945, returning to Brazil after the end of the Second World War, Lyra enlisted himself in the Brazilian Army to continue his path to citizenship and spend some time living with his brothers from his father's earlier marriage as guardians until he turned 18. The following year, he would move to S\u00e3o Paulo, living in the home of Manuel Tavares, a lawyer and friend of the family, and soon begin his study of Mathematics.[1][5]/nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, 1947, Lyra began studying Mathematics under the former Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci\u00eancias e Letras of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (FFCL). During this time, he would meet French mathematicians Andr\u00e9 Weil (1906\u20131998) and Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 (1906\u20131992), and have lectures with Professor C\u00e2ndido Lima da Silva Dias (1913\u20131998) on the topic of algebraic topology, the area of study he would pursue during the rest of his career.[1][2][3]/nAfter graduating in 1950, Lyra developed an interest in algebraic topology when he attended a course on the Theory of Simplicial Homology, which was administrated by Professor C\u00e2ndido Lima, on the year of his graduation. With this, he travelled to France in 1952 to take part in a postgraduate program with funding from the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas (CNPq). He met and studied with Henri Cartan and participated in seminars and watched Hurewicz's lectures on homotopy in the Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris.[1][2][3]/nDuring his time in France, Lyra met Leda Lacerda, a woman from Rio de Janeiro and graduated in physics from the Faculdade Nacional de Filosofia. Lacerda was in Europe at that time to study in the European Institute of Physics. After meeting Lyra, they began their relationship and they moved to the Hotel des Grands Hommes, in Paris, where they would remain until the end of their stay in France. A short time later. Leda became pregnant with their first son and returned to Brazil, with Lyra following soon after completing his postgraduation. Together in Brazil, they were married in the home of Lasar Segall, father of the artist Maur\u00edcio Segall, a friend of the couple.[1][2]/nIn 1954, Jorge Lacerda de Lyra was born. In all, Carlos and Leda had 3 children: Jorge, Sylvia (1956) and Eduardo (1958). In that same year, Carlos was hired by the FFCL, together with Elza Gomide, and became associate professor in the C\u00e1tedra de An\u00e1lise Matem\u00e1tica which was headed by Professor Omar Catunda. This began his academic career in the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.[1][2][3]/nLyra continued as associate professor in the C\u00e1tedra de An\u00e1lise Matem\u00e1tica until 1958. Influenced by a visiting professor at the USP, Alexander Grothendieck, Carlos learnt about cohomology, furthering his interest of topology. In 1956, Carlos organized a weekly seminar on algebraic topology, where they would discuss important topics from this field.[1][5]/nHe defended his doctorate thesis in 1958, titled Sobre os espa\u00e7os de mesmo tipo de homotopia que o dos poliedros, with C\u00e2ndido Lima da Silva Dias advising him. He received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1961 and moved his family to New Jersey, where he visited the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. This advanced his understanding of cohomological operations and, through the advising of John Milnor (1931 -), he developed his study in differential topology.[2][1][5]/nConcerned that he would not be allowed to return to Brazil due to his socialist affiliation, Lyra returned after one year in New Jersey out of the two years the original funding provided for. After receiving his familial inheritance, he bought a house in Vila Mariana. In 1963, he became the coordinator of the night course of Mathematical analysis in the Departamento de Matem\u00e1tica of the USP, until 1970.[1][5]/nCarlos was a fundamental figure in the creation of the Instituto de Matem\u00e1tica e Estat\u00edstica of USP (IME-USP) in January 1970. In 1972, he was hired as a Senior Professor. He was recognised as a professor and researcher who was dedicated and inspired students and colleagues.[2][1][5]/nIn 1968 he defended his postgraduate thesis, titled H-Equival\u00eancia de grupos topol\u00f3gicos, leading to him obtaining the title of Professor in Complements in Geometry and Superior Geometry at the FFCL.[1][5]/nLyra as a professor frequently participated in events such as the Col\u00f3quios de Matem\u00e1tica. It was in the first Col\u00f3quio Brasileiro de Matem\u00e1tica in which he led a course based on his doctorate (Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Topologia Alg\u00e9brica), and on the fifth and seventh he presented once again. He also participated on the Comiss\u00e3o Organizadora of the reunion in his first year, coordinated a commission in the Col\u00f3quio, and participated once again in the sixth./nIn 1967, during the sixth Col\u00f3quio Brasileiro de Matem\u00e1tica, Lyra integrated a commission whose aim was to define the scientific character and the organization of the Escola Latino-Americana de Matem\u00e1tica. This commission was composed of the professors: Emilio Lluis (Mexico), Orlando Villamayor (Argentina) and Carlos Benjamin de Lyra (Brazil). Working together, they produced a document which was then approved by the plenary.[3][4]/nBetween 1966 and 1967, Lyra was the elected president of the Sociedade de Matem\u00e1tica de S\u00e3o Paulo, however it did not last for very long and, before its end, he had one published work in the Di\u00e1rio Oficial do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo./nYears later, in 1969, he was one of the founders of the Sociedade Brasileira de Matem\u00e1tica, and was elected as one of four advisors. His mandate lasted until 1972, and later, he became the Secretary General.[3]/nIn his final years, Lyra continued to be active in his work. After the creation of the IME-USP in 1970, he was chosen by the CNPq to be a conference professor and, two years later, nominated, by the president of the CNPq, to be the Brazilian representative in the Permanent Commission of the Escola Latino-Americana de Matem\u00e1tica (ELAM). However, in the period, Lyra lost one of his sons. Eduardo Lacerda de Lyra died in 1971, 12 years-old, in an accident at the beach.[1][3]/nIn his final year, Lyra passed the exam for becoming a professor, wrote and turned in his Memorial to become an adjunct professor of the IME. Curiously, Carlos had the habit of telling his friends that he would die early and, according to Jorge and Sylvia, the men in their family lived relatively short lives, this be confirmed with his own early death.[1][3]/nOn the 21st of July 1974, 46 years-old, Carlos Benjamin de Lyra died. After feeling ill, he was hospitalized for four days and diagnosed with having a brain tumour. According to Leda, Carlos returned home on the condition that he would return to the hospital in three days. This period at home gave him sufficient time to finish an article he was in the process of writing and nothing more.[1][3][4]/nHis thesis for becoming a professor was revised and submitted postmortem for publishing by his friend Peter Hilton who also brought with him the article that Lyra left in his office to England to be published under the title \"SHM-maps of CW-groups\".[1][3]/nLyra was described as a socialist intellectual and, between the years of 1950 and 1955, was a member of the Partido Socialista Brasileiro, having such colleagues as Paul Singer, Febus Gikovate, among others. One of the reasons for not pursuing US citizenship was because of his critical views of the country.[2]/nHe was also an acting member of the Commiss\u00e3o de Elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do Livro Branco, on the outcomes of the event that occurred in the Maria Ant\u00f4nia street of S\u00e3o Paulo, acting as a rapporteur.

Petrie commented: How about we put four squares around one corner? In practice, they would lie on a plane, forming a pattern of squares covering the plane. He called this arrangement a \"tesserohedron\", reaching the similar structure of triangles a \"trigonohedron.\"/nIn 1926, Petrie told Coxeter that he had discovered two new regular polyhedra, infinite but free of \"false vertices\" (points distinct from the vertices, where three or more faces meet, like those that characterize regular star polyhedra): one consisting of squares, six at each vertex and another consisting of hexagons, four at each vertex, which form a dual or reciprocal pair. To the common objection that there is no room for more than four squares around a vertex, he revealed the trick: allow the faces to be arranged up and down, marking a zigzag. When Coxeter understood this, he mentioned a third possibility: hexagons, six around a vertex, its dual./nCoxeter suggested a modified Schl\u00e4fli symbol, {l, m | n} for these figures, with the emblem {l, m} implying the vertex figure, m l-gons around a vertex and n-gonal holes. Then it occurred to them that, although the new polyhedra are infinite, they could find analogous finite polyhedra by delving into the fourth dimension. Petrie cited one consisting of n2 squares, four at each vertex. They called these figures \"regular skew polyhedra\". Later, Coxeter would delve deeper into the subject./nBecause his father belonged to University College London, Petrie enrolled in this institution, where he successfully completed his studies. When the Second World War broke out, he enlisted as an officer and was captured as a prisoner by the Germans, organizing a choir during his captivity. After the war ended and he was released, he went to Darlington Hall, a school in southwest England. He worked many years as a schoolteacher. He was one of the tutors who attended to the children doing poorly in school./nPetrie continued to correspond with Coxeter and was the first to notice that, among the edges of a regular polyhedron, a skew polygon forming a zigzag can be distinguished, in which the first and second are the edges of one face, the second and third are the edges of another face and so on, successively. This zigzag is known as the \"Petrie polygon\" and has many applications. The Petrie polygon of a regular polyhedron can be defined as the skew polygon (whose vertices do not all lie in the same plane) such that every two consecutive sides (but not three) belong to one of the faces of the polyhedron./nEach finite regular polyhedron can be orthogonally projected onto a plane so that the Petrie polygon becomes a regular polygon, with the rest of the projection inside. These polygons and their projected graphs help visualize the symmetrical structure of regular polytopes of higher dimensions, which are difficult to conceive or imagine without this aid./nHis skills as a draftsman are shown in an exquisite set of drawings of the stellated icosahedron, which provides much of the fascination of the much-discussed book he illustrates. On another occasion, to explain the symmetry of the icosahedron, Coxeter showed an orthogonal projection, representing 10 of the 15 great circles as ellipses. The difficult task of drawing was performed by Petrie around 1932. It now prominently features on the cover of a popular recreational mathematics book garnished with a touch of colour. It is reported that, in periods of intense concentration, he could answer questions about complex figures of the fourth dimension by \"visualizing\" them./nPetrie got married and had a daughter. In late 1972, his wife suffered a sudden heart attack and passed away. He missed her so much and was so distracted that one day he walked onto a highway near his home and was hit by a car while trying to cross it running. He died in Surrey, at 64, just two weeks after his wife.[citation needed]", "12151939": "Ivan Ivanovich Zhegalkin (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d \u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0301\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d; 3 August 1869, Mtsensk \u2013 28 March 1947, Moscow) was a Russian and Soviet mathematician.

B. Halsted, was an American mathematician who explored foundations of geometry and introduced non-Euclidean geometry into the United States through his translations of works by Bolyai, Lobachevski, Saccheri, and Poincar\u00e9. He wrote an elementary geometry text, Rational Geometry, based on Hilbert's axioms, which was translated into French, German, and Japanese. Halsted produced original works in synthetic geometry, first with an elementary text in 1896, and with a text on synthetic projective geometry in 1906./nHalsted was a tutor and instructor at Princeton University. He held a mathematical fellowship while a student at Princeton. Halsted was a fourth generation Princeton graduate, earning his bachelor's degree in 1875 and his Master's in 1878. He went on to Johns Hopkins University where he was J. J. Sylvester's first student, receiving his Ph.D. in 1879. After graduation, Halsted served as an instructor in mathematics at Princeton until beginning his post at the University of Texas at Austin in 1884./nFrom 1884 to 1903, Halsted was a member of the University of Texas at Austin Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics, eventually becoming its chair.  He taught mathematicians R. L. Moore and L. E. Dickson, among other students. He explored the foundations of geometry and many alternatives to Euclid's development, culminating with his Rational Geometry. \nIn the interest of hyperbolic geometry in 1891 he translated the work of Nicolai Lobachevsky on theory of parallels.[1] In 1893 in Chicago, Halsted read a paper Some salient points in the history of non-Euclidean and hyper-spaces at the International Mathematical Congress held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition.[2] Halsted frequently contributed to the early American Mathematical Monthly. In one article[3] he championed the role of J. Bolyai in the development of non-Euclidean geometry and criticized C. F. Gauss.[4] See also the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein on 3 September 1912./nIn 1903, Halsted was fired from UT Austin after having published several articles that criticized the university for having passed over R. L. Moore, at that time a young and promising mathematician whom Halsted hoped to have as an assistant, for an instructor post in favor of a well-connected but less qualified candidate with roots in the area.[5] \nHe completed his teaching career at St. John's College, Annapolis; Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio (1903-1906); and the Colorado State Teachers College, Greeley (1906-1914)./nIn 1913 Science Press published three translations by Halsted of popular science works by Henri Poincar\u00e9. In a preface, Poincar\u00e9 paid tribute to Halsted's inter-continental reach: He \"has  already taken the trouble to translate many European treatises and thus powerfully contributed to make the new continent understand the thought of the old.\"[6]/nHalsted was a member of the American Mathematical Society and served as vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  He was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1905.[7]/nIn 1896 Halsted published a chapter on synthetic geometry pertaining to three-dimensional projective geometry in Higher Mathematics distributed by Mansfield Merriman and Robert S. Woodward.[8] In 1906 Synthetic Projective Geometry was published separately in 241 articles and 61 problems. A bibliography referring to Chasles, Steiner, and Clebsch appears on page 24. There are four pages of index, 58 of text, and a lyrical preface: \"Man imprisioned in a little body, with short-arm hands instead of wings, created for his guidance a mole geometry, tactile space, codified by Euclid in his immortal Elements, whose basal principle is congruence, measurement. Yet man is no mole. Infinite feelers radiate from the windows of his soul, whose wings touch the fixed stars. The angel of light in him created for the guidance of eye-life an independent system, a radiant geometry, a visual space, codified in 1847 by a new Euclid, by the Erlangen professor, George von Staudt, in his immortal Geometrie der Lage, published in the quaint and ancient Nurnberg of Albrecht Durer.\"/nBy developing concepts of eject and cut, the text relates abstraction to practice in perspective drawing or a picture plane (page 10). A line is called a straight and includes a figurative point. Halsted uses the approach of a Steiner conic in article 77 for the definition of a conic: \"If two coplanar non-copunctual flat pencils are projective but not perspective, the crosses of correlated straights form a 'range of the second degree' or 'conic range'.\"  The eject of a conic is a cone, while the cut of a cone is a conic./nSince four arbitrary points in a plane have six connectors, there are three more points determined by the crosses of the connectors. Halted calls the original four points dots and the extra three codots. Standard nomenclature refers to the configuration as a complete quadrangle while Halsted says tetrastim. Each codot corresponds to a pair of opposite connectors. Four harmonic points are defined \"if the first and third are codots of a tetrastim while the others are on the connectors of the third codot\" (pages 15, 16)./nFor a given conic C, a point Z has a corresponding straight the polar of Z and Z is the pole of this straight: Through Z draw two secants through C crossing at AD and BC. Consider the tetrastim ABCD, which has Z as a codot. Then the polar of Z is the straight through the other two codots of ABCD (page 25). Continuing with conics, conjugate diameters are straights, each of which is the polar of the figurative point of the other (page 32).", "59567236": "Margaret Gurney (October 28, 1908 \u2013\u00a0March 19, 2002) was an American mathematician, statistician, and computer programmer.

Skolem attended secondary school in Kristiania (later renamed Oslo), passing the university entrance examinations in 1905. He then entered Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet to study mathematics, also taking courses in physics, chemistry, zoology and botany./nIn 1909, he began working as an assistant to the physicist Kristian Birkeland, known for bombarding magnetized spheres with electrons and obtaining aurora-like effects; thus Skolem's first publications were physics papers written jointly with Birkeland. In 1913, Skolem passed the state examinations with distinction, and completed a dissertation titled Investigations on the Algebra of Logic. He also traveled with Birkeland to the Sudan to observe the zodiacal light. He spent the winter semester of 1915 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, at the time the leading research center in mathematical logic, metamathematics, and abstract algebra, fields in which Skolem eventually excelled. In 1916 he was appointed a research fellow at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet. In 1918, he became a Docent in Mathematics and was elected to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters./nSkolem did not at first formally enroll as a Ph.D. candidate, believing that the Ph.D. was unnecessary in Norway. He later changed his mind and submitted a thesis in 1926, titled Some theorems about integral solutions to certain algebraic equations and inequalities. His notional thesis advisor was Axel Thue, even though Thue had died in 1922./nIn 1927, he married Edith Wilhelmine Hasvold./nSkolem continued to teach at Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet (renamed the University of Oslo in 1939) until 1930 when he became a Research Associate in Chr. Michelsen Institute in Bergen. This senior post allowed Skolem to conduct research free of administrative and teaching duties. However, the position also required that he reside in Bergen, a city which then lacked a university and hence had no research library, so that he was unable to keep abreast of the mathematical literature. In 1938, he returned to Oslo to assume the Professorship of Mathematics at the university. There he taught the graduate courses in algebra and number theory, and only occasionally on mathematical logic. Skolem's Ph.D. student \u00d8ystein Ore went on to a career in the USA./nSkolem served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society, and edited the Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift (\"The Norwegian Mathematical Journal\") for many years. He was also the founding editor of Mathematica Scandinavica./nAfter his 1957 retirement, he made several trips to the United States, speaking and teaching at universities there. He remained intellectually active until his sudden and unexpected death./nFor more on Skolem's academic life, see Fenstad (1970)./nSkolem published around 180 papers on Diophantine equations, group theory, lattice theory, and most of all, set theory and mathematical logic. He mostly published in Norwegian journals with limited international circulation, so that his results were occasionally rediscovered by others. An example is the Skolem\u2013Noether theorem, characterizing the automorphisms of simple algebras. Skolem published a proof in 1927, but Emmy Noether independently rediscovered it a few years later./nSkolem was among the first to write on lattices. In 1912, he was the first to describe a free distributive lattice generated by n elements. In 1919, he showed that every implicative lattice (now also called a Skolem lattice) is distributive and, as a partial converse, that every finite distributive lattice is implicative. After these results were rediscovered by others, Skolem published a 1936 paper in German, \"\u00dcber gewisse 'Verb\u00e4nde' oder 'Lattices'\", surveying his earlier work in lattice theory./nSkolem was a pioneer model theorist. In 1920, he greatly simplified the proof of a theorem Leopold L\u00f6wenheim first proved in 1915, resulting in the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem, which states that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model. His 1920 proof employed the axiom of choice, but he later (1922 and 1928) gave proofs using K\u0151nig's lemma in place of that axiom. It is notable that Skolem, like L\u00f6wenheim, wrote on mathematical logic and set theory employing the notation of his fellow pioneering model theorists Charles Sanders Peirce and Ernst Schr\u00f6der, including \u03a0, \u03a3 as variable-binding quantifiers, in contrast to the notations of Peano, Principia Mathematica, and Principles of Mathematical Logic. Skolem (1934) pioneered the construction of non-standard models of arithmetic and set theory./nSkolem (1922) refined Zermelo's axioms for set theory by replacing Zermelo's vague notion of a \"definite\" property with any property that can be coded in first-order logic. The resulting axiom is now part of the standard axioms of set theory. Skolem also pointed out that a consequence of the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is what is now known as Skolem's paradox: If Zermelo's axioms are consistent, then they must be satisfiable within a countable domain, even though they prove the existence of uncountable sets./nThe completeness of first-order logic is a corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann's Principles of Mathematical Logic clearly articulated it. In any event, Kurt G\u00f6del first proved this completeness in 1930./nSkolem distrusted the completed infinite and was one of the founders of finitism in mathematics. Skolem (1923) sets out his primitive recursive arithmetic, a very early contribution to the theory of computable functions, as a means of avoiding the so-called paradoxes of the infinite. Here he developed the arithmetic of the natural numbers by first defining objects by primitive recursion, then devising another system to prove properties of the objects defined by the first system. These two systems enabled him to define prime numbers and to set out a considerable amount of number theory. If the first of these systems can be considered as a programming language for defining objects, and the second as a programming logic for proving properties about the objects, Skolem can be seen as an unwitting pioneer of theoretical computer science./nIn 1929, Presburger proved that Peano arithmetic without multiplication was consistent, complete, and decidable. The following year, Skolem proved that the same was true of Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named Skolem arithmetic in his honor. G\u00f6del's famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is incompletable and hence a posteriori undecidable./nHao Wang praised Skolem's work as follows:/nSkolem tends to treat general problems by concrete examples. He often seemed to present proofs in the same order as he came to discover them. This results in a fresh informality as well as a certain inconclusiveness. Many of his papers strike one as progress reports. Yet his ideas are often pregnant and potentially capable of wide application. He was very much a 'free spirit': he did not belong to any school, he did not found a school of his own, he did not usually make heavy use of known results... he was very much an innovator and most of his papers can be read and understood by those without much specialized knowledge. It seems quite likely that if he were young today, logic... would not have appealed to him.

Instead, she returned to Harris Teachers College and began focusing on mathematics education instead of mathematical research.[2][4] During this time she also became active in the Missouri Section of the Mathematical Association of America.[2]/nIn 1954 she started her work as mathematical problems editor for School Science and Mathematics, a position she held until 1976 despite a colleague undercutting her in the early 1960s by suggesting to the journal's editor-in-chief that she was too old for the position.[2][9]/nShe moved in 1956 to San Diego State University,[2][1] and retired as a professor emeritus in 1976.[1] She died on December 29, 2003.[2][1]/nWillerding wrote over 30 mathematical textbooks.[2] They include:", "27791": "Marie-Sophie Germain (French: [ma\u0281i s\u0254fi \u0292\u025b\u0281m\u025b\u0303]; 1 April 1776 \u2013 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father's library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after.[1] Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life.[2] Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred.[3] On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\u2019 school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour./nMarie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on April 1, 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois, was a wealthy silk merchant,[4][5][6] though some believe he was a goldsmith.[7] In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the \u00c9tats-G\u00e9n\u00e9raux, which he saw change into the Constitutional Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-Fran\u00e7ois became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.[7]/nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, Ang\u00e9lique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain's nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline's son, published some of Germain's work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).[5]/nWhen Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father's library. Here she found J. E. Montucla's L'Histoire des Math\u00e9matiques, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.[5]/nGermain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics,[5] could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study.[8] So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Trait\u00e9 d'Arithm\u00e9tique by \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout and Le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.[9]/nGermain's parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics.[10] After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.[9]/nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the \u00c9cole Polytechnique opened.[6] As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\".[9] The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\".[11] Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc,[9][12] \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".[13]  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman,[9] and he became her mentor.[6]/nGermain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published Essai sur la th\u00e9orie des nombres.[14] After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain's work in the Suppl\u00e9ment to his second edition of the Th\u00e9orie des Nombres, where he calls it tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse (\"very ingenious\"). See also Her work on Fermat's Last Theorem below.[15]/nGermain's interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.[14] After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems,[16] she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc,[9] to the author himself, who was one year younger than she.[17] The first letter, dated 21 November 1804,[18] discussed Gauss' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain's work on Fermat's Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n\u00a0=\u00a0p\u00a0\u2212\u00a01, where p is a prime number of the form p\u00a0=\u00a08k\u00a0+\u00a07.[19] However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.[20]/nAround 1807 (sources differ),[21] during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety\u00a0[fr]), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss' safety. [9] General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe.[21] As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie's name.[21]/nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.[13]  He replied:[22]/nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M.\u00a0Le\u00a0Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory's] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius./nGauss' letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere.[21][23] In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nn\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{n}+y^{n}}\n\n is of the form \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n+\nn\n\nf\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h^{2}+nf^{2}}\n\n, then \n\n\n\nx\n+\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x+y}\n\n is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: \n\n\n\n\n15\n\n11\n\n\n+\n\n8\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 15^{11}+8^{11}}\n\n can be written as \n\n\n\n\nh\n\n2\n\n\n+\n11\n\nf\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle h^{2}+11f^{2}}\n\n, but \n\n\n\n15\n+\n8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 15+8}\n\n cannot.[19][24]/nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work.[20] Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased.[20] Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.[25]/nWhen Germain's correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni's experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the Academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange's comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the Academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant,[26] and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.[27]/nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research.[28] She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\".[26] Lagrange was able to use Germain's work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".[18]/nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help.[26] Germain's anonymous[18] 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals,[27] and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\".[26] The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson.[18] In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain's help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the Academy commission, had had access to her work).[27]/nGermain submitted her third paper, \"Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des surfaces \u00e9lastiques\",[18] under her own name, and on 8 January 1816[27] she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences.[29] She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award.[18] Although Germain had at last been awarded the prix extraordinaire,[20] the Academy was still not fully satisfied.[30] Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff\u2013Love equation),[31] but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler,[18] which led to incorrect boundary conditions.[31] Here is Germain's final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:/nwhere N2 is a constant.[18][32][33]/nAfter winning the Academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the Academy's tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the Academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.[28]/nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.[18]/nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the Academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the Academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.[34]/nOne further work of Germain's on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"M\u00e9moire sur la courbure des surfaces\". She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).[18]/nGermain's best work was in number theory,[4] and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat's Last Theorem.[15] In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the Academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.[35] It reawakened Germain's interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.[14]/nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity.[35] She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case.[36] Germain's letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.[37]/nFermat's Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers p that do not divide any of x, y, or z. Case 2 includes all p that divide at least one of x, y, or z. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"Sophie Germain's theorem\":[38]/nLet p be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime P\u00a0=\u00a02Np\u00a0+\u00a01 (N is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:/nThen the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds true for p.[39]/nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes p\u00a0<\u00a0100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent p\u00a0<\u00a0197\".[39] L. E. Dickson later used Germain's theorem to prove the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.[40]/nIn an unpublished manuscript titled Remarque sur l'impossibilit\u00e9 de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l'\u00e9quation xp\u00a0+\u00a0yp\u00a0=\u00a0zp,[38] Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat's theorem for p\u00a0>\u00a05 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\",[41] around 40 digits long.[42]  Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre's treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for p\u00a0=\u00a05 (see Correspondence with Legendre).[41]  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later.[1] Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\",[1] but ultimately her method did not work.[41]/nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology.[9] She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.[43]/nTwo of her philosophical works, Pens\u00e9es diverses and Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur l'\u00e9tat des sciences et des lettres, aux diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques de leur culture, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.[44] Pens\u00e9es is a history of science and mathematics with Germain's commentary.[45] In Consid\u00e9rations, the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the humanities.[46]/nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain,[47] she continued to work. In 1831 Crelle's Journal published her paper on the curvature of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding y and z in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n(\n\nx\n\np\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n)\n\n\nx\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n=\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\u00b1\np\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {4(x^{p}-1)}{x-1}}=y^{2}\\pm pz^{2}}\n\n\".[18] Mary Gray records: \"She also published in Annales de chimie et de physique an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\"[18] On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.[25]/nDespite Germain's intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"renti\u00e8re \u2013 annuitant\"[48] (property holder),[49] not a \"math\u00e9maticienne\".[48] But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1837\u2014six years after Germain's death\u2014Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".[50]/nGermain's resting place in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone.[25][7]  At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.[7]/nIn January 2020, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a \u00d1uSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Sophie Germain.[51]/nE. Dubouis defined a sophien of a prime n to be a prime \u03b8 where \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a0kn\u00a0+\u00a01, for such n that yield \u03b8 such that xn\u00a0=\u00a0yn\u00a0+\u00a01 (mod \u03b8) has no solutions when x and y are prime to n.[52]/nA Sophie Germain prime is a prime p such that 2p\u00a0+\u00a01 is also prime.[39]/nThe Germain curvature (also called mean curvature) is \n\n\n\n(\n\nk\n\n1\n\n\n+\n\nk\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (k_{1}+k_{2})/2}\n\n,[50] where k1 and k2 are the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature.[18]/nSophie Germain's identity states that for any {x, y},/nVesna Petrovich found that the educated world's response to the publication in 1821 of Germain's prize-winning essay \"ranged from polite to indifferent\".[29] Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\".[25] Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans' book \"Woman in Science\",[53] although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\".[54] Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".[48]/nGermain's contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss)./nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain's work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\"[55] Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"[56]/nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain's theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain's work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\"[27] Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain's name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower's construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"[48]/nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the Disquisitiones, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\"[15] Gray adds on to say \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\"[49] Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain's creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\",[46] and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches.[29] Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain's biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"[28]/nGermain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn's 2001 play Proof. The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden's film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal)./nIn the fictional work \"The Last Theorem\" by Arthur C.

A particular trick he employed was to turn theorems into games\u2014for instance, students would try to add red edges to a graph on six vertices in order to create a red triangle, while another group of students tried to add edges to create a blue triangle (and each edge of the graph had to be either blue or red).  Because of the theorem on friends and strangers, one team or the other would have to win./nFrank Harary was born in New York City, the oldest child to a family of Jewish immigrants from Syria and Russia. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Brooklyn College in 1941 and 1945 respectively[2] and his Ph.D., with supervisor Alfred L. Foster, from University of California, Berkeley in 1948./nPrior to his teaching career he became a research assistant in the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan./nHarary's first publication, \"Atomic Boolean-like rings with finite radical\", went through much effort to be put into the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1950.  This article was first submitted to the American Mathematical Society in November 1948, then sent to the Duke Mathematical Journal where it was revised three times before it was finally published two years after its initial submission.[citation needed] Harary began his teaching career at the University of Michigan in 1953 where he was first an assistant professor, then in 1959 associate professor and in 1964 was appointed as a professor of mathematics, a position he held until 1986./nFrom 1987 he was Professor (and Distinguished Professor Emeritus) in the Computer Science Department at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces. He was one of the founders of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory and the Journal of Graph Theory.[1]/nIn 1949 Harary published On the algebraic structure of knots. Shortly after this publication in 1953 Harary published his first book (jointly with George Uhlenbeck) On the number of Husimi trees. It was following this text that he began to build up a worldwide reputation for his work in graph theory. In 1965 his first book Structural models: An introduction to the theory of directed graphs was published, and for the rest of his life his interest would be in the field of graph theory./nWhile beginning his work in graph theory around 1965, Harary began buying property in Ann Arbor, and subdividing the houses he bought into apartments. This led to criticism for poor maintenance, \"scores of building code violations\", and six condemnations of buildings he owned. In a 1969 newspaper article, Harary was quoted as stating \"We just wanted these properties for the land value ... we wanted to move the tenants out\", while his wife Jayne stated \"We've wanted to help poor blacks find better housing, but we've taken the rap again and again.\"[3][4] Harary and his wife Jayne had six children together, Miriam, Natalie, Judith, Thomas, Joel and Chaya./nFrom 1973 to 2007 Harary jointly wrote five more books, each in the field of graph theory.  In the time before his death, Harary traveled the world researching and publishing over 800 papers (with some 300 different co-authors),  in mathematical journals and other scientific publications, more than any mathematician other than Paul Erdos.  Harary recorded that he lectured in 166 different cities around the United States and some 274 cities in over 80 different countries.  Harary was particularly proud that he had given lectures in cities around the world beginning with every letter of the alphabet, even including \"X\" when he traveled to Xanten, Germany. Harary also played a curious role in the award-winning film Good Will Hunting. The film displayed formulas he had published on the enumeration of trees, which were supposed to be fiendishly difficult.[5]/nIt was in 1986 at the age of 65 that Harary retired from his professorship at the University of Michigan.  Harary did not take his retirement lightly however; following his retirement Harary was appointed as a Distinguished Professor of Computer Sciences at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.  He held this position until his death in 2005.  The same year as his retirement Harary was made an honorary fellow of the National Academy of Sciences of India; he also served as an editor for about 20 different journals focusing primarily on graph theory and combinatorial theory.  It was following his retirement that Harary was elected as an honorary lifetime member of the Calcutta Mathematical Society and of the South African Mathematical Society./nHe died at Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces, New Mexico.[6] At the time of his death in Las Cruces other members of the department of Computer Science felt the loss for the great mind that once worked beside them.  The head of the department of Computer Science at the time of Harary's death Desh Ranjan had this to say, \"Dr. Harary was a true scholar with a genuine love for graph theory which was an endless source of new discoveries, beauty, curiosity, surprises and joy for him till the very end of his life.\"/nHarary's work in graph theory was diverse.  Some topics of great interest to him were:/nAmong over 700 scholarly articles Harary wrote, two were co-authored with Paul Erd\u0151s, giving Harary an Erd\u0151s number of 1.[12]  He lectured extensively and kept alphabetical lists of the cities where he spoke./nHarary's most famous classic book Graph Theory was published in 1969 and offered a practical introduction to the field of graph theory.  It is evident that Harary's focus in this book and amongst his other publications was towards the varied and diverse application of graph theory to other fields of mathematics, physics and many others.  Taken from the preface of Graph Theory, Harary notes .../n\"...there are applications of graph theory to some areas of physics, chemistry, communication science, computer technology, electrical and civil engineering, architecture, operational research, genetics, psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, and linguistics.\"[13]/nHarary quickly began promoting inquiry based learning through his texts, apparent by his reference to the tradition of the Moore method.  Harary made many unique contributions to graph theory as he explored more and more different fields of study and successfully attempted to relate them to graph theory.  Harary's classic book Graph Theory begins by providing the reader with much of the requisite knowledge of basic graphs and then dives right into proving the diversity of content that is held within graph theory.  Some of the other mathematical fields that Harary directly relates to graph theory in his book begin to appear around chapter 13, these topics include linear algebra, and abstract algebra./nHarary also made an influential contribution in the theory of social learning used in sociology and behavioral economics, deriving a criterion for consensus in John R. P. French's model of social power.[14] This anticipated by several decades, albeit in a special case, the widely used DeGroot learning model./nOne motivation for the study of graph theory is its application to sociograms described by Jacob L. Moreno. For instance the adjacency matrix of a sociogram was used by Leon Festinger.[15] Festinger identified the graph theory clique with the social clique and examined the diagonal of the cube of a groups\u2019 adjacency matrix to detect cliques. Harary joined with Ian Ross to improve on Festinger's clique detection.[16]/nThe admission of powers of an adjacency matrix led Harary and Ross to note that a complete graph can be obtained from the square of an adjacency matrix of a tree. Relying on their study of clique detection, they described a class of graphs for which the adjacency matrix is the square of the adjacency matrix of a tree.[17]/nOnce we have the tree in question we can create an adjacency matrix for the tree T and check that it is indeed the tree which we sought.  Squaring the adjacency matrix of T should yield an adjacency matrix for a graph which is isomorphic to the graph G which we started with.  Probably the simplest way to observe this theorem in action is to observe the case which Harary mentions in The Square of a Tree. Specifically the example in question describes the tree corresponding the graph of K5/n\"Consider the tree consisting of one point joined with all the others.  When the tree is squared, the result is the complete graph.  We wish to illustrate... T2\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n{\\displaystyle =}\n\nK5\"/nUpon squaring the adjacency matrix of the previously mentioned tree, we can observe that the theorem does in fact hold true.  We can also observe that this pattern of setting up a tree where \"one point joined with all the others\" will always indeed yield the correct tree for all complete graphs.", "66153621": "Joseph Parsi (fl.\u2009late 15th century) was a Jewish mathematician. All that is known of him is that he was the author of an unpublished work entitled Keli Faz, a manual showing how to construct mathematical instruments. Steinschneider argues that Parsi may be identical with Joseph the physician, cosmographer, and astronomer of Lisbon, who in 1480 advised King John of Portugal to employ the astrolabe at sea, and who was a member of the commission to which the project of Columbus was submitted for examination.[1] The name \"Parsi\", however, indicates that the author of the Keli Faz was a Persian./nThis article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Singer, Isidore; Seligsohn, M.

He had the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation.[7]/nBerezovsky made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, when the country implemented privatization of state property.[8] He profited from gaining control over assets, including the country's main television channel, Channel One. In 1997, Forbes estimated Berezovsky's wealth at US$3\u00a0billion.[9] Berezovsky helped fund Unity, the political party that would form Vladimir Putin's first parliamentary base,[10] and was elected to the Duma in the 1999 Russian legislative election.[11] However, following the Russian presidential election in March 2000, Berezovsky went into opposition and resigned from the Duma.[12] Berezovsky would remain a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life.[13]/nIn late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK, which granted him political asylum in 2003.[14] After he moved to Britain, the Russian government took over his television assets,[15] and he divested from other Russian holdings. In Russia, Berezovsky was later convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement. The first charges had been brought during Primakov's government in 1999.[16] Despite an Interpol Red Notice for Berezovsky's arrest, Russia repeatedly failed to obtain the extradition of Berezovsky from Britain; the situation became a major point of diplomatic tension between the two countries.[17][18][19]/nIn 2012, Berezovsky lost a London High Court case he brought over the ownership of the major oil producer Sibneft, against Roman Abramovich, in which he sought over \u00a33 billion in damages.[20] The court concluded that Berezovsky had never been a co-owner of Sibneft.[21]/nBerezovsky was found dead in his home, Titness Park, at Sunninghill, near Ascot in Berkshire, on 23 March 2013.[22] A post-mortem examination found that his death was consistent with hanging and that there were no signs of a violent struggle.[23] However, the coroner at the inquest into Berezovsky's death later recorded an open verdict.[24]/nBoris Abramovich Berezovsky was born in 1946, in Moscow, to Abram Markovich Berezovsky (1911\u20131979),[25] a Jewish civil engineer in construction works,[26][27] and his wife, Anna Aleksandrovna Gelman (22 November 1923 \u2013 3 September 2013).[28] He studied applied mathematics, receiving his doctorate in 1983.[29] After graduating from the Moscow Forestry Engineering Institute in 1968, Berezovsky worked as an engineer from 1969 until 1987, serving as assistant research officer, research officer and finally the head of a department in the Institute of Control Sciences of the USSR Academy of Sciences.[30] Berezovsky researched optimization and control theory, publishing 16 books and articles between 1975 and 1989./nAlexander Khinshtein (State Duma deputy, member of the United Russia faction) claimed that in 1979 Boris Berezovsky was detained by the OBKhSS authorities in Makhachkala (Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) for profiteering.[31] In Khinshtein's opinion, Berezovsky has been a KGB officer since 1979.[32]/nIn 1989, Berezovsky took advantage of the opportunities presented by perestroika to found LogoVAZ with Badri Patarkatsishvili and senior managers from Russian automobile manufacturer AvtoVAZ. LogoVAZ developed software for AvtoVAZ, sold Soviet-made cars and serviced foreign cars.[33] The dealership profited from hyperinflation by taking cars on consignment and paying the producer at a later date when the money lost much of its value.[34]/nOne of Berezovsky's early endeavors was All-Russia Automobile Alliance (AVVA), a venture fund he formed in 1993 with Alexander Voloshin (Boris Yeltsin's future Chief of Staff) and AvtoVAZ Chairman Vladimir Kadannikov.[34] Berezovsky controlled about 30% of the company, which raised nearly US$50\u00a0million from small investors through a bonded loan to build a plant producing a \"people's car\". The project did not collect sufficient funds for the plant and the funds were instead invested into AvtoVAZ production, while the debt to investors was swapped for equity.[35][36] By 2000, AVVA held about one-third of AvtoVAZ.[37]/nIn 1994, Berezovsky was the target of a car bombing incident, but survived the assassination attempt, in which his driver was killed and he himself was injured.[38] Alexander Litvinenko led the FSB investigation into the incident and linked the crime to the resistance of the Soviet-era AvtoVaz management to Berezovsky's growing influence in the Russian automobile market.[39]/nBerezovsky's involvement in the Russian media began in December 1994, when he gained control over ORT Television (see Channel One (Russia)) to replace the failing Soviet TV Channel 1.   He appointed the popular anchorman and producer Vladislav Listyev as CEO of ORT. Three months later Listyev was assassinated amid a fierce struggle for control of advertising sales.[40][41] Berezovsky was questioned in the police investigation, among many others, but the killers were never found. [42]/nUnder Berezovsky's stewardship, ORT became a major asset of the reformist camp as they prepared to face Communists and nationalists in the upcoming presidential elections.[43]/nFrom 1995 to 1997, through the controversial loans-for-shares privatisation auctions,[44][45] Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili assisted Roman Abramovich in acquiring control of Sibneft, the sixth-largest Russian oil company, which constituted the bulk of his wealth.[46][47] In an article in The Washington Post in 2000, Berezovsky revealed that financier George Soros declined an invitation to participate in the acquisition.[48]/nIn 1995, he played a key role in a management reshuffle at Aeroflot and participated in its corporatization,[33] with his close associate Nikolai Glushkov becoming Aeroflot's CFO. In January 1998, it was announced that Sibneft would merge with Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos to create the third-largest oil company in the world.[49] The merger was abandoned five months later amid falling oil prices.[50]/nBerezovsky entered the Kremlin's inner circle in 1993 through arranging for the publication of Yeltsin's memoirs and befriended Valentin Yumashev, the President's ghost-writer.[51][52][53]/nIn January 1996, at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Berezovsky liaised with fellow oligarchs to form an alliance \u2013 which later became known as the \"Davos Pact\"[54] \u2013 to bankroll Boris Yeltsin's campaign in the upcoming presidential elections.[55] On his return to Moscow, Berezovsky met and befriended Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter,[53] According to a later profile by The Guardian, \"Berezovsky masterminded the 1996 re-election of Boris Yeltsin... He and his billionaire friends coughed up \u00a3140\u00a0million for Yeltsin's campaign\".[56]/nIn the summer of 1996, Berezovsky had emerged as a key advisor to Yeltsin, allied with Anatoly Chubais, opposing a group of hardliners led by General Alexander Korzhakov.[57] One night in June, in the drawing room of Club Logovaz, Berezovsky, Chubais and others plotted the ouster of Korzhakov and other hardliners.[53] On 20 June 1996, Yeltsin fired Korzhakov and two other hawks, leaving the reformers' team in full control of the Kremlin.[58] Firing them was controversial though, as Korzhakov a few days before caught two of Yeltsin's campaign organizers carrying US$500,000 cash without invoices out of the presidential administration building.[59]/nOn 16 June 1996, Yeltsin came first in the first round of elections after forging a tactical alliance with Gen. Alexander Lebed, who finished third. On 3 July, in the runoff vote, he beat the Communist Gennady Zyuganov. His victory was due largely to the support of the TV networks controlled by Gusinsky and Berezovsky (NTV and ORT) and the money from the business elite.[60] The New York Times called Berezovsky the \"public spokesman and chief lobbyist for this new elite, which moved from the shadows to respectability in a few short years\".[53]/nOn 17 October 1996, Yeltsin dismissed General Alexander Lebed from the position of National Security Advisor amid allegations that he was plotting a coup and secretly mustering a private army.[61] Lebed promptly accused Berezovsky and Gusinsky of engineering his ouster, and formed a coalition with the disgraced General Alexander Korzhakov.[62] The dismissal of Lebed, the architect of the Khasavyurt peace accord, left Yeltsin's Chechen policy in limbo. On 30 October 1996, in a political bombshell, Yeltsin named Ivan Rybkin as his new National Security Advisor and appointed Berezovsky Deputy Secretary in charge of Chechnya[63] with a mandate to oversee the implementation of the Khasavyurt Accord: that is, the withdrawal of Russian forces, the negotiation of a peace treaty, and the preparation of a general election. On 19 December 1996, Berezovsky made headlines by negotiating the release of 21 Russian policeman held hostage by the warlord Salman Raduev amid efforts by radicals from both sides to torpedo peace negotiations.[64]/nOn 12 May 1997, Yeltsin and Maskhadov signed the Russian\u2013Chechen Peace Treaty in the Kremlin. Speaking at a press conference in Moscow, Berezovsky outlined his priorities for the economic reconstruction of Chechnya, particularly the construction of a pipeline for transporting Azerbaijani oil. He called upon the Russian business community to contribute to the rebuilding of the republic, revealing his own donation of US$1\u00a0million (some sources mention US$2\u00a0million) for a cement factory in Grozny.[65] This payment would come to haunt him years later, when he was accused of funding Chechen terrorists.[66]/nAfter his dismissal from the Security Council, Berezovsky vowed to continue his activities in Chechnya as a private individual[67] and maintained contact with Chechen warlords. He was instrumental in the release of 69 hostages, including two Britons, Jon James and Camilla Carr, whom he flew in his private jet to RAF Brize Norton in September 1998.[68][69] In an interview with Thomas de Waal in 2005, he revealed the involvement of the British Ambassador to Russia, Sir Andrew Wood, and explained that his former negotiations counterpart, the Islamic militant leader Movladi Udugov, helped arrange the Britons' release.[70]/nBerezovsky had a phone conversation with Movladi Udugov in the spring of 1999, six months before the beginning of fighting in Dagestan. A transcript of that conversation was leaked to a Moscow tabloid on 10 September 1999 and appeared to mention the would-be militants' invasion. It has been the subject of much speculation ever since. As Berezovsky explained later in interviews to de Waal[70] and Goldfarb,[39] Udugov proposed to coordinate the Islamists' incursion into Dagestan, so that a limited Russian response would topple the Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov and establish a new Islamic republic, which would be anti-American but friendly to Russia. Berezovsky said that he disliked the idea but reported Udugov's overture to prime-minister Stepashin. \"Udugov and Basayev,\" he asserted, \"conspired with Stepashin and Putin to provoke a war to topple Maskhadov ... but the agreement was for the Russian army to stop at the Terek River. However, Putin double-crossed the Chechens and started an all-out war.\"[39]/nIn March 1997, Berezovsky and Tatyana Dyachenko flew to Nizhniy Novgorod to persuade the city's governor, Boris Nemtsov, to join Chubais' economic team,[53] which became known as the government of Young Reformers. This was the last concerted political action of the \"Davos Pact\" (see above). Four months later the group split into two cliques fiercely competing for Yeltsin's favour.[71] The clash was precipitated by the privatization auction of the communication utility Svyazinvest, in which Onexim bank of Chubais' loyalist Vladimir Potanin, backed by George Soros, competed with Gusinsky, allied with Spanish Telef\u00f3nica. An initially commercial dispute swiftly developed into a contest of political wills between Chubais and Berezovsky.[71]/nPotanin's victory unleashed a bitter media war, in which ORT and NTV accused the Chubais group of fixing the auction in favor of Potanin, whereas Chubais charged Berezovsky with abusing his government position to advance his business interests.[72] Both sides appealed to Yeltsin, who had proclaimed a new era of \"fair\" privatization \"based on strict legislative rules and allowing no deviations\".[73] In the end, both sides lost. Berezovsky's media revealed a corrupt scheme whereby a publishing house owned by Onexim Bank paid Chubais and his group hefty advances for a book that was never written. The scandal led to a purge of Chubais' loyalists from the government.[74] Chubais retaliated by persuading Yeltsin to dismiss Boris Berezovsky from the national security council. Berezovsky's service on the Security Council ended on 5 November 1997.[75] Soros called the Berezovsky-Chubais clash a \"historical event, in the reality of which I would have never believed, if I had not watched it myself. I saw a fight of the people in the boat floating towards the edge of a waterfall\". He argued that the reformist camp never recovered from the wounds sustained in this struggle, setting the political stage for conservative nationalists, and eventually Vladimir Putin.[72]/nIn 1991, Berezovsky founded the \"Triumph\" award, bestowed upon outstanding Russian poets, musicians, artists, directors and ballet dancers.[76]/nIt is reported in the documentary series Captive that Boris Berezovsky, in 1998, was effective in the release of two English aid workers who had been held hostage for ransom in Chechnya for 14 months/nIn the spring of 1998, Berezovsky made an unexpected political comeback, starting with his appointment, in April 1998, to the position of executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[77] He emerged in the centre of a new informal power group \u2013 the \"Family\", a close-knit circle of advisers around Yeltsin, which included Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana and his chief of staff, Yumashev. It was rumoured that no important government appointment could happen without the Family's support.[78] By 1999, the Family also included two of Berezovsky's associates, his former AVVA partner Alexander Voloshin, who replaced Yumashev as Yeltsin's chief of staff, and Roman Abramovich.[79]/nThe principal concern of the Family was finding an \"electable\" successor to Yeltsin to counter the presidential aspirations of the then\u2013prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, who was leaning to more statist positions. Political battles between the Family and Primakov's camp dominated the two last years of Yeltsin's presidency.[80]/nIn November 1998, in a televised press conference, five officers of the FSB, led by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Litvinenko, revealed an alleged plot by their superiors to assassinate Berezovsky.[81]/nIn April 1999, Russia's Prosecutor General, Yury Skuratov, opened an investigation into embezzlement at Aeroflot and issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky, who called the investigation politically motivated and orchestrated by Primakov.[82] Nikolai Glushkov, Aeroflot's former General Director, later revealed that conflict with Primakov arose from the irritation that Berezovsky's management team caused in the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, which Primakov headed before becoming prime minister, over firing of thousands of spies, who used Aeroflot as a front organization in Soviet times.[83][84][85] The arrest warrant was dropped a week later, after Berezovsky submitted to questioning by the prosecutors. No charges were brought.[86] Yeltsin sacked Primakov's government shortly thereafter and replaced him with Sergey Stepashin as new prime-minister.[87]/nVyacheslav Aminov (Russian: \u0412\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0410\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432) supported Berezovsky and headed Berezovsky's security service.[88]/nVladimir Putin's meteoric rise from relative obscurity to the Russian presidency in the course of a few short months of 1999 has been attributed to his intimacy with the \"Family\" as a protege of Berezovsky and Yumashev. By the end of 1999, the Family had persuaded Yeltsin to name Putin his political successor and candidate for the presidency.[89][90]/nBerezovsky's acquaintance with Putin dated back to the early 1990s, when the latter, as Deputy Mayor of St. Petersburg, helped Logovaz establish a car dealership.[91] They enjoyed friendly relations; on occasion, Berezovsky took Putin skiing with him in Switzerland.[89]/nIn February 1999, when Berezovsky's political standing looked uncertain because of his clash with Primakov over Aeroflot, Putin, then Director of the FSB, made a bold gesture of friendship by showing up at a birthday party for Berezovsky's wife. \"I absolutely do not care what Primakov thinks of me\", Putin told Berezovsky on that night. That was the beginning of their political alliance.[91] According to the Times, Spanish police discovered that on up to five occasions in 1999, Putin had secretly visited a villa in Spain belonging to Berezovsky.[92]/nIn mid-July 1999, the Family dispatched Berezovsky to Biarritz, where Putin was vacationing, to persuade him to accept the position of prime minister and the role of heir apparent.[91][93] On 9 August, Yeltsin sacked the government of Sergei Stepashin and appointed Putin prime minister, amid reports that Berezovsky had masterminded the reshuffle.[94]/nPutin's principal opponents were the former Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov and the Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, backed by the Fatherland-All Russia alliance. To counter this group in the Duma elections of 1999, Berezovsky was instrumental in the creation, within the space of a few months, of the Unity party, with no ideology other than its support for Putin.[95][96] Later, he disclosed that the source of Unity's funding, with Putin's knowledge and consent, was Aeroflot.[97] In the 1999 election, Berezovsky campaigned as a Putin loyalist and won a seat in the Duma, representing the North Caucasian republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia.[96]/nDuring the Duma election campaign Berezovsky's ORT TV served as an extremely effective propaganda machine for the Putin camp, using aggressive attack reporting and programming to denigrate and ridicule Putin's rivals, Primakov and Luzhkov, tactics strongly criticized as undue interference with the media.[98] But Unity got a surprisingly high score in the elections, paving the way for Putin's election victory in spring 2000.[80]/nBerezovsky's disagreements with Putin became public three weeks into Putin's presidency. On 8 May 2000, Berezovsky and Abramovich were spotted together at Putin's invitation-only inauguration ball in Moscow.[99] However, on 31 May, Berezovsky sharply attacked the constitutional reform proposed by the president, which would give the Kremlin the right to dismiss elected governors.[100] On 17 July 2000, Berezovsky resigned from the Duma, saying he \"did not want to be involved in the country's ruin and the restoration of an authoritarian regime\".[101] In August, Berezovsky's media attacked Putin for the way he handled the sinking of the Kursk submarine, blaming the death of 118 sailors on the Kremlin's reluctance to accept foreign help.[102] In September, Berezovsky alleged that the Kremlin had attempted to expropriate his shares in ORT and announced that he would put his stake into a trust to be controlled by prominent intellectuals.[103]/nIn an article in The Washington Post in 2000, Berezovsky argued that in the absence of a strong civil society and middle class it may sometimes be necessary for capitalists \"to interfere directly in the political process\" of Russia as a counterweight to ex-Communists \"who hate democracy and dream of regaining lost positions.\"[104] Berezovsky took legal action against the journalist Paul Klebnikov, who accused him of various crimes. In October, in an interview in Le Figaro, Putin announced that he would no longer tolerate criticism of the government by media controlled by the oligarchs. \"If necessary we will destroy those instruments that allow this blackmail\", he declared.[105] Responding to a question about Berezovsky, he warned that he had a \"cudgel\" in store for him. \"The state has a cudgel in its hands that you use to hit just once, but on the head. We haven't used this cudgel yet. We've just brandished it... [But] the day we get really angry, we won't hesitate to use it.\"[105]/nIn the same month, Russian prosecutors revived the Aeroflot fraud investigation and Berezovsky was questioned as a witness.[106] On 7 November 2000, Berezovsky, who was travelling abroad, failed to appear for further questioning and announced that he would not return to Russia because of what he described as \"constantly intensifying pressure on me by the authorities and President Putin personally. Essentially,\" he said, \"I'm being forced to choose whether to become a political prisoner or a political emigrant.\" Berezovsky claimed that Putin had made him a suspect in the Aeroflot case simply because ORT had \"spoken the truth\" about the sinking of the submarine Kursk.[107] In early December, his associate Nikolai Glushkov was arrested in Moscow and Berezovsky dropped the proposal to put ORT stake in trust.[108]/nIn 2001, the Russian government made a systematic takeover of privately owned television networks, in the course of which Berezovsky, Gusinsky and Patarkatsishvili lost most of their media holdings,[15] prompting one of them to warn of Russia \"turning into a banana republic\" in a letter to The New York Times.[109] In February, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili sold their stake in ORT to Roman Abramovich, who promptly ceded editorial control to the Kremlin.[110] Berezovsky later claimed that there was a secret understanding that Nikolai Glushkov would be released from prison as part of that deal, a promise that was never fulfilled.[111] In April, the government took control of Vladimir Gusinsky's NTV.[112] Berezovsky then moved to acquire a controlling stake in a smaller network, TV-6, made Patarkatsishvili its Chairman, and offered employment to hundreds of locked out NTV journalists.[113] Almost immediately, Patarkatshishvili became a target of police investigation and fled the country.[114] In January 2002 a Russian arbitration court forced TV-6 (Russia) into liquidation. The liquidation of TV-6 was precipitated by LUKoil, a partly state-owned minority shareholder, using a piece of legislation that was almost immediately repealed.[115][116]/nIn 2001, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili ended their involvement in Sibneft for a US$1.3\u00a0billion fee from Roman Abramovich.[47] This transaction was the subject of a later dispute in the UK commercial courts, with Berezovsky alleging that he had been put under pressure to sell his stake to Abramovich at a fraction of the true value,[117] an allegation that the court rejected.[47]/nIn 2006, Berezovsky sold the Kommersant (\"The Businessman\") newspaper and his remaining Russian assets.[118]/nFrom his new home in the UK, Stanley House, where he and associates including Akhmed Zakayev, Alexander Litvinenko and Alex Goldfarb became known as \"the London Circle\" of Russian exiles, Berezovsky publicly stated that he was on a mission to bring down Putin \"by force\" or by bloodless revolution.[119][89] He established the International Foundation for Civil Liberties (IFCL), to \"support the abused and the vulnerable in society \u2013 prisoners, national minorities and business people\" in Russia and criticized Putin's record in the West.[120]/nBerezovsky launched a concerted campaign to expose alleged misdeeds of Vladimir Putin, from suppressing freedom of speech[121] to committing war crimes in Chechnya.[122] He also accused Russia's FSB security service of staging the Moscow apartment bombings of 1999 in order to help Putin win the presidency.[123] Many of these activities were funded through the New York-based IFCL, directed by Berezovsky's friend Alex Goldfarb.[citation needed]/nBerezovsky bought a Belgravia flat, the 125-acre Wentworth Park estate near Virginia Water in Surrey, and for a while owned the 172-acre Hascombe Court estate in Godalming.[124] In 2012, he sold his Wentworth Park house.[21]/nOn 9 September 2003, Berezovsky was granted refugee status and political asylum by the British Home Office which he, according to Alex Goldfarb, welcomed.[125]/nOn 12 September 2003, judge Timothy Workman of Bow Street Magistrates' Court in central London dropped extradition proceedings against Berezovsky, ruling that it would be pointless to pursue the case as the granting of asylum status to Berezovsky made the proceedings redundant.[126]/nHowever, when Berezovsky told Reuters in early February 2006 that he was working on plans to overthrow Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw warned the London-based Russian tycoon not to plot against the Russian President while living in Britain. His refugee status could be reviewed if he continued to make such remarks.[127]/nAfter Berezovsky gained political asylum in Britain, the Russian authorities vigorously pursued various criminal charges against him. This culminated in two trials in absentia. From London, Berezovsky called the trial, which sentenced him to six years in prison, \"a farce\".[16] In June 2009, the Krasnogorsk City Court near Moscow sentenced Berezovsky to thirteen years imprisonment for defrauding AvtoVAZ of 58\u00a0million rubles (US$1.9\u00a0million) in the 1990s. Berezovsky was represented by a court-appointed lawyer.[128]/nIn spite of Berezovsky's successes in Britain in fighting off extradition requests and exposing Russian court convictions as politically motivated (see below), some other jurisdictions cooperated with Russian authorities in seizing his property and targeting his financial transactions as money laundering. Berezovsky succeeded in overturning some of these actions. In July 2007, Brazilian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky in connection with his investment in the Brazilian football club Corinthians.[129] However, a year later the Brazilian Supreme Court cancelled the order and stopped the investigation.[130] On Russian requests, French authorities raided his villa in Nice in search of documents,[131] and seized his two yachts parked on the French Riviera.[132] However, some months later, the boats were released by a French court.[citation needed] Swiss prosecutors have been assisting their Russian colleagues for over a decade in investigating Berezovsky's finances.[133]/nBerezovsky's meteoric enrichment and involvement in power struggles have been accompanied by allegations of various crimes from his opponents. After his falling out with Putin and exile to London, these allegations became the recurrent theme of official state-controlled media, earning him comparisons with Leon Trotsky[134] and the Nineteen Eighty-Four character Emmanuel Goldstein.[135]/nIn 1996, Forbes, an American business magazine, published an article by Paul Klebnikov entitled \"Godfather of the Kremlin?\" with the sub-heading \"Power. Politics. Murder. Boris Berezovsky could teach the guys in Sicily a thing or two.\"[136] The article linked Berezovsky to corruption in the car industry, to the Chechen mafia and to the murder of Vladislav Listyev. In 2000, the House of Lords gave Berezovsky and Nikolai Glushkov permission to sue for libel in the UK courts. Given that only 2,000 of the 785,000 copies sold worldwide were sold in the United Kingdom, this led numerous scholars to cite the case as an example of libel tourism.[137][138][139][140][141] The case slowly proceeded until the claimants opted to settle when Forbes offered a partial retraction.[141] The following statement appended to the article on the Forbes website summarises: \"On 6 March 2003, the resolution of the case was announced in the High Court in London. Forbes stated in open court that (1) it was not the magazine's intention to state that Berezovsky was responsible for the murder of Listiev, only that he had been included in an inconclusive police investigation of the crime; (2) there is no evidence that Berezovsky was responsible for this or any other murder; (3) in light of the English court's ruling, it was wrong to characterize Berezovsky as a mafia boss; and (4) the magazine erred in stating that Glouchkov had been convicted for theft of state property in 1982.\"[142] Klebnikov elaborated his allegations in his 2000 book Godfather of the Kremlin: Boris Berezovsky and the looting of Russia (the 2001 edition was titled Godfather of the Kremlin: The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism).[143][144][145]/nIn 2006, a UK court awarded Berezovsky \u00a350,000 in libel damages against the Russian private bank Alfa-Bank and its Chairman, Mikhail Fridman. Fridman had claimed on a Russian television programme that could be watched in the UK that Berezovsky had threatened him when the two men were competitors for control of the Kommersant publishing house, and that making threats was Berezovsky's usual way of conducting business. The jury rejected the defendants' claim that Fridman's allegations were true. Berezovsky accepted the apology and withdrew his libel suit.[146]/nIn March 2010, Berezovsky, represented by Desmond Browne QC, won a libel case and was awarded \u00a3150,000 damages by the High Court in London over allegations that he had been behind the murder of Alexander Litvinenko.[147] The allegations had been broadcast by the Russian state channel RTR Planeta in April 2007 on its programme Vesti Nedeli, which could be viewed from the UK. In his judgement, Mr Justice Eady stated: \"I can say unequivocally that there is no evidence before me that Mr Berezovsky had any part in the murder of Mr Litvinenko. Nor, for that matter, do I see any basis for reasonable grounds to suspect him of it.\" Berezovsky had sued both the channel and a man called Vladimir Terluk, whom Mr Justice Eady agreed was the man who had been interviewed in silhouette by the programme under the pseudonym 'Pyotr'. Terluk had claimed that to further his UK asylum application Berezovsky had approached him to fabricate a murder plot against himself, and that Litvinenko knew of this. Mr Justice Eady accepted that Terluk had not himself alleged Berezovsky's involvement in the murder of Litvinenko, but considered that his own allegations were themselves serious and that there was no truth in any of them. As RTR did not participate in the proceedings, Terluk was left to defend the case himself, receiving significant assistance (as the judge noted) from the Russian prosecutor's office.[140]/nThe Guardian described the 2010 libel case as \"almost anarchic at times as officials from the Russian prosecutors' office repeatedly intervened despite not being party to proceedings. So obvious was their intention that when one of their mobile phones went off in court one day, Desmond Browne quipped: 'That must be Mr Putin on the line.'\"[140] The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed, Lord Justice Laws giving a judgment with which the Chancellor of the High Court and Lady Justice Rafferty agreed. The Lord Justice described a witness statement of Andrei Lugovoi, newly adduced by the defendants, as 'not sensibly capable of belief'.[148]/nIn 2011, Berezovsky brought a civil case against Roman Abramovich in the High Court of Justice in London, accusing Abramovich of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract, and seeking over \u00a33 billion in damages.[20] This became the largest civil court case in British legal history.[149]/nBerezovsky's claimed past ownership of Sibneft \u2013 which constituted the bulk of his fortune \u2013 was put into question by Abramovich, who in a statement to the High Court in London asserted that Berezovsky had never owned shares in Sibneft, and that US$1.3\u00a0billion paid in 2001 ostensibly for his stake in the company was actually in recognition of Berezovsky's \"political assistance and protection\" during the creation of Sibneft in 1995.[150] The hearings, which started on 3 October 2011, examined Berezovsky's US$5.5\u00a0billion claim against Abramovich for damages arising from the sale of his assets under alleged \"threats and intimidation\".[151]/nOn 31 August 2012, the High Court found for Abramovich.[152] The High Court judge stated that because of the nature of the evidence, the case hinged on whether to believe Berezovsky or Abramovich's evidence. In her ruling, the judge observed: \"On my analysis of the entirety of the evidence, I found Mr. Berezovsky an unimpressive, and inherently unreliable, witness, who regarded truth as a transitory, flexible concept, which could be moulded to suit his current purposes. ... I regret to say that the bottom line of my analysis of Mr. Berezovsky's credibility is that he would\nhave said almost anything to support his case.\"[20][153][152]:\u200a16\u201318\u200a She ruled that the monies paid represented a final payment in discharge of all obligations.[152][47]/nBerezovsky conducted business with Neil Bush, the younger brother of the US President George W. Bush. Berezovsky was an investor in Bush's Ignite! Learning, an educational software corporation, since at least 2003. In 2005, Neil Bush met with Berezovsky in Latvia, causing tension with Russia due to Berezovsky's fugitive status.[154] Neil Bush was also seen with Berezovsky in his box at an Arsenal F.C. match at the Emirates Stadium in London.[155] There had been speculation that the relationship might have become a cause of tension in Russo-American bilateral relations.[156]/nIt had been speculated that Berezovsky's wealth may have been depleted with the onset of the late 2000s recession. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, in 2011 his net worth was about US$900\u00a0million./nIn September 2005, Berezovsky said in an interview with the BBC: \"I'm sure that Putin doesn't have the chance to survive, even to the next election in 2008. I am doing everything in my power to limit his time frame, and I am really thinking of returning to Russia after Putin collapses, which he will.\"[89][157] In January 2006, Berezovsky stated in an interview to a Moscow-based radio station that he was working on overthrowing the administration of Vladimir Putin by force.[158] Berezovsky also accused Putin of being \"a gangster\"[159] and the \"terrorist number one\".[160]/nBerezovsky declared that he was plotting the overthrow of President Putin on 13 April 2007 during an interview The Guardian conducted: \"We need to use force to change this regime. It isn't possible to change this regime through democratic means. There can be no change without force, pressure.\"[8] He also admitted that during the last six years he had struggled hard to \"destroy the positive image of Putin\" and said that \"Putin has created an authoritarian regime against the Russian constitution. ... I don't know how it will happen, but authoritarian regimes only collapse by force.\"[161]/nSoon after Berezovsky's 2007 statement, Garry Kasparov, a figure in the opposition movement The Other Russia and leader of the United Civil Front, wrote the following on his website: \"Berezovsky has lived in emigration for many years and no longer has significant influence upon the political processes which take place in Russian society. His extravagant proclamations are simply a method of attracting attention. Furthermore, for the overwhelming majority of Russian people he was a political symbol of the 90s, one of the 'bad blokes' enriching themselves behind the back of president Yeltsin. The informational noise around Berezovsky was specifically beneficial for the Kremlin, which was trying to compromise Russia's real opposition. Berezovsky has not had and does not have any relation to Other Russia or the United Civil Front.\"[163] Berezovsky responded in June 2007 by saying that \"there is not one significant politician in Russia whom he has not financed\" and that this included members of Other Russia. The managing director of the United Civil Front, in turn, said that the organization would consider suing Berezovsky over these allegations,[citation needed] but the lawsuit has never been brought before the court./nThe Russian Prosecutor General's Office had launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky to determine whether his comments could be considered a \"seizure of power by force\", as outlined in the Russian Criminal Code. If convicted, an offender faces up to twenty years imprisonment. The British Foreign Office denounced Berezovsky's statements, warning him that his status of a political refugee might be reconsidered, should he continue to make similar remarks. Furthermore, Scotland Yard had announced that it would investigate whether Berezovsky's statements violated the law.[164][165] However, in the following July, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Berezovsky would not face charges in the UK for his comments. Kremlin officials called it a \"disturbing moment\" in Anglo-Russian relations.[166]/nIn September 2005, the former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, accused Berezovsky of having financed Viktor Yushchenko's 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he claimed were controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yuschenko's official backers.[167] Berezovsky claimed that he met Yushchenko's representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he declined to confirm or deny that the companies that received the money were used in Yushchenko's campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.[citation needed] In November 2005, Berezovsky also claimed he had heavily financed Ukraine's Orange Revolution (that had followed the presidential election).[168] In September 2007, Berezovsky launched lawsuits against two Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Tretyakov, a former presidential aid, and David Zhvaniya, a former emergencies minister.[169] Berezovsky was suing the men for nearly US$23\u00a0million, accusing them of misusing the money he had allocated in 2004 to fund the Orange Revolution.[169] Yushchenko has denied Berezovsky financed his election campaign.[167]/nBerezovsky called on Ukrainian business to support Yushchenko in the 2010 presidential election of January 2010 as a guarantor of debarment of property redistribution after the election.[170] On 10 December 2009, the Ukrainian minister of interior affairs Yuriy Lutsenko stated that if the Russian interior ministry requested it, Berezovsky would be detained upon arriving in Ukraine.[170]/nIn February 2012, in an interview for the independent Russian TV Rain channel Berezovsky reiterated that he had personally provided approximately $50 millions to the Ukrainian Orange revolution. David Zhvania\u00a0[ru] (Russian: \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0412\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f) and Oleksandr Tretiakov were among the ones who allegedly received money.[171]/nIn October 2005, Latvian Prime Minister Aigars Kalv\u012btis signed a decree placing Boris Berezovsky on the list of personae non gratae. The exact reasons for blacklisting Berezovsky were not disclosed. Kalvitis called Berezovsky a \"threat\" to national security. Previously, the National Security Council of Latvia took the decision to recommend that Berezovsky be barred from travelling to Latvia. The decision to bar the one-time Russian oligarch came swiftly after Berezovsky's trip to Riga in September 2005.[172] Berezovsky was in Riga along with Neil Bush to discuss a project with Latvian businessmen.[173]/nThe Baltic News Service quoted the former Russian oligarch as saying that he believes Latvia's decision to declare him persona non-grata was the result of intense pressure by Russia and structures linked with George Soros, the U.S. business magnate who had had acrimonious relations with Berezovsky. Kalvitis however denied the theory that the banning came on pressure from the Kremlin or the White House.[174]/nAccording to Alexander Litvinenko, a Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officer in London was preparing to assassinate Berezovsky with a binary weapon in September 2003. This alleged plot was reported to British police.[175] Hazel Blears, then a Home Office Minister, said that inquiries made [into these claims] were \"unable to either substantiate this information or find evidence of any criminal offences having been committed\".[176]/nIn June 2007, Berezovsky said he fled Britain on the advice of Scotland Yard, amid reports that he was the target of an assassination attempt by a suspected Russian hitman. On 18 July 2007, the British tabloid The Sun reported that the alleged would-be assassin was captured by the police at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane.[177][178] They reported that the suspect, arrested by the anti-terrorist police after being tracked for a week by MI5, was deported back to Russia when no weapons were found and there was not enough evidence to charge him with any offence. In addition, they said British police placed a squad of uniformed officers around Akhmed Zakayev's house in north London, and also phoned Litvinenko's widow, Marina, to urge her to take greater security precautions.[179]/nBerezovsky again accused Vladimir Putin of being behind a plot to assassinate him. The Kremlin had denied similar claims in the past.[180]/nAccording to the interview given by a high-ranking British security official on BBC Two in July 2008, the alleged Russian agent, known as \"A\", was of Chechen nationality.[181] He was identified by Kommersant as the Chechen mobster Movladi Atlangeriyev; after returning to Russia, Atlangeriyev was forcibly disappeared in January 2008 by unknown men in Moscow.[182]/nAlexander Litvinenko, one of Berezovsky's closest associates, was murdered in London in November 2006 with a rare radioactive poison, Polonium 210. The British authorities charged a former FSB officer and head of security at ORT, Andrey Lugovoy, with the murder and requested his extradition, which Russia refused.[183] Several Russian diplomats were expelled from the UK over the case.[184] The UK government has not publicly expressed a view on the matter, but allegations that the murder was sponsored by the Russian state have been expressed by \"sources in the UK government\", according to the BBC,[185] and by officials of the US Department of State, as revealed by leaked diplomatic cables;[186] they were reflected in a 2008 resolution by the US Congress.[187] The intricate details of the murder, the relationship between Litvinenko and Berezosvsky, and the implications of the case have been described in the 2007 book, Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB by Alex Goldfarb with Marina Litvinenko.[188]/nAn alternative, more dubious narrative \u2013 that the murder was orchestrated by Berezovsky and his associate Alex Goldfarb with the aim of \"framing\" the Russian government and discrediting it on the global stage \u2013 has aired in Russian state-funded media[189] by Lugovoy,[citation needed] by Litvinenko's Italy-based father,[citation needed] by Nikita Chekulin[190] and by Russian officials.[191] Berezovsky won a UK libel suit against Russian State Television over these allegations in 2010 (see above), following which he commented, \"I trust the conclusions of the British investigators that the trail leads to Russia and I hope that one day justice will prevail.\"[147]/nIn the evening of Tuesday, 12 February 2008, Georgia's richest man, billionaire Arkady \"Badri\" Patarkatsishvili, a close friend and long-time business partner of Berezovsky, collapsed and died in his bedroom after a family dinner at Downside Manor, his mansion in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, at the age of 52.[192]/nPatarkatsishvili, who as a presidential candidate had also been campaigning to oust Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili, spent his last day in the City of London office of international law firm Debevoise and Plimpton. He was preparing along with his lawyer Lord Goldsmith QC and fellow exiles, the Russians Nikolai Glushkov and Yuli Dubov. Shortly after dining at Downside Manor, Patarkatsishvili told his family he felt unwell and went upstairs to his bedroom where he was found unconscious after a heart attack.[193] Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful.[194] As in any other case of unexpected death, Surrey police treated the case as \"suspicious\" and launched an official investigation.[195] Preliminary reports indicated a heart attack as the cause of death./nBerezovsky described the death of his closest friend as \"a terrible tragedy\".[196]/nOn 23 March 2013, Berezovsky was found dead at his home,[197] Titness Park, at Sunninghill, near Ascot in Berkshire.[22] His body was found by a bodyguard in a locked bathroom, with a ligature around his neck.[198][199][200]/nHis death was announced in a post on Facebook, by his son-in-law. Alexander Dobrovinsky, a lawyer who had represented Berezovsky, wrote that he may have committed suicide,[201] adding that Berezovsky had fallen into debt after losing the lawsuit against Abramovich, and had spent the final few months of his life selling his possessions to cover his court costs.[202] Berezovsky was also said to have recently been depressed and to have isolated himself from friends.[203][204] He reportedly suffered from depression and was taking antidepressant drugs; a day prior to his death he told a reporter in London that he had nothing left to live for.[205]/nThe Thames Valley Police classified his death as \"unexplained\" and launched a formal investigation into the circumstances behind it. Specialists in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials were deployed to Berezovsky's home as a \"precaution\".[202] These specialists later \"found nothing of concern\".[206]/nA post-mortem examination carried out by the Home Office pathologist found the cause of death was consistent with hanging and there was nothing pointing to a violent struggle.[23][207] At the March 2014 inquest into the death, however, Berezovsky's daughter Elizaveta introduced a report by German pathologist Bernd Brinkmann, with whom she had shared the autopsy photos, noting that the ligature mark on her father's neck was circular rather than V-shaped as is commonly the case with hanging victims, and called the coroner's attention to a statement by one of the responding paramedics who found it strange that Berezovsky's face was purple, rather than pale as hanging victims usually are. The body also had a fresh wound on the back of the head and a fractured rib (injuries police believed Berezovsky could have suffered in the process of falling as he hanged himself). An unidentified fingerprint was found near the body, and one paramedic's radiation alarm sounded as they entered the house.[208]/nBerezovsky was buried on 8 May 2013 in a private ceremony at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey. The burial timing had been changed on several occasions to try to avoid interest from the Russian media.[209]/nAfter Berezovsky's death, a spokesman for President Putin reported that he, Berezovsky, had sent a letter to the Russian president, asking for permission to return to Russia and asking \"forgiveness for his mistakes\".[210][211] Some of Berezovsky's associates doubted the letter's existence, claiming that it was out of character. However, his girlfriend at the time, Katerina Sabirova, later confirmed in an interview that he did in fact send the letter:[212]/nI said that they will publish it and you will look bad. And that it won't help. He answered that it was all the same to him, that in any case all sins were blamed on him and that this was his only chance./nIt was claimed by anonymous sources that rival Roman Abramovich delivered the letter to Putin personally, having received an apology from Berezovsky himself. Both Putin's chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, and Abramovich's spokesman alluded to the letter being passed by a \"certain person\", but did not go into details due to the personal nature of the issue.[213]/nBerezovsky was a doctor of technical sciences and author of many academic papers and studies such as \"Binary relations in multi-criteria optimizations\" and \"Multi-criteria optimization: mathematical aspects\". In the mathematical review index MathSciNet, B.A. Berezovsky is credited with 16 publications from 1975 to 1989 on operations research and mathematical programming, earning 9 citations in other publications. Most cited is the book The Problem of Optimal Choice with A.V. Gnedin (Nauka, Moscow 1984), devoted to secretary problems./nAside from his academic publications, he frequently authored articles and gave interviews; these are collected in The Art of the Impossible (3 vols.). He continued to contribute articles while in exile, taking a highly critical view of Russia's political leaders.[8][214][215][216]/nIn 1996, the Russian-American journalist Paul Klebnikov wrote a highly critical article entitled \"Godfather of the Kremlin?\"[217] on Berezovsky and the state of Russia more generally, in response to which Berezovsky sued Forbes in the UK;[217]:\u200a7\u200a in 2001, he expanded his article into a book entitled Godfather of the Kremlin, alternatively subtitled The Decline of Russia in the Age of Gangster Capitalism and Boris Berezovsky and the looting of Russia.[144][145][218] On 9 July 2004, while leaving the Forbes office in Moscow, unknown assailants fired at Klebnikov from a slowly moving car. He was shot four times and died later in hospital. The same day Berezovsky, in the words of investigative journalist Richard Behar, \"whipped out his tongue from its holster and publicly called the 41-year-old editor of Forbes Russia 'a dishonest reporter'\".[219] The books Secret Diary of a Russian Oligarch and How to get rid of an Oligarch or Who Beat Berezovsky by Sasha Nerozina (friend of the Berezovsky family and a spokeswoman of Berezovsky's wife Galina) were published in Russia and other former Soviet states in 2013 and 2014 by Olma Media Publishing House./nYuli Dubov, a close business associate of Berezovsky, wrote a novel based on Berezovsky's life which provided the basis for the 2002 film Tycoon. Like Berezovsky, he fled to London and successfully fought extradition to Russia.[220][221] Judge Timothy Workman of Bow Street Magistrates' Court in central London dropped extradition proceedings against Yuly Dubov in October 2003.[222]/nAlex Goldfarb, a microbiologist and activist who became acquainted with Berezovsky in the 1990s and later worked for him, provides snapshots of Berezovsky at crucial moments as background to his 2007 account of the Litvinenko murder case, co-written with Marina Litvinenko, Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB.[39] David E. Hoffman of The Washington Post wrote The Oligarchs: Wealth and Power in the New Russia, which provides a comparative treatment of Berezovsky and several of his fellow so-called business oligarchs.[223] Ben Mezrich wrote Once Upon a Time in Russia: The Rise of the Oligarchs\u2014A True Story of Ambition, Wealth, Betrayal, and Murder, which provides a comparative narrative of Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich through their careers, friendship, and ultimate rivalry.[224]/nIn 2017, the Russian book Time of Berezovsky was published by Corpus (an imprint of AST), in which Petr Aven \u2013 a friend of Berezovsky \u2013 interviewed various people who were close to Berezovsky at different times, including Leonid Boguslavsky, Yuli Dubov, Galina Besharova, Yelena Gorbunova, Yuri Shefler, Anatoly Chubais, Mikhail Fridman, Valentin Yumashev, Sergey Dorenko, Eugene Shvidler, Vladimir Posner, Alexander Goldfarb, Alexander Voloshin, Stanislav Belkovsky and Yuri Felshtinsky.[225][226]/nA documentary about Berezovsky's efforts to undermine Putin from his exile in UK was shown on BBC Two in December 2005.[227]/nBerezovsky features in a painting by the Russian artist Ilya Glazunov, displayed in Moscow's Ilya Glazunov Gallery. According to the Rough Guide, \"The Market of Our Democracy shows Yeltsin waving a conductor's baton as two lesbians kiss and the oligarch Berezovsky flaunts a sign reading 'I will buy Russia', while charlatans rob a crowd of refugees and starving children.\"[228]/nBerezovsky also features as a character in the opera The Life and Death of Alexander Litvinenko by Alexander Woolf to a libretto by David Pountney, which was premiered in July 2021 at Grange Park Opera.[229][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]/nPatriots premiered at the Almeida Theatre in Islington, London, in May 2022, following the life of Berezovsky from the president's inner circle to public enemy number one.

Beginning from the earlier contributions of Euclid and Archimedes on the topic, he brought them to the state prior to the invention of analytic geometry. His definitions of the terms ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola are the ones in use today. With his predecessors Euclid and Archimedes, Apollonius is generally considered among the greatest mathematicians of antiquity.[1]/nAside from geometry, Apollonius worked on numerous other topics, including astronomy. Most of this work has not survived, where exceptions are typically fragments referenced by other authors like Pappus of Alexandria. His hypothesis of eccentric orbits to explain the apparently aberrant motion of the planets, commonly believed until the Middle Ages, was superseded during the Renaissance. The Apollonius crater on the Moon is named in his honor.[2]/nDespite his momentous contributions to the field of mathematics, scant biographical information on  Apollonius remains. The 6th century Greek commentator Eutocius of Ascalon, writing on Apollonius' Conics, states:[3]/nApollonius, the geometrician, ...  came from Perga in Pamphylia in the times of Ptolemy III Euergetes, so records Herakleios the biographer of Archimedes ..../nFrom this passage Apollonius can be approximately dated,[a] but specific birth and death years stated by modern scholars are only speculative.[4] Ptolemy III Euergetes (\"benefactor\") was third Greek dynast of Egypt in the Diadochi succession, who reigned 246\u2013222/221 BC. \"Times\" are always recorded by ruler or officiating magistrate, so Apollonius was likely born after 246. The identity of Herakleios is uncertain./nPerga was a Hellenized city in Pamphylia, Anatolia, whose ruins yet stand. It was a center of Hellenistic culture. Eutocius appears to associate Perga with the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. Never under Egypt, Perga in 246 BC belonged to the Seleucid Empire, an independent diadochi state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty. During the last half of the 3rd century BC, Perga changed hands a number of times, being alternatively under the Seleucids and under the Attalids of Pergamon to the north. Someone designated \"of Perga\" might be expected to have lived and worked there; to the contrary, if Apollonius was later identified with Perga, it was not on the basis of his residence. The remaining autobiographical material implies that he lived, studied, and wrote in Alexandria./nA letter by the Greek mathematician and astronomer Hypsicles was originally part of the supplement taken from Euclid's Book XIV, part of the thirteen books of Euclid's Elements.[5]/nBasilides of Tyre, O Protarchus, when he came to Alexandria and met my father, spent the greater part of his sojourn with him on account of the bond between them due to their common interest in mathematics. And on one occasion, when looking into the tract written by Apollonius about the comparison of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in one and the same sphere, that is to say, on the question what ratio they bear to one another, they came to the conclusion that Apollonius' treatment of it in this book was not correct; accordingly, as I understood from my father, they proceeded to amend and rewrite it. But I myself afterwards came across another book published by Apollonius, containing a demonstration of the matter in question, and I was greatly attracted by his investigation of the problem. Now the book published by Apollonius is accessible to all; for it has a large circulation in a form which seems to have been the result of later careful elaboration./nSome autobiographical material can be found in the surviving prefaces to the books of Conics. These are letters Apollonius addressed to influential friends asking them to review the book enclosed with the letter. The first two prefaces are addressed to Eudemus of Pergamon./nEudemus likely was or became the head of the research center of the Museum of Pergamon, a city known for its books and parchment industry from which the name parchment is derived. Research in Greek mathematical institutions, which followed the model of the Athenian Lycaeum, was part of the educational effort to which the library and museum were adjunct. There was only one such school in the state, under royal patronage. Books were rare and expensive and collecting them was a royal obligation./nApollonius's preface to Book I tells Eudemus that the first four books were concerned with the development of elements while the last four were concerned with special topics. Apollonius reminds Eudemus that Conics was initially requested by Naucrates, a geometer and house guest at Alexandria otherwise unknown to history. Apollonius provided Naucrates the first draft of all eight books, but he refers to them as being \"without a thorough purgation\", and intended to verify and correct the books, releasing each one as it was completed./nHaving heard this plan from Apollonius himself, who visited Pergamon, Eudemus insisted Apollonius send him each book before release. At this stage Apollonius was likely still a young geometer, who according to Pappus stayed at Alexandria with the students of Euclid (long after Euclid's time), perhaps the final stage of his education. Eudemus may have been a mentor from Appolonius' time in Pergamon./nThere is a gap between the first and second prefaces. Apollonius has sent his son, also named Apollonius, to deliver the second. He speaks with more confidence, suggesting that Eudemus use the book in special study groups. Apollonius mentions meeting Philonides of Laodicea, a geometer whom he introduced to Eudemus in Ephesus, and who became Eudemus' student. Philonides lived mainly in Syria during the 1st half of the 2nd century BC. Whether the meeting indicates that Apollonius now lived in Ephesus is unresolved; the intellectual community of the Mediterranean was cosmopolitan and scholars in this \"golden age of mathematics\" sought employment internationally, visited each other, read each other's works and made suggestions, recommended students, and communicated via some sort of postal service. Surviving letters are abundant./nThe preface to Book III is missing, and during the interval Eudemus died, says Apollonius in the preface to Book IV. Prefaces to Books IV\u2013VII are more formal, mere summaries omitting personal information. All four are addressed to a mysterious Attalus, a choice made, Apollonius says, \"because of your earnest desire to possess my works\". Presumably Attalus was important to be sent Apollonius' manuscripts. One theory is that Attalus is Attalus II Philadelphus (220\u2013138 BC), general and defender of Pergamon whose brother Eumenes II was king, and who became co-regent after his brother's illness in 160 BC and acceded to the throne in 158 BC. Both brothers were patrons of the arts, expanding the library into international magnificence. Attalus was a contemporary of Philonides and Apollonius' motive is consonant with Attalus' book-collecting initiative./nIn Preface VII Apollonius describes Book VIII as \"an appendix ... which I will take care to send you as speedily as possible.\" There is no record that it was ever sent, and Apollonius might have died before finishing it. Pappus of Alexandria, however, provided lemmas for it, so it must have been in circulation in some form./nApollonius was a prolific geometer, turning out a large number of works. Only one survives, Conics. Of its eight books, only the first four persist as untranslated original texts of Apollonius. Books 5-7 are only available in an Arabic translation by Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra commissioned by the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101; the original Greek is lost.[6] The status of Book 8 is unknown. A first draft existed, but whether the final draft was ever produced is not known. A \"reconstruction\" of it by Edmond Halley exists in Latin, but there is no way to know how much of it, if any, is verisimilar to Apollonius./nThe Greek text of Conics uses the Euclidean arrangement of definitions, figures and their parts; i.e., the \u201cgivens,\u201d followed by propositions \u201cto be proved.\u201d Books I-VII present 387 propositions. This type of arrangement can be seen in any modern geometry textbook of the traditional subject matter. As in any course of mathematics, the material is very dense and consideration of it, necessarily slow.  Apollonius had a plan for each book, which is partly described in the Prefaces. The headings, or pointers to the plan, are somewhat in deficit, Apollonius having depended more on the logical flow of the topics./nBook I presents 58 propositions. Its most salient content is all the basic definitions concerning cones and conic sections. These definitions are not exactly the same as the modern ones of the same words. Etymologically the modern words derive from the ancient, but the etymon often differs in meaning from its reflex./nA conical surface is generated by a line segment rotated about a bisector point such that the end points trace circles, each in its own plane. A cone, one branch of the double conical surface, is the surface with the point (apex or vertex), the circle (base), and the axis, a line joining vertex and center of base./nA section (Latin sectio, Greek tome) is an imaginary \"cutting\"  of a cone by a plane./nThe Greek geometers were interested in laying out select figures from their inventory in various applications of engineering and architecture, as the great inventors, such as Archimedes, were accustomed to doing. A demand for conic sections existed then and exists now. The development of mathematical characterization had moved geometry in the direction of Greek geometric algebra, which visually features such algebraic fundamentals as assigning values to line segments as variables. They used a coordinate system intermediate between a grid of measurements and the Cartesian coordinate system. The theories of proportion and application of areas allowed the development of visual equations. (See below under Methods of Apollonius)./nThe \"application of areas\" implicitly asks, given an area and a line segment, does this area apply; that is, is it equal to, the square on the segment? If yes, an applicability (parabole) has been established. Apollonius followed Euclid in asking if a rectangle on the abscissa of any point on the section applies to the square of the ordinate.[7] If it does, his word-equation is the equivalent of \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n=\nk\nx\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}=kx}\n\n which is one modern form of the equation for a parabola. The rectangle has sides \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n and \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n. It was he who accordingly named the figure, parabola, \"application\"./nThe \"no applicability\" case is further divided into two possibilities. Given a function, \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\textstyle f(x)}\n\n, such that, in the applicability case, \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n=\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}=g(x)}\n\n, in the no applicability case, either \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n>\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}>g(x)}\n\n or \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n<\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}<g(x)}\n\n. In the former, \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n falls short of \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}}\n\n by a quantity termed the ellipsis, \"deficit\".  In the latter, \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)}\n\n overshoots by a quantity termed the hyperbole, \"surfeit\"./nApplicability could be achieved by adding the deficit, \n\n\n\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n=\ng\n(\nx\n)\n+\nd\n,\n\n\n{\\textstyle y^{2}=f(x)=g(x)+d,}\n\n or subtracting the surfeit, \n\n\n\ng\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\ns\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g(x)-s.}\n\n The figure compensating for a deficit was named an ellipse; for a surfeit, a hyperbola.[c] The terms of the modern equation depend on the translation and rotation of the figure from the origin, but the general equation for an ellipse,/ncan be placed in the form/nwhere \n\n\n\nC\n\n/\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C/B}\n\n is the deficit, while an equation for the hyperbola,/nbecomes/nwhere \n\n\n\nC\n\n/\n\nB\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C/B}\n\n is the surfeit.[d]/nBook II contains 53 propositions. Apollonius says that he intended to cover \"the properties having to do with the diameters and axes and also the asymptotes and other things ... for limits of possibility.\" His definition of \"diameter\" is different from the traditional, as he finds it necessary to refer the intended recipient of the letter to his work for a definition. The elements mentioned are those that specify the shape and generation of the figures. Tangents are covered at the end of the book./nBook III contains 56 propositions. Apollonius claims original discovery for theorems \"of use for the construction of solid loci ... the three-line and four-line locus ....\" The locus of a conic section is the section. The three-line locus problem (as stated by Taliafero's appendix to Book III) finds \"the locus of points whose distances from three given fixed straight lines ... are such that the square of one of the distances is always in a constant ratio to the rectangle contained by the other two distances.\" This is the proof of the application of areas resulting in the parabola.[8] The four-line problem results in the ellipse and hyperbola. Analytic geometry derives the same loci from simpler criteria supported by algebra, rather than geometry, for which Descartes was highly praised. He supersedes Apollonius in his methods./nBook IV contains 57 propositions. The first sent to Attalus, rather than to Eudemus, it thus represents his more mature geometric thought. The topic is rather specialized: \"the greatest number of points at which sections of a cone can meet one another, or meet a circumference of a circle, ....\" Nevertheless, he speaks with enthusiasm, labeling them \"of considerable use\" in solving problems (Preface 4).[e]/nBook V, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 77 propositions, the most of any book.[9] They cover the ellipse (50 propositions), the parabola (22), and the hyperbola (28).[10] These are not explicitly the topic, which in Prefaces I and V Apollonius states to be maximum and minimum lines. These terms are not explained. In contrast to Book I, Book V contains no definitions and no explanation./nThe ambiguity has served as a magnet to exegetes of Apollonius, who must interpret without sure knowledge of the meaning of the book's major terms. Until recently Heath's view prevailed: the lines are to be treated as normals to the sections.[11] A normal in this case is the perpendicular to a curve at a tangent point sometimes called the foot. If a section is plotted according to Apollonius\u2019 coordinate system (see below under Methods of Apollonius), with the diameter (translated by Heath as the axis) on the x-axis and the vertex at the origin on the left, the phraseology of the propositions indicates that the minima/maxima are to be found between the section and the axis. Heath is led into his view by consideration of a fixed point p on the section serving both as tangent point and as one end of the line. The minimum distance between p and some point g on the axis must then be the normal from p./nIn modern mathematics, normals to curves are known for being the location of the center of curvature of that small part of the curve located around the foot. The distance from the foot to the center is the radius of curvature. The latter is the radius of a circle, but for other than circular curves, the small arc can be approximated by a circular arc. The curvature of non-circular curves; e.g., the conic sections, must change over the section. A map of the center of curvature; i.e., its locus, as the foot moves over the section, is termed the evolute of the section. Such a figure, the edge of the successive positions of a line, is termed an envelope today. Heath believed that in Book V we are seeing Apollonius establish the logical foundation of a theory of normals, evolutes, and envelopes.[12]/nHeath's was accepted as the authoritative interpretation of Book V for the entire 20th century, but the changing of the century brought with it a change of view. In 2001, Apollonius scholars Fried & Unguru, granting all due respect to other Heath chapters, balked at the historicity of Heath's analysis of Book V, asserting that he \u201creworks the original to make it more congenial to a modern mathematician ... this is the kind of thing that makes Heath\u2019s work of dubious value for the historian, revealing more of Heath\u2019s mind than that of Apollonius.\u201d[13] Some of his arguments are in summary as follows. There is no mention of maxima/minima being per se normals in either the prefaces or the books proper.[f] Out of Heath's selection of 50 propositions said to cover normals, only 7, Book V: 27\u201333, state or imply maximum/minimum lines being perpendicular to the tangents. These 7 Fried classifies as isolated, unrelated to the main propositions of the book. They do not in any way imply that maxima/minima in general are normals. In his extensive investigation of the other 43 propositions, Fried proves that many cannot be.[g]/nFried and Unguru counter by portraying Apollonius as a continuation of the past rather than a foreshadowing of the future. First is a complete philological study of all references to minimum and maximum lines, which uncovers a standard phraseology. There are three groups of 20-25 propositions each.[14] The first group contains the phrase \u201cfrom a point on the axis to the section,\u201d which is exactly the opposite of a hypothetical \u201cfrom a point on the section to the axis.\u201d The former does not have to be normal to anything, although it might be. Given a fixed point on the axis, of all the lines connecting it to all the points of the section, one will be longest (maximum) and one shortest (minimum). Other phrases are \u201cin a section,\u201d \u201cdrawn from a section,\u201d \u201ccut off between the section and its axis,\u201d cut off by the axis,\u201d all referring to the same image./nIn the view of Fried and Unguru, the topic of Book V is exactly what Apollonius says it is, maximum and minimum lines. These are not code words for future concepts, but refer to ancient concepts then in use. The authors cite Euclid, Elements, Book III, which concerns itself with circles, and maximum and minimum distances from interior points to the circumference.[15] Without admitting to any specific generality they use terms such as \u201clike\u201d or \u201cthe analog of.\u201d They are known for innovating the term \u201cneusis-like.\u201d A neusis construction was a method of fitting a given segment between two given curves. Given a point P, and a ruler with the segment marked off on it. one rotates the ruler around P cutting the two curves until the segment is fitted between them. In Book V, P is the point on the axis. Rotating a ruler around it, one discovers the distances to the section, from which the minimum and maximum can be discerned. The technique is not applied to the situation, so it is not neusis. The authors use neusis-like, seeing an archetypal similarity to  the ancient method.[13]/nBook VI, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 33 propositions, the least of any book. It also has large lacunae, or gaps in the text, due to damage or corruption in the previous texts./nThe topic is relatively clear and uncontroversial. Preface 1 states that it is \u201cequal and similar sections of cones.\u201d Apollonius extends the concepts of congruence and similarity presented by Euclid for more elementary figures, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, to conic sections. Preface 6 mentions \u201csections and segments\u201d that are \u201cequal and unequal\u201d as well as \u201csimilar and dissimilar,\u201d and adds some constructional information./nBook VI features a return to the basic definitions at the front of the book. \u201cEquality\u201d is determined by an application of areas. If one figure; that is, a section or a segment, is \u201capplied\u201d to another (Halley's si applicari possit altera super alteram), they are \u201cequal\u201d (Halley's aequales) if they coincide and no line of one crosses any line of the other. This is obviously a standard of congruence following Euclid, Book I, Common Notions, 4: \u201cand things coinciding (epharmazanta) with one another are equal (isa).\u201d Coincidence and equality overlap, but they are not the same: the application of areas used to define the sections depends on quantitative equality of areas but they can belong to different figures./nBetween instances that are the same (homos), being equal to each other, and those that are different, or unequal, are figures that are \u201csame-ish\u201d (hom-oios), or similar. They are neither entirely the same nor different, but share aspects that are the same and do not share aspects that are different. Intuitively the geometricians had scale in mind; e.g., a map is similar to a topographic region. Thus figures could have larger or smaller versions of themselves./nThe aspects that are the same in similar figures depend on the figure. Book 6 of Euclid's Elements presents similar triangles as those that have the same corresponding angles. A triangle can thus have miniatures as small as you please, or giant versions, and still be \u201cthe same\u201d triangle as the original./nIn Apollonius' definitions at the beginning of Book VI, similar right cones have similar axial triangles. Similar sections and segments of sections are first of all in similar cones. In addition, for every abscissa of one must exist an abscissa in the other at the desired scale. Finally, abscissa and ordinate of one must be matched by coordinates of the same ratio of ordinate to abscissa as the other. The total effect is as though the section or segment were moved up and down the cone to achieve a different scale.[h]/nBook VII, also a translation from the Arabic, contains 51 Propositions. These are the last that Heath considers in his 1896 edition. In Preface I, Apollonius does not mention them, implying that, at the time of the first draft, they may not have existed in sufficiently coherent form to describe. Apollonius uses obscure language, that they are \u201cperi dioristikon theorematon\u201d, which Halley translated as \u201cde theorematis ad determinationem pertinentibus,\u201d and Heath as \u201ctheorems involving determinations of limits.\u201d This is the language of definition, but no definitions are forthcoming. Whether the reference might be to a specific kind of definition is a consideration but to date nothing credible has been proposed.[i] The topic of Book VII, completed toward the end of Apollonius\u2019 life and career, is stated in Preface VII to be diameters and \u201cthe figures described upon them,\u201d which must include conjugate diameters, as he relies heavily on them. In what way the term \u201climits\u201d or \u201cdeterminations\u201d might apply is not mentioned./nDiameters and their conjugates are defined in Book I (Definitions 4\u20136). Not every diameter has a conjugate. The topography of a diameter (Greek diametros) requires a regular curved figure. Irregularly-shaped areas, addressed in modern times, are not in the ancient game plan. Apollonius has in mind, of course, the conic sections, which he describes in often convolute language: \u201ca curve in the same plane\u201d is a circle, ellipse or parabola, while \u201ctwo curves in the same plane\u201d is a hyperbola. A chord is a straight line whose two end points are on the figure; i.e., it cuts the figure in two places. If a grid of parallel chords is imposed on the figure, then the diameter is defined as the line bisecting all the chords, reaching the curve itself at a point called the vertex. There is no requirement for a closed figure; e.g., a parabola has a diameter./nA parabola has symmetry in one dimension. If you imagine it folded on its one diameter, the two halves are congruent, or fit over each other. The same may be said of one branch of a hyperbola. Conjugate diameters (Greek suzugeis diametroi, where suzugeis is \u201cyoked together\u201d), however, are symmetric in two dimensions. The figures to which they apply require also an areal center (Greek kentron), today called a centroid, serving as a center of symmetry in two directions. These figures are the circle, ellipse, and two-branched hyperbola. There is only one centroid, which must not be confused with the foci. A diameter is a chord passing through the centroid, which always bisects it./nFor the circle and ellipse, let a grid of parallel chords be superimposed over the figure such that the longest is a diameter and the others are successively shorter until the last is not a chord, but is a tangent point. The tangent must be parallel to the diameter. A conjugate diameter bisects the chords, being placed between the centroid and the tangent point. Moreover, both diameters are conjugate to each other, being called a conjugate pair. It is obvious that any conjugate pair of a circle are perpendicular to each other, but in an ellipse, only the major and minor axes are, the elongation destroying the perpendicularity in all other cases./nConjugates are defined for the two branches of a hyperbola resulting from the cutting of a double cone by a single plane. They are called conjugate branches. They have the same diameter. Its centroid bisects the segment between vertices. There is room for one more diameter-like line: let a grid of lines parallel to the diameter cut both branches of the hyperbola. These lines are chord-like except that they do not terminate on the same continuous curve. A conjugate diameter can be drawn from the centroid to bisect the chord-like lines./nThese concepts mainly from Book I get us started on the 51 propositions of Book VII defining in detail the relationships between sections, diameters, and conjugate diameters. As with some of Apollonius other specialized topics, their utility today compared to Analytic Geometry remains to be seen, although he affirms in Preface VII that they are both useful and innovative; i.e., he takes the credit for them./nThe early printed editions began for the most part in the 16th century. At that time in Europe, scholarly books were expected to be in Neo-Latin. As few mathematical manuscripts were written in Latin, the editors of the early printed works translated from Greek or Arabic. Often Greek and Latin were juxtaposed, with the Greek text representing either the original or an editor's restoration. Critical commentary of the time was typically in Latin. (Earlier commentaries had been written in ancient or medieval Greek or Arabic.) Only in the 18th and 19th centuries did editions in modern languages begin to appear. A representative list of early printed editions is given below./nThe difficulty of Conics made an intellectual niche for later commentators, each presenting Apollonius in the most lucid and relevant way for his own times. They use a variety of methods: annotation, extensive prefatory material, different formats, additional drawings, superficial reorganization by the addition of capita, and so on. There are subtle variations in interpretation./nLimited material about Conics was ever written in English, because European mathematicians of the 16th\u201318th century, including English mathematicians such as Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton, preferred Neo-Latin. In later centuries, geometry was re-established using coordinates (analytic geometry) and synthetic methods fell out of favor, so Conics' direct influence on mathematical research declined./nPresentations written entirely in native English begin in the late 19th century./nParticularly influential is Thomas Heath's translation Treatise on Conic Sections. His extensive prefatory commentary includes such items as a lexicon of Apollonian geometric terms giving the Greek, the meanings, and usage.[17] Commenting that \"the apparently portentious bulk of the treatise has deterred many from attempting to make its acquaintance\",[18] he promises to add headings, changing the organization superficially, and to clarify the text with modern notation. His work thus references two systems of organization, his own and Apollonius', parenthetically cross-referenced./nHeath was active in the late 19th and early 20th century, passing away in 1940, but meanwhile another point of view developed. St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe), which had been a military school since colonial times, preceding the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, to which it is adjacent, in 1936 lost its accreditation and was on the brink of bankruptcy. In desperation the board summoned Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan from the University of Chicago, where they had been developing a new theoretical program for instruction of the Classics. Leaping at the opportunity, in 1937 they instituted the \u201cnew program\u201d at St. John's, later dubbed the Great Books program, a fixed curriculum that would teach the works of select key contributors to the culture of western civilization. At St. John's, Apollonius came to be taught as himself, not as some adjunct to analytic geometry./nThe \u201ctutor\u201d of Apollonius was R. Catesby Taliaferro, a new PhD in 1937 from the University of Virginia. He tutored until 1942 and then later for one year in 1948, supplying the English translations by himself, translating Ptolemy's Almagest and Apollonius\u2019 Conics. These translations became part of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Great Books of the Western World series. Only Books I-III are included, with an appendix for special topics (a translation of Book IV of the Conics by Michael N. Fried was produced in 2002). Unlike Heath, Taliaferro did not attempt to reorganize Apollonius, even superficially, or to rewrite him. His translation into modern English follows the Greek fairly closely. He does use modern geometric notation to some degree./nContemporaneously with Taliaferro's work, Ivor Thomas an Oxford don of the World War II era, was taking an intense interest in Greek mathematics. He planned a compendium of selections, which came to fruition during his military service as an officer in the Royal Norfolk Regiment. After the war it found a home in the Loeb Classical Library, where it occupies two volumes, all translated by Thomas, with the Greek on one side of the page and the English on the other, as is customary for the Loeb series. Thomas' work has served as a handbook for the golden age of Greek mathematics. For Apollonius he only includes mainly those portions of Book I that define the sections./nThe rest of Apollonius's works are fragmentary or lost. Many of the lost works are described or mentioned by commentators. In addition are ideas attributed to Apollonius by other authors without documentation. Credible or not, they are hearsay. Some authors identify Apollonius as the author of certain ideas, consequently named after him. Others attempt to express Apollonius in modern notation or phraseology with indeterminate degrees of fidelity./nEdmond Halley reconstructed De Rationis Sectione and De Spatii Sectione. Beyond these works, except for a handful of fragments, documentation that might in any way be interpreted as descending from Apollonius ends./nBesides Conics, Pappus mentions other treatises of Apollonius:/nEach of these was divided into two books, and\u2014with the Data, the Porisms, and Surface-Loci of Euclid and the Conics of Apollonius\u2014were, according to Pappus, included in the body of the ancient analysis.[8] Descriptions follow of the six works mentioned above./nDe Rationis Sectione sought to resolve a simple problem: Given two straight lines and a point in each, draw through a third given point a straight line cutting the two fixed lines such that the parts intercepted between the given points in them and the points of intersection with this third line may have a given ratio.[8]/nDe Spatii Sectione discussed a similar problem requiring the rectangle contained by the two intercepts to be equal to a given rectangle.[8]/nIn the late 17th century, Edward Bernard discovered a version of De Rationis Sectione in the Bodleian Library. Although he began a translation, it was Halley who finished it and included it in a 1706 volume with his restoration of De Spatii Sectione./nDe Sectione Determinata deals with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others.[20] The specific problems are: Given two, three or four points on a straight line, find another point on it such that its distances from the given points satisfy the condition that the square on one or the rectangle contained by two has a given ratio either (1) to the square on the remaining one or the rectangle contained by the remaining two or (2) to the rectangle contained by the remaining one and another given straight line. Several have tried to restore the text to discover Apollonius's solution, among them Snellius (Willebrord Snell, Leiden, 1698); Alexander Anderson of Aberdeen, in the supplement to his Apollonius Redivivus (Paris, 1612); and Robert Simson in his Opera quaedam reliqua (Glasgow, 1776), by far the best attempt.[8]/nDe Tactionibus embraced the following general problem: Given three things (points, straight lines, or circles) in position, describe a circle passing through the given points and touching the given straight lines or circles. The most difficult and historically interesting case arises when the three given things are circles. In the 16th century, Vieta presented this problem (sometimes known as the Apollonian Problem) to Adrianus Romanus, who solved it with a hyperbola. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler solution, eventually leading him to restore the whole of Apollonius's treatise in the small work Apollonius Gallus (Paris, 1600). The history of the problem is explored in fascinating detail in the preface to J. W. Camerer's brief Apollonii Pergaei quae supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in hos Libras, cum Observationibus, &c (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).[8]/nThe object of De Inclinationibus was to demonstrate how a straight line of a given length, tending towards a given point, could be inserted between two given (straight or circular) lines. Though Marin Getaldi\u0107 and Hugo d'Omerique (Geometrical Analysis, Cadiz, 1698) attempted restorations, the best is by Samuel Horsley (1770).[8]/nDe Locis Planis is a collection of propositions relating to loci that are either straight lines or circles. Since Pappus gives somewhat full particulars of its propositions, this text has also seen efforts to restore it, not only by P. Fermat (Oeuvres, i., 1891, pp.\u00a03\u201351) and F. Schooten (Leiden, 1656) but also, most successfully of all, by R. Simson (Glasgow, 1749).[8]/nAncient writers refer to other works of Apollonius that are no longer extant:/nThe equivalence of two descriptions of planet motions, one using eccentrics and another deferent and epicycles, is attributed to Apollonius. Ptolemy describes this equivalence in the Almagest./nAccording to Heath,[21] the \"Methods of Apollonius\" were not personal to him; whatever influence he had on later theorists was the influence of geometry, not of his own innovation of technique. Heath says,/nAs a preliminary to the consideration in detail of the methods employed in the Conics, it may be stated generally that they follow steadily the accepted principles of geometrical investigation which found their definitive expression in the Elements of Euclid./nWhen referring to golden age geometers, modern scholars use the term \"method\" to mean the visual, reconstructive way in which the geometer produces a result equivalent to that produced by algebra today. As a simple example, the algebraic method to compute the area of a square is to square its side length; the analogous geometric method is to construct a visual square. Geometric methods in the golden age could produce most of the results of elementary algebra./nHeath goes on to use the term geometrical algebra for the methods of the entire golden age.[k] The term had been defined by Henry Burchard Fine in 1890 or before, who applied it to La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, the first full-blown work of analytic geometry.[22] Establishing as a precondition that \u201ctwo algebras are formally identical whose fundamental operations are formally the same,\u201d Fine says that Descartes\u2019 work \u201cis not ... mere numerical algebra, but what may for want of a better name be called the algebra of line segments. Its symbolism is the same as that of numerical algebra; ....\u201d/nFor example, in Apollonius a line segment AB (the line between Point A and Point B) is also the numerical length of the segment. It can have any length. AB therefore becomes the same as an algebraic variable, such as x (the unknown), to which any value might be assigned; e.g., x=3./nVariables are defined in Apollonius by such word statements as \u201clet AB be the distance from any point on the section to the diameter,\u201d a practice that continues in algebra today. Every student of basic algebra must learn to convert \u201cword problems\u201d to algebraic variables and equations, to which the rules of algebra apply in solving for x. Apollonius had no such rules. His solutions are geometric./nRelationships not readily amenable to pictorial solutions were beyond his grasp; however, his repertory of pictorial solutions came from a pool of complex geometric solutions generally not known (or required) today. One well-known exception is the indispensable Pythagorean Theorem, even now represented by a right triangle with squares on its sides illustrating an expression such as a2 + b2 = c2. The Greek geometers called those terms \u201cthe square on AB,\u201d etc. Similarly, the area of a rectangle formed by AB and CD was \"the rectangle on AB and CD.\"/nThese concepts gave the Greek geometers algebraic access to linear functions and quadratic functions, which latter the conic sections are. They contain powers of 1 or 2 respectively. Apollonius had not much use for cubes (featured in solid geometry), even though a cone is a solid. His interest was in conic sections, which are plane figures. Powers of 4 and up were beyond visualization, requiring a degree of abstraction not available in geometry, but ready at hand in algebra./nAll ordinary measurement of length in public units, such as inches, using standard public devices, such as a ruler, implies public recognition of a Cartesian grid; that is, a surface divided into unit squares, such as one square inch, and a space divided into unit cubes, such as one cubic inch. The ancient Greek units of measurement had provided such a grid to Greek mathematicians since the Bronze Age. \nPrior to Apollonius, Menaechmus and Archimedes had already started locating their figures on an implied window of the common grid by referring to distances conceived to be measured from a left-hand vertical line marking a low measure and a bottom horizontal line marking a low measure, the directions being rectilinear, or perpendicular to one another.[23] These edges of the window become, in the Cartesian coordinate system, the axes. One specifies the rectilinear distances of any point from the axes as the coordinates. The ancient Greeks did not have that convention. They simply referred to distances./nApollonius does have a standard window in which he places his figures. Vertical measurement is from a horizontal line he calls the \u201cdiameter.\u201d  The word is the same in Greek as it is in English, but the Greek is somewhat wider in its comprehension.[24]  If the figure of the conic section is cut by a grid of parallel lines, the diameter bisects all the line segments included between the branches of the figure. It must pass through the vertex (koruphe, \"crown\"). A diameter thus comprises open figures such as a parabola as well as closed, such as a circle. There is no specification that the diameter must be perpendicular to the parallel lines, but Apollonius uses only rectilinear ones./nThe rectilinear distance from a point on the section to the diameter is termed tetagmenos in Greek, etymologically simply \u201cextended.\u201d  As it is only ever extended \u201cdown\u201d (kata-) or \u201cup\u201d (ana-), the translators interpret it as ordinate. In that case the diameter becomes the x-axis and the vertex the origin. The y-axis then becomes a tangent to the curve at the vertex. The abscissa is then defined as the segment of the diameter between the ordinate and the vertex./nUsing his version of a coordinate system, Apollonius manages to develop in pictorial form the geometric equivalents of the equations for the conic sections, which raises the question of whether his coordinate system can be considered Cartesian. There are some differences. The Cartesian system is to be regarded as universal, covering all figures in all space applied before any calculation is done. It has four quadrants divided by the two crossed axes. Three of the quadrants include negative coordinates meaning directions opposite the reference axes of zero./nApollonius has no negative numbers, does not explicitly have a number for zero, and does not develop the coordinate system independently of the conic sections. He works essentially only in Quadrant 1, all positive coordinates. Carl Boyer, a modern historian of mathematics, therefore says:[25]/nHowever, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed a posteriori upon a given curve in order to study its properties .... Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry..../nNevertheless, according to Boyer, Apollonius' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and his work seems to anticipate analytical geometry.[25]\nApollonius occupies some sort of intermediate niche between the grid system of conventional measurement and the fully developed Cartesian Coordinate System of Analytic Geometry. In reading Apollonius, one must take care not to assume modern meanings for his terms./nApollonius uses the \"Theory of Proportions\" as expressed in Euclid\u2019s Elements, Books 5 and 6. Devised by Eudoxus of Cnidus, the theory is intermediate between purely graphic methods and modern number theory. A standard decimal number system is lacking, as is a standard treatment of fractions. The propositions, however, express in words rules for manipulating fractions in arithmetic. Heath proposes that they stand in place of multiplication and division.[26]/nBy the term \u201cmagnitude\u201d  Eudoxus hoped to go beyond numbers to a general sense of size, a meaning it still retains. With regard to the figures of Euclid, it most often means numbers, which was the Pythagorean approach. Pythagoras believed the universe could be characterized by quantities, which belief has become the current scientific dogma. Book V of Euclid begins by insisting that a magnitude (megethos, \u201csize\u201d) must be divisible evenly into units (meros, \u201cpart\u201d). A magnitude is thus a multiple of units. They do not have to be standard measurement units, such as meters or feet. One unit can be any designated line segment./nThere follows perhaps the most useful fundamental definition ever devised in science: the ratio (Greek logos, meaning roughly \u201cexplanation.\u201d) is a statement of relative magnitude. Given two magnitudes, say of segments AB and CD. the ratio of AB to CD, where CD is considered unit, is the number of CD in AB; for example, 3 parts of 4, or 60 parts per million, where ppm still uses the \u201cparts\u201d terminology. The ratio is the basis of the modern fraction, which also still means \u201cpart,\u201d or \u201cfragment\u201d,  from the same Latin root as fracture.\nThe ratio is the basis of mathematical prediction in the logical structure called a \u201cproportion\u201d  (Greek analogos). The proportion states that if two segments, AB and CD, have the same ratio as two others, EF and GH, then AB and CD are proportional to EF and GH, or, as would be said in Euclid, AB is to CD as EF is to GH./nAlgebra reduces this general concept to the expression AB/CD = EF/GH. Given any three of the terms, one can calculate the fourth as an unknown. Rearranging the above equation, one obtains AB = (CD/GH)\u2022EF, in which, expressed as y = kx, the CD/GH is known as the \u201cconstant of proportionality.\u201d The Greeks had little difficulty with taking multiples (Greek pollaplasiein), probably by successive addition./nApollonius uses ratios almost exclusively of line segments and areas, which are designated by squares and rectangles. The translators have undertaken to use the colon notation introduced by Leibniz in Acta Eruditorum, 1684.[27] Here is an example from Conics, Book I, on Proposition 11:", "35220701": "Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Rohn (January 25, 1855 in Schwanheim \u2013 August 4, 1920 in Leipzig) was a German mathematician, who studied geometry./nRohn studied in Darmstadt, Leipzig and Munich, initially engineering but then mathematics by the influence of Alexander von Brill, among the others.

Despite leaving university without a degree, he studied mathematics and trained as a school teacher, eventually teaching mathematics, physics, botany and gymnastics.[2] He later received an honorary doctorate and became professor of mathematics in Berlin./nAmong many other contributions, Weierstrass  formalized the definition of the continuity of a function and complex analysis, proved the intermediate value theorem and the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass theorem, and used the latter to study the properties of continuous functions on closed bounded intervals./nWeierstrass was born into a Roman Catholic family in Ostenfelde, a village near Ennigerloh, in the Province of Westphalia.[3]/nWeierstrass was the son of Wilhelm Weierstrass, a government official, and Theodora Vonderforst both of whom were Catholic Rhinelanders. His interest in mathematics began while he was a gymnasium student at the Theodorianum in Paderborn.  He was sent to the University of Bonn upon graduation to prepare for a government position. Because his studies were to be in the fields of law, economics, and finance, he was immediately in conflict with his hopes to study mathematics. He resolved the conflict by paying little heed to his planned course of study but continuing private study in mathematics. The outcome was that he left the university without a degree. He then studied mathematics at the M\u00fcnster Academy (which was even then famous for mathematics) and his father was able to obtain a place for him in a teacher training school in M\u00fcnster.  Later he was certified as a teacher in that city. During this period of study, Weierstrass attended the lectures of Christoph Gudermann and became interested in elliptic functions./nIn 1843 he taught in Deutsch Krone in West Prussia and since 1848 he taught at the Lyceum Hosianum in Braunsberg.[4] Besides mathematics he also taught physics, botany, and gymnastics.[3]/nWeierstrass may have had an illegitimate child named Franz with the widow of his friend Carl Wilhelm Borchardt.[5]/nAfter 1850 Weierstrass suffered from a long period of illness, but was able to publish mathematical articles that brought him fame and distinction. The University of K\u00f6nigsberg conferred an honorary doctor's degree on him on 31 March 1854. In 1856 he took a chair at the Gewerbeinstitut in Berlin (an institute to educate technical workers which would later merge with the Bauakademie to form the Technical University of Berlin). In 1864 he became professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Berlin, which later became the Humboldt Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin./nIn 1870, at the age of fifty-five, Weierstrass met Sofia Kovalevsky whom he tutored privately after failing to secure her admission to the university.  They had a fruitful intellectual, and kindly personal relationship that \"far transcended the usual teacher-student relationship\". He mentored her for four years, and regarded her as his best student, helping to secure a doctorate for her from Heidelberg University without the need for an oral thesis defense.  He was immobile for the last three years of his life, and died in Berlin from pneumonia.[6]/nWeierstrass was interested in the soundness of calculus, and at the time there were somewhat ambiguous definitions of the foundations of calculus so that important theorems could not be proven with sufficient rigour.  Although Bolzano had developed a reasonably rigorous definition of a limit as early as 1817 (and possibly even earlier) his work remained unknown to most of the mathematical community until years later,\nand many mathematicians had only vague definitions of limits and continuity of functions./nThe basic idea behind Delta-epsilon proofs is, arguably, first found in the works of Cauchy in the 1820s.[7][8]\nCauchy did not clearly distinguish between continuity and uniform continuity on an interval. Notably, in his 1821 Cours d'analyse, Cauchy argued that the (pointwise) limit of (pointwise) continuous functions was itself (pointwise) continuous, a statement that is false in general. The correct statement is rather that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous (also, the uniform limit of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous).\nThis required the concept of uniform convergence, which was first observed by Weierstrass's advisor, Christoph Gudermann, in an 1838 paper, where Gudermann noted the phenomenon but did not define it or elaborate on it. Weierstrass saw the importance of the concept, and both formalized it and applied it widely throughout the foundations of calculus./nThe formal definition of continuity of a function, as formulated by Weierstrass, is as follows:/nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n is continuous at \n\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle x=x_{0}}\n\n if \n\n\n\n\n\u2200\n\u00a0\n\u03b5\n>\n0\n\u00a0\n\u2203\n\u00a0\n\u03b4\n>\n0\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\forall \\ \\varepsilon >0\\ \\exists \\ \\delta >0}\n\n such that for every \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n in the domain of \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n, \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n|\n\nx\n\u2212\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n|\n\n<\n\u03b4\n\u21d2\n\n|\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\u2212\nf\n(\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n|\n\n<\n\u03b5\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle \\ |x-x_{0}|<\\delta \\Rightarrow |f(x)-f(x_{0})|<\\varepsilon .}\n\n In simple English,  \n\n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n is continuous at a point \n\n\n\n\nx\n=\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\displaystyle x=x_{0}}\n\n if for each \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n close enough to \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n\n, the function value \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n is very close to \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x_{0})}\n\n, where the \"close enough\" restriction typically depends on the desired closeness of \n\n\n\nf\n(\n\nx\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x_{0})}\n\n  to \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x).}\n\n\nUsing this definition, he proved the Intermediate Value Theorem.

Using the apparatus of analysis that he helped to develop, Weierstrass was able to give a complete reformulation of the theory that paved the way for the modern study of the calculus of variations. Among several axioms, Weierstrass established a necessary condition for the existence of strong extrema of variational problems. He also helped devise the Weierstrass\u2013Erdmann condition, which gives sufficient conditions for an extremal to have a corner along a given extremum and allows one to find a minimizing curve for a given integral./nThe lunar crater Weierstrass and the asteroid 14100 Weierstrass are named after him.

He made important contributions to the areas of differential calculus over commutative algebras, the algebraic theory of differential operators, homological algebra, differential geometry and algebraic topology, mechanics and mathematical physics, the geometrical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and secondary calculus.[1]/nA.M. Vinogradov was born on 18 February 1938 in Novorossiysk. His father, Mikhail Ivanovich Vinogradov, was a hydraulics scientist; his mother, Ilza Alexandrovna Firer, was a medical doctor. Among his more distant ancestors, his great-grandfather, Anton Smagin, was a self-taught peasant and a deputy of the State Duma of the second convocation.[1]/nBetween 1955 and 1960 Vinogradov studied at the Mechanics and Mathematics Department of Moscow State University (Mech-mat). He pursued a PhD at the same institution, defending his thesis in 1964, under the supervision of V.G. Boltyansky.[2]/nAfter teaching for one year at the Moscow Mining Institute, in 1965 he received a position at the Department of Higher Geometry and Topology of Moscow State University. He obtained his habilitation degree (doktorskaya dissertatsiya) in 1984 at the Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Science in Novosibirsk in Russia. In 1990 he left the Soviet Union for Italy, and from 1993 to 2010 was professor in geometry at the University of Salerno.[1]/nVinogradov published his first works in number theory, together with B.N. Delaunay and D.B. Fuchs, when he was a second year undergraduate student. By the end of his undergraduate years he changed research interests and started working on algebraic topology. His PhD thesis was devoted to homotopic properties of the embedding spaces of circles into the 2-sphere or the 3-disk. He continued working in algebraic and differential topology \u2013 in particular, on the Adams spectral sequence \u2013 until the early seventies.[3]/nBetween the sixties and the seventies, inspired by the ideas of Sophus Lie, Vinogradov changed once more research interests and began to investigate the foundations of the geometric theory of partial differential equations. Having become familiar with the work of Spencer, Goldschmidt and Quillen on formal integrability, he turned his attention to the algebraic (in particular, cohomological) component of that theory. In 1972, he published a short note containing what he called the main functors of the differential calculus over commutative algebras.[4]/nVinogradov\u2019s approach to nonlinear differential equations as geometric objects, with their general theory and applications, is developed in details in some monographs[5][6][7] as well as in some articles.[8][9][10] He recast infinitely prolonged differential equations into a category[11] whose objects, called diffieties, are studied in the framework of what he called secondary calculus (by analogy with secondary quantization).[12][13][14] One of the central parts of this theory is based on the \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\cal {C}}}\n\n-spectral sequence (now known as the Vinogradov spectral sequence).[15][16][17] The first term of this spectral sequence gives a unified cohomological approach to various notions and statements, including the Lagrangian formalism with constraints, conservation laws, cosymmetries, the Noether theorem, and the Helmholtz criterion in the inverse problem of the calculus of variations (for arbitrary nonlinear differential operators). A particular case of the \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\cal {C}}}\n\n-spectral sequence (for an \u201cempty\u201d equation, i.e., for the space of infinite jets) is the so-called variational bicomplex.[18]/nFurthermore, Vinogradov introduced a new bracket on the graded algebra of linear transformations of a cochain complex.[19] The Vinogradov bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity modulo a coboundary. Vinogradov\u2019s construction is a precursor of the general concept of a derived bracket on a differential Leibniz algebra introduced by Kosmann-Schwarzbach in 1996.[20] These results were also applied to Poisson geometry.[21][22]/nTogether with Peter Michor\u00a0[de], Vinogradov was concerned with the analysis and comparison of various generalizations of Lie (super) algebras, including \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{\\infty }}\n\n algebras and Filippov algebras.[23] He also developed a theory of compatibility of Lie algebra structures and proved that any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field or over \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n can be assembled in a few steps from two elementary constituents, that he called dyons and triadons.[24][25] Furthermore, he speculated that this particle-like structures could be related to the ultimate structure of elementary particles./nVinogradov's research interests were also motivated by problems of contemporary physics \u2013 for example the structure of Hamiltonian mechanics,[26][27] the dynamics of acoustic beams,[28] the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (the so-called Kadomtsev-Pogutse equations appearing in the stability theory of high-temperature plasma in tokamaks)[29] and mathematical questions in general relativity.[30][31][10] Considerable attention to the mathematical understanding of the fundamental physical notion of observable is given in a book written by Vinogradov jointly with several participants of his seminar, under the pen name of Jet Nestruev.[7]/nFrom 1967 until 1990, Vinogradov headed a research seminar at Mekhmat, which became a prominent feature in the mathematical life of Moscow. In 1978, he was one of the organisers and first lecturers in the so-called People's University for students who were not accepted to Mekhmat because they were ethnically Jewish (he ironically called this school the \u201cPeople\u2019s Friendship University\u201d). In 1985, he created a laboratory that studied various aspects of the geometry of differential equations at the Institute of Programming Systems in Pereslavl-Zalessky and was its scientific supervisor until his departure for Italy.[1]/nVinogradov was one of the initial founder of the mathematical journal Differential Geometry and its Applications, remaining one of the editors from 1991 to his last days.[32] A special issue of the journal, devoted to the geometry of PDEs, was published in his memory.[33]/nIn 1993 he was one of the promoters of the Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute in Mathematical Physics in Vienna.[34] In 1997 he organised the large conference Secondary Calculus and Cohomological Physics in Moscow,[13] which was followed by a series of small conferences called Current Geometry that took place in Italy from 2000 to 2010.[35]/nFrom 1998 to 2019, Vinogradov organised and directed the so-called Diffiety Schools in Italy, Russia, and Poland,[36] in which a wide range of courses were taught, in order to prepare students and young researchers to work on the theory of diffieties and secondary calculus.[37][38]/nHe supervised 19 PhD students.[2]", "2583876": "Sir Franz Arthur Friedrich Schuster FRS FRSE[1] (12 September 1851 \u2013 14 October 1934) was a German-born British physicist known for his work in spectroscopy, electrochemistry, optics, X-radiography and the application of harmonic analysis to physics. Schuster's integral is named after him.[2] He contributed to making the University of Manchester a centre for the study of physics.[3][4]/nArthur Schuster was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany the son of Francis Joseph Schuster, a cotton merchant and banker, and his wife Marie Pfeiffer.[5]/nSchuster's parents were married in 1849, converted from Judaism to Christianity, and brought up their children in that faith. In 1869, his father moved to Manchester where the family textile business was based. Arthur, who had been to school in Frankfurt and was studying in Geneva, joined his parents in 1870 and he and the other children became British citizens in 1875./nFrom his childhood, Schuster had been interested in science and after working for a year (1870/71) for the family firm of Schuster Brothers in Manchester, he persuaded his father to let him study at Owens College. He studied mathematics under Thomas Barker and physics under Balfour Stewart, and began research with Henry Roscoe on the spectra of hydrogen and nitrogen. He spent a year with Gustav Kirchhoff at the University of Heidelberg, and having gained his PhD, returned to Owens as an unpaid demonstrator in physics. Schuster later used his family's wealth to buy material and equipment and to endow readerships in mathematical physics at Manchester and meteorology at the University of Cambridge. He also contributed to the Royal Society and the International Union for Co-operation in Solar Research./nAfter a further period of study in Germany with Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Hermann von Helmholtz, he returned to England, where his knowledge of spectrum analysis led to him being appointed to lead an expedition to Siam, to photograph the coronal spectrum during the total solar eclipse of 6 April 1875. This was an important appointment for such a junior scientist. On the way, he wrote a letter dated 21 February 1875, to Nature describing his observation of the \"green flash\" phenomenon./nOn his return to Manchester in 1875, he began research on electricity and then went on to spend five years at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. His status there was quite unofficial; he was neither a student nor a fellow. He worked with James Clerk Maxwell and with Rayleigh. In 1881, he was appointed to the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at Owens, by now one of the colleges of the new Victoria University. He succeeded his teacher Balfour Stewart as professor of physics in 1888. This appointment gave him the opportunity to establish a large, active teaching and research department. In 1900 a new laboratory, for which he had fought and which he had designed, was officially opened. It was the fourth largest in the world. The laboratory quickly became a serious rival to the Cavendish; see Manchester Science Hall of Fame. Much of this later fame was associated with Ernest Rutherford who succeeded Schuster as Langworthy Professor in 1907. Schuster resigned from the chair, partly for health reasons and partly to promote the cause of international science. He ensured that Rutherford would succeed him./nSchuster is credited with coining the concept of antimatter in  two letters to Nature in 1898.  He hypothesized antiatoms, and whole antimatter solar systems, which would yield energy if the atoms combined with atoms of normal matter. His hypothesis was given a mathematical foundation by the work of Paul Dirac in 1928, which predicted antiparticles and later led to their discovery.[6][7]/nSchuster is perhaps most widely remembered for his periodogram analysis, a technique which was long the main practical tool for identifying statistically important frequencies present in a time series of observations. He first used this form of harmonic analysis in 1897 to disprove C. G. Knott's claim of periodicity in earthquake occurrences. He went on to apply the technique to analysing sunspot activity.

He went on to lecture in the history of mechanics there from 1896 to 1899, after working as assistant to Giuseppe Peano and Vito Volterra. He resigned his university post in 1899 so that he could pursue his independent studies, making a living from high-school mathematics teaching. During his lifetime he became internationally known, his writings having been translated into English, French, and Polish, though he was largely forgotten after his death in Rome. He was rediscovered in the late 1950s. He did not publish any complete books, but left about 200 essays and reviews across a range of academic disciplines./nVailati's view of philosophy was that it provided a preparation and the tools for scientific work. For that reason, and because philosophy should be neutral between rival beliefs, conceptions, theoretical structures, etc., the philosopher should avoid the use of special technical language, but should use the language that he finds used in those areas in which he is interested. That is not to say that the philosopher should merely accept whatever he finds; an ordinary-language term may be problematic, but its deficiencies should be corrected rather than replacing it with some new technical term./nHis view of truth and meaning was influenced by philosophers such as C.S. Peirce and Ernst Mach. He carefully distinguished between meaning and truth: \"the question of determining what we mean when we propound a given proposition is entirely different from the question of deciding whether it is true or false.[1] Nevertheless, having decided what is meant, the work of deciding whether it is true or false is crucial. Vailati held a moderate positivist view, in both science and philosophy:/n\"it must be demanded of anybody who advances a thesis that he be capable of indicating the facts which according to him should obtain (or have obtained) if his thesis were true, and also their difference from other facts which according to him would obtain (or have obtained) if it were not true\"[2]/nVailati's influences and contacts were many and varied, belying the oversimple label often attached to him: \"the Italian pragmatist\". While owing much to Peirce and William James (between whose thought he was one of the first to distinguish), he also acknowledged the influence of Plato and George Berkeley (both of whom he saw as important precursors of, or influences on, pragmatism), Gottfried Leibniz, Victoria Welby-Gregory, G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Peano, and Franz Brentano. He corresponded with many of his contemporaries./nHis early work included papers on symbolic logic, focusing on its r\u00f4le in philosophy, and distinguishing between logic and psychology and epistemology./nVailata's main historical interests concerned mechanics, logic, and geometry, and he was an important contributor to a number of areas, including the study of post-Aristotelian Greek mechanics, of Galileo's predecessors, of the notion and r\u00f4le of definition in the work of Plato and Euclid, of mathematical influences on logic and epistemology, and of the non-Euclidean geometry of Gerolamo Saccheri. He was particularly interested in the ways in which what might be seen as the same problems are addressed and dealt with at different times./nHis historical work was interrelated with his philosophical work, involving the same fundamental views and methodology. Vailati saw the two as differing in approach rather than subject matter, and believed that there should be co-operation between philosophers and scientists in the pursuit of historical studies. He also held that a complete history demanded that one take into account the relevant social background./nOf a certain interest is the participation of Vailati in the scientific activity of the chair of \"Calculus infinitesimal\" held by Giuseppe Peano. We are in Turin in 1892. The period is full of Prolusions and there are the emergence of disciplines such as anthropology and sociology, which have produced a new scientific concept in the nineteenth century.[3] The Turin Prolusions (1896-1898) open the horizon to new discoveries and to the formulations of scientific theories and hypotheses concerning the relationship between science and its history.

After some misadventures (he was robbed by either pirates or fraudulent customs officials) he went to Athens, possibly for litigation, where he became a leading mathematician./nOn Chios, Hippocrates may have been a pupil of the mathematician and astronomer Oenopides of Chios. In his mathematical work there probably was some Pythagorean influence too, perhaps via contacts between Chios and the neighboring island of Samos, a center of Pythagorean thinking: Hippocrates has been described as a 'para-Pythagorean', a philosophical 'fellow traveler'. \"Reduction\" arguments such as reductio ad absurdum argument (or proof by contradiction) have been traced to him, as has the use of power to denote the square of a line.[1]/nThe major accomplishment of Hippocrates is that he was the first to write a systematically organized geometry textbook, called Elements (\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1, Stoicheia), that is, basic theorems, or building blocks of mathematical theory. From then on, mathematicians from all over the ancient world could, at least in principle, build on a common framework of basic concepts, methods, and theorems, which stimulated the scientific progress of mathematics./nOnly a single, famous fragment of Hippocrates' Elements is existent, embedded in the work of Simplicius. In this fragment the area is calculated of some so-called Hippocratic lunes. This was part of a research program to square the circle, that is, to construct a square with the same area as a circle. The strategy, apparently, was to divide a circle into a number of crescent-shaped parts. If it were possible to calculate the area of each of those parts, then the area of the circle as a whole would be known too.[citation needed] Only much later was it proven (by Ferdinand von Lindemann, in 1882) that this approach had no chance of success, because the factor pi (\u03c0) is transcendental. The number \u03c0 is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle, and also the ratio of the area to the square of the radius./nIn the century after Hippocrates, at least four other mathematicians wrote their own Elements, steadily improving terminology and logical structure. In this way, Hippocrates' pioneering work laid the foundation for Euclid's Elements (c. 325 BC), which was to remain the standard geometry textbook for many centuries. Hippocrates is believed to have originated the use of letters to refer to the geometric points and figures in a proposition, e.g., \"triangle ABC\" for a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C./nTwo other contributions by Hippocrates in the field of mathematics are noteworthy. He found a way to tackle the problem of 'duplication of the cube', that is, the problem of how to construct a cube root. Like the quadrature of the circle, this was another of the so-called three great mathematical problems of antiquity. Hippocrates also invented the technique of 'reduction', that is, to transform specific mathematical problems into a more general problem that is easier to solve. The solution to the more general problem then automatically gives a solution to the original problem./nIn the field of astronomy, Hippocrates tried to explain the phenomena of comets and the Milky Way. His ideas have not been handed down very clearly, but he probably thought both were optical illusions, the result of refraction of solar light by moisture that was exhaled by, respectively, a putative planet near the Sun, and the stars. The fact that Hippocrates thought that light rays originated in our eyes instead of in the object that is seen, adds to the unfamiliar character of his ideas.", "2452874": "Mario Pieri (22 June 1860 \u2013 1 March 1913) was an Italian mathematician who is known for his work on foundations of geometry./nPieri was born in Lucca, Italy, the son of Pellegrino Pieri and Ermina Luporini.

Modine Emeritus Professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. He specializes in Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), fluid dynamics, and numerical analysis. His most influential work lies in CFD, a field he helped modernize from 1970 onwards. An appraisal of his early work has been given by C. Hirsch (1979)[1]/nAn astrophysicist by education, van Leer made lasting contributions to CFD in his five-part article series \u201cTowards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme (1972-1979),\u201d where he extended Godunov's finite-volume scheme to the second order (MUSCL). Also in the series, he developed non-oscillatory interpolation using limiters, an approximate Riemann solver, and discontinuous-Galerkin schemes for unsteady advection. Since joining the University of Michigan's Aerospace Engineering Department (1986), he has worked on convergence acceleration by local preconditioning and multigrid relaxation for Euler and Navier-Stokes problems, unsteady adaptive grids, space-environment modeling, atmospheric flow modeling, extended hydrodynamics for rarefied flows, and discontinuous-Galerkin methods. He retired in 2012, forced to give up research because of progressive blindness./nThroughout his career, van Leer's work has had interdisciplinary characteristic. Starting from astrophysics, he first made an impact on weapons research, followed by aeronautics, then space-weather modeling, atmospheric modeling, surface-water modeling and automotive engine modeling, to name the most important fields./nVan Leer is also an accomplished musician, playing the piano at the age of 5 and composing at 7. His musical education includes two years at the Royal Conservatory for Music of The Hague, Netherlands. As a pianist he was featured in the Winter '96 issue of Michigan Engineering (Engineering and the Arts). As a carillonist, he has played the carillon of Burton Memorial Tower on many football Saturdays. He was the world's first and only CJ (carillon-jockey) based on the North Campus carillon, live streaming from the Lurie Tower./nIn 1993 he gave a full-hour recital on the carillon of the City Hall in Leiden, the town of his alma mater. Van Leer enjoys improvising in the Dutch carillon-playing style; one of his improvisations is included on a 1998 CD featuring both University of Michigan's carillons. His carillon composition \"Lament\"[2] was published in the UM School of Music's carillon music series on the occasion of the annual congress of The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America, Ann Arbor, June 2002. A flute composition by van Leer was performed twice in 1997 by University of Michigan Professor Leone Buyse./nBram van Leer was a doctoral student in astrophysics at Leiden Observatory (1966\u20131970) when he got interested in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the sake of solving cosmic flow problems.

Roe first presented his much used averaging formulas./nNext, van Leer succeeded in circumventing Godunov's barrier theorem (i.e., a monotonicity preserving advection scheme cannot be better than first-order accurate) by limiting the second-order term in the Lax-Wendroff scheme as a function of the non-smoothness of the numerical solution itself. This is a non-linear technique even for a linear equation. Having discovered this basic principle, he planned a series of three articles titled \"Towards the ultimate conservative difference scheme\", which advanced from scalar non-conservative but non-oscillatory (part I[4]) via scalar conservative non-oscillatory (part II[5]) to conservative non-oscillatory Euler (part III[6]). The finite-difference schemes for the Euler equations turned out to be unattractive because of their many terms; a switch to the finite-volume formulation completely cleared this up and led to Part IV[7] (finite-volume scalar) and, finally, Part V[8] (finite-volume Lagrange and Euler) titled, \"A second-order sequel to Godunov's method\", which is his most cited article (approaching 6000 citations on November 1, 2017). This paper[9] was reprinted in 1997 in the 30th anniversary issue of Journal Computational Physics with an introduction by Charles Hirsch./nThe series contains several original techniques that have found their way into the CFD community. In Part II two limiters are presented, later called by van Leer \"double minmod\" (after Osher's \"minmod\" limiter) and its smoothed version \"harmonic\"; the latter limiter is sometimes referred to in the literature as \"van Leer's limiter.\" Part IV, \"A new approach to numerical convection,\" describes a group of 6 second- and third-order schemes that includes two discontinuous-Galerkin schemes with exact time integration. Van Leer was not the only one to break Godunov's barrier using nonlinear limiting; similar techniques were developed independently around the same time by Boris[10] and by V.P. Kolgan, a Russian researcher unknown in the West. In 2011, van Leer devoted an article to Kolgan's contributions [11] and had Kolgan's 1972 TsAGI report reprinted in translation in the Journal of Computational Physics./nAfter the publication of the series (1972\u20131979), van Leer spent two years at ICASE (NASA LaRC), where he was engaged by NASA engineers interested in his numerical expertise. This led to van Leer's differentiable flux-vector splitting[12] and the development of the block-structured codes CFL2D and CFL3D [13][14] which still are heavily used. Other contributions from these years are the review of upwind methods with Harten and Lax,[15] the AMS workshop paper [16] detailing the differences and resemblances between upwind fluxes and Jameson's flux formula, and the conference paper with Mulder[17] on upwind relaxation methods; the latter includes the concept of Switched Evolution-Relaxation (SER) for automatically choosing the time step in an implicit marching scheme./nAfter permanently moving to the U.S., van Leer's first influential paper was \u201cA comparison of numerical flux formulas for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations,[18]\u201d which analyzes numerical flux functions and their suitability for resolving boundary layers in Navier-Stokes calculations. In 1988, he embarked on a very large project, to achieve steady Euler solutions in O(N) operations by a purely explicit methodology. There were three crucial components to this strategy:\n1. Optimally smoothing multistage single-grid schemes for advections\n2. Local preconditioning of the Euler equations\n3. Semi-coarsened multigrid relaxation/nThe first subject was developed in collaboration with his doctoral student, C.H. Tai.[19] The second subject was needed to make the Euler equations look as much scalar as possible. The preconditioning was developed with doctoral student W. -T. Lee.[20] In order to apply this to the discrete scheme, crucial modification had to be made to the original discretization. It turned out that applying the preconditioning to an Euler discretization required a reformulation of the numerical flux function for the sake of preserving accuracy at low Mach numbers. Combining the optimal single grid schemes with the preconditioned Euler discretization was achieved by doctoral student J. F. Lynn.[21] The same strategy for the Navier-Stokes discretization was pursued by D. Lee.[22]/nThe third component, semi-coarsened multigrid relaxation, was developed by van Leer's former student W. A. Mulder (Mulder 1989). This technique is needed to damp certain combinations of high- and low-frequency modes when the grid is aligned with the flow./nIn 1994, van Leer teamed up with Darmofal, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan at the time, to finish the project. The goal of the project was first reached by Darmofal and Siu (Darmofal, and Siu 1999), and later was done more efficiently by van Leer and Nishikawa.[23]/nWhile the multi-grid project was going on, van Leer worked on two more subjects: multi-dimensional Riemann solvers,[24][25] and time-dependent adaptive Cartesian grid.[26] After conclusion of the multigrid project, van Leer continued to work on local preconditioning of the Navier-Stokes equations together with C. Depcik.[27] A 1-D preconditioning was derived that is optimal for all Mach and Reynolds numbers. There is, however, a narrow domain in the (M, Re)-plane where the preconditioned equations admit a growing mode. In practice, such a mode, if it were to arise, should be damped by the time-marching scheme, e.g., an implicit scheme./nIn the last decade of his career, van Leer occupied himself with extended hydrodynamics and discontinuous-Galerkin method. The goal of the first project was to describe rarefied flow up to and including intermediate Knudsen numbers (Kn~1) by a hyperbolic-relaxation system. This works well for subsonic flows and weak shock waves, but stronger shock waves acquire the wrong internal structure.[28][29] For low speed flow, van Leer's doctoral student H. L. Khieu tested the accuracy of the hyperbolic-relaxation formulation was tested by comparing simulations with the numerical results of a full-kinetic solver based on Boltzmann equation.[30] Recent research has demonstrated that a system of second order PDEs derived from the hyperbolic relaxation systems can be entirely successful; for details see Myong Over-reach 2014./nThe second project was the development of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for diffusion operators. It started with the discovery of the recovery method for representing the 1D diffusion operator./nStarting in 2004, the recovery-based DG (RDG)[31] has been shown an accuracy of the order 3p+1 or 3p+2 for even or odd polynomial-space degree p. This result holds for Cartesian grids in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensions, for linear and non-linear diffusion equations that may or may not contain shear terms.[32][33][34][35] On unstructured grids, the RDG was predicted to achieve the order of accuracy of 2p+2; this research unfortunately was not completed before van Leer retired./nVan Leer's early work, especially\u00a0the series \u201cTowards the ultimate conservative difference scheme\u201d\u00a0motivated by the needs of astrophysical modeling, has influenced a wide range of other disciplines; such interdisciplinary knowledge transfer is not self-evident. Exporting scientific ideas from one discipline to another is best done through personal contact. For instance, Van Leer's presence at NASA Langley Research Center from 1979 to 1981 and then in the summers of '81 to '83 led to the development of NASA's CFL2D code and ultimately CFL3D. The transition of ideas between disciplines through publications is a much slower process, as most researchers do not read journals based in fields other than their own expertise./nA case in point is the way Van Leer's ideas, contained in the series \"Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme,\" made their way into Atmospheric General Circulation Modeling (GCM). \u00a0 Although published in the Journal of Computational Physics, which in its early years published key atmospheric research articles, it seems to have gone unnoticed by the GCM community. Thus, the second-order DG advection Scheme III from Towards IV was rediscovered by G.L. Russel and J.A. Lerner in 1981,[36] while the third-order DG advection scheme VI was rediscovered by M.J. Prather in 1986.[37] But Monotonicity-preserving limiters were not included in these works./nIt was not until the atmospheric scientist R.B. Rood[38] from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center published a comprehensive review of publications on advection schemes in 1987 that Van Leer's articles were unlocked to the GCM community. The first application of a monotonicity preserving advection scheme to atmospheric transport was due to D.J. Allen, A.R. Douglass, R.B. Rood, and P.D. Guthrie in 1991.[39] Subsequently, in 1997, Shian-Jiann (S. J.) Lin and Rood,[40] both at NASA Goddard, published a predictor-corrector version of the second-order Godunov method for use in atmospheric dynamics and implemented it in a shallow-water model. Finally, Lin,\u00a0now at the Princeton Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), \u00a0put these ideas into a full non-hydrostatic atmospheric description with Eulerian horizontal and Lagrangian vertical discretizations,[41] named FV3 (Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core). This dynamical core has found its way into the main national weather- and climate-prediction codes. Specifically, FV3 has been chosen as the dynamical core for the Next Generation Global Prediction System project (NGGPS), the latest NCAR Community Climate System Model CESM4, the NOAA-GFDL CM4.0 model, and NASA's GEOS5 model./nIn addition to the above narrative, we list some subjects and papers related to van Leer's interdisciplinary research efforts:/nThree significant review papers by van Leer are:/nIn 2010, van Leer received AIAA Fluid Dynamics award for his lifetime achievement.

From 1943 to 1946 she studied at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, and from 1946 was a teaching assistant there and undertook research advised by Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz./nFrom 1949 to 1951 she was a research assistant at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, as a result of which she received her doctorate.[4]/nIn 1951, she became a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Her supervisor, Jean Leray, suggested that she study the dynamics of the Einstein field equations. He also introduced her to Albert Einstein, whom she consulted with a few times further during her time at the Institute./nIn 1952, Bruhat and her husband were both offered jobs at Marseilles, precipitating her early departure from the Institute. In the same year, she published the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the vacuum Einstein Equations, her most renowned achievement. Her work proves the well-posedness of the Einstein equations, and started the study of dynamics in General Relativity./nIn 1947, she married fellow mathematician L\u00e9once Four\u00e8s. Their daughter Michelle is now (as of 2016) an ecologist. Her doctoral work and early research is under the name Yvonne Four\u00e8s-Bruhat. In 1960, Bruhat and Four\u00e8s divorced, with her later marrying the mathematician Gustave Choquet and changing her last name to Choquet-Bruhat. She and Choquet had two children; her son, Daniel Choquet, is a neuroscientist and her daughter, Genevi\u00e8ve, is a doctor./nIn 1958, she was awarded the CNRS Silver Medal.[5] From 1958 to 1959 she taught at the University of Reims.  In 1960 she became a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie (UPMC) in Paris, and has remained professor or professor emeritus until her retirement in 1992./nAt the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie she continued to make significant contributions to mathematical physics, notably in general relativity, supergravity, and the non-Abelian gauge theories of the standard model. Her work in 1981 with Demetrios Christodoulou showed the existence of global solutions of the Yang-Mills, Higgs, and Spinor Field Equations in 3+1 Dimensions.[6] Additionally in 1984 she made perhaps the first study by a mathematician of supergravity with results that can be extended to the currently important model in D=11 dimensions.[7]/nIn 1978 Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat was elected a correspondent to the Academy of Sciences and on 14 May 1979 became the first woman to be elected a full member. From 1980 to 1983 she was President of the Comit\u00e9 international de relativit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et gravitation (\"International committee on general relativity and gravitation\").  In 1985 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In 1986 she was chosen to deliver the prestigious  Noether Lecture by the Association for Women in Mathematics./nChoquet-Bruhat's best-known research deals with the mathematical nature of the initial data formulation of general relativity. A summary of results can be phrased purely in terms of standard differential geometric objects./nIn this sense, an initial data set can be viewed as the prescription of the submanifold geometry of an embedded spacelike hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold./nOne of Choquet-Bruhat's seminal 1952 results states the following:/nEvery vacuum initial data set (M, g, k) has a development f\u00a0: M \u2192 (M, g) such that g has zero Ricci curvature, and such that every inextendible timelike curve in the Lorentzian manifold (M, g) intersects f(M) exactly once./nBriefly, this can be summarized as saying that (M, g) is a vacuum spacetime for which f(M) is a Cauchy surface. Such a development is called a globally hyperbolic vacuum development. Choquet-Bruhat also proved a uniqueness theorem:/nGiven any two globally hyperbolic vacuum developments f1\u00a0: M \u2192 (M1, g1) and f2\u00a0: M \u2192 (M2, g2) of the same vacuum initial data set, there is an open subset U1 of M1 containing f1(M) and an open subset U2 of M2 containing f1(M), together with an isometry i\u00a0: (U1, g1) \u2192 (U2, g2) such that i(f1(p)) = f2(p) for all p in M./nIn a slightly imprecise form, this says: given any embedded spacelike hypersurface M of a Ricci-flat Lorentzian manifold M, the geometry of M near M is fully determined by the submanifold geometry of M./nIn an article written with Robert Geroch in 1969, Choquet-Bruhat fully clarified the nature of uniqueness. With a two-page argument in point-set topology using Zorn's lemma, they showed that Choquet-Bruhat's above existence and uniqueness theorems automatically imply a global uniqueness theorem:/nAny vacuum initial data set (M, g, k) has a maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum development, meaning a globally hyperbolic vacuum development f\u00a0: M \u2192 (M, g) such that, for any other globally hyperbolic vacuum development f1\u00a0: M \u2192 (M1, g1), there is an open subset U of M containing f(M) and an isometry i\u00a0: M1 \u2192 U such that i(f1(p)) = f(p) for all p in M.Any two maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum developments of the same vacuum initial data are isometric to one another./nIt is now common to study such developments. For instance, the well-known theorem of Demetrios Christodoulou and Sergiu Klainerman on stability of Minkowski space asserts that if (\u211d3, g, k) is a vacuum initial data set with g and k sufficiently close to zero (in a certain precise form), then its maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum development is geodesically complete and geometrically close to Minkowski space./nChoquet-Bruhat's proof makes use of a clever choice of coordinates, the wave coordinates (which are the Lorentzian equivalent to the harmonic coordinates), in which the Einstein equations become a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations, for which well-posedness results can be applied./nArticles/nSurvey articles/nTechnical books/nPopular book", "34926069": "Vijaya Kumar Murty FRSC (born 20 May 1956) is an Indo-Canadian mathematician working primarily in number theory.

He was born in Riga, Latvia, which at that time was a part of Russian Empire. Molien studied associative algebras and polynomial invariants of finite groups./nTheodor Molien's father Eduard Molien was a teacher at the Riga Governorate Gymnasium. Theodor entered that gymnasium in 1872 and graduated in 1879./nIn January 1880 Molien entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu) as a student of astronomy. To support his studies his family also moved to Dorpat (now Tartu). In October 1883 the council of the university gave him the degree of a candidate of astronomy. His thesis \"Bahn des Cometen 1880 III\" was published in Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2510. His further work was supervised by the head of the chair of applied mathematics of the University of Dorpat Anders Lindstedt. In a report to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat Lindstedt acknowledges Molien as having unquestionably exceptional scientific talent (unzweifelhaft ungew\u00f6hnliche wissenschaftliche Begabung)./nIn the autumn of 1883, as part of his studies Molien was sent to Leipzig for three semesters. There he attended lectures by Felix Klein on different fields of mathematics and worked in his seminar. He also attended lectures of Carl Neumann, Eduard Study, Wilhelm Killing and Georg Scheffers. At that time Klein was dealing with deep problems of algebra and theory of functions of a complex variable. Following his suggestion, Molien started to study linear transformations of elliptic functions. The obtained results he submitted to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat as a master thesis titled \"Ueber die lineare Transformation der elliptischen Functionen\". In spring 1885 Molien passed the master's exams and after the defence in the autumn of 1885 he obtained the scientific degree of a Master of Mathematics. In November 1885 he became a docent at the University of Dorpat. This position he held for 15 years./nSummers (that were free from teaching) of 1886, 1888 and 1889 Molien spent in scientific centers of Germany. His interest concentrated on so-called higher complex numbers (nowadays called hypercomplex numbers). His studies resulted in his article \"\u00dcber Systeme h\u00f6herer komplexer Zahlen\" (\"On systems of higher complex numbers\"), published in 1891 in Mathematische Annalen./nOn 30 September 1892, Molien defended his dissertation, also titled \"\u00dcber Systeme h\u00f6herer komplexer Zahlen\". He got the degree of a doctor of pure mathematics. The importance of his work was acknowledged by Georg Frobenius, Sophus Lie and other mathematicians. One of the main results of his dissertation sounds in modern terms as follows: every simple associative algebra over the field of complex numbers is isomorphic to the algebra of square matrices of a suitable order over the same field./nFor his scientific achievements, in 1892 Molien was elected a member of Moscow Mathematical Society. In 1894 French mathematicians awarded him a golden medal dedicated to the seventieth birthday of Charles Hermite. During Dorpat years, Molien had mathematical correspondence with Frobenius and Hurwitz./nSince the University of Dorpat had only one professorship in pure mathematics, Molien had to stay for years at docent's position. Being a docent in Dorpat, Molien prepared and gave different lecture courses: Theory of analytic and elliptic functions, modern geometry and algebra, theory of algebraic equations, number theory, projective geometry, theory of quaternions, history of mathematics and others. Some of these courses were new for the university./nIn 1887 Russian powers decided to change the language of secondary and higher education in Baltic governorates from German to Russian with the deadline 1 January 1895. With the purpose of improving his Russian language, Molien was sent to Moscow for the year 1892./nOnly in December 1900 Molien was given a professor's position, but not in Dorpat, but in the starting Tomsk Technological Institute in Siberia. He became the first professor of mathematics in Siberia. His was given a task of organizing teaching mathematics at the institute. In Tomsk, besides giving courses in mathematical analysis and differential equations, he wrote textbooks and exercise books on these subjects, and also established a mathematical library at the institute./nKnown for his oppositional political views, he had to retire in 1913. Since 1914, Molien was a professor at higher Siberian courses for women in Tomsk, and when in 1917 the faculty of physics and mathematics was opened at the Tomsk State University, he got a professorship there, and stayed at that university until his death on 25 December 1941./nIn Tomsk Molien spent 41 years of his life. These years were scientifically not as fruitful as earlier years./nHe got the title of Honoured Worker of Science./nMolien was interested in chess. In 1897-1898 he was in correspondence with a leading Russian chess player Mikhail Chigorin. He was one of the strongest chess players in Dorpat and was particularly known for his blindfold play (Ken Whyld, personal communication, 1995).

He published only one book, the Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire (Paris, 1824), in which he expressed the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines and laid the foundations of the new discipline: thermodynamics. Carnot's work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but it was later used by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin to formalize the second law of thermodynamics and define the concept of entropy. Driven by purely technical concerns, such as improving the performance of the steam engine, Sadi Carnot's theoretical work laid important foundations for modern science as well as technologies such as the automobile and jet engine./nHis father Lazare Carnot was an eminent mathematician, military engineer, and leader of the French Revolutionary Army./nNicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot was born in Paris at the Palais du Petit-Luxembourg into a family that was distinguished in both science and politics. He was the first son of Lazare Carnot, who chose his son's third given name Sadi (by which he would always be known) after the Persian poet Sadi of Shiraz. Sadi was the elder brother of statesman Hippolyte Carnot and the uncle of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot, who would serve as President of France from 1887 to 1894./nHis father, Lazare Carnot, knowing his son's potential, sent him to Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne in Paris to prepare him for the examinations to \u00c9cole polytechnique. In 1811, at the age of 16, the minimum age possible, Sadi Carnot became a cadet in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris, where his classmates included Michel Chasles and Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique was intended to train engineers for military service, but its professors included such eminent scientists as Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, Fran\u00e7ois Arago, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard, Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette, Jean-Henri Hassenfratz, Antoine Andr\u00e9 Louis Reynaud, and Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson. Thus, the school had become renowned for its mathematical instruction.[1]/nAfter graduating in 1814, Sadi went to study in \u00c9cole du G\u00e9nie at Metz to study the two-year course in military engineering. Sadi then became an officer in the French army's corps of engineers. His father Lazare had served as Napoleon's minister of the interior during the \"Hundred Days\", and, after Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, Lazare was forced into exile. Sadi's position in the army, under the restored Bourbon monarchy of Louis XVIII, became increasingly difficult.[2]/nSadi Carnot was posted to different locations, where he inspected fortifications, tracked plans, and wrote many reports. It appeared that his recommendations were ignored and his career was stagnating.[3] On 15 September 1818 he took a six-month leave to prepare for the entrance examination of Royal Corps of Staff and School of Application for the Service of the General Staff.[2]/nIn 1819, Sadi transferred to the newly formed General Staff in Paris. He remained on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits and received only two-thirds pay. Carnot befriended Nicolas Cl\u00e9ment and Charles-Bernard Desormes and attended lectures on physics and chemistry. He became interested in understanding the limitation to improving the performance of steam engines, which led him to the investigations that became his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, published in 1824./nCarnot retired from the army in 1828, without a pension. He was interned in a private asylum in 1832 as suffering from \"mania\" and \"general delirium\", and he died of cholera shortly thereafter, aged 36, at the hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine.[4] The grave of L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot is still located in the cemetery of Ivry-sur-Seine, with this text imprinted on it: LEONARD SADI - CARNOT\u00a0- PARIS 1ER JUIN 1796\u00a0- IVRY 24 AOUT 1832 -\u00a0EL\u00c8VE DE L'ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE - CAPITAINE DU GENIE\u00a0- PHYSICIEN - FONDATEUR DE LA -\nTHERMO DYNAMIQUE./nWhen Carnot began working on his book, steam engines had achieved widely recognized economic and industrial importance, but there had been no real scientific study of them. Newcomen had invented the first piston-operated steam engine over a century before, in 1712; some 50 years after that, James Watt made his celebrated improvements, which were responsible for greatly increasing the efficiency and practicality of steam engines. Compound engines (engines with more than one stage of expansion) had already been invented, and there was even a crude form of internal-combustion engine, with which Carnot was familiar and which he described in some detail in his book. Although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. In 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades. The prevalent theory of heat was the caloric theory, which regarded heat as a sort of weightless and invisible fluid that flowed when out of equilibrium./nEngineers in Carnot's time had tried, by means such as highly pressurized steam and the use of fluids, to improve the efficiency of engines. In these early stages of engine development, the efficiency of a typical engine\u2014the useful work it was able to do when a given quantity of fuel was burned\u2014was only 3%./nCarnot wanted to answer two questions about the operation of heat engines: \"Is the work available from a heat source potentially unbounded?\" and \"Can heat engines in principle be improved by replacing the steam with some other working fluid or gas?\" He attempted to answer these in a memoir, published as a popular work in 1824 when he was only 27 years old. It was entitled R\u00e9flexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu (\"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\"). The book was plainly intended to cover a rather wide range of topics about heat engines in a rather popular fashion; equations were kept to a minimum and called for little more than simple algebra and arithmetic, except occasionally in the footnotes, where Carnot indulged in a few arguments involving some calculus. He discussed the relative merits of air and steam as working fluids, the merits of various aspects of steam-engine design, and even included some ideas of his own regarding possible practical improvements. The most important part of the book concentrated on an abstract presentation of an idealized engine that could be used to understand and clarify the fundamental principles that are generally applied to all heat engines, independent of their design./nPerhaps the most important contribution Carnot made to thermodynamics was his abstraction of the essential features of the steam engine, as they were known in his day, into a more general and idealized heat engine. This resulted in a model thermodynamic system upon which exact calculations could be made, and avoided the complications introduced by many of the crude features of the contemporary steam-engine. By idealizing the engine, he could arrive at clear and indisputable answers to his original two questions./nHe showed that the efficiency of this idealized engine is a function only of the two temperatures of the reservoirs between which it operates. He did not, however, give the exact form of the function, which was later shown to be (T1\u2212T2)/T1, where T1 is the absolute temperature of the hotter reservoir. (Note: This equation probably came from Kelvin.) No thermal engine operating any other cycle can be more efficient, given the same operating temperatures./nThe Carnot cycle is the most efficient possible engine, not only because of the (trivial) absence of friction and other incidental wasteful processes; the main reason is that it assumes no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures. Carnot knew that the conduction of heat between bodies at different temperatures is a wasteful and irreversible process, which must be eliminated if the heat engine is to achieve maximum efficiency./nRegarding the second point, he also was quite certain that the maximum efficiency attainable did not depend upon the exact nature of the working fluid. He stated this for emphasis as a general proposition:/nThe motive power of heat is independent of the agents employed to realize it; its quantity is fixed solely by the temperatures of the bodies between which is effected, finally, the transfer of caloric./nFor his \"motive power of heat\", we would today say \"the efficiency of a reversible heat engine\"; and rather than \"transfer of caloric\" we would say \"the reversible transfer of entropy \u2206S\" or \"the reversible transfer of heat at a given temperature Q/T\". Carnot knew intuitively that his engine would have the maximum efficiency, but was unable to state what that efficiency would be./nHe concluded:/nThe production of motive power is therefore due in steam engines not to actual consumption of caloric but to its transportation from a warm body to a cold body.[5]/nand/nIn the fall of caloric, motive power undoubtedly increases with the difference of temperature between the warm and cold bodies, but we do not know whether it is proportional to this difference.[6]/nIn an idealized model, the caloric transported from a hot to a cold body by a frictionless heat engine that lacks conductive heat flow, driven by a difference of temperature, yielding work, could also be used to transport the caloric back to the hot body by reversing the motion of the engine consuming the same amount of work, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. Carnot further postulated that no caloric is lost during the operation of his idealized engine. The process being completely reversible executed by this kind of heat engine is the most efficient possible process. The assumption that heat conduction not driven by a temperature difference can exist, so that no caloric is lost by the engine, guided him to design the Carnot-cycle to be operated by his idealized engine. The cycle is consequently composed of adiabatic processes where no heat/caloric \u2206S = 0 flows and isothermal processes where heat is transferred \u2206S > 0 but no temperature difference \u2206T = 0 exists. The proof of the existence of a maximum efficiency for heat engines is as follows:/nAs the cycle named after Carnot doesn't waste caloric, the reversible engine has to use this cycle. Imagine now two large bodies, a hot and a cold one. He postulates now the existence of a heat machine with a greater efficiency. We couple now two idealized machines \u2014but of different efficiencies\u2014 and connect them to the same hot and the same cold body. The first and less efficient one lets a constant amount of entropy \u2206S = Q/T flow from hot to cold during each cycle, yielding an amount of work denoted W. If we use now this work to power the other \u2014more efficient\u2014 machine, it would, using the amount of work W gained during each cycle by the first machine, make an amount of entropy \u2206S' > \u2206S flow from the cold to the hot body. The net effect is a flow of \u2206S' \u2212 \u2206S \u2260 0 of entropy from the cold to the hot body, while no net work is done. Consequently, the cold body is cooled down and the hot body rises in temperature. As the difference of temperature rises, now the yielding of work by the first is greater in the successive cycles and due to the second engine difference in temperature of the two bodies stretches by each cycle even more. In the end this set of machines would be a perpetuum mobile that cannot exist. This proves that the assumption of the existence of a more efficient engine was wrong, so that a heat engine that operates the Carnot cycle must be the most efficient one. This means that a frictionless heat engine that lacks conductive heat flow driven by a difference of temperature shows maximum possible efficiency./nCarnot concludes further that the choice of the working fluid, its density or the volume occupied by it cannot change this maximum efficiency. Using the equivalence of any working gas used in heat engines, he deduced that the difference in the specific heat of a gas measured at constant pressure and that measured at constant volume must be constant for all gases.\nBy comparing the operation of his hypothetical heat-engines for two different volumes occupied by the same amount of working gas he correctly deduces the relation between entropy and volume for an isothermal process:/n\u0394\nS\n\u221d\nln\n\u2061\n\n\nV\n\nV\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta S\\propto \\ln {\\frac {V}{V_{0}}}.}/nCarnot's book received very little attention from his contemporaries. The only reference to it within a few years after its publication was in a review in the periodical Revue Encyclop\u00e9dique, which was a journal that covered a wide range of topics in literature. The impact of the work had only become apparent once it was modernized by \u00c9mile Clapeyron in 1834 and then further elaborated upon by Clausius and Kelvin, who together derived from it the concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. Rankine, who introduced the term potential energy in 1853, was later made aware that an equivalent phrase, \"in its purely mechanical sense, had been anticipated by Carnot\", who had employed the term force vive virtuelle.[7]/nOn Carnot's religious views, he was a Philosophical theist.[8] He believed in divine causality, stating that \"what to an ignorant man is chance, cannot be chance to one better instructed,\" but he did not believe in divine punishment. He criticized established religion, though at the same time spoke in favor of \"the belief in an all-powerful Being, who loves us and watches over us.\"[9]/nHe was a reader of Blaise Pascal, Moli\u00e8re and Jean de La Fontaine.[10]/nCarnot died during a cholera epidemic in 1832, at the age of 36. (Asimov 1982, p.\u00a0332) \nBecause of the contagious nature of cholera, many of Carnot's belongings and writings were buried together with him after his death. As a consequence, only a handful of his scientific writings survived./nAfter the publication of Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, the book quickly went out of print and for some time was very difficult to obtain. Kelvin, for one, had a difficult time getting a copy of Carnot's book. In 1890 an English translation of the book was published by R. H. Thurston;[11] this version has been reprinted in recent decades by Dover and by Peter Smith, most recently by Dover in 2005. Some of Carnot's posthumous manuscripts have also been translated into English./nCarnot published his book in the heyday of steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were better because of the higher temperature of the consequent hot reservoir. Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain why one existing practice was superior to others. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its hot reservoir is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories[12] to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.", "22408768": "Randall J.

Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit Roger Joseph Boscovich and to Leonardo da Vinci for his vast range of interests, and has been honoured with the title \"Master of a Hundred Arts\".[2] He taught for more than 40\u00a0years at the Roman College, where he set up a wunderkammer. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades./nKircher claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphic writing of the ancient Egyptian language, but most of his assumptions and translations in the field turned out to be wrong. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the Coptic languages, and some commentators[who?] regard him as the founder of Egyptology. Kircher was also fascinated with Sinology and wrote an encyclopedia of China, where he revealed the early presence of Nestorian Christians while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity./nKircher's work in geology included studies of volcanoes and fossils. One of the first researchers to observe microbes through a microscope, Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the plague was caused by an infectious microorganism and in suggesting effective measures to prevent its spread. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various automatons and the first megaphone. The invention of the magic lantern has been misattributed to Kircher,[3] although he conducted a study of the principles involved in his Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae./nA scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the rationalism of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and others. In the late 20th\u00a0century, however, the aesthetic qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as \"a giant among seventeenth-century scholars\", and \"one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain\".[4] Another scholar, Edward\u00a0W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as \"the last Renaissance man\". In A Man of Misconceptions, his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie wrote \"many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,\"[5] but he was \"a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness,\" whose work was read \"by the smartest minds of the time.\"[6]/nKircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in Geisa, Buchonia, near Fulda (Thuringia, Germany). From his birthplace, he took the epithets Bucho, Buchonius and Fuldensis which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the novitiate of the Society./nThe youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught Hebrew by a rabbi[7] in addition to his studies at school. He studied philosophy and theology at Paderborn,[3] but fled to Cologne in 1622 to escape advancing Protestant forces.[citation needed] On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen Rhine \u2014 one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, traveling to Heiligenstadt, he was caught and nearly hanged by a party of Protestant soldiers.[citation needed]/nFrom 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his regency period in Koblenz as a teacher. This was followed by assignment to Heiligenstadt, where he taught mathematics, Hebrew and Syriac, and produced a show of fireworks and moving scenery for the visiting Elector Archbishop of Mainz, showing early evidence of his interest in mechanical devices. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1628[3] and became professor of ethics and mathematics at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs./nIn 1631, while still at W\u00fcrzburg, Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. W\u00fcrzburg was attacked shortly afterwards and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher privately insisted that he had not relied on it.[8] This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the Ars Magnesia, reporting his research on magnetism), but having been caught up in the Thirty Years' War he was driven to the papal University of Avignon in France. In 1633 he was called to Vienna by the emperor to succeed Kepler as Mathematician to the Habsburg court. On the intervention of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to Rome to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna./nOn the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed destination. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634[9] he taught mathematics, physics and Oriental languages at the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied malaria and the plague, amassing a collection of antiquities, which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum./nIn 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a church said to have been constructed by Constantine on the site of Saint Eustace's vision of a crucifix in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the Santuario della Mentorella\u00a0[it], and his heart was buried in the church upon his death.[citation needed]/n/nKircher published many substantial books on a wide variety of subjects such as Egyptology, geology, and music theory. His syncretic approach disregarded conventional boundaries between disciplines: his Magnes, for example, ostensibly discussed magnetism, but also explored other modes of attraction such as gravity and love. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work is Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652\u201354), a vast study of Egyptology and comparative religion.[10]/nHis books, written in Latin, were widely circulated in the 17th century, and contributed to the wide dissemination of scientific information. Kircher is not considered to have made any significant original contributions, although some discoveries and inventions (e.g., the magic lantern) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.[10]/nIn his foreword to Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:[11]/n\"Nothing is more beautiful than to know all.\"/nThe last known example of Egyptian hieroglyphics dates from AD 394, after which all knowledge of hieroglyphics was lost.[12] Until Thomas Young and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion found the key to hieroglyphics in the 19th century, the main authority was the 4th-century Greek grammarian Horapollon, whose chief contribution was the misconception that hieroglyphics were \"picture writing\" and that future translators should look for symbolic meaning in the pictures.[13]/nThe first modern study of hieroglyphics came with Piero Valeriano Bolzani's Hieroglyphica (1556).[12] Kircher was the most famous of the \"decipherers\" between ancient and modern times and the most famous Egyptologist of his day.[14] In his Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta (1643), Kircher called hieroglyphics \"this language hitherto unknown in Europe, in which there are as many pictures as letters, as many riddles as sounds, in short as many mazes to be escaped from as mountains to be climbed\".[14] While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars, and Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study./nKircher's interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at Speyer. He learned Coptic in 1633 and published its first grammar in 1636, the Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus. Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of hieroglyphs with his Lingua aegyptiaca restituta. Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of ancient Egyptian.[14][15] For this Kircher has been considered the true \"founder of Egyptology\", because his work was conducted \"before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars\".[15] He also recognized the relationship between hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts./nBetween 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of \"translations\" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies.[14] However, according to Steven Frimmer, \"none of them even remotely fitted the original texts\".[14] In Oedipus Aegyptiacus, Kircher argued under the impression of the Hieroglyphica that ancient Egyptian was the language spoken by Adam and Eve, that Hermes Trismegistus was Moses, and that hieroglyphs were occult symbols which \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.\" This led him to translate the simple hieroglyphic text \u1e0fd Wsr (\"Osiris says\") as \"The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis\"[16]/nEgyptologist E.

Wallis Budge mentioned Kircher as the foremost of writers who \"pretended to have found the key to the hieroglyphics\" and called his translations in Oedipus Aegyptiacus \"utter nonsense, but as they were put forth in a learned tongue many people at the time believed they were correct.\"[17] Although Kircher's approach to deciphering texts was based on a fundamental misconception, some modern commentators have described Kircher as the pioneer of the serious study of hieroglyphs. The data which he collected were later consulted by Champollion in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was \"because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone\".[18] Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:/nIt is, therefore, Kircher's incontestable merit that he was the first to have discovered the phonetic value of an Egyptian hieroglyph. From a humanistic as well as an intellectual point of view Egyptology may very well be proud of having Kircher as its founder.[19]/nKircher was also actively involved in the erection of the Pamphilj obelisk, and added \"hieroglyphs\" of his design in the blank areas.[20] Rowland 2002 concluded that Kircher made use of Pythagorean principles to read hieroglyphs of the Pamphili Obelisk, and used the same form of interpretation when reading scripture.[21]/nKircher had an early interest in China, telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a missionary to that country. In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was  China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae & artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata, and which is commonly known simply as China Illustrata, i.e. \"China Illustrated\". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from  accurate cartography to mythical elements, such as a study of dragons. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular Michael Boym[22] and Martino Martini./nChina Illustrata emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of Nestorian Christians (with a Latin translation of the Nestorian Stele of Xi'an provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng),[23] but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of Ham, that Confucius was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the Chinese characters were abstracted hieroglyphs./nIn Kircher's system, ideograms were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the Maya and Aztecs were yet lower pictograms which referred only to objects. Umberto Eco comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations:/n\"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father\". (p.\u00a069)/nIn 1675, he published Arca No\u00eb, the results of his research on the biblical Ark of Noah \u2014  following the Counter-Reformation, allegorical interpretation was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to arise spontaneously), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been./nKircher was sent the Voynich Manuscript in 1666 by Johannes Marcus Marci in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it.[24] The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until Victor Emmanuel II of Italy annexed the Papal States in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists.  In his Polygraphia Nova (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial universal language./nOn a visit to southern Italy in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the crater of Vesuvius, then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the Strait of Messina. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his Mundus Subterraneus of 1664, in which he suggested that the tides were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean ocean./nKircher was also puzzled by fossils. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans.[25] Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations. He interpreted mountain ranges as the Earth's skeletal structures exposed by weathering.[26]/nMundus Subterraneus includes several pages about the legendary island of Atlantis including a map with the Latin caption \"Situs Insulae Atlantidis, a Mari olim absorpte ex mente Egyptiorum et Platonis Description,\" translating as \"Site of the island of Atlantis, in the sea, from Egyptian sources and Plato's description.\"[27]/nIn his book Arca No\u00eb, Kircher argued that after the Flood new species were transformed as they moved into different environments, for example, when a deer moved into a colder climate, it became a reindeer. He wrote that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, armadillos from a combination of turtles and porcupines. He also advocated the theory of spontaneous generation.[28] Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.[29]/nKircher took a modern approach to the study of diseases as early as 1646 by using a microscope to investigate the blood of plague victims. In his Scrutinium Pestis of 1658, he observed the presence of \"little worms\" or \"animalcules\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. That was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were red or white blood cells and not the plague agent, Yersinia pestis. He also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs./nIn 1646, Kircher published Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae, concerning the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the magic lantern developed by Christiaan Huygens and others. Kircher described the construction of a \"catoptric lamp\" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he improved it, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.[30]/nPreviously,  such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of King Solomon). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical./nKircher constructed a magnetic clock, which he explained in his Magnes (1641). The clock had been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. Linus of Liege, and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the Copernican cosmological model, arguing that the magnetic sphere in the clock rotated by the magnetic force of the sun.[31]/nKircher's model disproved that hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a water clock in the base of the device. Although Kircher disputed the Copernican model in his Magnes, supporting instead that of Tycho Brahe, his later Itinerarium exstaticum (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems\u00a0\u2014 including the Copernican\u00a0\u2014 as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.[31]/nThe Musurgia Universalis (1650) sets out Kircher's views on music: he believed that the harmony of music reflected the proportions of the universe. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered automatic organs, notations of birdsong and diagrams of musical instruments. One illustration shows the differences between the ears of humans and other animals. In Phonurgia Nova (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places./nOther machines designed by Kircher include an aeolian harp, automatons such as a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube, a perpetual motion machine, and a Katzenklavier (\"cat piano\"). The Katzenklavier would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified pitches, although Kircher is not known to have constructed the instrument./nIn Phonurgia Nova, literally \"new methods of sound production\", Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explored the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound for architectural applications. He also examined echoes in rooms using domes of different shapes, including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he explored the therapeutic effects of music in tarantism, a theme from southern Italy.[32]/nAlthough Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite set), based on the previous work of Ramon Llull. His methods and diagrams are discussed in Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria, 1669. They include what may be the first recorded drawings of complete bipartite graphs, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize complete graphs.[33]  Kircher also employed combinatorics in his Arca Musarithmica, an aleatoric music device capable of composing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases./nFor most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was \"the first scholar with a global reputation\". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own experiments and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica calls him a \"one-man intellectual clearing house\". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near-exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, Sir Thomas Browne (1605\u201382) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life, however, his stock fell, as the rationalist Cartesian approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as \"more quacksalver than savant\")./nKircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and postmodernism./nAs few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their aesthetic qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian Anthony Grafton has said that \"the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a Borges story that was never written\", while Umberto Eco has written about Kircher in his novel The Island of the Day Before, as well as in his non-fiction works The Search for the Perfect Language and Serendipities. In the historical novel Imprimatur by Monaldi & Sorti (2002), Kircher plays a major role. Shortly after his death, some travelers are locked up in a hotel in Baroque Rome by the papal health authorities because of an epidemic of plague. Kircher's theory about the healing power of music is remembered by the protagonists in various flashbacks and finally provides the key to the puzzle. In Where Tigers Are At Home, by Jean-Marie Blas de Robl\u00e8s, the protagonist works on a  translation of a bogus 17th-century biography of  Kircher. The contemporary artist Cyb\u00e8le Varela has paid tribute to Kircher in her exhibition Ad Sidera per Athanasius Kircher, held in the Collegio Romano, in the same place where the Museum Kircherianum was./nThe Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles has a hall dedicated to the life of Kircher. His ethnographic collection is in the Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome./nJohn Glassie's book, A Man of Misconceptions, traces connections between Kircher and figures such as Gianlorenzo Bernini, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, and Isaac Newton. It also suggests influences on Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Anton Mesmer, Jules Verne, and Marcel Duchamp./nIn the end, Glassie writes, Kircher should be acknowledged \u201cfor his effort to know everything and to share everything he knew, for asking a thousand questions about the world around him, and for getting so many others to ask questions about his answers; for stimulating, as well as confounding and inadvertently amusing, so many minds; for having been a source of so many ideas\u2014right, wrong, half-right, half-baked, ridiculous, beautiful, and all-encompassing.\u201d[34]/nKircher's life and research are central to the plot of James Rollin's 2015 novel The Bone Labyrinth./nHe is also mentioned in The Book of Life, the third book in the All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness./nHe further appears in two separate episodes in Daniel Kehlmann's novel Tyll (2017)./nThe permanent exhibition The World Is Bound with Secret Knots at the Museum of Jurassic Technology is based on the life and work of Kircher and uses elaborate 3D technology to highlight the magical quality of many of his ideas and images.[35]/nHe is also a character (though largely off-stage, he is often mentioned by other characters) in the \"Ring of Fire\" alternate history series (published by Baen). In it, he was sent back to Germany in the early 1630s, where he became the unofficial pastor of the Catholic church in the temporally-transplanted town of Grantville, Thuringia-Franconia./nKircher features as a favourite author of Father Chmielowski in Olga Tokarczuk's The Books of Jacob./nKircher's principal works, in chronological order, are:", "19852927": "Giovanni Demisiani (Greek: \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2; died 1614), a Greek from Zakynthos, was a theologian, chemist, mathematician to Cardinal Gonzaga, and member of the Accademia dei Lincei.[1][2] Demisiani is noted for  coining the name telescope (from the Greek \u03c4\u1fc6\u03bb\u03b5, tele \"far\" and \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, skopein \"to look or see\") for a version of the instrument presented by Galileo Galilei to the Accademia dei Lincei at a banquet honoring Galileo\u2019s induction into the Accademia in 1611.[2]/n/nThis article about a Greek mathematician is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.", "5893760": "Claude Jacques Berge (5 June 1926 \u2013 30 June 2002) was a French mathematician, recognized as one of the modern founders of combinatorics and graph theory./nClaude Berge's parents were Andr\u00e9 Berge and Genevi\u00e8ve Fourcade. Andr\u00e9 Berge (1902\u20131995) was a physician and psychoanalyst who, in addition to his professional work, had published several novels. He was the son of Ren\u00e9 Berge, a mining engineer, and Antoinette Faure. F\u00e9lix Fran\u00e7ois Faure (1841\u20131899) was Antoinette Faure's father; he was President of France from 1895 to 1899. Andr\u00e9 Berge married Genevi\u00e8ve in 1924, and Claude was the second of their six children. His five siblings were Nicole (the eldest), Antoine, Philippe, Edith, and Patrick. Claude attended the \u00c9cole des Roches\u00a0[fr] near Verneuil-sur-Avre, about 110\u00a0km (68\u00a0mi) west of Paris. This famous private school, founded by the sociologist Edmond Demolins in 1899, attracted students from all over France to its innovative educational program. At this stage in his life, Claude was unsure about the topic in which he should specialize. He said in later life:/n\"I wasn't quite sure that I wanted to do mathematics. There was often a greater urge to study literature.\"/nHis love of literature and other non-mathematical subjects never left him and we shall discuss below how they played a large role in his life. However, he decided to study mathematics at the University of Paris. After the award of his first degree, he continued to undertake research for his doctorate, advised by Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz. He began publishing mathematics papers in 1950. In that year two of his papers appeared, the short paper Sur l'isovalence et la r\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des transformateurs and the major, 30-page paper Sur un nouveau calcul symbolique et ses applications. The symbolic calculus that he discussed in this major paper is a combination of generating functions and Laplace transforms. He then applied this symbolic calculus to combinatorial analysis, Bernoulli numbers, difference equations, differential equations, and summability factors. In 1951 he published a further two short papers, Sur l'inversion des transformateurs and Sur une th\u00e9orie ensembliste des jeux alternatifs, that announced various results that would be discussed fully in his thesis. He was awarded a doctorate in 1953 for his thesis Sur une th\u00e9orie ensembliste des jeux alternatifs, under the supervision of Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz.[1] In this thesis, he examined games where perfect information is available in which, at each move, there are possibly an infinite number of choices. The games are not necessarily finite, with indefinite continuation being allowed. Berge examined the properties of such games with a thorough analysis. A 55-page paper based on his thesis, and with the same title, was published in 1953./nBerge married Jane Gentaz (born 7 January 1925) on 29 December 1952; they had one child, Delphine, born on 1 March 1964. In 1952, before the award of his doctorate, Berge was appointed as a research assistant at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. In 1957 he spent time in the United States as a visiting professor at Princeton University. He took part in the Economics Research Project there, which was under contract with the Office of Naval Research. While in Princeton he undertook work that was presented in the paper \"Two theorems in graph theory\" published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. This was one of his first papers on graph theory, his earlier work being on the theory of games and combinatorics. He was writing his famous book Th\u00e9orie des graphes et ses applications (Graph theory and applications) at this time and had just published his book on the theory of games, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des jeux \u00e0 n personnes (General theory of games with n players) (1957). Returning to France from the United States, Berge took up the position of Director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique. Also, in 1957 he was appointed as a professor in the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris. Th\u00e9orie des graphes et ses applications was published in 1958 and, remarkably, in the following year his third book, Espaces topologiques, fonctions multivoques (Topological Spaces, Multi-Valued Functions), was published. For a mathematician in their early thirties to publish three major books within as many years is a truly outstanding achievement./nBeginning in 1952 he was a research assistant at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and from 1957 to 1964 he was a professor at the Institute of Statistics at the University of Paris. From 1965 to 1967 he directed the International Computing Centre in Rome. He was also associated with the Centre d'Analyse et de Math\u00e9matique Sociales (CAMS), a research center of \u00c9cole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales. He held visiting positions at Princeton University in 1957, Pennsylvania State University in 1968, and New York University in 1985, and was a frequent visitor to the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.[2][3]/nThe period around 1960 seems to have been particularly important and fruitful for Berge. Through the book Th\u00e9orie des graphes et ses applications he had established a mathematical name for himself. In 1959 he attended the first graph theory conference ever in Dobog\u00f3k\u0151, Hungary, and met the Hungarian graph theorists. He published a survey paper on graph coloring, where he introduced the ideas that soon led to perfect graphs. In March 1960 he talked about this at a meeting in Halle in East Germany. In November of the same year, he was one of the ten founding members of the OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litt\u00b4erature Potentiel). And in 1961, with his friend and colleague Marcel-Paul Sch\u00fctzenberger, he initiated the S\u00e9minaire sur les probl\u00e8mes combinatoires at the  University of Paris (which later became the \u00c9quipe combinatoire du CNRS). At the same time, Berge achieved success as a sculptor./nIn 1994 Berge wrote a 'mathematical' murder mystery for Oulipo. In this short story, Who killed the Duke of Densmore (1995), the Duke of Densmore has been murdered by one of his six mistresses, and Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are summoned to solve the case. Watson is sent by Holmes to the Duke's castle but, on his return, the information he conveys to Holmes is very muddled. Holmes uses the information that Watson gives him to construct a graph. He then applies a theorem of Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s to the graph, which produces the name of the murderer. Other clever contributions of Berge to Oulipo are described in.[4][3]/nAnother of Berge's interests was in art and sculpture. He described his early sculptures, made in part from stones found in the river Seine, in his book Sculptures multip\u00e8tres (1962). Bjarne Toft writes:[5]/nIn our modern everyday life, we are surrounded and bombarded by (too) beautiful, flawless pictures, sculptures, and designs. In this stream, Claude Berge's sculptures catch our attention, with their authenticity and honesty. They are not pretending to be more than they are. Berge catches again something general and essential, as he did in his mathematics. The sculptures may at first seem just funny, and they certainly have a humorous side. But they have strong personalities in their unique style \u2013 you come to like them as you keep looking at them \u2013 whether one could live with them if they came alive is another matter!/nBerge wrote five books, on game theory (1957), graph theory and its applications (1958), topological spaces (1959), principles of combinatorics (1968) and hypergraphs (1970), each being translated in several languages. These books helped bring the subjects of graph theory and combinatorics out of disrepute by highlighting the successful practical applications of the subjects.[6] He is particularly remembered for two conjectures on perfect graphs that he made in the early 1960s but were not proved until significantly later:/nGames were a passion of Claude Berge throughout his life, whether playing them \u2013\nas in favorites such as chess, backgammon, and Hex \u2013 or exploring more theoretical\naspects. This passion governed his interests in mathematics. He began writing on\ngame theory as early as 1951, spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1957, and the same year produced his first major book, Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des jeux \u00e0 n personnes. Here, one not only comes across names such as John von Neumann and John Nash, as one would expect, but also names such as D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig, \u00d8ystein Ore, and Richardson. Indeed, the book contains much graph theory, namely the graph theory useful for game theory; it also contains much topology, namely the topology of relevance to game theory. Thus, it was natural that Berge quickly followed up on this work with two larger volumes, Th\u00e9orie des graphes et ses applications and Espaces topologiques, fonctions multivoques. The first one is a masterpiece, with its unique blend of general theory, theorems \u2013 easy and difficult, proofs, examples, applications, diagrams. It is a personal manifesto of graph theory, rather than a complete description, as attempted in the book by K\u0151nig. It would be an interesting project to compare the first two earlier books on graph theory, by Andr\u00e9 Sainte-Lagu\u00eb and K\u0151nig, respectively, with the book by Berge. It is clear that Berge's book is more leisurely and playful than K\u0151nig's, in particular. It is governed by the taste of Berge and might well be subtitled 'seduction into graph theory' (to use the words of Gian-Carlo Rota from the preface to the English translation of Berge's book). Among the main topics in this book are factorization, matchings, and alternating paths. Here Berge relies on the fundamental paper of Tibor Gallai. Gallai was one of the greatest graph theorists \u2013 he was to some degree overlooked \u2013 but not by Berge. Gallai was among the first to emphasize min-max theorems and LP-duality in combinatorics./nHe is also known for his maximum theorem in optimization and for Berge's lemma, which states that a matching M in a graph G is maximum if and only if there is in G no augmenting path with respect to M./nIn addition to mathematics, Claude Berge enjoyed literature, sculpture, and art.  Berge co-founded the French literary group Oulipo with novelists and other mathematicians in 1960 to create new forms of literature. In this association, he wrote a murder mystery based on a mathematical theorem: Who killed the Duke of Densmore? In an adaptation of this story, the Duke of Densmore is killed by an explosion. Ten years later, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are called to investigate this unsolved case. Using the testimonies of the Duke's seven ex-wives and his knowledge of interval graphs, Holmes is able to determine which one made multiple visits to the Duke and was able to plant the bomb.[9][10]/nBerge won the EURO Gold Medal from the Association of European Operational Research Societies in 1989,[3][11] and (with Ronald Graham) the inaugural\nEuler Medal from the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications in 1993.[3]/n(Note: Rough English translation in parentheses)", "61599361": "Yewande Olubummo (born February 8, 1960)[1] is a Nigerian-American mathematician whose research interests include functional analysis and dynamical systems.

He was the first student to be awarded a dual degree (MA in Mathematics and MSc in physics) from Calcutta University. Perhaps the most emphatic figure of Indian education, he was a man of great personality, high self-respect, courage and towering administrative ability. The second Indian Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta for four consecutive two-year terms (1906\u20131914) and a fifth two-year term (1921\u201323), Mukherjee was responsible for the foundation of the Bengal Technical Institute in 1906, which was later known as Jadavpur University and the University College of Science (Rajabazar Science College) of the Calcutta University in 1914./nMukherjee also played a vital role in the founding of the University College of Law popularly known as Hazra Law College. The Calcutta Mathematical Society was also founded by Mukherjee in 1908 and he served as the president of the Society from 1908 to 1923.[3][4] He was also the president of the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress in 1914 held at the Rajabazar Science College, which he founded. The Ashutosh College was also founded under his stewardship in 1916, when he was Vice-chancellor of University of Calcutta./nHe is often called \"Banglar Bagh\" ('The Bengal Tiger') for his high self-esteem, courage and academic integrity.[5] According to historian D. R. Bhandarkar, the epithet 'Vikramaditya' is also ascribed to Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee.[6]/nAshutosh Mukherjee was born on 29 June 1864 at Bowbazar, Kolkata in a Brahmin family to Jagattarini Devi and Ganga Prasad Mukhopadhyaya, a well-known doctor who founded the South Sub Urban School in Calcutta. Among his ancestors were several distinguished Sanskrit scholars, including Pandit Ramchandra Tarkalankar, a professor of nyaya who had been appointed by Warren Hastings to that chair at the Sanskrit College in Kolkata.[7] Brought up in an atmosphere of science and literature at home, young Ashutosh went to the Sisu Vidayalaya at Chakraberia, Bhowanipore and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. When he was young, he met Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar who was a major influence on him. He was a student of Madhusudan Das.[8]/nMukherjee married Jogamaya Devi Bhattacharyya (1871\u201316 July 1958) in 1885.[9] The couple had seven children, Kamala (born 1895), Rama Prasad (1896-1983),[10] Syama Prasad (1901-1953), Uma Prasad (1902-1997), Amala (born 1905), Bama Prasad (born 1906) and Ramala (born 1908). His son Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the most notable of his children, founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the direct precursor to the modern Bharatiya Janata Party. Rama Prasad became a judge in the High Court of Calcutta while Uma Prasad became famed as a Himalayan trekker and a travel writer - being awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award for his travelogue Manimahesh.[11] His grandson Chittatosh Mookerjee was the Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court.[12]/nSir Ashutosh Mukherjee was born into a Hindu Brahmin family in Kolkata, West Bengal.[13] His ancestral town was Jirat in Hooghly District, West Bengal.[14] His grandfather actually came to Jirat from another village named Digsui, situated also in the Hooghly District and settled down there. Sir Ashutosh's father Ganga Prasad Mukherjee was born in Jirat, Hooghly District on 16 December 1836.[14] He was a very meritorious student and he came to Kolkata to study in Medical College with the help of the wealthy people of Jirat. Later he settled down in Bhawanipore area of Kolkata./nIn November 1879, at the age of fifteen, Mukherjee passed the entrance exam of the Calcutta University in which he stood second and received a first grade scholarship.[15] In the year 1880, he took admission at the Presidency College (now Presidency University) in Kolkata where he met P.C. Ray and Narendranath Dutta who would later become famous as Swami Vivekananda. Later that year, though only a first-year undergraduate, he published his first mathematical paper, on a new proof of the 25th proposition of Euclid's first book.[15]/nIn 1883, Mukherjee topped the BA examination at Calcutta University[16] to complete a postgraduate degree in mathematics. In 1883 S.N. Banerjee wrote an article in the newspaper Bengalee against the orders of the Calcutta High Court and he was arrested in contempt of court. Protests and hartals erupted across Bengal and other cities, led by a group of students headed by Mukherjee at Calcutta high court. In 1884, he won the Harishchandra Prize for academic achievements, and completed an M.A. with first-class honours in mathematics in 1885.[15] In 1886, he was awarded a second Masters in Natural Sciences, making him the first student to be awarded a dual degree from Calcutta University.[15] In the same year he was married to Jogomaya Devi, and also published his third mathematical paper, \"A Note on Elliptic Functions.\" The paper was praised by the distinguished British mathematician and Fellow of the Royal Society Arthur Cayley as a contribution of \"outstanding merit.\"[15] Mukherjee was recognised for his achievements by the grant of the Premchand Roychand Fellowship in Mathematics and Physics, Pure and Applied.[2] Still only aged 22, he was further recognised by his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE).[2] By 1888, Mukherjee was a lecturer in mathematics for the recently established Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS).[17]/nMukherjee continued publishing scholarly papers on mathematics and physics into his 30s. By 1893, aged 29, Mukherjee had been further elected to the fellowships of the Physical Society of France and the Mathematical Society of Palermo, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He subsequently became a member of the London Mathematical Society, the Paris Mathematical Society and the American Mathematical Society (1900).[2][15] Although after 1893 he largely abandoned his mathematical pursuits for a legal career, Mukherjee has been recognised as the first modern Indian mathematician to enter the field of mathematical research, and founded the Calcutta Mathematical Society in 1908. Among his mathematical contributions, Mukherjee determined several crucial derivations of Gaspare Mainardi's answer to determining the oblique trajectory of a system of confocal ellipses. He also made lasting contributions in differential geometry, developing analytical methods of simplifying Gaspard Monge's interpretation of his general differential equation for conics.[2][15]/nAt the age of 24, Mukherjee became a Fellow of the Calcutta University. Turning down a job offer in the Department of Public Instruction in order to complete his Bachelor of Law degree, he received his degree in 1888 and enrolled as a vakil of the Calcutta High Court. By 1897, he had received an LL.D. and was appointed the Tagore Professor of Law of the Calcutta University in that year. In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the High Court, and subsequently served as its acting Chief Justice for a couple of years.[15]/nMukherjee was influential in the university affairs throughout his life. From the age of 25, he was a member of its Syndicate, serving on the University Senate and Syndicate for the next 16 years. He served as President of the Board of Studies in Mathematics for 11 years, and represented his university in the Bengal Legislative Council from 1899 to 1903. He was appointed Vice-Chancellor from 1906 to 1914 and again from 1921 to 1923.[15]  He was instrumental in discovering the talents of C. V. Raman and S.

Ashutosh had no peer in the whole of Europe./nAshutosh Mukherjee had a vision of the kind of education he wanted young people to have, and he had the acumen and courage to extract it from his colonial masters. He set up several new academic graduate programs at the Calcutta University: comparative literature, anthropology, applied psychology, industrial chemistry, ancient Indian history and culture as well as Islamic culture. He also made arrangements for postgraduate teaching and research in Bengali, Hindi, Pali and Sanskrit. Scholars from all over India, irrespective of race, caste, and gender, came to study and teach there. He even persuaded European scholars to teach at his university. He was one of the first persons to recognise the work of Srinivasa Ramanujan. He also established Asutosh College in South Kolkata in 1916. He laid the foundry stone of Jagadbandhu Institution in 1914 and Santragachi Kedarnath Institution in 1925./nCurzon's education mission in 1902 identified the universities including the Calcutta University, as centres of sedition where young people formed networks of resistance to colonial domination.[18] The cause of this was thought to be the unwise granting of autonomy to these universities in the nineteenth century. Thus in the period of 1905 to 1935, the colonial administration tried to reinstate government control of education./nIn 1910, he was appointed the President of the Imperial (now National) Library Council to which he donated his personal collection of 80,000 books which are arranged in a separate section. He was the president of the inaugural session of the Indian Science Congress in 1914. Mukherjee was a member of the 1917\u20131919 Sadler Commission, presided over by Michael Ernest Sadler, which inquired into the state of Indian education. He was thrice elected as the president of The Asiatic Society. Having served as a fellow and subsequently as a vice-president of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science since the 1890s, in 1922 he was elected President of the IACS and held the office until his death.[19]/nAfter serving five terms as Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University, Mukherjee declined to be reappointed to a sixth term in 1923 when the university's Chancellor, Governor of Bengal the Earl of Lytton, tried to impose conditions on his reappointment. Shortly thereafter, he also resigned his judgeship on the Calcutta High Court and resumed his private practice of law. While arguing a case in Patna the following year, Mukherjee died suddenly on 25 May 1924, a month before his sixtieth birthday. His body was returned to Kolkata and cremated at a funeral service which drew crowds of mourners.[15]/nMukherjee was a polyglot learned in Pali, French and Russian.

He is one of the creators of geometric measure theory, at the meeting point of differential geometry and mathematical analysis.[3]/nFederer was born July 23, 1920, in Vienna, Austria. After emigrating to the US in 1938, he studied mathematics and physics at the University of California, Berkeley, earning the Ph.D. as a student of Anthony Morse in 1944. He then spent virtually his entire career as a member of the Brown University Mathematics Department, where he eventually retired with the title of Professor Emeritus./nFederer wrote more than thirty research papers in addition to his book Geometric measure theory. The Mathematics Genealogy Project assigns him nine Ph.D. students and well over a hundred subsequent descendants. His most productive students include the late Frederick J. Almgren, Jr. (1933\u20131997), a professor at Princeton for 35 years, and his last student, Robert Hardt, now at Rice University./nFederer was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1987, he and his Brown colleague Wendell Fleming won the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize \"for their pioneering work in Normal and Integral currents.\"[FF60]/nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Federer made many contributions at the technical interface of geometry and measure theory. Particular themes included surface area, rectifiability of sets, and the extent to which one could substitute rectifiability for smoothness in the classical analysis of surfaces. A particularly noteworthy early accomplishment (improving earlier work of Abram Besicovitch) was the characterization of purely unrectifiable sets as those which \"vanish\" under almost all projections.[4][5] Federer also made noteworthy contributions to the study of Green's theorem in low regularity.[6] The theory of capacity with modified exponents was developed by Federer and William Ziemer.[FZ73] In his first published paper, written with his Ph.D. advisor Anthony Morse, Federer proved the Federer\u2013Morse theorem which states that any continuous surjection between compact metric spaces can be restricted to a Borel subset so as to become an injection, without changing the image.[7]/nOne of Federer's best-known papers, Curvature Measures, was published in 1959.[F59][8] The intention is to establish measure-theoretic formulations of second-order analysis in differential geometry, particularly curvature. The Steiner formula formed a fundamental precedent for Federer's work; it established that the volume of a neighborhood of a convex set in Euclidean space is given by a polynomial. If the boundary of the convex set is a smooth submanifold, then the coefficients of the Steiner formula are defined by its curvature. Federer's work was aimed towards developing a general formulation of this result. The class of subsets that he identified are those of positive reach, subsuming both the class of convex sets and the class of smooth submanifolds. He proved the Steiner formula for this class, identifying generalized quermassintegrals (called curvature measures by Federer) as the coefficients. In the same paper, Federer proved the coarea formula, which has become a standard textbook result in measure theory.[9]/nFederer's second landmark paper, Normal and Integral Currents, was co-authored with Wendell Fleming.[FF60] In their work, they showed that Plateau's problem for minimal surfaces can be solved in the class of integral currents, which may be viewed as generalized submanifolds. Moreover, they identified new results on the isoperimetric problem and its relation to the Sobolev embedding theorem. Their paper inaugurated a new and fruitful period of research on a large class of geometric variational problems, and especially minimal surfaces./nIn 1969, Federer published his book Geometric Measure Theory, which is among the most widely cited books in mathematics.[F69][10] It is a comprehensive work beginning with a detailed account of multilinear algebra and measure theory. The main body of the work is devoted to a study of rectifiability and the theory of currents. The book ends with applications to the calculus of variations. Federer's book is considered an authoritative text on this material, and included a number of new results in addition to much material from past research of Federer and others. Much of his book's discussion of currents and their applications are limited to integral coefficients. He later developed the basic theory in the setting of real coefficients.[F75]/nA particular result detailed in Federer's book is that area-minimizing minimal hypersurfaces of Euclidean space are smooth in low dimensions. Around the same time, Enrico Bombieri, Ennio De Giorgi, and Enrico Giusti proved that a minimal hypercone in eight-dimensional Euclidean space, first identified by James Simons, is area-minimizing. As such, it is direct to construct area-minimizing minimal hypersurfaces of Euclidean space which have singular sets of codimension seven. In 1970, Federer proved that this codimension is optimal: all such singular sets have codimension of at least seven.[F70] His dimension reduction argument for this purpose has become a standard part of the literature on geometric measure theory and geometric analysis.[11][12] Later, Federer also found a new proof of the result of Bombieri\u2013De Giorgi\u2013Giusti.[F75]/nFederer was the author of around thirty research papers, along with his famous textbook Geometric Measure Theory.", "1142530": "Jean-Gaston Darboux FAS MIF FRS FRSE (14 August 1842\u00a0\u2013 23 February 1917) was a French mathematician.[2]/nAccording to his birth certificate, he was born in N\u00eemes in France on 14 August 1842, at 1 am.

His best-known student was J\u00fcrgen Moser, one of the founders of KAM theory (Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold\u2013Moser), which lies at the foundations of chaos theory. Another notable student was Kurt Mahler, the number theorist./nSiegel was an antimilitarist, and in 1917, during World War I he was committed to a psychiatric institute as a conscientious objector. According to his own words, he withstood the experience only because of his support from Edmund Landau, whose father had a clinic in the neighborhood. After the end of World War I, he enrolled at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, studying under Landau, who was his doctoral thesis supervisor (PhD in 1920). He stayed in G\u00f6ttingen as a teaching and research assistant; many of his groundbreaking results were published during this period. In 1922, he was appointed professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt as the successor of Arthur Moritz Sch\u00f6nflies. Siegel, who was deeply opposed to Nazism, was a close friend of the docents Ernst Hellinger and Max Dehn and used his influence to help them. This attitude prevented Siegel's appointment as a successor to the chair of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory in Munich.[5] In Frankfurt he took part with Dehn, Hellinger, Paul Epstein, and others in a seminar on the history of mathematics, which was conducted at the highest level. In the seminar they read only original sources. Siegel's reminiscences about the time before World War II are in an essay in his collected works./nIn 1936 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Oslo. In 1938, he returned to G\u00f6ttingen before emigrating in 1940 via Norway to the United States, where he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had already spent a sabbatical in 1935. He returned to G\u00f6ttingen after World War II, when he accepted a post as professor in 1951, which he kept until his retirement in 1959. In 1968 he was elected a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[6]/nSiegel's work on number theory, diophantine equations, and celestial mechanics in particular won him numerous honours. In 1978, he was awarded the first Wolf Prize in Mathematics, one of the most prestigious in the field. When the prize committee decided to select the greatest living mathematician, the discussion centered around Siegel and Israel Gelfand as the leading candidates. The prize was ultimately split between them.[7]/nSiegel's work spans analytic number theory; and his theorem on the finiteness of the integer points of curves, for genus > 1, is historically important as a major general result on diophantine equations, when the field was essentially undeveloped. He worked on L-functions, discovering the (presumed illusory) Siegel zero phenomenon. His work, derived from the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method on quadratic forms, appeared in the later, adele group theories encompassing the use of theta-functions. The Siegel modular varieties, which describe Siegel modular forms, are recognised as part of the moduli theory of abelian varieties. In all this work the structural implications of analytic methods show through./nIn the early 1970s Weil gave a series of seminars on the history of number theory prior to the 20th century and he remarked that Siegel once told him that when the first person discovered the simplest case of Faulhaber's formula then, in Siegel's words, \"Es gefiel dem lieben Gott.\" (It pleased the dear Lord.) Siegel was a profound student of the history of mathematics and put his studies to good use in such works as the Riemann\u2013Siegel formula./nby Siegel:/nabout Siegel:", "67399485": "Edith Linwood Bush (September 15, 1882 \u2013 November 3, 1977) was an American mathematician.

He qualified in the first position for both and chose to attend the former institution in 1889. That year he also won the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, an annual national mathematics competition. After graduating in 1892, he placed first in the agr\u00e9gation, a competitive civil service examination leading to the position of professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9. His thesis, published in 1893, was titled Sur quelques points de la th\u00e9orie des fonctions (\"On some points in the theory of functions\"). That year, Borel started a four-year stint as a lecturer at the University of Lille, during which time he published 22 research papers.

The concept of a Borel set is named in his honor. One of his books on probability introduced the amusing thought experiment that entered popular culture under the name infinite monkey theorem or the like.  He also published a series of papers (1921\u20131927) that first defined games of strategy.[5] John von Neumann objected to this assignment of priority in a letter to Econometrica published in 1953 where he asserted that Borel could not have defined games of strategy because he rejected the minimax theorem.[6]/nWith the development of statistical hypothesis testing in the early 1900s various tests for randomness were proposed. Sometimes these were claimed to have some kind of general significance, but mostly they were just viewed as simple practical methods. In 1909, Borel formulated the notion that numbers picked randomly on the basis of their value are almost always normal, and with explicit constructions in terms of digits, it is quite straightforward to get numbers that are normal.[7]/nIn 1913 and 1914 he bridged the gap between hyperbolic geometry and special relativity with expository work.

He was an active scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, where he made great contributions as a researcher, teacher, as well as in administrative positions.[1] At this university he directed, together with Alfred Tarski, the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science,[2] from which many important logicians and philosophers emerged. He had a strong sense of social commitment and was a passionate defensor of his pacifist and progressive ideas.[2] He took part in many social projects aimed at teaching mathematics, as well as projects aimed at supporting women's and minority groups to pursue careers in mathematics and related fields. A lover of dance and literature, he appreciated life in all its facets: art, culture, science and, above all, the warmth of human relations.[2] He is remembered by his students for his great kindness, as well as for his academic and teaching excellence.[3]/nHenkin is mainly known for his completeness proofs of diverse formal systems, such as type theory and first-order logic (the completeness of the latter, in its weak version, had been proven by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1929).[4] To prove the completeness of type theory, Henkin introduces new semantics, not equivalent to standard semantics, based on structures called general models (also known as Henkin models). The change of semantics that he proposed permits to provide a complete deductive calculus for type theory and for second-order logic, amongst other logics. Henkin methods have aided to prove various model theory results, both in classical and non-classical logics. Besides logic, the other branch on which his investigations were centered was algebra; he specialized in cylindric algebras, in which he worked together with Tarski and Donald Monk.[5] As for the philosophy of mathematics, although the works in which he explicitly approaches it are scarce, he can be considered to have a nominalist position.[6]/nLeon Albert Henkin was born on April 19, 1921, in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family that had emigrated from Russia a generation earlier. The first of the family to emigrate was Abraham Henkin, the eldest of the brothers of Leon's father.[2] According to Leon,[7] his father had been extremely proud of him since he was just a boy. His high expectations were evident in the name he gave him: he chose to name his son Albert after a series of articles on Einstein's theory of relativity that the New York Times published shortly before Henkin's birth. His family was sympathetic with pacifist and progressive ideas, and although he was not religious, he had deeply rooted Jewish traditions. Leon grew up surrounded by tight family ties; he was very close to his cousins, with whom he lived during his childhood in Brooklyn.[2]/nHenkin studied primarily in New York City public schools; he attended Lincoln High School, where he graduated at age 16 to enter Columbia University. Both in college and high school he was a member of the chess teams; he always preferred games that involved rational thinking to games of chance.[2] In the years of his high school education, Henkin considered becoming a math teacher and also came to desire to become a writer (as he later expressed in a personal letter).[8] Although he dedicated himself to university academic life, he never abandoned his interest in teaching elementary mathematics, to which he later actively contributed./nIn 1937 Leon entered Columbia University as a mathematics student. It was during his time at this institution that he developed an interest in logic, which would determine the course of his academic career. His first contact with logic was through B. Russell's book, \"Mysticism and Mathematics\", which drew his interest during a visit to the library.[9] This interest was increased and cultivated by some courses. Although the mathematics department of the University did not offer courses in Logic (these were offered by the Philosophy department), Leon was one of the few mathematics students interested in that discipline and he decided to attend them.[7] In the fall of 1938, in his second year as a Columbia University student, he participated in a first course in Logic taught by Ernest Nagel, who had contributed to the creation of the Association of Symbolic Logic two years earlier. This course brought him closer to Russell's book \"Principles of Mathematics\", where he first encountered the axiom of choice; Russell's presentation made a strong impression on him and led him to explore the Principia Mathematica that Russell wrote with Whitehead a few years later. He was struck by the general ideas of Type Theory and by the mysterious axiom of reducibility.[7] Both the axiom of choice and Type Theory later played an important role in his doctoral dissertation./nThe following year, in the fall semester of 1939, Henkin took a second course of Logic with Nagel, in which formal systems of propositional logic and first-order logic were addressed. These constituted his first experience with the mathematical treatment of deductive systems. The course did not go into metalogical results that established a relationship between the semantics and syntactics, and the issue of completeness was not addressed at all.[7] However, Nagel proposed to Henkin as an independent project the reading of the proof of the completeness of propositional logic given by Quine, which had appeared a few months before in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.[10] This reading was highly significant for Henkin, not so much because of the content itself, but because with it he discovered that he could understand the research on logic and mathematics that was taking place at the time.[7] According to Henkin, although he managed to follow Quine's demonstration, he did not manage to capture the idea of the proof: \"I simply noted that the aim of the paper was to show that every tautology had a formal proof in the system of axioms presented, and I expended my utmost effort to check Quine's reasoning that this was so, without ever reflecting on why author and reader were making this effort. This strictly limited objective also kept me from wondering how the author thought of putting the steps of the proof together; the result was that I failed to get 'the idea of the proof', the essential ingredient needed for discovery.\"[7]/nJust before Henkin began his second year at Columbia, World War II broke out. This had several repercussions on his life. One of them had a positive effect on his education. Days before the war broke out, the Polish mathematician and logician Alfred Tarski had come to Harvard, at Quine's invitation, to give a series of lectures on logic. With the invasion of Poland by Germany, Tarski found it impossible to return to Poland and he had to remain in the United States. Tarski visited several cities giving lectures on logic.[11] One of these lectures was at Columbia, and Henkin, like the rest of the logic students, attended it with great enthusiasm. In it Tarski spoke of G\u00f6del's work on undecidable propositions in Type Theory and on the existence of decision algorithms for formal systems, a subject that Henkin found extremely stimulating.[7]/nIn his last year at Columbia, in 1941, Professor F. J. Murray, knowing that Henkin was a mathematics student interested in Logic, suggested that they review together the monograph by G\u00f6del recently published at Princeton on the consistency of the axiom of choice with the generalized continuum hypothesis. Although the meetings they had to discuss it were scarce and Leon ended up revising this monograph practically alone, the experience was considered by him as the most enriching one in his formation at Columbia.[7] According to Henkin, then began to take form some of the ideas that became the starting-point of his doctoral dissertation./nIn 1940, Henkin decided to apply for admission to a doctoral program, without having fully defined what path to follow in his research. He was accepted to three universities, from which he chose Princeton, since the renowned logician Alonzo Church was there, although at the time Henkin was unaware of his work.[7]/nHenkin began his graduate studies at Princeton in 1941, studying under the direction of Church. The Ph.D. program he attended consisted of two years of mathematics courses, after which he was to take a \"qualifying\" oral examination to show he was well educated in at least three branches of mathematics; with this he would receive a M.A. degree. He would then have another two years to write a doctoral dissertation containing an original research, after which he would get the degree of Ph.D.[7]/nThe first two years he took courses in logic -taught by Church-, analysis and general topology. In the first logic course with Church were studied several formal systems of Propositional Logic and first-order logic; some proofs of completeness and discussed part of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems were revised, as well as a presentation of G\u00f6del's proof on the completeness of first-order logic. In the second one they dealt in great detail with a Second-Order system for Peano Arithmetic, as well as with the incompleteness of this axiomatic theory and the consequent incompleteness of second-order logic.[7]/nIn 1941 the United States entered the Second World War, altering Henkin's plans. He had to rush his oral qualification exam, with which he obtained the degree of M. A. and left Princeton to take part in the Manhattan Project. This interruption would last four years, during which he contributed his mathematical knowledge working on radar problems and in the design of a plant to separate uranium isotopes.[7] Most of his work required numerical analysis to solve partial differential equations. During this period, all of his work and readings on logic were completely suspended.[7]/nOnce the war was over, Henkin returned to Princeton in 1946, where he was still required to write a dissertation to complete his Ph.D. studies. Upon his return he joined the logic course that Church had begun a month earlier on Frege's theory of \"sense and reference\". In this course he discovered Church's theory of types, which he found extremely interesting. The questions he asked about it eventually led him to give his proof of the completeness of the theory of types, which he was able to adapt to also give a new proof of the completeness of first-order logic.[7] These results, as well as others that other that emerged from the same ideas, came to take part in Henkin's doctoral dissertation, which was titled \"The completeness of formal systems\", with which he graduated in June 1947. The dissertation itself was not published, although parts of it were rewritten and published in articles,[12][13] and.[14] Many years later, Henkin wrote the article \"The discovery of my completeness proofs\",[7] which contains a detailed review of the contents of his dissertation. The procedures used in it have become frequent methods of proofs in various branches of logic./nHaving obtained his Ph.D. degree, Henkin spent two more years at Princeton working on post-doctoral studies. During this time, in 1948, he met Ginette Potvin, during a trip to Montreal with his sister Estelle and Princeton mathematics graduate student Harold Kuhn.  Ginette would become his wife in 1950, a half year after Estelle married Harold.  After completing his second year of postdoctoral studies at Princeton in 1949, Leon returned to California, where he entered the mathematics department at the University of Southern California. There he held the position of assistant professor until 1953./nIn 1952 Tarski had managed to obtain a permanent position at Berkeley for Henkin. However, Henkin did not want to accept it, as he was sympathetic to the protests recently raised by the controversial oath of allegiance that had been required of university professors since 1950.[15]  Once the oath requirement disappeared, Henkin accepted Tarski's offer and settled in Berkeley in 1953./nFrom 1953, most of Henkin's academic activity revolved around Berkeley, where he collaborated with a solid research group in Logic. He remained there for almost all his academic life, except for some periods in which he traveled abroad with scholarships and grants of diverse institutes, like the one-year stay he had in Amsterdam or the one in Israel with the Fulbright Research Grants he was awarded (in 1954 and 1979 respectively).[16]/nHenkin was always grateful to Tarski, as it was thanks to him that he was able to settle in Berkeley. After Tarski's death in 1983, he wrote in a personal letter: \u201cI write to tell you that Alfred Tarski, who came to Berkeley in 1942 and founded our great Center for the Study of Logic and Foundations, died Wednesday night, at age 82 [...]. It was he who brought me to Berkeley in 1953, so I owe much to him personally as well as scientifically.\u201d[17]/nTarski not only offered Henkin a job opportunity, but also provided him with a very fertile interdisciplinary collaborative environment for the development of Logic. Tarski had founded the Center for the Study of Logic and Foundations in Berkeley, but with Henkin's help he was able to bring together a group of logicians, mathematicians and philosophers who formed the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science,[2] which is still active today.[18] As part of this project they created an interdisciplinary postgraduate program culminating in a Ph.D. Tarski and Henkin boosted the project by organizing important congresses and conferences on Logic, following Tarski's conception of \"logic as a common basis for the whole of human knowledge\".[19][18] The intense activity that took place in Berkeley in the 1950s and 1960s on metalogic was largely due to the activity of Tarski and Henkin, both in teaching and research. Many results of what are today crucial to Model Theory came as a result of the academic activity in Berkeley that took place in those years./nAmong the research trips that Henkin did throughout the years are his visits to universities in Hanover, Princeton, Colorado, as well as to several European Universities, such as Oxford (in the United Kingdom), and others in Yugoslavia, Spain, Portugal and France. In 1979, with his second Fulbright Grant, Henkin spent a year in Israel, in Haifa, at the Department of Science Education of the Technion University.[2] On this occasion he also visited two universities in Egypt. In 1982 he first visited Spain. He gave conferences at several universities, including those in Barcelona, Madrid and Seville.[2]/nHenkin had an active role in research and teaching, but his activities at the university went far beyond that. In addition to the dedication he put in his teaching as well as and in guiding the Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science, he held some administrative positions; he was director of the Department of Mathematics from 1966 to 1968, and subsequently from 1983 to 1985.[2] One of the activities to which he devoted most energy was the teaching of mathematics, on which he also did some research.[20]/nOn some occasions Henkin attended to his children's schools to talk to elementary school children about maths, talking to them about \"the negative numbers\", or \"how to subtract by addition\". Around that time (about 1960), Henkin began to alternate his research work in mathematics with research work in teaching mathematics; the latter became increasingly frequent.[2]/nIn 1991 he was granted the title of Professor Emeritus at the University of Berkeley and retired./nAfter he retired, Henkin continued to work on math teaching projects. From 1991, he took part on a summer courses program at Mills College intended to give talented women from across the nation education in mathematics in order to prepare them for college. Finally, Ginette and Henkin moved to Oakland, where Henkin died a few years later, in November 2006.[2]/nAlways kind to his students and colleagues, whom he frequently invited to his home to enjoy evenings with Ginette, he is remembered as a brilliant researcher, a teacher committed to his discipline and a person who showed solidarity with his community.[21]/nOne of the phrases that best captures the sentiment expressed in various testimonies of his students is that given by Douglas Hofstadter: \"I feel very fortunate to have been his graduate student since I learned from him much more than logic. It is his humanity that conquered my heart. I always wish I am not less kind to my graduate students and no less eager to follow their professional growth after graduation than he was to me\".[22]/nHenkin's work on algebra focused on cylindric algebras, a subject he investigated together with Alfred Tarski and Donald Monk.[23] Cylindric Algebra provides structures that are to first-order logic what Boolean algebra is to propositional logic.[5][24] One of the purposes of Henkin and Tarski in promoting algebraic logic was to attract the interest of mathematicians to logic,[25] convinced as they were that logic could provide unifying principles to mathematics:[2]  \"In fact we would go so far as to venture a prediction that through logical research there may emerge important unifying principles which will help to give coherence to a mathematics which sometimes seems in danger of becoming infinitely divisible\".[26]/nAccording to Monk,[5] Henkin's research on cylindrical algebra can be divided into the following parts: Algebraic Theory, Algebraic Set Theory, Representation Theorems, Non-representable Algebraic Constructions and Applications to Logic.[5]/nIn 1949 \"The completeness of the first order functional calculus\"[12] was published, as well as \"Completeness in the theory of types\"[27] in 1950. Both presented part of the results exposed in the dissertation \"The completeness of formal systems\" with which Henkin received his Ph.D. degree at Princeton in 1947. One of Henkin's best known results is that of the completeness of first-order logic, published in the above-mentioned 1949 article, which appears as the first theorem of the 1947 dissertation. It states the following:/nAny set \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n of sentences of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n formally consistent in the deductive system of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n is satisfiable by a numerable structure \n\n\n\nM\n\n\n{\\displaystyle M}\n\n./nThis theorem is nowadays called the 'completeness theorem', since from it the following easily follows:/nIf \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n is a set of sentences of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n is semantic consequence of \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n \n\n\n\n(\nS\n\u22a8\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (S\\models \\phi )}\n\n, then \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n is deducible from \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n \n\n\n\n(\nS\n\u22a2\n\u03d5\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (S\\vdash \\phi )}\n\n./nThis is the strong version of the completeness theorem, from which the weak version is obtained as a corollary. The latter states the result for the particular case in which \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n is the empty set, this is to say, the deductive calculus of first-order logic is capable of deriving all valid formulas. The weak version, known as G\u00f6del's completeness theorem, had been proved by G\u00f6del in 1929, in his own doctoral thesis. Henkin's proof is more general, more accessible than G\u00f6del's and more easily generalizable to languages of any cardinality. It approaches completeness from a new and fruitful perspective[28] and its greatest quality is perhaps that its proof can be easily adapted to prove the completeness of other deductive systems. Other results central to model theory are obtained as corollaries of the strong completeness of the first-order logic proved by Henkin. From it follows, for example, the following result for a first order language  \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n:/nEvery set of well-formed formulas of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n that is satisfiable in a \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n\u2212structure is satisfiable in an infinite numerable structure./nThis result is known as the \"downwards\" L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem. One other result obtained from the completeness theorem is:/nA set \n\n\n\nS\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S}\n\n of well-formed formulas of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n has a model if and only if each finite subset of it has a model./nThe latter is known as the \"compactness theorem\" of first-order logic, which can also be phrased as: \"Any set of well formed formulas of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n that is finitely satisfiable is satisfiable\".[29] This is to say, if for each of the finite subsets of \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n there is a structure in which all of its formulas are true, then there is also a structure in which all the formulas of \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n are true. It is known as \"compactness theorem\" because it corresponds to the compactness of a certain topological space, defined from semantic notions.[30]/nAmong the other theorems of completeness given by Henkin, the most relevant is perhaps that of the completeness of Church's Theory of Types, which is the first of the completeness theorems Henkin proved. Then, he adapted the method developed in that proof to prove the completeness of other deductive systems. This method has continued to be used to give proofs of completeness in both classical and non-classical logics, and it has become the usual proof of completeness for first-order logic in Logic textbooks. When Henkin published this result in 1949, completeness was not even part of the canonical subjects covered by the textbooks; some twenty years later, this theorem, along with its proof and corollaries, was part of virtually every Logic textbook.[31] As for non-classical logics, Henkin's method can be used, among other things, to extend the completeness of Fuzzy Logic from first order to higher order, producing a complete Fuzzy Type Theory;[32] it also offers a way to obtain results that link classical logic with intuitionist logic;[33] and it allows one to test results of completeness in other non-classical logics, as in the cases of Hybrid Type Theory[34] and Equational Hybrid Propositional Type Theory.[35]/nDespite being one of his best known results, Henkin got to the proof of the completeness of first-order logic \"accidentally\", trying to prove a completely different result.[7] The order of publication of his articles and even the order of presentation of the theorems in his 1947 dissertation does not reflect the evolution that followed the ideas that led him to his completeness results.[36] However, Henkin simplifies the difficult task of tracing the development and shaping of his ideas by his article \"The discovery of my completeness proofs\",[7] published in 1996. In it, he describes the process of the development of his dissertation. He doesn't only explain the content of his work, but he also explains the ideas that led to it, from his first logic courses in College until the end of the writing of his thesis.[37]/nAt the end of the war, Henkin returned to Princeton to complete his doctoral studies, for which he still had to write a dissertation containing an original research. As soon as he arrived at Princeton, he attended Church's course in logic that had begun one month earlier, which dealt with Frege's theory of \"sense and reference\". Motivated by Frege's ideas, Church wanted to put them into practice through a formal axiomatic theory. To do so, he took the simple Theory of Types he had published a few years earlier, and supplied it with a hierarchy of types, inspired by the idea of \"sense\" exposed by Frege. It was in this course that Henkin became acquainted with Church's Theory of Types, which he found of great interest. He immediately made a conjecture about it, whose proof he hoped could become his doctoral dissertation./nOne of the attributes that drew Henkin's attention to Church's Theory of Types was that the \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n\n-operator allowed to name many objects in the type hierarchy. As he explains in \"The discovery of my completeness proofs\", he set out to find out which elements had names in this theory. He began by exploring the elements that were named in the two domains at the base of the type hierarchy. He took \n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {N} }\n\n as the universe of individuals, and added a constant for each the number \n\n\n\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0}\n\n and the successor function \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, so that each element in the domain was named from \n\n\n\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0}\n\n and repeated occurrences of \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n. Going up through the hierarchy, he tried to specify which functions over those elements were nameable. The set of them was supernumerable, so there had to be some without a name, since there is only a numerable number of expressions. How could be said which elements were the nameable ones? To make each expression correspond to the element it denotated, he needed a choice function, in whose search Henkin invested many efforts. Finally, he realized that by means of the deductive calculus he could form equivalence classes of expressions whose equality could be derived by the calculus, and form with these classes a model isomorphic to the new hierarchy of types formed by the named elements. He had been focusing on the interpretations of the formal language, when the key to solving the problem lied on the deductive system. It remained to make the universe of the objects named by the propositions a set of two elements: the truth values. This could be achieved by expanding the axioms to form a maximally consistent set. Once this was achieved, it could be proved that every consistent set of formulas \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n has a model that satisfies exactly the formulas of \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n \u2013the elements of such model are the equivalence classes of the expressions themselves\u2013. That is, he would have managed to give a proof of the completeness of the deductive calculus.[6]/nThe same method used to prove the completeness of Church's Theory of Types could easily be adapted to give a proof of (strong) completeness of first-order logic, and of others that followed later on. The ideas on the nameable elements in the hierarchy of types underlying the discovery of Henkin's completeness proofs led to the successful introduction of new semantics, called general semantics, which are based on general models (or Henkin models)./nHenkin's method to give the completeness proofs consists on building a certain model: it starts with a set of formulas \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n, of which the consistency is assumed. A model is then constructed, which satisfies exactly the formulas of \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n. Henkin's idea to build a suitable model relies on obtaining a sufficiently detailed description of such model using the sentences of the formal language, and to establish which objects could be the elements of such model. If it were known, for each formula of the language of \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n, if it should be satisfied or not by the model, we would have a comprehensive description of the model that would allow its construction. This is exactly what is being looked for: a set of sentences \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n containing \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n for which it holds that every sentence of the language or its negation belongs to Gamma. In the case of first-order logic one more thing is required: that the set \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n be exemplified, this is, for all existential formula there is a constant that acts as a witness of it. On the other hand, since the nature of the objects that make up the model's universe is irrelevant, no objection arises against taking as individuals the terms of the language themselves \u2013or classes of equivalence of them\u2013./nThe first step that must be taken is to extend the language of \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n adding an infinite collection of new individual constants, and then to order the formulas of the language (which are infinite). Once this is done, the aim is to inductively construct an infinite chain of consistent and exemplified sets: we start from \n\n\n\n\u0394\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta }\n\n, systematically adding to this set every formula that doesn't make the resulting set inconsistent, adding also exemplifications of the existential formulas. Thus, an infinite chain of consistent and exemplified sets is built, whose union is a maximally consistent and exemplified set; this will be the required set \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n./nHaving achieved to construct this maximally consistent and exemplified set, the model described by it can be constructed. Which individuals constitute the model's universe? In the case of first-order logic without equality, the elements of the domain will be the terms of the formal language. To construct the functions and relations of the model we follow thoroughly what \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n dictates: if the language contains a \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-relator \n\n\n\nR\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R}\n\n, its interpretation in the model will be a relationship formed by all the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n-tuples of terms in the model's universe such that the formula that says they are related belongs to \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n. If the language includes equality, the domain of the model are classes of equivalence of the terms of the language instead. The equivalence relation is established by the formulas of the maximally consistent set: two terms are equal if there is in \n\n\n\n\u0393\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma }\n\n a formula stating they are./nSummarizing, the demonstration in the case of a numerable language has two parts:[6]/nThe simple Theory of Types, with the \n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n\n-calculus and the standard semantics is sufficiently rich to express arithmetic categorically, from where it follows, by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, that it is incomplete. Following the idea of identifying the namable elements in the hierarchy of types, Henkin proposed a change in the interpretation of the language, accepting as types hierarchies some that  previously were not admitted. If it was asked from each level of the hierarchy not that there must be all the corresponding functions, but only those that are definable, then a new semantics is obtained, and with it a new logic.[38] The resulting semantics is known as general semantics. In it the structures that are admissible as models are those known as 'general models'.[39] These can be used not only in Type Theory, but also, for instance, to obtain complete (and compact) higher-order logics./nObtaining complete higher-order logics by the use of general semantics meets the expected balance between the expressive power of a logic and the power of its deductive calculus. In second-order logic with standard semantics it is known that quantifying over predicative variables gives the language an immense expressive power, in exchange for which the power of deductive calculus is lost: the latter is not enough to produce the extense set of valid formulas of this logic (with standard semantics). Changing the calculus does not solve anything, since G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem ensures that no deductive calculus could achieve completeness. On the contrary, by changing the semantics, that is, by changing the sets that form the universes in which the predicative variables and constants are interpreted, the logic turns out to be complete, at the cost of losing expressive capacity.[40]/nIn second-order logic the set of valid formulas is so large because the concept of standard structure is too restrictive and there are not enough of them to find models that refute the formulas.[41] By relaxing the conditions we ask of the structures on which the language is interpreted, there are more models in which the formulas must be true to be valid and therefore the set of valid formulas is reduced; it does so in such a way that it coincides with the set produced by a deductive calculus, giving rise to completeness.[42]/nOne of the areas in which the foundations laid by Henkin's work have proved fruitful is in the search for a logic that works as a common framework for translation between logics. This framework is intended to be used as a metalogical tool; its purpose is not to choose \"one logic\" above the others, which would suppress the richness provided by the diversity of them, but to provide the adequate context to contrast them, understand them and thus make the best use of the qualities of each one.[42]/nA research that takes Henkin's ideas in this direction is that of Mar\u00eda Manzano, one of his students, whose proposal is to use Many-Sorted Logic as a common framework for the translation of logics.[42] The aims of this proposal can be synthesized into two: 1) to use a single deductive calculus for all of them; and 2) to use the metaproperties of Many-Sorted Logic in order to more easily proof metaproperties of other logics. In addition, having a logical framework is useful for comparing different logics by comparing the theories that represent them.[42] Although Henkin does not speak of formulae translation, nor does he make explicit a Many-Sorted Language or calculus, the ideas he uses in two of his articles serve as a basis for the approach to translation:[43] \"Completeness in the theory of types\"[44] and \"Banishing the Rule of Substitution for Functional Variables\".[45]/nThe topic of mathematical induction was frequently addressed in Henkin's activities on teaching. Probably his experience in this field was the result of his article \"On mathematical induction\".[46] This was Henkin's favorite article of his own, of which he even wrote that he considered it his best expository article.[47] In it he defined Peano Models as those that fulfill Peano's three Second-Order Axioms and Induction Models as those that satisfy the third of them: the induction axiom. He demonstrated that although all recursive operations can be introduced in the Peano models, this is not the case in the Induction Models. Concretely, there are Induction Models in which the exponentiation operation cannot be defined.[46] In this article, Henkin also presents the mathematical structure that Induction models can have, which is quite simple: they can either be the standard model, that is, isomorphic to natural numbers, or in two more ways; isomorphic to cycles \u2013which correspond to the \n\n\n\n\nZ\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} }\n\n integers module \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n; or isomorphsicn to what Henkin called \"spoons,\" which is a combination of a finite list followed by a cycle.[46][42]/nOf the articles published by Henkin, the most philosophical is \"Some Notes on Nominalism\",[48] which he wrote in response to two articles on nominalism,[16] one by Quine and the other jointly written by Quine and Goodman. The discussions relevant to this philosophical doctrine arise naturally in the proofs of completeness given by Henkin, as well as in his proposal for a change in semantics through general models. Both from the content of his works and from his own statements it is considered that his position was nominalist.[6]/nHenkin's activity as a university professor was vigorous. He taught at all levels, putting the same care and dedication into each of them. Some of the courses he taught were directly related to his research area, such as \"Mathematical Logic\", \"Metamathematics\" or \"Cylindric Algebra\", but others extended to a great diversity of areas, including, among others, \"Fundaments of Geometry\", \"Algebra and Trigonometry\", \"Finite Mathematics\", \"Calculus with Analytic Geometry\" or \"Mathematical Concepts for Elementary School Teachers\".[16] His students agree that his explanations were extremely clear and caught the listener's attention.[49] In the words of one of his students, \"part of his magic was his elegant expression of the mathematics, but he also worked hard to engage his audience in conjecturing and seeing the next step or in being surprised by it. He certainly captured the interest of his audiences.\"[50]/nOne of the aspects of his lectures in which he put special care was in finding an appropriate pace, facing the constant dilemma of how to find the optimal speed for learning. He considered it important that the students could follow the rhythm of the class, even if this meant that some would found it slow \u2013they could continue at their own pace with the readings.[2] However, he also considered that what was easily learned was easily forgotten, so he sought a balance between making his classes accessible and challenging for students, so that they would make the effort to learn more deeply.[49] About his own experience as a student, he commented in an interview: \"That easy way in which ideas came made it too easy to forget them. I probably learned more densely condensed material in what we called the 'seminar for babies in conjunctive topology', conducted by Arthure Stone. I learned more because it forced us to do all the work.\"[51]/nIn addition to his courses and supervision of graduate students, Henkin's role in the scholars education was significant. Tarski had invited him to Berkeley with a clear purpose. As a mathematician, Henkin had a key role in Tarski's project to make Berkeley a center of development of logic,[52] bringing together mathematicians, logicians and philosophers. Henkin aided him to carry out the project, helping him in the creation of the interdisciplinary Group in Logic and the Methodology of Science, whose successful performance was largely due to Henkin's drive.[2] Part of this project was the creation of an interdisciplinary university program that culminated in a Ph.D. in \"Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science\". He also collaborated in organising important meetings and conferences that promoted interdisciplinary collaboration united by logic.[52] The outcome was that in the 1950s and 1960s there was a vibrant development of logic in Berkeley, from which many advances in Model Theory emerged./nAlthough Henkin's first encounter with teaching mathematics was as a professor, later in life he began to do research in mathematics' teaching as well. Some of his writings in this field are: \"Retracing Elementary Mathematics\",[53] \"New directions in secondary school mathematics\"[54] or \"The roles of action and of thought in mathematics education\".[55] From 1979 onwards he put special emphasis on this facet of his research[2] and the last doctoral theses he directed are related to the teaching of mathematics or the integration of minority groups in research.[16]/nHenkin liked to write expository articles,[56] for some of which he received awards such as the Chauvenet Prize (1964),[57] for the article \"Are Logic and Mathematics Identical? \"[9] or the Lester R. Ford Award,[16] for the article \"Mathematical Foundations of Mathematics\".[58]/nThroughout his life, Leon Henkin showed a deep commitment to society and was often called a social activist.[16] Many of his mathematics teaching projects sought to bring minority or socially disadvantaged groups closer to mathematics and related areas.[59] He was aware that we are part of history and the context around us, as one of his writings records:/n\"Waves of history wash over our nation, stirring up our society and our institutions. Soon we see changes in the way that all of us do things, including our mathematics and our teaching. These changes form themselves into rivulets and streams that merge at various angles with those arising in parts of our society quite different from education, mathematics, or science. Rivers are formed, contributing powerful currents that will produce future waves of history.\nThe Great Depression and World War II formed the background of my years of study; the Cold War and the Civil Rights Movement were the backdrop against which I began my career as a research mathematician, and later began to involve myself with mathematics education.\"[60]/nHenkin was convinced that changes could be achieved through education and, true to his idea, he committed himself to both elementary mathematics education programs and to programs whose aim was to combat exclusion.[61] He showed a political commitment to society, defending progressive ideas. He inspired many of his students to become involved in mathematics education.[2] Diane Resek, one of his students with an affinity for teaching, described him as follows:/n\"Leon was committed to work toward equity in society. He was able to see that profes- sional mathematicians could make a difference, particularly regarding racial inequities in the United States. He was one of the first people to say that one thing holding back racial minorities and poorer people in America was their low participation rates in math/science careers. He believed that there were ways of teaching and new programs that could correct this problem.\"[62]/nAware of the contributions that mathematicians could make through teaching, Henkin defended that teaching should be valued in the academy environment, as he expressed in a personal letter: \"In these times when our traditionally trained mathematics Ph.D.\u2019s are finding rough going in the marketplace, it seems to me that we on the faculty should particularly seek new realms wherein mathematics training can make a substantial contribution to the basic aims of society.\"[63]/nSome of the social projects he formed or participated in are the following.[2] Between 1957 and 1959 he was part of the Summer Institutes, aimed at mathematics teachers and dedicated to improving high school and college education. In 1958 the National Science Foundation authorized the committee of the American Mathematical Society \u2013which had been interested for some years in the use of films and visual material for mathematics education\u2013 to produce experimental films for this purpose, accompanied by printed manuals with appendices that would go deeper into the content and problems to be solved. Henkin participated in this project with a film on mathematical induction, whose supplementary manual was printed by the American Mathematical Society.[64] The film was broadcast in the series \"Mathematics Today\". Between 1961 and 1964, he participated in a series of courses for elementary school teachers, organized by the Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics. Also around that time, he promoted the Activities to Broaden Opportunity initiative, which sought to provide opportunities for promising students from ethnic minority groups by offering them summer courses and scholarships. He took part in the SEED (Special Elementary Education for the Disadvantaged) program, which encouraged college students to participate in elementary education, as well as in SESAME (Special Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education), the interdisciplinary doctoral program created by members of various science departments, whose purpose was to research teaching and learning of science, engineering, and mathematics. Between 1960 and 1968 he participated in a series of conferences in mathematics schools, and was involved in the development of several films produced by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). These films dealt with topics such as the integer system and the rational number system. He also participated in support courses for female calculus students and convinced the mathematics department to allow graduate students to receive the same financial support for working as elementary school teachers as they did for working as assistant teachers in college.[49] \"He not only believed in equality, but also worked actively to see that it was brought about.\"[65]", "1994574": "David Gawen Champernowne, FBA (9 July 1912 \u2013 19 August 2000)[1][2][3] was an English economist and mathematician./nChampernowne was the only child of Francis Gawayne Champernowne (1866\u20131921), M.A. (Oxon.), a barrister and bursar of Keble College, Oxford, and his wife Isabel Mary, daughter of George Rashleigh, of Riseley, Horton Kirby, Kent.[4] The Champernowne family were landed gentry, of Dartington, Devon; Francis Gawayne Champernowne was a grandson of Arthur Champernowne (1767\u20131819), M.P. for Saltash in 1806, who, born to Rev.

From a young age, Aris was interested in chemistry.  Aris's father owned a photo-finishing works, where he would experiment with chemicals and reactions. He attended St Martin's, a small local kindergarten and moved to St Wulfran's, a local preparatory school, now Queen Elizabeth's School. Here, he studied Latin (a skill he would make much use of later in his life) and was encouraged to continue pursuing his interest in chemistry.  Because of his achievements, he was referred to the Reverend C. B. Canning, Headmaster of Canford School, a well-known public school, close to Wimborne. On the strength of this interview, he was given a place in the newly created house that the school had provided for day-boarders.  This was in 1943, when he was 14.  His mathematics teacher, H. E. Piggott, had a particular influence on Aris due to \"the liveliness, enthusiasm, and care that he brought to his teaching\", which \"were unparalleled in my experience\".[1] Piggot spent substantial time on pure and applied mathematical papers, an experience that Aris described as \"extraordinary\". Aris dedicated his book Discrete Dynamic Programming to Piggot 15 years later.[2]/nPiggot helped Aris to get a job working for Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) as a laboratory technician in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Research Labs, at the age of 17.  While working at ICI, Aris attended the University of London part-time to work toward his B.Sc. Aris described this as \"an excellent way to get a degree, although perhaps not so good a way of getting an education.\"[1]  After 2 years Aris made an attempt to earn the B.Sc. Honours Degree. He sat 12 papers (exams) covering a wide range of mathematical topics, and got a degree with first-class honours./nIn 1948, ICI sent him to Edinburgh, Scotland for two years of study at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Edinburgh, which was presided over by Alexander Aitken. Aris, who was accepted for post-graduate studies but not for a Ph.D., did post-graduate work at the University under the supervision of John Cossar. During this break from ICI, Aris also registered for a University of London M.Sc. in the area of mathematical analysis.  When he sat the papers, however, he failed to get the degree./nIn 1950, Aris returned to ICI and began working for C. H. Bosanquet in Billingham, England. Working with Bosanquet provided Aris the opportunity to work on a large variety of problems, including catalysis, heat transfer, gas scrubbing, and centrifuge design./nAris was then promoted to Technical Officer, where he began working on chromatography. He utilized results from a paper on dispersion written by Geoffrey Taylor,[3] and extended its results, ultimately writing a paper in 1955 that applied the method of moments to Taylor's approach.  He submitted the paper to the Proceedings of the Royal Society, with help from Taylor (who was a Fellow of the Royal Society). Aris communicated with Taylor regarding dispersion and diffusion. In the meantime, however, he was transferred to a different division, where he began working on chemical reactor design.  Frustrated with the transfer and with the proprietary nature of his commercial work, which made publishing work very difficult, he decided to move to a university, applying for several lectureship positions during 1954 and 1955 without success.  Aris continued to work at ICI, focusing much of his efforts on mathematical modeling of adiabatic multi-bed reactors, a topic that was the central focus of an M.S. student at the University of Minnesota. In 1955, Neal Amundson of the University of Minnesota, who was on sabbatical at Cambridge, visited the ICI Research Department, where Aris was working. Amundson suggested to ICI, during his visit, that Aris be sent to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis for a year of study.  Several months later, Aris later met Amundson at Cambridge and told Amundson of his plans to leave ICI for academia, plans that he had not revealed to his superiors at ICI. Amundson offered Aris a research fellowship at the University of Minnesota, which Aris accepted.  After notifying ICI of his intent to leave, he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota at the end of 1955./nAris began working on chemically reacting laminar flow, applying Kummer's hypergeometric function to the problem, and control of a stirred tank reactor with some unusual properties.  Both problems required the use of a computer to perform calculations, and Amundson provided Aris with a computer science graduate student with whom to work. Aris's research fellowship was extended for a second year, but shortly afterward, in October 1956, Aris was informed of a lectureship opening at the University of Edinburgh. He took advantage of the opportunity, and left immediately for Edinburgh./nAris was on the faculty of the University of Edinburgh for two years, 1956\u20131958. While at Edinburgh, Aris wrote papers on his work at the University of Minnesota and at ICI. Having the lectureship position allowed Aris to gain experience lecturing to students. He also attended the lectures of, and interacted with, the chair of chemical technology at the University of Edinburgh, Kenneth Denbigh, who was a well-known thermodynamicist and an editor of the journal Chemical Engineering Science./nAris returned to Minneapolis in the summer of 1957 to continue his work on the stirred tank reactor problem. In August he became engaged to Claire Holman, and when he informed Amundson, Amundson offered him a faculty position at the University. Aris accepted the job, and began working as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota in 1958./nAris had not formally received a Ph.D., but had registered three years earlier with the University of London, where he had earned his B.Sc., and which offered Ph.D. degrees by correspondence. A Ph.D. degree could be earned without following a strict preparation process; the individual needed to propose a research program after 3 years, select a committee of examiners, and submit a dissertation, and after an oral examination by and approval from the committee, the degree would be granted.  Amundson had suggested Aris look into Richard Bellman's method of dynamic programming[4] for his dissertation. Amundson informally served as Aris's advisor, and Aris completed his dissertation on the topic in 1960./nHis dissertation was published by the Academic Press in a series of which Bellman was the editor, and Bellman took note of the dissertation. Aris and Amundson visited Bellman at the Rand Corporation, where Bellman was working on economic models. The dynamic programming method had originally been developed for economics, but Bellman was attracted by applications in engineering, and the meeting led to a joint collaboration and a publication./nAris's research at the University of Minnesota focused on optimization, dynamic programming, control theory, Taylor diffusion, and computing engines. Aris also taught a graduate fluid mechanics course, and eventually wrote the book Vectors, tensors, and the basic equations of fluid mechanics[5] in an effort to make the rational mechanics approach of Truesdell, Coleman, and others more accessible to students./nAfter he had been with the department for six years, Aris took a sabbatical at the Shell Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge during the 1964\u20131965 academic year, where he was able to interact with many well-known engineers and mathematicians such as Geoffrey Taylor and John Littlewood. He also lectured in many places in Europe, including Brussels, Copenhagen, and Trondheim./nAris took a second sabbatical after 6 years, again going to the University of Cambridge, during the 1971\u20131972 academic year. He spent his time writing a monograph on mathematical models for porous catalysts, which he did not finish until 1973. During his sabbatical, he received financial support in the form of a Guggenheim grant. This also provided Aris an opportunity to participate in the board overseeing the formation and development of Los Alamos National Lab's Center for Nonlinear Studies, which allowed Aris the opportunity to travel to Los Alamos during the 1970s and 1980s./nIn 1974, Neal Amundson, who had been the department chairman of the University of Minnesota's chemical engineering department for nearly 25 years, resigned from this position. Aris was appointed acting head of the department, while Amundson left Minnesota for the University of Houston. Aris acted as department chair for 4 years, and was relieved of the position in 1978. Coinciding with this was an offer from Princeton University to join the faculty there, as well as the offer to stay at the University of Minnesota and work half-time in the chemical engineering department and half-time in the paleography department. Aris decided to stay at the University of Minnesota./nIn addition to his interest in chemical engineering, Aris was also interested in the humanities. At the University of Minnesota, Aris was able to pursue his interest in paleography when he was granted a professorship in the Classics Department, where he taught classes and published books and research articles. Aris published his book Explicatio Formarum Literarum, or The Unfolding of Letterforms, which covered the history of written letters from the 1st century to the 15th century./nAris had several other sabbaticals over his 40-year career.  Through the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar program at the California Institute of Technology, Aris was able to spend a portion of 1977 and a year in 1980\u20131981 on sabbatical in Pasadena, California. He dedicated a portion of his time to paleography, utilizing the nearby Huntington Library. Additionally, through a personal connection at the University of Leeds, Aris was able to spend several weeks there as Brotherton Professor in 1985. Aris spent his last sabbatical, from 1993\u20131994, at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton./nAris penned many poems and anecdotes, many relating his difficulties with Parkinson's disease, from which Aris eventually died. Aris died on November 2, 2005, in Edina, Minnesota./nOver the course of his long academic career, Aris was a visiting professor at many institutions, including Cambridge University, the California Institute of Technology, and Princeton University; he authored 13 books and more than 300 chemical engineering research articles, and mentored 48 Ph.D. and 20 M.S. graduate students. Aris was well known for his research on mathematical modeling, chemical reactor and chemical process design, and distillation techniques, as well as his paleographic research./nAfter he had been department head for four years, in 1978 he was named Regents Professor. Some of the awards and honors earned by Aris include a Guggenheim Fellowship, election to the National Academy of Engineering in 1975 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1988.[6] Aris was also a member of the American Chemical Society, the Society for Mathematical Biology, and the Society of Scribes and Illuminators, among others. Aris was awarded the Richard E. Bellman Control Heritage Award in 1992 for his contributions to the field of control theory.[7] He was awarded the Neal R. Amundson Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering by the International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering in 1998.[8]/nIn 2016, the board of the ISCRE (International Symposia on Chemical Reaction Engineering) established the Rutherford Aris Young Investigator Award for Excellence in Chemical Reaction Engineering.

After the war, he ran a hardware store in Dallas, then little more than a railway stop, and raised six children, of whom Robert, named after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, was the fifth./nMoore entered the University of Texas at the unusually youthful age of 15, in 1898, already knowing calculus thanks to self-study. He completed the B.Sc. in three years instead of the usual four; his teachers included G. B. Halsted and L. E. Dickson. After a year as a teaching fellow at Texas, he taught high school for a year in Marshall, Texas./nAn assignment of Halsted's led Moore to prove that one of Hilbert's axioms for geometry was redundant. When E. H. Moore (no relation), who headed the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, and whose research interests were on the foundations of geometry, heard of Robert's feat, he arranged for a scholarship that would allow Robert to study for a doctorate at Chicago. Oswald Veblen supervised Moore's 1905 thesis, titled Sets of Metrical Hypotheses for Geometry./nMoore then taught one year at the University of Tennessee, two years at Princeton University, and three years at Northwestern University.

In 1931, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences./nAccording to the bibliography in Wilder (1976), Moore published 67 papers and one monograph, his 1932 Foundations of Point Set Theory. He is primarily remembered for his work on the foundations of topology, a topic he first touched on in his Ph.D. thesis. By the time Moore returned to the University of Texas, he had published 17 papers on point-set topology\u2014a term he coined\u2014including his 1915 paper \"On a set of postulates which suffice to define a number-plane\", giving an axiom system for plane topology. \nThe Moore plane, Moore's road space, Moore space, Moore's quotient theorem\u00a0[ru] and the normal Moore space conjecture are named in his honor./nRobert Lee Moore is known to have supervised 50 doctoral dissertations, almost all at Texas, including those of R. H. Bing,  F. Burton Jones, John R. Kline, Edwin Evariste Moise, Mary Ellen Rudin, Gordon Whyburn, Richard Davis Anderson, and Raymond Louis Wilder.  Moore has been described as having been one of the most charismatic and inspiring university teachers of mathematics ever active in the United States. Accounts have been given of his ability to teach students who had never previously distinguished themselves in mathematics how to do proofs. He went out of his way to teach elementary and service courses every year, and actually forbade his pre-doctoral level students from consulting the mathematical literature.[1][2]/nIt was while attending lectures at the University of Chicago that Moore first hit on his original teaching methods. Finding these lectures rather boring, even mind dulling, he would liven up a lecture by running a race in his mind with the lecturer, by trying to discover the proof of an announced theorem before the lecturer had finished his presentation. Moore often won this silent race, and when he did not, he felt that he was better off from having made the attempt. It was at the University of Pennsylvania, while teaching a course on the foundations of geometry, that Moore first tried out the teaching methods that came to be known as the Moore method. The success of this method led others to adopt it and similar methods./nMoore's record as a teacher of mathematics has been tarnished by his racism towards black students.[3][4]\nMost of Moore's career was spent in a racially segregated part of the United States. African-American students were prohibited from even enrolling at the University of Texas until the late 1950s,[5]\nand Moore himself was strongly in favor of segregation.[6][7][8][9] After the University of Texas began admitting African-American students, he refused to allow them into his classes,\neven for mathematics graduate students such as Vivienne Malone-Mayes.[3][4][7][8] He told another African-American mathematics student, Walker E. Hunt, \"you are welcome\nto take my course but you start with a C and can only go down from there\".[9] On one occasion he walked out of a talk by a student, his academic grandchild, after discovering that the speaker was African-American.[4][7][8]/nMoore was also known for repeatedly claiming that female students were inferior to male students, and, though \"less pronounced than his racism\", for his antisemitism.[4] However, while Moore's racism is confirmed by several first-hand accounts of his refusal to teach African-American students, the often-repeated description of him as a misogynist and antisemite is based largely on his oral remarks. Some of the sources reporting these remarks, such as Mary Ellen Rudin, also point out that in fact he encouraged females who showed mathematical talent and that he had Jewish students, such as Edwin E.

He lives in seclusion in Saint Petersburg, and has not accepted offers for interviews since 2006./nIn the 1990s, partly in collaboration with Yuri Burago, Mikhael Gromov, and Anton Petrunin, he made contributions to the study of Alexandrov spaces. In 1994, he proved the soul conjecture in Riemannian geometry, which had been an open problem for the previous 20 years. In 2002 and 2003, he developed new techniques in the analysis of Ricci flow, and proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture, the former of which had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century. The full details of Perelman's work were filled in and explained by various authors over the following several years./nIn August 2006, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal[1] for \"his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow\", but he declined the award, stating: \"I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo.\"[2] On 22 December 2006, the scientific journal Science recognized Perelman's proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture as the scientific \"Breakthrough of the Year\", the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.[3]/nOn 18 March 2010, it was announced that he had met the criteria to receive the first Clay Millennium Prize[4] for resolution of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. On 1 July 2010, he rejected the prize of one million dollars, saying that he considered the decision of the board of the Clay Institute to be unfair, in that his contribution to solving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture was no greater than that of Richard S. Hamilton, the mathematician who pioneered the Ricci flow partly with the aim of attacking the conjecture.[5][6] He had previously rejected the prestigious prize of the European Mathematical Society in 1996.[7]/nGrigori Yakovlevich Perelman was born in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia) on 13 June 1966, to Jewish parents,[8][9][10] Yakov (who now lives in Israel)[8] and Lyubov (who still lives in Saint Petersburg with Grigori).[8] Grigori's mother Lyubov gave up graduate work in mathematics to raise him. Grigori's mathematical talent became apparent at the age of ten, and his mother enrolled him in Sergei Rukshin's after-school mathematics training program.[11]/nHis mathematical education continued at the Leningrad Secondary School 239, a specialized school with advanced mathematics and physics programs. Grigori excelled in all subjects except physical education.[12] In 1982, as a member of the Soviet Union team competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad, an international competition for high school students, he won a gold medal, achieving a perfect score.[13] He continued as a student of The School of Mathematics and Mechanics at the Leningrad State University, without admission examinations, and enrolled at the university.[citation needed]/nAfter completing his PhD in 1990, Perelman began work at the Leningrad Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where his advisors were Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Yuri Burago. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with a strong recommendation from the geometer Mikhail Gromov,[14] Perelman obtained research positions at several universities in the United States. In 1991, Perelman won the Young Mathematician Prize of the St. Petersburg Mathematical Society for his work on Aleksandrov's spaces of curvature bounded from below.[15] In 1992, he was invited to spend a semester each at the Courant Institute in New York University, where he began work on manifolds with lower bounds on Ricci curvature. From there, he accepted a two-year Miller Research Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1993. After having proved the soul conjecture in 1994, he was offered jobs at several top universities in the US, including Princeton and Stanford, but he rejected them all and returned to the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg in the summer of 1995 for a research-only position.[11]/nIn his undergraduate studies, Perelman dealt with issues in the field of convex geometry. His first published article studied the combinatorial structures arising from intersections of convex polyhedra.[P85] With I. V. Polikanova, he established a measure-theoretic formulation of Helly's theorem.[PP86] In 1987, the year he began graduate studies, he published an article controlling the size of circumscribed cylinders by that of inscribed spheres.[P87]/nSurfaces of negative curvature were the subject of Perelman's graduate studies. His first result was on the possibility of prescribing the structure of negatively-curved polyhedral surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space. He proved that any such metric on the plane which is complete can be continuously immersed as a polyhedral surface.[P88] Later, he constructed an example of a smooth hypersurface of four-dimensional Euclidean space which is complete and has Gaussian curvature negative and bounded away from zero. Previous examples of such surfaces were known, but Perelman's was the first to exhibit the saddle property on nonexistence of locally strictly supporting hyperplanes.[P89] As such, his construction provided further obstruction to the extension of a well-known theorem of Nikolai Efimov to higher dimensions.[16]/nPerelman's first works to have a major impact on the mathematical literature were in the field of Alexandrov spaces, the concept of which dates back to the 1950s. In a very well-known paper coauthored with Yuri Burago and Mikhael Gromov, Perelman established the modern foundations of this field, with the notion of Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence as an organizing principle.[BGP92] In a followup unpublished paper, Perelman proved his \"stability theorem,\" asserting that in the collection of all Alexandrov spaces with a fixed curvature bound, all elements of any sufficiently small metric ball around a compact space are mutually homeomorphic.[P91] Vitali Kapovitch, who described Perelman's article as being \"very hard to read,\" later wrote a detailed version of Perelman's proof, making use of some further simplifications./nPerelman developed a version of Morse theory on Alexandrov spaces.[P93] Despite the lack of smoothness in Alexandrov spaces, Perelman and Anton Petrunin were able to consider the gradient flow of certain functions, in unpublished work.[PP95] They also introduced the notion of an \"extremal subset\" of Alexandrov spaces, and showed that the interiors of certain extremal subsets define a stratification of the space by topological manifolds.[PP93] In further unpublished work, Perelman studied DC functions (difference of concave functions) on Alexandrov spaces and established that the set of regular points has the structure of a manifold modeled on DC functions.[P95d]/nFor his work on Alexandrov spaces, Perelman was recognized with an invited lecture at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians.[P95a]/nIn 1972, Jeff Cheeger and Detlef Gromoll established their important soul theorem. It asserts that every complete Riemannian metric of nonnegative sectional curvature has a compact nonnegatively curved submanifold, called a soul, whose normal bundle is diffeomorphic to the original space. From the perspective of homotopy theory, this says in particular that every complete Riemannian metric of nonnegative sectional curvature may be taken to be closed. Cheeger and Gromoll conjectured that if the curvature is strictly positive somewhere, then the soul can be taken to be a single point, and hence that the original space must be diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. In 1994, Perelman gave a short proof of Cheeger and Gromoll's conjecture by establishing that, under the condition of nonnegative sectional curvature, Sharafutdinov's retraction is a submersion.[P94b] Perelman's theorem is significant in establishing a topological obstruction to deforming a nonnegatively curved metric to one which is positively curved, even at a single point./nSome of Perelman's work dealt with the construction of various interesting Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature. He found Riemannian metrics on the connected sum of arbitrarily many complex projective planes with positive Ricci curvature, bounded diameter, and volume bounded away from zero.[P97b] Also, he found an explicit complete metric on four-dimensional Euclidean space with positive Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, and such that the asymptotic cone is nonuniquely defined.[P97c]/nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, proposed by mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1904, was throughout the 20th century regarded as a key problem in topology. On the 3-sphere, defined as the set of points at unit length from the origin in four-dimensional Euclidean space, any loop can be contracted into a point. Poincar\u00e9 suggested that a converse might be true: if a closed three-dimensional manifold has the property that any loop can be contracted into a point, then it must be topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere. Stephen Smale proved a high-dimensional analogue of Poincar\u00e9's conjecture in 1961, and Michael Freedman proved the four-dimensional version in 1982.[17][18] Despite their work, the case of three-dimensional spaces remained completely unresolved. Moreover, Smale and Freedman's methods have had no impact on the three-dimensional case, as their topological manipulations, moving \"problematic regions\" out of the way without interfering with other regions, seem to require high dimensions in order to work./nIn 1982, William Thurston developed a novel viewpoint, making the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture into a small special case of a hypothetical systematic structure theory of topology in three dimensions. His proposal, known as the Thurston geometrization conjecture, posited that given any closed three-dimensional manifold whatsoever, there is some collection of two-dimensional spheres and tori inside of the manifold which disconnect the space into separate pieces, each of which can be endowed with a uniform geometric structure.[19] Thurston was able to prove his conjecture under some provisional assumptions. In John Morgan's view, it was only with Thurston's systematic viewpoint that most topologists came to believe that the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture would be true.[20]/nAt the same time that Thurston published his conjecture, Richard Hamilton introduced his theory of the Ricci flow. Hamilton's Ricci flow is a prescription, defined by a partial differential equation formally analogous to the heat equation, for how to deform a Riemannian metric on a manifold. The heat equation, such as when applied in the sciences to physical phenomena such as temperature, models how concentrations of extreme temperatures will spread out until a uniform temperature is achieved throughout an object. In three seminal articles published in the 1980s, Hamilton proved that his equation achieved analogous phenomena, spreading extreme curvatures and uniformizing a Riemannian metric, in certain geometric settings.[21][22][23] As a byproduct, he was able to prove some new and striking theorems in the field of Riemannian geometry./nDespite formal similarities, Hamilton's equations are significantly more complex and nonlinear than the heat equation, and it is impossible that such uniformization is achieved without contextual assumptions. In completely general settings, it is inevitable that \"singularities\" occur, meaning that curvature accumulates to infinite levels after a finite amount of \"time\" has elapsed. Following Shing-Tung Yau's suggestion that a detailed understanding of these singularities could be topologically meaningful, and in particular that their locations might identify the spheres and tori in Thurston's conjecture, Hamilton began a systematic analysis.[24] Throughout the 1990s, he found a number of new technical results and methods,[25] culminating in a 1997 publication constructing a \"Ricci flow with surgery\" for four-dimensional spaces.[26] As an application of his construction, Hamilton was able to settle a four-dimensional curvature-based analogue of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Yau has identified this article as one of the most important in the field of geometric analysis, saying that with its publication it became clear that Ricci flow could be powerful enough to settle the Thurston conjecture.[27] The key of Hamilton's analysis was a quantitative understanding of how singularities occur in his four-dimensional setting; the most outstanding difficulty was the quantitative understanding of how singularities occur in three-dimensional settings. Although Hamilton was unable to resolve this issue, in 1999 he published work on Ricci flow in three dimensions, showing that if a three-dimensional version of his surgery techniques could be developed, and if a certain conjecture on the long-time behavior of Ricci flow could be established, then Thurston's conjecture would be resolved.[28] This became known as the Hamilton program./nIn November 2002 and March 2003, Perelman posted two preprints to arXiv, in which he claimed to have outlined a proof of Thurston's conjecture.[P02][P03a] In a third paper posted in July 2003, Perelman outlined an additional argument, sufficient for proving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture (but not the Thurston conjecture), the point being to avoid the most technical work in his second preprint.[P03b] Making use of the Almgren-Pitts min-max theory from the field of geometric measure theory, Tobias Colding and William Minicozzi provided a completely alternative proof of the results in Perelman's third preprint.[29][30][31]/nPerelman's first preprint contained two primary results, both to do with Ricci flow. The first, valid in any dimension, was based on a novel adaptation of Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau's differential Harnack inequalities to the setting of Ricci flow.[32] By carrying out the proof of the Bishop-Gromov inequality for the resulting Li\u2212Yau length functional, Perelman established his celebrated \"noncollapsing theorem\" for Ricci flow, asserting that local control of the size of the curvature implies control of volumes. The significance of the noncollapsing theorem is that volume control is one of the preconditions of Hamilton's compactness theorem. As a consequence, Hamilton's compactness and the corresponding existence of subsequential limits could be applied somewhat freely./nThe \"canonical neighborhoods theorem\" is the second main result of Perelman's first preprint. In this theorem, Perelman achieved the quantitative understanding of singularities of three-dimensional Ricci flow which had eluded Hamilton. Roughly speaking, Perelman showed that on a microscopic level, every singularity looks either like a cylinder collapsing to its axis, or a sphere collapsing to its center. Perelman's proof of his canonical neighborhoods theorem is a highly technical achievement, based upon extensive arguments by contradiction in which Hamilton's compactness theorem (as facilitated by Perelman's noncollapsing theorem) is applied to construct self-contradictory manifolds./nOther results in Perelman's first preprint include the introduction of certain monotonic quantities and a \"pseudolocality theorem\" which relates curvature control and isoperimetry. However, despite being major results in the theory of Ricci flow, these results were not used in the rest of his work./nThe first half of Perelman's second preprint, in addition to fixing some incorrect statements and arguments from the first paper, used his canonical neighborhoods theorem to construct a Ricci flow with surgery in three dimensions, systematically excising singular regions as they develop. As an immediate corollary of his construction, Perelman resolved a major conjecture on the topological classification in three dimensions of closed manifolds which admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. His third preprint (or alternatively Colding and Minicozzi's work) showed that on any space satisfying the assumptions of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, the Ricci flow with surgery exists only for finite time, so that the infinite-time analysis of Ricci flow is irrelevant. The construction of Ricci flow with surgery has the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture as a corollary./nIn order to settle the Thurston conjecture, the second half of Perelman's second preprint is devoted to an analysis of Ricci flows with surgery, which may exist for infinite time. Perelman was unable to resolve Hamilton's 1999 conjecture on long-time behavior, which would make Thurston's conjecture another corollary of the existence of Ricci flow with surgery. Nonetheless, Perelman was able to adapt Hamilton's arguments to the precise conditions of his new Ricci flow with surgery. The end of Hamilton's argument made use of Jeff Cheeger and Mikhael Gromov's theorem characterizing collapsing manifolds. In Perelman's adaptation, he required use of a new theorem characterizing manifolds in which collapsing is only assumed on a local level. In his preprint, he said the proof of his theorem would be established in another paper, but he did not then release any further details. Proofs were later published by Takashi Shioya and Takao Yamaguchi,[33] John Morgan and Gang Tian,[34] Jianguo Cao and Jian Ge,[35] and Bruce Kleiner and John Lott.[36]/nPerelman's preprints quickly gained the attention of the mathematical community, although they were widely seen as hard to understand since they had been written somewhat tersely. Against the usual style in academic mathematical publications, many technical details had been omitted. It was soon apparent that Perelman had made major contributions to the foundations of Ricci flow, although it was not immediately clear to the mathematical community that these contributions were sufficient to prove the geometrization conjecture or the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture./nIn April 2003, Perelman visited the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Stony Brook University, Columbia University, and New York University to give short series of lectures on his work, and to clarify some details for experts in the relevant fields. In the years afterwards, three detailed expositions appeared, discussed below. Since then, various parts of Perelman's work have also appeared in a number of textbooks and expository articles./nPerelman's proofs are concise and, at times, sketchy. The purpose of these notes is to provide the details that are missing in [Perelman's first two preprints]... Regarding the proofs, [Perelman's papers] contain some incorrect statements and incomplete arguments, which we have attempted to point out to the reader. (Some of the mistakes in [Perelman's first paper] were corrected in [Perelman's second paper].) We did not find any serious problems, meaning problems that cannot be corrected using the methods introduced by Perelman./nIn this paper, we shall present the Hamilton-Perelman theory of Ricci flow. Based on it, we shall give the first written account of a complete proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and the geometrization conjecture of Thurston. While the complete work is an accumulated efforts of many geometric analysts, the major contributors are unquestionably Hamilton and Perelman. [...] In this paper, we shall give complete and detailed proofs [...] especially of Perelman's work in his second paper in which many key ideas of the proofs are sketched or outlined but complete details of the proofs are often missing. As we pointed out before, we have to substitute several key arguments of Perelman by new approaches based on our study, because we were unable to comprehend these original arguments of Perelman which are essential to the completion of the geometrization program./nIn May 2006, a committee of nine mathematicians voted to award Perelman a Fields Medal for his work on the Ricci flow.[38] However, Perelman declined to accept the prize. Sir John Ball, president of the International Mathematical Union, approached Perelman in Saint Petersburg in June 2006 to persuade him to accept the prize. After 10 hours of attempted persuasion over two days, Ball gave up. Two weeks later, Perelman summed up the conversation as follows: \"He proposed to me three alternatives: accept and come; accept and don't come, and we will send you the medal later; third, I don't accept the prize. From the very beginning, I told him I have chosen the third one ... [the prize] was completely irrelevant for me. Everybody understood that if the proof is correct, then no other recognition is needed.\"[38] He was quoted as saying, \"'I'm not interested in money or fame, I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo. I'm not a hero of mathematics. I'm not even that successful; that is why I don't want to have everybody looking at me.'\"[46]/nNevertheless, on 22 August 2006, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal \"for his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow\".[47] He did not attend the ceremony and the presenter informed the congress that Perelman declined to accept the medal, which made him the only person to have ever declined the prize.[7][48]/nHe had previously rejected a prestigious prize from the European Mathematical Society.[7]/nOn 18 March 2010, Perelman was awarded a Millennium Prize for solving the problem.[49] On 8 June 2010, he did not attend a ceremony in his honor at the Institut Oc\u00e9anographique, Paris to accept his $1 million prize.[citation needed] According to Interfax, Perelman refused to accept the Millennium prize in July 2010. He considered the decision of the Clay Institute unfair for not sharing the prize with Richard S. Hamilton,[5] and stated that \"the main reason is my disagreement with the organized mathematical community. I don't like their decisions, I consider them unjust.\"[6]/nThe Clay Institute subsequently used Perelman's prize money to fund the \"Poincar\u00e9 Chair\", a temporary position for young promising mathematicians at the Paris Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9.[50]/nPerelman quit his job at the Steklov Institute in December 2005.[51] His friends are said to have stated that he currently finds mathematics a painful topic to discuss; by 2010, some even said that he had entirely abandoned mathematics.[52]/nPerelman is quoted in a 2006 article in The New Yorker saying that he was disappointed with the ethical standards of the field of mathematics. The article implies that Perelman refers particularly to alleged efforts of Fields medalist Shing-Tung Yau to downplay Perelman's role in the proof and play up the work of Cao and Zhu. Perelman added:/n\"I can't say I'm outraged. Other people do worse. Of course, there are many mathematicians who are more or less honest. But almost all of them are conformists. They are more or less honest, but they tolerate those who are not honest...It is not people who break ethical standards who are regarded as aliens. It is people like me who are isolated.\"[38]/nThis, combined with the possibility of being awarded a Fields medal, led him to state that he had quit professional mathematics by 2006. He said:/n\"As long as I was not conspicuous, I had a choice. Either to make some ugly thing or, if I didn't do this kind of thing, to be treated as a pet. Now, when I become a very conspicuous person, I cannot stay a pet and say nothing. That is why I had to quit.\" (The New Yorker authors explained Perelman's reference to \"some ugly thing\" as \"a fuss\" on Perelman's part about the ethical breaches he perceived.)[53]/nIt was unclear whether along with his resignation from Steklov and subsequent seclusion Perelman stopped his mathematics research. Yakov Eliashberg, another Russian mathematician, said that in 2007 Perelman confided to him that he was working on other things, but that it was too premature to discuss them. Perelman has shown interest in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations and the problem of their solutions' existence and smoothness, according to Le Point.[54]/nIn 2014, Russian media reported that Perelman was working in the field of nanotechnology in Sweden.[55] Shortly thereafter, however, he was spotted again in his native hometown of Saint Petersburg.[55] Russian media speculated he is periodically visiting his sister in Sweden, while living in Saint Petersburg and taking care of his elderly mother.[56]/nPerelman has avoided journalists and other members of the media. Masha Gessen, author of a biography about Perelman, Perfect Rigour: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century, was unable to meet him.[57]/nA Russian documentary about Perelman in which his work is discussed by several leading mathematicians including Mikhail Gromov was released in 2011 under the title \"\u0418\u043d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446. \u0423\u0440\u043e\u043a \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\" (\"Maverick: Perelman's Lesson\").[citation needed]/nIn April 2011, Aleksandr Zabrovsky, producer of \"President-Film\"  studio, claimed to have held an interview with Perelman and agreed to shoot a film about him, under the tentative title The Formula of the Universe.[58] Zabrovsky says that in the interview,[citation needed] Perelman explained why he rejected the one million dollar prize.[58]\nA number of journalists[59][60][61] believe that Zabrovsky's interview is most likely a fake, pointing to contradictions in statements supposedly made by Perelman.[citation needed]/nThe writer Brett Forrest briefly interacted with Perelman in 2012.[62][63] A reporter who had called him was told: \"You are disturbing me.

In all likelihood, Copernicus developed his model independently of Aristarchus of Samos, an ancient Greek astronomer who had formulated such a model some eighteen centuries earlier.[6][c][d][e]/nThe publication of Copernicus's model in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), just before his death in 1543, was a major event in the history of science, triggering the Copernican Revolution and making a pioneering contribution to the Scientific Revolution.[8]/nCopernicus was born and died in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and multilingual region that had been part of the Kingdom of Poland since 1466. A polyglot and polymath, he obtained a doctorate in canon law and was a mathematician, astronomer, physician, classics scholar, translator, governor, diplomat, and economist. From 1497 he was a Warmian Cathedral chapter canon. In 1517 he derived a quantity theory of money\u2014a key concept in economics\u2014and in 1519 he formulated an economic principle that later came to be called Gresham's law.[f]/nNicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 in the city of Toru\u0144 (Thorn), in the province of Royal Prussia, in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland[10][11] to German-speaking parents.[12]/nHis father was a merchant from Krak\u00f3w (Krakau) and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy Toru\u0144 merchant.[13] Nicolaus was the youngest of four children. His brother Andreas (Andrew) became an Augustinian canon at Frombork (Frauenburg).[13] His sister Barbara, named after her mother, became a Benedictine nun and, in her final years, prioress of a convent in Che\u0142mno (Kulm); she died after 1517.[13] His sister Katharina married the businessman and Toru\u0144 city councilor Barthel Gertner and left five children, whom Copernicus looked after to the end of his life.[13] Copernicus never married and is not known to have had children, but from at least 1531 until 1539 his relations with Anna Schilling, a live-in housekeeper, were seen as scandalous by two bishops of Warmia who urged him over the years to break off relations with his \"mistress\".[14]/nCopernicus's father's family can be traced to a village in Silesia between Nysa (Nei\u00dfe) and Prudnik (Neustadt). The village's name has been variously spelled Kopernik,[g] Copernik, Copernic, Kopernic, Coprirnik, and today Koperniki.[16]/nIn the 14th century, members of the family began moving to various other Silesian cities, to the Polish capital, Krak\u00f3w (1367), and to Toru\u0144 (1400).[16] The father, Miko\u0142aj the Elder, likely the son of Jan, came from the Krak\u00f3w line.[16]/nNicolaus was named after his father, who appears in records for the first time as a well-to-do merchant who dealt in copper, selling it mostly in Danzig (Gda\u0144sk).[17][18] He moved from Krak\u00f3w to Toru\u0144 around 1458.[19] Toru\u0144, situated on the Vistula River, was at that time embroiled in the Thirteen Years' War, in which the Kingdom of Poland and the Prussian Confederation, an alliance of Prussian cities, gentry and clergy, fought the Teutonic Order over control of the region. In this war, Hanseatic cities like Danzig and Toru\u0144, Nicolaus Copernicus's hometown, chose to support the Polish King, Casimir IV Jagiellon, who promised to respect the cities' traditional vast independence, which the Teutonic Order had challenged. Nicolaus's father was actively engaged in the politics of the day and supported Poland and the cities against the Teutonic Order.[20] In 1454 he mediated negotiations between Poland's Cardinal Zbigniew Ole\u015bnicki and the Prussian cities for repayment of war loans.[16] In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Teutonic Order formally relinquished all claims to its western province, which as Royal Prussia remained a region of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland until the First (1772) and Second (1793) Partitions of Poland./nCopernicus's father married Barbara Watzenrode, the astronomer's mother, between 1461 and 1464.[16] He died about 1483.[13]/nNicolaus's mother, Barbara Watzenrode, was the daughter of a wealthy Toru\u0144 patrician and city councillor, Lucas Watzenrode the Elder (deceased 1462), and Katarzyna (widow of Jan Peckau), mentioned in other sources as Katarzyna R\u00fcdiger gente Modlib\u00f3g (deceased 1476).[13] The Modlib\u00f3gs were a prominent Polish family who had been well known in Poland's history since 1271.[21] The Watzenrode family, like the Kopernik family, had come from Silesia from near Schweidnitz (\u015awidnica), and after 1360 had settled in Toru\u0144. They soon became one of the wealthiest and most influential patrician families.[13] Through the Watzenrodes' extensive family relationships by marriage, Copernicus was related to wealthy families of Toru\u0144 (Thorn), Danzig (Gdansk) and Elbing (Elbl\u0105g), and to prominent Polish noble families of Prussia: the Czapskis, Dzia\u0142y\u0144skis, Konopackis and Ko\u015bcieleckis.[13] Lucas and Katherine had three children: Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447\u20131512), who would become Bishop of Warmia and Copernicus's patron; Barbara, the astronomer's mother (deceased after 1495); and Christina (deceased before 1502), who in 1459 married the Toru\u0144 merchant and mayor, Tiedeman von Allen.[13]/nLucas Watzenrode the Elder, a wealthy merchant and in 1439\u201362 president of the judicial bench, was a decided opponent of the Teutonic Knights.[13] In 1453 he was the delegate from Toru\u0144 at the Grudzi\u0105dz (Graudenz) conference that planned the uprising against them.[13] During the ensuing Thirteen Years' War, he actively supported the Prussian cities' war effort with substantial monetary subsidies (only part of which he later re-claimed), with political activity in Toru\u0144 and Danzig, and by personally fighting in battles at \u0141asin (Lessen) and Malbork (Marienburg).[13] He died in 1462.[13]/nLucas Watzenrode the Younger, the astronomer's maternal uncle and patron, was educated at the University of Krak\u00f3w (now Jagiellonian University) and at the universities of Cologne and Bologna. He was a bitter opponent of the Teutonic Order,[h] and its Grand Master once referred to him as \"the devil incarnate\".[i] In 1489 Watzenrode was elected Bishop of Warmia (Ermeland, Ermland) against the preference of King Casimir IV, who had hoped to install his own son in that seat.[24] As a result, Watzenrode quarreled with the king until Casimir IV's death three years later.[25] Watzenrode was then able to form close relations with three successive Polish monarchs: John I Albert, Alexander Jagiellon, and Sigismund I the Old. He was a friend and key advisor to each ruler, and his influence greatly strengthened the ties between Warmia and Poland proper.[26] Watzenrode came to be considered the most powerful man in Warmia, and his wealth, connections and influence allowed him to secure Copernicus's education and career as a canon at Frombork Cathedral.[24][j]/nCopernicus' father died around 1483, when the boy was 10. His maternal uncle, Lucas Watzenrode the Younger (1447\u20131512), took Copernicus under his wing and saw to his education and career.[13] Six years later, Watzenrode was elected Bishop of Warmia. Watzenrode maintained contacts with leading intellectual figures in Poland and was a friend of the influential Italian-born humanist and Krak\u00f3w courtier Filippo Buonaccorsi.[28] There are no surviving primary documents on the early years of Copernicus's childhood and education.[13] Copernicus biographers assume that Watzenrode first sent young Copernicus to St. John's School, at Toru\u0144, where he himself had been a master.[13] Later, according to Armitage,[k] the boy attended the Cathedral School at W\u0142oc\u0142awek, up the Vistula River from Toru\u0144, which prepared pupils for entrance to the University of Krak\u00f3w.[29]/nIn the winter semester of 1491\u201392 Copernicus, as \"Nicolaus Nicolai de Thuronia\", matriculated together with his brother Andrew at the University of Krak\u00f3w (now Jagiellonian University).[13] Copernicus began his studies in the Department of Arts (from the fall of 1491, presumably until the summer or fall of 1495) in the heyday of the Krak\u00f3w astronomical-mathematical school, acquiring the foundations for his subsequent mathematical achievements.[13] According to a later but credible tradition (Jan Bro\u017cek), Copernicus was a pupil of Albert Brudzewski, who by then (from 1491) was a professor of Aristotelian philosophy but taught astronomy privately outside the university; Copernicus became familiar with Brudzewski's widely read commentary to Georg von Peuerbach's Theoric\u00e6 nov\u00e6 planetarum and almost certainly attended the lectures of Bernard of Biskupie and Wojciech Krypa of Szamotu\u0142y, and probably other astronomical lectures by Jan of G\u0142og\u00f3w, Micha\u0142 of Wroc\u0142aw (Breslau), Wojciech of Pniewy, and Marcin Bylica of Olkusz.[30]/nCopernicus's Krak\u00f3w studies gave him a thorough grounding in the mathematical astronomy taught at the university (arithmetic, geometry, geometric optics, cosmography, theoretical and computational astronomy) and a good knowledge of the philosophical and natural-science writings of Aristotle (De coelo, Metaphysics) and Averroes, stimulating his interest in learning and making him conversant with humanistic culture.[24] Copernicus broadened the knowledge that he took from the university lecture halls with independent reading of books that he acquired during his Krak\u00f3w years (Euclid, Haly Abenragel, the Alfonsine Tables, Johannes Regiomontanus' Tabulae directionum); to this period, probably, also date his earliest scientific notes, now preserved partly at Uppsala University.[24] At Krak\u00f3w Copernicus began collecting a large library on astronomy; it would later be carried off as war booty by the Swedes during the Deluge in the 1650s and is now at the Uppsala University Library.[31]/nCopernicus's four years at Krak\u00f3w played an important role in the development of his critical faculties and initiated his analysis of logical contradictions in the two \"official\" systems of astronomy\u2014Aristotle's theory of homocentric spheres, and Ptolemy's mechanism of eccentrics and epicycles\u2014the surmounting and discarding of which would be the first step toward the creation of Copernicus's own doctrine of the structure of the universe.[24]/nWithout taking a degree, probably in the fall of 1495, Copernicus left Krak\u00f3w for the court of his uncle Watzenrode, who in 1489 had been elevated to Prince-Bishop of Warmia and soon (before November 1495) sought to place his nephew in the Warmia canonry vacated by 26 August 1495 death of its previous tenant, Jan Czanow. For unclear reasons\u2014probably due to opposition from part of the chapter, who appealed to Rome\u2014Copernicus's installation was delayed, inclining Watzenrode to send both his nephews to study canon law in Italy, seemingly with a view to furthering their ecclesiastic careers and thereby also strengthening his own influence in the Warmia chapter.[24]/nOn 20 October 1497, Copernicus, by proxy, formally succeeded to the Warmia canonry which had been granted to him two years earlier. To this, by a document dated 10 January 1503 at Padua, he would add a sinecure at the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew in Wroc\u0142aw (at the time in the Crown of Bohemia). Despite having been granted a papal indult on 29 November 1508 to receive further benefices, through his ecclesiastic career Copernicus not only did not acquire further prebends and higher stations (prelacies) at the chapter, but in 1538 he relinquished the Wroc\u0142aw sinecure. It is unclear whether he was ever ordained a priest.[32] Edward Rosen asserts that he was not.[33][34] Copernicus did take minor orders, which sufficed for assuming a chapter canonry.[24] The Catholic Encyclopedia proposes that his ordination was probable, as in 1537 he was one of four candidates for the episcopal seat of Warmia, a position that required ordination.[35]/nMeanwhile, leaving Warmia in mid-1496\u2014possibly with the retinue of the chapter's chancellor, Jerzy Pranghe, who was going to Italy\u2014in the fall, possibly in October, Copernicus arrived in Bologna and a few months later (after 6 January 1497) signed himself into the register of the Bologna University of Jurists' \"German nation\", which included young Poles from Silesia, Prussia and Pomerania as well as students of other nationalities.[24]/nDuring his three-year stay at Bologna, which occurred between fall 1496 and spring 1501, Copernicus seems to have devoted himself less keenly to studying canon law (he received his doctorate in canon law only after seven years, following a second return to Italy in 1503) than to studying the humanities\u2014probably attending lectures by Filippo Beroaldo, Antonio Urceo, called Codro, Giovanni Garzoni, and Alessandro Achillini\u2014and to studying astronomy. He met the famous astronomer Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara and became his disciple and assistant.[24] Copernicus was developing new ideas inspired by reading the \"Epitome of the Almagest\" (Epitome in Almagestum Ptolemei) by George von Peuerbach and Johannes Regiomontanus (Venice, 1496). He verified its observations about certain peculiarities in Ptolemy's theory of the Moon's motion, by conducting on 9 March 1497 at Bologna a memorable observation of the occultation of Aldebaran, the brightest star in the Taurus constellation, by the Moon. Copernicus the humanist sought confirmation for his growing doubts through close reading of Greek and Latin authors (Pythagoras, Aristarchos of Samos, Cleomedes, Cicero, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Philolaus, Heraclides, Ecphantos, Plato), gathering, especially while at Padua, fragmentary historic information about ancient astronomical, cosmological and calendar systems.[36]/nCopernicus spent the jubilee year 1500 in Rome, where he arrived with his brother Andrew that spring, doubtless to perform an apprenticeship at the Papal Curia. Here, too, however, he continued his astronomical work begun at Bologna, observing, for example, a lunar eclipse on the night of 5\u20136 November 1500. According to a later account by Rheticus, Copernicus also\u2014probably privately, rather than at the Roman Sapienza\u2014as a \"Professor Mathematum\" (professor of astronomy) delivered, \"to numerous... students and... leading masters of the science\", public lectures devoted probably to a critique of the mathematical solutions of contemporary astronomy.[37]/nOn his return journey doubtless stopping briefly at Bologna, in mid-1501 Copernicus arrived back in Warmia. After on 28 July receiving from the chapter a two-year extension of leave in order to study medicine (since \"he may in future be a useful medical advisor to our Reverend Superior [Bishop Lucas Watzenrode] and the gentlemen of the chapter\"), in late summer or in the fall he returned again to Italy, probably accompanied by his brother Andrew[m] and by Canon Bernhard Sculteti. This time he studied at the University of Padua, famous as a seat of medical learning, and\u2014except for a brief visit to Ferrara in May\u2013June 1503 to pass examinations for, and receive, his doctorate in canon law\u2014he remained at Padua from fall 1501 to summer 1503.[37]/nCopernicus studied medicine probably under the direction of leading Padua professors\u2014Bartolomeo da Montagnana, Girolamo Fracastoro, Gabriele Zerbi, Alessandro Benedetti\u2014and read medical treatises that he acquired at this time, by Valescus de Taranta, Jan Mesue, Hugo Senensis, Jan Ketham, Arnold de Villa Nova, and Michele Savonarola, which would form the embryo of his later medical library.[37]/nOne of the subjects that Copernicus must have studied was astrology, since it was considered an important part of a medical education.[39] However, unlike most other prominent Renaissance astronomers, he appears never to have practiced or expressed any interest in astrology.[40]/nAs at Bologna, Copernicus did not limit himself to his official studies. It was probably the Padua years that saw the beginning of his Hellenistic interests. He familiarized himself with Greek language and culture with the aid of Theodorus Gaza's grammar (1495) and Johannes Baptista Chrestonius's dictionary (1499), expanding his studies of antiquity, begun at Bologna, to the writings of Bessarion, Lorenzo Valla, and others. There also seems to be evidence that it was during his Padua stay that the idea finally crystallized, of basing a new system of the world on the movement of the Earth.[37]\nAs the time approached for Copernicus to return home, in spring 1503 he journeyed to Ferrara where, on 31 May 1503, having passed the obligatory examinations, he was granted the degree of Doctor of Canon Law (Nicolaus Copernich de Prusia, Jure Canonico ... et doctoratus[41]). No doubt it was soon after (at latest, in fall 1503) that he left Italy for good to return to Warmia.[37]/nCopernicus made three observations of Mercury, with errors of \u22123, \u221215 and \u22121 minutes of arc. He made one of Venus, with an error of \u221224 minutes. Four were made of Mars, with errors of 2, 20, 77, and 137 minutes. Four observations were made of Jupiter, with errors of 32, 51, \u221211 and 25 minutes. He made four of Saturn, with errors of 31, 20, 23 and \u22124 minutes.[42]/nWith Novara, Copernicus observed an occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon on 9 March 1497. Copernicus also observed a conjunction of Saturn and the Moon on 4 March 1500. He saw an eclipse of the Moon on 6 November 1500.[43][44]/nHaving completed all his studies in Italy, 30-year-old Copernicus returned to Warmia, where he would live out the remaining 40 years of his life, apart from brief journeys to Krak\u00f3w and to nearby Prussian cities: Toru\u0144 (Thorn), Gda\u0144sk (Danzig), Elbl\u0105g (Elbing), Grudzi\u0105dz (Graudenz), Malbork (Marienburg), K\u00f6nigsberg (Kr\u00f3lewiec).[37]/nThe Prince-Bishopric of Warmia enjoyed substantial autonomy, with its own diet (parliament) and monetary unit (the same as in the other parts of Royal Prussia) and treasury.[45]/nCopernicus was his uncle's secretary and physician from 1503 to 1510 (or perhaps till his uncle's death on 29 March 1512) and resided in the Bishop's castle at Lidzbark (Heilsberg), where he began work on his heliocentric theory. In his official capacity, he took part in nearly all his uncle's political, ecclesiastic and administrative-economic duties. From the beginning of 1504, Copernicus accompanied Watzenrode to sessions of the Royal Prussian diet held at Malbork and Elbl\u0105g and, write Dobrzycki and Hajdukiewicz, \"participated... in all the more important events in the complex diplomatic game that ambitious politician and statesman played in defense of the particular interests of Prussia and Warmia, between hostility to the [Teutonic] Order and loyalty to the Polish Crown.\"[37]/nIn 1504\u20131512 Copernicus made numerous journeys as part of his uncle's retinue\u2014in 1504, to Toru\u0144 and Gda\u0144sk, to a session of the Royal Prussian Council in the presence of Poland's King Alexander Jagiellon; to sessions of the Prussian diet at Malbork (1506), Elbl\u0105g (1507) and Sztum (Stuhm) (1512); and he may have attended a Pozna\u0144 (Posen) session (1510) and the coronation of Poland's King Sigismund I the Old in Krak\u00f3w (1507). Watzenrode's itinerary suggests that in spring 1509 Copernicus may have attended the Krak\u00f3w sejm.[37]/nIt was probably on the latter occasion, in Krak\u00f3w, that Copernicus submitted for printing at Jan Haller's press his translation, from Greek to Latin, of a collection, by the 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, of 85 brief poems called Epistles, or letters, supposed to have passed between various characters in a Greek story. They are of three kinds\u2014\"moral,\" offering advice on how people should live; \"pastoral\", giving little pictures of shepherd life; and \"amorous\", comprising love poems. They are arranged to follow one another in a regular rotation of subjects. Copernicus had translated the Greek verses into Latin prose, and he now published his version as Theophilacti scolastici Simocati epistolae morales, rurales et amatoriae interpretatione latina, which he dedicated to his uncle in gratitude for all the benefits he had received from him. With this translation, Copernicus declared himself on the side of the humanists in the struggle over the question of whether Greek literature should be revived.[46] Copernicus's first poetic work was a Greek epigram, composed probably during a visit to Krak\u00f3w, for Johannes Dantiscus' epithalamium for Barbara Zapolya's 1512 wedding to King Zygmunt I the Old.[47]/nSome time before 1514, Copernicus wrote an initial outline of his heliocentric theory known only from later transcripts, by the title (perhaps given to it by a copyist), Nicolai Copernici de hypothesibus motuum coelestium a se constitutis commentariolus\u2014commonly referred to as the Commentariolus. It was a succinct theoretical description of the world's heliocentric mechanism, without mathematical apparatus, and differed in some important details of geometric construction from De revolutionibus; but it was already based on the same assumptions regarding Earth's triple motions. The Commentariolus, which Copernicus consciously saw as merely a first sketch for his planned book, was not intended for printed distribution. He made only a very few manuscript copies available to his closest acquaintances, including, it seems, several Krak\u00f3w astronomers with whom he collaborated in 1515\u20131530 in observing eclipses. Tycho Brahe would include a fragment from the Commentariolus in his own treatise, Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata, published in Prague in 1602, based on a manuscript that he had received from the Bohemian physician and astronomer Tade\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek, a friend of Rheticus. The Commentariolus would appear complete in print for the first time only in 1878.[47]/nIn 1510 or 1512 Copernicus moved to Frombork, a town to the northwest at the Vistula Lagoon on the Baltic Sea coast. There, in April 1512, he participated in the election of Fabian of Lossainen as Prince-Bishop of Warmia. It was only in early June 1512 that the chapter gave Copernicus an \"external curia\"\u2014a house outside the defensive walls of the cathedral mount. In 1514 he purchased the northwestern tower within the walls of the Frombork stronghold. He would maintain both these residences to the end of his life, despite the devastation of the chapter's buildings by a raid against Frauenburg carried out by the Teutonic Order in January 1520, during which Copernicus's astronomical instruments were probably destroyed. Copernicus conducted astronomical observations in 1513\u20131516 presumably from his external curia; and in 1522\u20131543, from an unidentified \"small tower\" (turricula), using primitive instruments modeled on ancient ones\u2014the quadrant, triquetrum, armillary sphere. At Frombork Copernicus conducted over half of his more than 60 registered astronomical observations.[47]/nHaving settled permanently at Frombork, where he would reside to the end of his life, with interruptions in 1516\u20131519 and 1520\u201321, Copernicus found himself at the Warmia chapter's economic and administrative center, which was also one of Warmia's two chief centers of political life. In the difficult, politically complex situation of Warmia, threatened externally by the Teutonic Order's aggressions (attacks by Teutonic bands; the Polish-Teutonic War of 1519\u20131521; Albert's plans to annex Warmia), internally subject to strong separatist pressures (the selection of the prince-bishops of Warmia; currency reform), he, together with part of the chapter, represented a program of strict cooperation with the Polish Crown and demonstrated in all his public activities (the defense of his country against the Order's plans of conquest; proposals to unify its monetary system with the Polish Crown's; support for Poland's interests in the Warmia dominion's ecclesiastic administration) that he was consciously a citizen of the Polish-Lithuanian Republic. Soon after the death of uncle Bishop Watzenrode, he participated in the signing of the Second Treaty of Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski (7 December 1512), governing the appointment of the Bishop of Warmia, declaring, despite opposition from part of the chapter, for loyal cooperation with the Polish Crown.[47]/nThat same year (before 8 November 1512) Copernicus assumed responsibility, as magister pistoriae, for administering the chapter's economic enterprises (he would hold this office again in 1530), having already since 1511 fulfilled the duties of chancellor and visitor of the chapter's estates.[47]/nHis administrative and economic duties did not distract Copernicus, in 1512\u20131515, from intensive observational activity. The results of his observations of Mars and Saturn in this period, and especially a series of four observations of the Sun made in 1515, led to the discovery of the variability of Earth's eccentricity and of the movement of the solar apogee in relation to the fixed stars, which in 1515\u20131519 prompted his first revisions of certain assumptions of his system. Some of the observations that he made in this period may have had a connection with a proposed reform of the Julian calendar made in the first half of 1513 at the request of the Bishop of Fossombrone, Paul of Middelburg. Their contacts in this matter in the period of the Fifth Lateran Council were later memorialized in a complimentary mention in Copernicus's dedicatory epistle in D\u0113 revolutionibus orbium coelestium and in a treatise by Paul of Middelburg, Secundum compendium correctionis Calendarii (1516), which mentions Copernicus among the learned men who had sent the Council proposals for the calendar's emendation.[48]/nDuring 1516\u20131521, Copernicus resided at Olsztyn (Allenstein) Castle as economic administrator of Warmia, including Olsztyn (Allenstein) and Pieni\u0119\u017cno (Mehlsack). While there, he wrote a manuscript, Locationes mansorum desertorum (Locations of Deserted Fiefs), with a view to populating those fiefs with industrious farmers and so bolstering the economy of Warmia. When Olsztyn was besieged by the Teutonic Knights during the Polish\u2013Teutonic War, Copernicus directed the defense of Olsztyn and Warmia by Royal Polish forces. He also represented the Polish side in the ensuing peace negotiations.[49]/nCopernicus for years advised the Royal Prussian sejmik on monetary reform, particularly in the 1520s when that was a major question in regional Prussian politics.[51] In 1526 he wrote a study on the value of money, \"Monetae cudendae ratio\". In it he formulated an early iteration of the theory, now called Gresham's law, that \"bad\" (debased) coinage drives \"good\" (un-debased) coinage out of circulation\u2014several decades before Thomas Gresham. He also, in 1517, set down a quantity theory of money, a principal concept in economics to the present day. Copernicus's recommendations on monetary reform were widely read by leaders of both Prussia and Poland in their attempts to stabilize currency.[52]/nIn 1533, Johann Widmanstetter, secretary to Pope Clement VII, explained Copernicus's heliocentric system to the Pope and two cardinals. The Pope was so pleased that he gave Widmanstetter a valuable gift.[53] In 1535 Bernard Wapowski wrote a letter to a gentleman in Vienna, urging him to publish an enclosed almanac, which he claimed had been written by Copernicus. This is the only mention of a Copernicus almanac in the historical records. The \"almanac\" was likely Copernicus's tables of planetary positions. Wapowski's letter mentions Copernicus's theory about the motions of the Earth. Nothing came of Wapowski's request, because he died a couple of weeks later.[53]/nFollowing the death of Prince-Bishop of Warmia Mauritius Ferber (1 July 1537), Copernicus participated in the election of his successor, Johannes Dantiscus (20 September 1537). Copernicus was one of four candidates for the post, written in at the initiative of Tiedemann Giese; but his candidacy was actually pro forma, since Dantiscus had earlier been named coadjutor bishop to Ferber and since Dantiscus had the backing of Poland's King Sigismund I.[54] At first Copernicus maintained friendly relations with the new Prince-Bishop, assisting him medically in spring 1538 and accompanying him that summer on an inspection tour of Chapter holdings. But that autumn, their friendship was strained by suspicions over Copernicus's housekeeper, Anna Schilling, whom Dantiscus banished from Frombork in spring 1539.[54]/nIn his younger days, Copernicus the physician had treated his uncle, brother and other chapter members. In later years he was called upon to attend the elderly bishops who in turn occupied the see of Warmia\u2014Mauritius Ferber and Johannes Dantiscus\u2014and, in 1539, his old friend Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Che\u0142mno (Kulm). In treating such important patients, he sometimes sought consultations from other physicians, including the physician to Duke Albert and, by letter, the Polish Royal Physician.[55]/nIn the spring of 1541, Duke Albert\u2014former Grand Master of the Teutonic Order who had converted the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights into a Lutheran and hereditary realm, the Duchy of Prussia, upon doing homage to his uncle, the King of Poland, Sigismund I\u2014summoned Copernicus to K\u00f6nigsberg to attend the Duke's counselor, George von Kunheim, who had fallen seriously ill, and for whom the Prussian doctors seemed unable to do anything. Copernicus went willingly; he had met von Kunheim during negotiations over reform of the coinage. And Copernicus had come to feel that Albert himself was not such a bad person; the two had many intellectual interests in common. The Chapter readily gave Copernicus permission to go, as it wished to remain on good terms with the Duke, despite his Lutheran faith. In about a month the patient recovered, and Copernicus returned to Frombork. For a time, he continued to receive reports on von Kunheim's condition, and to send him medical advice by letter.[56]/nSome of Copernicus's close friends turned Protestant, but Copernicus never showed a tendency in that direction. The first attacks on him came from Protestants. Wilhelm Gnapheus, a Dutch refugee settled in Elbl\u0105g, wrote a comedy in Latin, Morosophus (The Foolish Sage), and staged it at the Latin school that he had established there. In the play, Copernicus was caricatured as the eponymous Morosophus, a haughty, cold, aloof man who dabbled in astrology, considered himself inspired by God, and was rumored to have written a large work that was moldering in a chest.[28]/nElsewhere Protestants were the first to react to news of Copernicus's theory. Melanchthon wrote:/nSome people believe that it is excellent and correct to work out a thing as absurd as did that Sarmatian [i.e., Polish] astronomer who moves the earth and stops the sun. Indeed, wise rulers should have curbed such light-mindedness.[28]/nNevertheless, in 1551, eight years after Copernicus's death, astronomer Erasmus Reinhold published, under the sponsorship of Copernicus's former military adversary, the Protestant Duke Albert, the Prussian Tables, a set of astronomical tables based on Copernicus's work. Astronomers and astrologers quickly adopted it in place of its predecessors.[57]/nSome time before 1514 Copernicus made available to friends his \"Commentariolus\" (\"Little Commentary\"), a manuscript describing his ideas about the heliocentric hypothesis.[o] It contained seven basic assumptions (detailed below).[58] Thereafter he continued gathering data for a more detailed work./nAt about 1532 Copernicus had basically completed his work on the manuscript of D\u0113 revolutionibus orbium coelestium; but despite urging by his closest friends, he resisted openly publishing his views, not wishing\u2014as he confessed\u2014to risk the scorn \"to which he would expose himself on account of the novelty and incomprehensibility of his theses.\"[54]/nIn 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered a series of lectures in Rome outlining Copernicus's theory. Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals heard the lectures and were interested in the theory. On 1 November 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Sch\u00f6nberg, Archbishop of Capua, wrote to Copernicus from Rome:/nSome years ago word reached me concerning your proficiency, of which everybody constantly spoke. At that time I began to have a very high regard for you... For I had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well but had also formulated a new cosmology. In it you maintain that the earth moves; that the sun occupies the lowest, and thus the central, place in the universe... Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, and at the earliest possible moment to send me your writings on the sphere of the universe together with the tables and whatever else you have that is relevant to this subject ...[59]/nBy then Copernicus's work was nearing its definitive form, and rumors about his theory had reached educated people all over Europe. Despite urgings from many quarters, Copernicus delayed publication of his book, perhaps from fear of criticism\u2014a fear delicately expressed in the subsequent dedication of his masterpiece to Pope Paul III. Scholars disagree on whether Copernicus's concern was limited to possible astronomical and philosophical objections, or whether he was also concerned about religious objections.[p]/nCopernicus was still working on De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (even if not certain that he wanted to publish it) when in 1539 Georg Joachim Rheticus, a Wittenberg mathematician, arrived in Frombork. Philipp Melanchthon, a close theological ally of Martin Luther, had arranged for Rheticus to visit several astronomers and study with them. Rheticus became Copernicus's pupil, staying with him for two years and writing a book, Narratio prima (First Account), outlining the essence of Copernicus's theory. In 1542 Rheticus published a treatise on trigonometry by Copernicus (later included as chapters 13 and 14 of Book I of De revolutionibus).[60]\nUnder strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen the favorable first general reception of his work, Copernicus finally agreed to give De revolutionibus to his close friend, Tiedemann Giese, bishop of Che\u0142mno (Kulm), to be delivered to Rheticus for printing by the German printer Johannes Petreius at Nuremberg (N\u00fcrnberg), Germany. While Rheticus initially supervised the printing, he had to leave Nuremberg before it was completed, and he handed over the task of supervising the rest of the printing to a Lutheran theologian, Andreas Osiander.[61]/nOsiander added an unauthorised and unsigned preface, defending Copernicus's work against those who might be offended by its novel hypotheses. He argued that \"different hypotheses are sometimes offered for one and the same motion [and therefore] the astronomer will take as his first choice that hypothesis which is the easiest to grasp.\" According to Osiander, \"these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. [I]f they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough.\"[62]/nToward the close of 1542, Copernicus was seized with apoplexy and paralysis, and he died at age 70 on 24 May 1543. Legend has it that he was presented with the final printed pages of his D\u0113 revolutionibus orbium coelestium on the very day that he died, allowing him to take farewell of his life's work.[q] He is reputed to have awoken from a stroke-induced coma, looked at his book, and then died peacefully.[r]/nCopernicus was reportedly buried in Frombork Cathedral, where a 1580 epitaph stood until being defaced; it was replaced in 1735. For over two centuries, archaeologists searched the cathedral in vain for Copernicus's remains. Efforts to locate them in 1802, 1909, 1939 had come to nought. In 2004 a team led by Jerzy G\u0105ssowski, head of an archaeology and anthropology institute in Pu\u0142tusk, began a new search, guided by the research of historian Jerzy Sikorski.[63][64] In August 2005, after scanning beneath the cathedral floor, they discovered what they believed to be Copernicus's remains.[65]/nThe discovery was announced only after further research, on 3 November 2008. G\u0105ssowski said he was \"almost 100 percent sure it is Copernicus\".[66] Forensic expert Capt. Dariusz Zajdel of the Polish Police Central Forensic Laboratory used the skull to reconstruct a face that closely resembled the features\u2014including a broken nose and a scar above the left eye\u2014on a Copernicus self-portrait.[66] The expert also determined that the skull belonged to a man who had died around age 70\u2014Copernicus's age at the time of his death.[65]/nThe grave was in poor condition, and not all the remains of the skeleton were found; missing, among other things, was the lower jaw.[67] The DNA from the bones found in the grave matched hair samples taken from a book owned by Copernicus which was kept at the library of the University of Uppsala in Sweden.[64][68]/nOn 22 May 2010, Copernicus was given a second funeral in a Mass led by J\u00f3zef Kowalczyk, the former papal nuncio to Poland and newly named Primate of Poland. Copernicus's remains were reburied in the same spot in Frombork Cathedral where part of his skull and other bones had been found. A black granite tombstone now identifies him as the founder of the heliocentric theory and also a church canon. The tombstone bears a representation of Copernicus's model of the Solar System\u2014a golden Sun encircled by six of the planets.[69]/nPhilolaus (c. 470 \u2013 c. 385 BCE) described an astronomical system in which a Central Fire (different from the Sun) occupied the centre of the universe, and a counter-Earth, the Earth, Moon, the Sun itself, planets, and stars all revolved around it, in that order outward from the centre.[70] Heraclides Ponticus (387\u2013312 BCE) proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis.[71]\nAristarchus of Samos (c. 310 BCE \u2013 c. 230 BCE) was the first to advance a theory that the Earth orbited the Sun.[72] Further mathematical details of Aristarchus's heliocentric system were worked out around 150 BCE by the Hellenistic astronomer Seleucus of Seleucia. Though Aristarchus's original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner (Archimedis Syracusani Arenarius & Dimensio Circuli) describes a work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model. Thomas Heath gives the following English translation of Archimedes's text:[73]/nYou are now aware ['you' being King Gelon] that the \"universe\" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth. This is the common account (\u03c4\u03ac \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1) as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the \"universe\" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface./nIn an early unpublished manuscript of De Revolutionibus (which still survives), Copernicus mentioned the (non-heliocentric) 'moving Earth' theory of Philolaus and the possibility that Aristarchus also had a 'moving Earth' theory (though it is unlikely that he was aware that it was a heliocentric theory). He removed both references from his final published manuscript.[c][e]/nCopernicus was probably aware that Pythagoras's system involved a moving Earth. The Pythagorean system was mentioned by Aristotle.[75]/nCopernicus owned a copy of Giorgio Valla's De expetendis et fugiendis rebus, which included a translation of Plutarch's reference to Aristarchus's heliostaticism.[76]/nIn Copernicus's dedication of On the Revolutions to Pope Paul III\u2014which Copernicus hoped would dampen criticism of his heliocentric theory by \"babblers... completely ignorant of [astronomy]\"\u2014the book's author wrote that, in rereading all of philosophy, in the pages of Cicero and Plutarch he had found references to those few thinkers who dared to move the Earth \"against the traditional opinion of astronomers and almost against common sense.\"/nThe prevailing theory during Copernicus's lifetime was the one that Ptolemy published in his Almagest c.\u2009150 CE; the Earth was the stationary center of the universe. Stars were embedded in a large outer sphere that rotated rapidly, approximately daily, while each of the planets, the Sun, and the Moon were embedded in their own, smaller spheres. Ptolemy's system employed devices, including epicycles, deferents and equants, to account for observations that the paths of these bodies differed from simple, circular orbits centered on the Earth.[77]/nBeginning in the 10th century, a tradition criticizing Ptolemy developed within Islamic astronomy, which climaxed with Ibn al-Haytham of Basra's Al-Shuk\u016bk 'al\u0101 Ba\u1e6dalamiy\u016bs (\"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\").[78] Several Islamic astronomers questioned the Earth's apparent immobility,[79][80] and centrality within the universe.[81] Some accepted that the earth rotates around its axis, such as Abu Sa'id al-Sijzi (d. c.\u20091020).[82][83] According to al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries \"that the motion we see is due to the Earth's movement and not to that of the sky.\"[83][84] That others besides al-Sijzi held this view is further confirmed by a reference from an Arabic work in the 13th century which states:/nAccording to the geometers [or engineers] (muhandis\u012bn), the earth is in constant circular motion, and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars.[83]/nIn the 12th century, Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji proposed a complete alternative to the Ptolemaic system (although not heliocentric).[85][86] He declared the Ptolemaic system as an imaginary model, successful at predicting planetary positions, but not real or physical.[85][86] Al-Bitruji's alternative system spread through most of Europe during the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued up to the 16th century.[86]/nMathematical techniques developed in the 13th to 14th centuries by Mo'ayyeduddin al-Urdi, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and Ibn al-Shatir for geocentric models of planetary motions closely resemble some of those used later by Copernicus in his heliocentric models.[87] Copernicus used what is now known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources.[88] Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus.[89] Ibn al-Shatir's lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus.[90] This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of those earlier astronomers.[91] However, no likely candidate for this conjectured work has yet come to light, and other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition.[92] Nevertheless, Copernicus cited some of the Islamic astronomers whose theories and observations he used in De Revolutionibus, namely al-Battani, Thabit ibn Qurra, al-Zarqali, Averroes, and al-Bitruji.[93] It has been suggested[94][95] that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science; Gregory Chioniades translated some of al-Tusi's works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi-couple are still extant in Italy.[96]/nCopernicus's major work on his heliocentric theory was D\u0113 revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published in the year of his death, 1543. He had formulated his theory by 1510. \"He wrote out a short overview of his new heavenly arrangement [known as the Commentariolus, or Brief Sketch], also probably in 1510 [but no later than May 1514], and sent it off to at least one correspondent beyond Varmia [the Latin for \"Warmia\"]. That person in turn copied the document for further circulation, and presumably the new recipients did, too...\"[98]/nCopernicus's Commentariolus summarized his heliocentric theory. It listed the \"assumptions\" upon which the theory was based, as follows:[99]/nDe revolutionibus itself was divided into six sections or parts, called \"books\":[102]/nGeorg Joachim Rheticus could have been Copernicus's successor, but did not rise to the occasion.[53] Erasmus Reinhold could have been his successor, but died prematurely.[53] The first of the great successors was Tycho Brahe[53] (though he did not think the Earth orbited the Sun), followed by Johannes Kepler,[53] who had collaborated with Tycho in Prague and benefited from Tycho's decades' worth of detailed observational data.[103]/nDespite the near universal acceptance later of the heliocentric idea (though not the epicycles or the circular orbits), Copernicus's theory was originally slow to catch on. Scholars hold that sixty years after the publication of The Revolutions there were only around 15 astronomers espousing Copernicanism in all of Europe: \"Thomas Digges and Thomas Harriot in England; Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei in Italy; Diego Zuniga in Spain; Simon Stevin in the Low Countries; and in Germany, the largest group\u2014Georg Joachim Rheticus, Michael Maestlin, Christoph Rothmann (who may have later recanted),[104] and Johannes Kepler.\"[104] Additional possibilities are Englishman William Gilbert, along with Achilles Gasser, Georg Vogelin, Valentin Otto, and Tiedemann Giese.[104]/nArthur Koestler, in his popular book The Sleepwalkers, asserted that Copernicus's book had not been widely read on its first publication.[105] This claim was trenchantly criticised by Edward Rosen,[s] and has been decisively disproved by Owen Gingerich, who examined nearly every surviving copy of the first two editions and found copious marginal notes by their owners throughout many of them. Gingerich published his conclusions in 2004 in The Book Nobody Read.[106]/nThe intellectual climate of the time \"remained dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and the corresponding Ptolemaic astronomy. At that time there was no reason to accept the Copernican theory, except for its mathematical simplicity [by avoiding using the equant in determining planetary positions].\"[107] Tycho Brahe's system (\"that the earth is stationary, the sun revolves about the earth, and the other planets revolve about the sun\")[107] also directly competed with Copernicus's. It was only a half-century later with the work of Kepler and Galileo that any substantial evidence defending Copernicanism appeared, starting \"from the time when Galileo formulated the principle of inertia...[which] helped to explain why everything would not fall off the earth if it were in motion.\"[107] \"[Not until] after Isaac Newton formulated the universal law of gravitation and the laws of mechanics [in his 1687 Principia], which unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, was the heliocentric view generally accepted.\"[107]/nThe immediate result of the 1543 publication of Copernicus's book was only mild controversy. At the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563) neither Copernicus's theory nor calendar reform (which would later use tables deduced from Copernicus's calculations) were discussed.[108] It has been much debated why it was not until six decades after the publication of De revolutionibus that the Catholic Church took any official action against it, even the efforts of Tolosani going unheeded. Catholic side opposition only commenced seventy-three years later, when it was occasioned by Galileo.[109]/nThe first notable to move against Copernicanism was the Magister of the Holy Palace (i.e., the Catholic Church's chief censor), Dominican Bartolomeo Spina, who \"expressed a desire to stamp out the Copernican doctrine\".[110] But with Spina's death in 1546, his cause fell to his friend, the well-known theologian-astronomer, the Dominican Giovanni Maria Tolosani of the Convent of St. Mark in Florence. Tolosani had written a treatise on reforming the calendar (in which astronomy would play a large role) and had attended the Fifth Lateran Council (1512\u20131517) to discuss the matter. He had obtained a copy of De Revolutionibus in 1544. His denunciation of Copernicanism was written a year later, in 1545, in an appendix to his unpublished work, On the Truth of Sacred Scripture.[111]/nEmulating the rationalistic style of Thomas Aquinas, Tolosani sought to refute Copernicanism by philosophical argument. Copernicanism was absurd, according to Tolosani, because it was scientifically unproven and unfounded. First, Copernicus had assumed the motion of the Earth but offered no physical theory whereby one would deduce this motion. (No one realized that the investigation into Copernicanism would result in a rethinking of the entire field of physics.) Second, Tolosani charged that Copernicus's thought process was backwards. He held that Copernicus had come up with his idea and then sought phenomena that would support it, rather than observing phenomena and deducing from them the idea of what caused them. In this, Tolosani was linking Copernicus's mathematical equations with the practices of the Pythagoreans (whom Aristotle had made arguments against, which were later picked up by Thomas Aquinas). It was argued that mathematical numbers were a mere product of the intellect without any physical reality, and as such could not provide physical causes in the investigation of nature.[112]/nSome astronomical hypotheses at the time (such as epicycles and eccentrics) were seen as mere mathematical devices to adjust calculations of where the heavenly bodies would appear, rather than an explanation of the cause of those motions. (As Copernicus still maintained the idea of perfectly spherical orbits, he relied on epicycles.) This \"saving the phenomena\" was seen as proof that astronomy and mathematics could not be taken as serious means to determine physical causes. Tolosani invoked this view in his final critique of Copernicus, saying that his biggest error was that he had started with \"inferior\" fields of science to make pronouncements about \"superior\" fields. Copernicus had used mathematics and astronomy to postulate about physics and cosmology, rather than beginning with the accepted principles of physics and cosmology to determine things about astronomy and mathematics. Thus Copernicus seemed to be undermining the whole system of the philosophy of science at the time. Tolosani held that Copernicus had fallen into philosophical error because he had not been versed in physics and logic; anyone without such knowledge would make a poor astronomer and be unable to distinguish truth from falsehood. Because Copernicanism had not met the criteria for scientific truth set out by Thomas Aquinas, Tolosani held that it could only be viewed as a wild unproven theory.[113][114]/nTolosani recognized that the Ad Lectorem preface to Copernicus's book was not actually by him. Its thesis that astronomy as a whole would never be able to make truth claims was rejected by Tolosani (though he still held that Copernicus's attempt to describe physical reality had been faulty); he found it ridiculous that Ad Lectorem had been included in the book (unaware that Copernicus had not authorized its inclusion). Tolosani wrote: \"By means of these words [of the Ad Lectorem], the foolishness of this book's author is rebuked. For by a foolish effort he [Copernicus] tried to revive the weak Pythagorean opinion [that the element of fire was at the center of the Universe], long ago deservedly destroyed, since it is expressly contrary to human reason and also opposes holy writ. From this situation, there could easily arise disagreements between Catholic expositors of holy scripture and those who might wish to adhere obstinately to this false opinion.\"[115] Tolosani declared: \"Nicolaus Copernicus neither read nor understood the arguments of Aristotle the philosopher and Ptolemy the astronomer.\"[111] Tolosani wrote that Copernicus \"is expert indeed in the sciences of mathematics and astronomy, but he is very deficient in the sciences of physics and logic. Moreover, it appears that he is unskilled with regard to [the interpretation of] holy scripture, since he contradicts several of its principles, not without danger of infidelity to himself and the readers of his book. ...his arguments have no force and can very easily be taken apart. For it is stupid to contradict an opinion accepted by everyone over a very long time for the strongest reasons, unless the impugner uses more powerful and insoluble demonstrations and completely dissolves the opposed reasons. But he does not do this in the least.\"[115]/nTolosani declared that he had written against Copernicus \"for the purpose of preserving the truth to the common advantage of the Holy Church.\"[116] Despite this, his work remained unpublished and there is no evidence that it received serious consideration. Robert Westman describes it as becoming a \"dormant\" viewpoint with \"no audience in the Catholic world\" of the late sixteenth century, but also notes that there is some evidence that it did become known to Tommaso Caccini, who would criticize Galileo in a sermon in December 1613.[116]/nTolosani may have criticized the Copernican theory as scientifically unproven and unfounded, but the theory also conflicted with the theology of the time, as can be seen in a sample of the works of John Calvin. In his Commentary on Genesis he said that \"We indeed are not ignorant that the circuit of the heavens is finite, and that the earth, like a little globe, is placed in the centre.\"[117] In his commentary on Psalms 93:1 he states that \"The heavens revolve daily, and, immense as is their fabric and inconceivable the rapidity of their revolutions, we experience no concussion.... How could the earth hang suspended in the air were it not upheld by God's hand? By what means could it maintain itself unmoved, while the heavens above are in constant rapid motion, did not its Divine Maker fix and establish it.\"[118] One sharp point of conflict between Copernicus's theory and the Bible concerned the story of the Battle of Gibeon in the Book of Joshua where the Hebrew forces were winning but whose opponents were likely to escape once night fell. This is averted by Joshua's prayers causing the Sun and the Moon to stand still. Martin Luther once made a remark about Copernicus, although without mentioning his name. According to Anthony Lauterbach, while eating with Martin Luther the topic of Copernicus arose during dinner on 4 June 1539 (in the same year as professor George Joachim Rheticus of the local University had been granted leave to visit him). Luther is said to have remarked \"So it goes now. Whoever wants to be clever must agree with nothing others esteem. He must do something of his own. This is what that fellow does who wishes to turn the whole of astronomy upside down. Even in these things that are thrown into disorder I believe the Holy Scriptures, for Joshua commanded the sun to stand still and not the earth.\"[107] These remarks were made four years before the publication of On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres and a year before Rheticus's Narratio Prima. In John Aurifaber's account of the conversation Luther calls Copernicus \"that fool\" rather than \"that fellow\", this version is viewed by historians as less reliably sourced.[107]/nLuther's collaborator Philipp Melanchthon also took issue with Copernicanism. After receiving the first pages of Narratio Prima from Rheticus himself, Melanchthon wrote to Mithobius (physician and mathematician Burkard Mithob of Feldkirch) on 16 October 1541 condemning the theory and calling for it to be repressed by governmental force, writing \"certain people believe it is a marvelous achievement to extol so crazy a thing, like that Polish astronomer who makes the earth move and the sun stand still. Really, wise governments ought to repress impudence of mind.\"[119] It had appeared to Rheticus that Melanchton would understand the theory and would be open to it. This was because Melanchton had taught Ptolemaic astronomy and had even recommended his friend Rheticus to an appointment to the Deanship of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences at the University of Wittenberg after he had returned from studying with Copernicus.[120]/nRheticus's hopes were dashed when six years after the publication of De Revolutionibus Melanchthon published his Initia Doctrinae Physicae presenting three grounds to reject Copernicanism. These were \"the evidence of the senses, the thousand-year consensus of men of science, and the authority of the Bible\".[121] Blasting the new theory Melanchthon wrote, \"Out of love for novelty or in order to make a show of their cleverness, some people have argued that the earth moves. They maintain that neither the eighth sphere nor the sun moves, whereas they attribute motion to the other celestial spheres, and also place the earth among the heavenly bodies. Nor were these jokes invented recently. There is still extant Archimedes's book on The Sand Reckoner; in which he reports that Aristarchus of Samos propounded the paradox that the sun stands still and the earth revolves around the sun. Even though subtle experts institute many investigations for the sake of exercising their ingenuity, nevertheless public proclamation of absurd opinions is indecent and sets a harmful example.\"[119] Melanchthon went on to cite Bible passages and then declare \"Encouraged by this divine evidence, let us cherish the truth and let us not permit ourselves to be alienated from it by the tricks of those who deem it an intellectual honor to introduce confusion into the arts.\"[119] In the first edition of Initia Doctrinae Physicae, Melanchthon even questioned Copernicus's character claiming his motivation was \"either from love of novelty or from desire to appear clever\", these more personal attacks were largely removed by the second edition in 1550.[121]/nAnother Protestant theologian who disparaged heliocentrism on scriptural grounds was John Owen. In a passing remark in an essay on the origin of the sabbath, he characterised \"the late hypothesis, fixing the sun as in the centre of the world\" as being \"built on fallible phenomena, and advanced by many arbitrary presumptions against evident testimonies of Scripture.\"[122]/nIn Roman Catholic circles, Copernicus's book was incorporated into scholarly curricula throughout the 16th century. For example, at the University of Salamanca in 1561 it became one of four text books that students of astronomy could choose from, and in 1594 it was made mandatory.[123] German Jesuit Nicolaus Serarius was one of the first Catholics to write against Copernicus's theory as heretical, citing the Joshua passage, in a work published in 1609\u20131610, and again in a book in 1612.[124] In his 12 April 1615 letter to a Catholic defender of Copernicus, Paolo Antonio Foscarini, Catholic Cardinal Robert Bellarmine condemned Copernican theory, writing \"...not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world...Nor can one answer that this is not a matter of faith, since if it is not a matter of faith 'as regards the topic,' it is a matter of faith 'as regards the speaker': and so it would be heretical to say that Abraham did not have two children and Jacob twelve, as well as to say that Christ was not born of a virgin, because both are said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of prophets and apostles.\"[125] One year later, the Roman Inquisition prohibited Copernicus's work. Nevertheless, the Spanish Inquisition never banned the De revolutionibus, which continued to be taught at Salamanca.[123]/nPerhaps the most influential opponent of the Copernican theory was Francesco Ingoli, a Catholic priest. Ingoli wrote a January 1616 essay to Galileo presenting more than twenty arguments against the Copernican theory.[126] Though \"it is not certain, it is probable that he [Ingoli] was commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy\",[127] (after the Congregation of the Index's decree against Copernicanism on 5 March 1616, Ingoli was officially appointed its consultant).[127] Galileo himself was of the opinion that the essay played an important role in the rejection of the theory by church authorities, writing in a later letter to Ingoli that he was concerned that people thought the theory was rejected because Ingoli was right.[126] Ingoli presented five physical arguments against the theory, thirteen mathematical arguments (plus a separate discussion of the sizes of stars), and four theological arguments. The physical and mathematical arguments were of uneven quality, but many of them came directly from the writings of Tycho Brahe, and Ingoli repeatedly cited Brahe, the leading astronomer of the era. These included arguments about the effect of a moving Earth on the trajectory of projectiles, and about parallax and Brahe's argument that the Copernican theory required that stars be absurdly large.[128]/nTwo of Ingoli's theological issues with the Copernican theory were \"common Catholic beliefs not directly traceable to Scripture: the doctrine that hell is located at the center of Earth and is most distant from heaven; and the explicit assertion that Earth is motionless in a hymn sung on Tuesdays as part of the Liturgy of the Hours of the Divine Office prayers regularly recited by priests.\"[129] Ingoli cited Robert Bellarmine in regards to both of these arguments, and may have been trying to convey to Galileo a sense of Bellarmine's opinion.[130] Ingoli also cited Genesis 1:14 where God places \"lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night.\" Ingoli did not think the central location of the Sun in the Copernican theory was compatible with it being described as one of the lights placed in the firmament.[129] Like previous commentators Ingoli also pointed to the passages about the Battle of Gibeon. He dismissed arguments that they should be taken metaphorically, saying \"Replies which assert that Scripture speaks according to our mode of understanding are not satisfactory: both because in explaining the Sacred Writings the rule is always to preserve the literal sense, when it is possible, as it is in this case; and also because all the [Church] Fathers unanimously take this passage to mean that the Sun which was truly moving stopped at Joshua's request. An interpretation that is contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers is condemned by the Council of Trent, Session IV, in the decree on the edition and use of the Sacred Books. Furthermore, although the Council speaks about matters of faith and morals, nevertheless it cannot be denied that the Holy Fathers would be displeased with an interpretation of Sacred Scriptures which is contrary to their common agreement.\"[129] However, Ingoli closed the essay by suggesting Galileo respond primarily to the better of his physical and mathematical arguments rather than to his theological arguments, writing \"Let it be your choice to respond to this either entirely of in part\u2014clearly at least to the mathematical and physical arguments, and not to all even of these, but to the more weighty ones.\"[131] When Galileo wrote a letter in reply to Ingoli years later, he in fact only addressed the mathematical and physical arguments.[131]/nIn March 1616, in connection with the Galileo affair, the Roman Catholic Church's Congregation of the Index issued a decree suspending De revolutionibus until it could be \"corrected,\" on the grounds of ensuring that Copernicanism, which it described as a \"false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture,\" would not \"creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth.\"[132] The corrections consisted largely of removing or altering wording that spoke of heliocentrism as a fact, rather than a hypothesis.[133] The corrections were made based largely on work by Ingoli.[127]/nOn the orders of Pope Paul V, Cardinal Robert Bellarmine gave Galileo prior notice that the decree was about to be issued, and warned him that he could not \"hold or defend\" the Copernican doctrine.[u] The corrections to De revolutionibus, which omitted or altered nine sentences, were issued four years later, in 1620.[134]/nIn 1633, Galileo Galilei was convicted of grave suspicion of heresy for \"following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture\",[135] and was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life.[136][137]/nAt the instance of Roger Boscovich, the Catholic Church's 1758 Index of Prohibited Books omitted the general prohibition of works defending heliocentrism,[138] but retained the specific prohibitions of the original uncensored versions of De revolutionibus and Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. Those prohibitions were finally dropped from the 1835 Index.[139]/nCopernicus is postulated to have spoken Latin, German, and Polish with equal fluency; he also spoke Greek and Italian, and had some knowledge of Hebrew.[v][w][x][y] The vast majority of Copernicus's extant writings are in Latin, the language of European academia in his lifetime./nArguments for German being Copernicus's native tongue are that he was born into a predominantly German-speaking urban patrician class using German, next to Latin, as language of trade and commerce in written documents,[147] and that, while studying canon law at the University of Bologna in 1496, he signed into the German natio (Natio Germanorum)\u2014a student organization which, according to its 1497 by-laws, was open to students of all kingdoms and states whose mother-tongue was German.[148] However, according to French philosopher Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, Copernicus's registration with the Natio Germanorum does not in itself imply that Copernicus considered himself German, since students from Prussia and Silesia were routinely so categorized, which carried certain privileges that made it a natural choice for German-speaking students, regardless of their ethnicity or self-identification.[148][z][aa][151]/nThe surname Kopernik, Copernik, Koppernigk, in various spellings, is recorded in Krak\u00f3w from c. 1350, apparently given to people from the village of Koperniki (prior to 1845 rendered Kopernik, Copernik, Copirnik, and Koppirnik) in the Duchy of Nysa, 10\u00a0km south of Nysa, and now 10\u00a0km north of the Polish-Czech border. Nicolaus Copernicus's great-grandfather is recorded as having received citizenship in Krak\u00f3w in 1386. The toponym Kopernik (modern Koperniki) has been variously tied to the Polish word for \"dill\" (koper) and the German word for \"copper\" (Kupfer).[ab] The suffix -nik (or plural, -niki) denotes a Slavic and Polish agent noun./nAs was common in the period, the spellings of both the toponym and the surname vary greatly. Copernicus \"was rather indifferent about orthography\".[152] During his childhood, about 1480, the name of his father (and thus of the future astronomer) was recorded in Thorn as Niclas Koppernigk.[153]\nAt Krak\u00f3w he signed himself, in Latin, Nicolaus Nicolai de Torunia (Nicolaus, son of Nicolaus, of Toru\u0144).[ac] At Bologna, in 1496, he registered in the Matricula Nobilissimi Germanorum Collegii, resp. Annales Clarissimae Nacionis Germanorum, of the Natio Germanica Bononiae, as Dominus Nicolaus Kopperlingk de Thorn \u2013 IX grosseti.[155][156] At Padua he signed himself \"Nicolaus Copernik\", later \"Coppernicus\".[152] The astronomer thus Latinized his name to Coppernicus, generally with two \"p\"s (in 23 of 31 documents studied),[157] but later in life he used a single \"p\". On the title page of De revolutionibus, Rheticus published the name (in the genitive, or possessive, case) as \"Nicolai Copernici\"./nThere has been discussion of Copernicus's nationality and of whether it is meaningful to ascribe to him a nationality in the modern sense./nNicolaus Copernicus was born and raised in Royal Prussia, a semiautonomous and multilingual region of the Kingdom of Poland.[158][159] He was the child of German-speaking parents and grew up with German as his mother tongue.[12][160][161] His first alma mater was the University of Krak\u00f3w in Poland. When he later studied in Italy, at the University of Bologna, he joined the German Nation, a student organization for German-speakers of all allegiances (Germany would not become a nation-state until 1871).[162][163] His family stood against the Teutonic Order and actively supported the city of Toru\u0144 during the Thirteen Years' War. Copernicus's father lent money to Poland's King Casimir IV Jagiellon to finance the war against the Teutonic Knights,[164] but the inhabitants of Royal Prussia also resisted the Polish crown's efforts for greater control over the region.[158]/nEncyclopedia Americana,[165] The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia,[166] The Oxford World Encyclopedia,[167] and World Book Encyclopedia[168] refer to Copernicus as a \"Polish astronomer\". Sheila Rabin, writing in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, describes Copernicus as a \"child of a German family [who] was a subject of the Polish crown\",[11] while Manfred Weissenbacher writes that Copernicus's father was a Germanized Pole.[169]/nNo Polish texts by Copernicus survive due to the rarity of Polish language in literature before the writings of the Polish Renaissance poets Miko\u0142aj Rej and Jan Kochanowski (educated Poles had generally written in Latin); but it is known that Copernicus knew Polish on a par with German and Latin.[170]/nHistorian Michael Burleigh describes the nationality debate as a \"totally insignificant battle\" between German and Polish scholars during the interwar period.[171] Polish astronomer Konrad Rudnicki calls the discussion a \"fierce scholarly quarrel in ... times of nationalism\" and describes Copernicus as an inhabitant of a German-speaking territory that belonged to Poland, himself being of mixed Polish-German extraction.[172]/nCzes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz describes the debate as an \"absurd\" projection of a modern understanding of nationality onto Renaissance people, who identified with their home territories rather than with a nation.[173] Similarly, historian Norman Davies writes that Copernicus, as was common in his era, was \"largely indifferent\" to nationality, being a local patriot who considered himself \"Prussian\".[174] Mi\u0142osz and Davies both write that Copernicus had a German-language cultural background, while his working language was Latin in accord with the usage of the time.[173][174] Additionally, according to Davies, \"there is ample evidence that he knew the Polish language\".[174] Davies concludes that, \"Taking everything into consideration, there is good reason to regard him both as a German and as a Pole: and yet, in the sense that modern nationalists understand it, he was neither.\"[174]/nThe third in NASA's Orbiting Astronomical Observatory series of missions, launched on 21 August 1972, was named Copernicus after its successful launch.

In the 1971\u20131972 academic year, he lectured on software engineering at French universities./nAfter graduating from Harvard, Warshall worked at ORO (Operation Research Office), a program set up by Johns Hopkins to do research and development for the United States Army. In 1958, he left ORO to take a position at a company called Technical Operations, where he helped build a research and development laboratory for military software projects. In 1961, he left Technical Operations to found Massachusetts Computer Associates. Later, this company became part of Applied Data Research (ADR). After the merger, Warshall sat on the board of directors of ADR and managed a variety of projects and organizations. He retired from ADR in 1982 and taught a weekly class in Biblical Hebrew at Temple Ahavat Achim in Gloucester, Massachusetts./nThere is an interesting anecdote about his proof that the transitive closure algorithm, now known as Warshall's algorithm, is correct. He and a colleague at Technical Operations bet a bottle of rum on who first could determine whether this algorithm always works. Warshall came up with his proof overnight, winning the bet and the rum, which he shared with the loser of the bet. Because Warshall did not like sitting at a desk, he did much of his creative work in unconventional places such as on a sailboat in the Indian Ocean or in a Greek lemon orchard.", "27750422": "Harry Lewis Nelson (born January 8, 1932) is an American mathematician and computer programmer. He was a member of the team that won the World Computer Chess Championship in 1983[1] and 1986,[2] and was a co-discoverer of the 27th Mersenne prime in 1979[3] (at the time, the largest known prime number). He also served as editor of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics for five years. Most of his professional career was spent at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he worked with some of the earliest supercomputers. He was particularly noted as one of the world's foremost experts in writing optimized assembly language routines for the Cray-1 and Cray X-MP computers. Nelson has had a lifelong interest in puzzles of all types, and since his retirement in 1991 he has devoted his time to his own MiniMax Game Company, a small venture that helps puzzle inventors to develop and market their products./nIn 1994, Nelson donated his correspondence from his days as editor of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics to the University of Calgary Library as part of the Eug\u00e8ne Strens Recreational Mathematics Special Collection.[4]/nNelson was born on January 8, 1932, in Topeka, Kansas, the third of four children. He attended local schools and was active in the Boy Scouts, earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Nelson attended Harvard University as a freshman, but then had to drop out for financial reasons. He attended the University of Kansas as a sophomore, but was able to return to Harvard for his junior and senior years, receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1953. In 1952, just before the start of his senior year, he married his high school sweetheart, Claire (n\u00e9e Rachael Claire Ensign). After graduating, he was inducted into the U.S. Army, but was never deployed overseas. He was honorably discharged in 1955, having attained the rank of sergeant. He enrolled in graduate studies at the University of Kansas, earning a master's degree in mathematics in 1957. It was during this period that he became fascinated by the then-new programmable digital computer. Nelson worked towards a Ph.D. until 1959, but the combination of his GI Bill educational benefits running out, needing to support a wife and three children, and the mathematics department rejecting his proposal to do his thesis on computers convinced him to leave the university without completing his Ph.D., and to get a job.[5]/nInitially, Nelson worked for Autonetics, an aerospace company in southern California. In 1960 he went to work for the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (later renamed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory or LLNL), in Livermore, California. He remained working there until his retirement in 1991. Nelson worked on a variety of computers at LLNL, beginning with the IBM 7030 (nicknamed Stretch). In the 1960s, early units of a new computer were typically delivered as \"bare metal,\" i.e. no software of any kind, including no compiler and no operating system. Programs needed to be written in assembly language, and the programmer needed to have intimate and detailed knowledge of the machine. A lifelong puzzle enthusiast, Nelson sought to understand every detail of the hardware, and earned a reputation as an expert on the features and idiosyncrasies of each new machine. Over time he became the principal person at LLNL in charge of doing acceptance testing of new hardware.[6]/nDuring the process of acceptance testing, a new supercomputer would typically run diagnostic programs at night, looking for problems. During the acceptance testing of LLNL's first Cray-1 computer, Nelson teamed up with Cray employee David Slowinski to devise a program that would hunt for the next Mersenne prime, while simultaneously being a legitimate diagnostic program. On April 8, 1979, the team found the 27th Mersenne prime: 244497 - 1, the largest prime number known at that time.[7][8]/nIn 1980, Nelson came across a copy of the chess program Cray Blitz written by Robert Hyatt. Using his detailed knowledge of the Cray-1 architecture, Nelson re-wrote a key routine in assembly language and was able to significantly speed up the program. The two began collaborating along with a third team member, Albert Gower, a strong correspondence chess player. In 1983, Cray Blitz won the World Computer Chess Championship, and successfully defended its title in 1986.[9]/nThe 1986 Championship was marred by controversy when the HiTech team, led by Hans Berliner, accused the Cray Blitz team of cheating. The charge was investigated for a few months by the tournament director, David Levy, and dismissed.[10]  Despite the dismissal, the experience somewhat soured the computer chess scene for Nelson, although he remained active until the ACM discontinued the annual computer chess tournaments in 1994./nHe is active with the International Puzzle Party, and is a longtime contributor to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics.

His younger brother was zoologist Paolo Enriques who was also the father of Enzo Enriques Agnoletti and Anna Maria Enriques Agnoletti. He became a student of Guido Castelnuovo (who later became his brother-in-law after marrying his sister Elbina), and became an important member of the Italian school of algebraic geometry. He also worked on differential geometry. He collaborated with Castelnuovo, Corrado Segre and Francesco Severi. He had positions at the University of Bologna, and then the University of Rome La Sapienza. In 1931 he sworn allegiance to fascism, and in 1933 he became a member of the PNF. Despite this, he lost his position in 1938, when the Fascist government enacted the \"leggi razziali\" (racial laws), which in particular banned Jews from holding professorships in Universities./nThe Enriques classification, of complex algebraic surfaces up to birational equivalence, was into five main classes, and was background to further work until Kunihiko Kodaira reconsidered the matter in the 1950s.  The largest class, in some sense, was that of surfaces of general type: those for which the consideration of differential forms provides linear systems that are large enough to make all the geometry visible. The work of the Italian school had provided enough insight to recognise the other main birational classes. Rational surfaces and more generally ruled surfaces (these include quadrics and cubic surfaces in projective 3-space) have the simplest geometry. Quartic surfaces in 3-spaces are now classified (when non-singular) as cases of K3 surfaces; the classical approach was to look at the Kummer surfaces, which are singular at 16 points.  Abelian surfaces give rise to Kummer surfaces as quotients. There remains the class of elliptic surfaces, which are fiber bundles over a curve with elliptic curves as fiber, having a finite number of modifications (so there is a bundle that is locally trivial actually over a curve less some points). The question of classification is to show that any surface, lying in projective space of any dimension, is in the birational sense (after blowing up and blowing down of some curves, that is) accounted for by the models already mentioned./nNo more than other work in the Italian school would the proofs by Enriques now be counted as complete and rigorous. Not enough was known about some of the technical issues: the geometers worked by a mixture of inspired guesswork and close familiarity with examples. Oscar Zariski started to work in the 1930s on a more refined theory of birational mappings, incorporating commutative algebra methods. He also began work on the question of the classification for characteristic p, where new phenomena arise.

She is noted for her early philosophical work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, and is now known most of all for an early, but long-ignored critique of a \"no hidden-variables theorem\" by John von Neumann. It has been suggested that, had her critique not remained nearly unknown for decades, the historical development of quantum mechanics might have been very different.[2]/nHermann studied mathematics at G\u00f6ttingen under Emmy Noether and Edmund Landau,[3] where she achieved her PhD in 1926.  Her doctoral thesis, \"Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale\" (in English \"The Question of Finitely Many Steps in Polynomial Ideal Theory\"), published in Mathematische Annalen, is the foundational paper for computer algebra.  It first established the existence of algorithms (including complexity bounds) for many of the basic problems of abstract algebra, such as ideal membership for polynomial rings.  Hermann's algorithm for primary decomposition is still in contemporary use.[4]/nFrom 1925 to 1927, Hermann worked as assistant for Leonard Nelson.[1] Together with Minna Specht, she posthumously published Nelson's work System der philosophischen Ethik und P\u00e4dagogik,[5] while continuing her own research./nAs a philosopher, Hermann had a particular interest in the foundations of physics.  In 1934, she went to Leipzig \"for the express purpose of reconciling a neo-Kantian conception of causality with the new quantum mechanics\".[6] In Leipzig, many exchanges of thoughts took place among Hermann, Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, and Werner Heisenberg.[6]  The contents of her work in this time, including a focus on a distinction of predictability and causality, are known from three of her own publications,[1] and from later description of their discussions by von Weizs\u00e4cker,[7] and the discussion of Hermann's work in chapter ten of Heisenberg's The Part and The Whole.  From Denmark, she published her work The foundations of quantum mechanics in the philosophy of nature (German original title: Die naturphilosophischen Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik).  This work has been referred to as \"one of the earliest and best philosophical treatments of the new quantum mechanics\".[8] In this work, she concludes:/nThe theory of quantum mechanics forces us [\u2026] to drop the assumption of the absolute character of knowledge about nature, and to deal with the principle of causality independently of this assumption. Quantum mechanics has therefore not contradicted the law of causality at all, but has clarified it and has removed from it other principles which are not necessarily connected to it./nIn June 1936, Hermann was awarded the Richard Avenarius prize together with Eduard May and Th. Vogel.[10][11]/nEarlier, in 1935, Hermann published a critique of John von Neumann's 1932 proof which was widely claimed to show that a hidden variable theory of quantum mechanics was impossible.  Hermann's work on this subject went unnoticed by the physics community until it was independently discovered and published by John Stewart Bell in 1966, and her earlier discovery was pointed out by Max Jammer in 1974.  Some have posited that had her critique not remained nearly unknown for decades, her ideas would have put in question the unequivocal acceptance of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, by providing a credible basis for the further development of nonlocal hidden variable theories, which would have changed the historical development of quantum mechanics.[1]/nAs Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, Hermann participated in the underground movement against the Nazis. She was a member of the Internationaler Sozialistischer Kampfbund (ISK).[12]/nBy 1936, Hermann left Germany for Denmark and later France and England.[12]   In London, in order to avoid standing out on account of her German provenance, she married a man called Edward Henry early in 1938.[13]   Her prescience was justified by events:  two years later the British government invoked its hitherto obscure Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, identifying several thousand refugees who had fled Germany for reasons of politics or race as enemy aliens and placing them in internment camps.[14]/nAfter the war ended in 1945 she was able to combine her interests in physics and mathematics with political philosophy.

Whittaker was a leading mathematical scholar of the early 20th-century who contributed widely to applied mathematics and was renowned for his research in mathematical physics and numerical analysis, including the theory of special functions, along with his contributions to astronomy, celestial mechanics, the history of physics, and digital signal processing./nAmong the most influential publications in Whittaker's bibliography, he authored several popular reference works in mathematics, physics, and the history of science, including A Course of Modern Analysis (better known as Whittaker and Watson), Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, and A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity. Whittaker is also remembered for his role in the relativity priority dispute, as he credited Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Hendrik Lorentz with developing special relativity in the second volume of his History, a dispute which has lasted several decades, though scientific consensus has remained with Einstein. Whittaker served as the Royal Astronomer of Ireland early in his career, a position he held from 1906 through 1912, before moving on to the chair of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh for the next three decades and, towards the end of his career, received the Copley Medal and was knighted. The School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh holds The Whittaker Colloquium, a yearly lecture, in his honour and the Edinburgh Mathematical Society promotes an outstanding young Scottish mathematician once every four years with the Sir Edmund Whittaker Memorial Prize, also given in his honour./nEdmund Taylor Whittaker was born in Southport, in Lancashire, the son of Selina Septima (n\u00e9e Taylor) and John Whittaker.[3] He was described as an \"extremely delicate child\", necessitating his mother to home school him until he was 11 years old, when he was sent off to Manchester Grammar School.[8] Ernest Barker, a classmate of Whittaker's at the Grammar School with whom he shared the office of prefect, later recalled his personality: \"He had a gay, lively, bubbling spirit: he was ready for every prank: he survives in my memory as a natural actor; and I think he could also, on occasion, produce a merry poem.\"[9] While at the school, Whittaker studied on the \"classical side\", devoting three-fifths of his time to Latin and Greek.[8] Whittaker struggled with the poetry and drama which was required by the upper school, and expressed gratitude for being allowed to leave these studies behind and specialise in mathematics.[8]/nIn December 1891 Whittaker received an entrance scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge.[1][8] After completing his education at the Manchester Grammar School he went on to study mathematics and physics there from 1892 to 1895.[10] He entered Trinity College as a minor scholar in October 1892 to study mathematics.[11] Whittaker was the pupil of Andrew Russell Forsyth and George Howard Darwin while at Trinity College and received tutoring throughout his first two years.[12] With an interest more in applied than pure mathematics, Whittaker won the Sheepshanks Astronomical Exhibition in 1894 as an undergraduate.[12] He graduated as Second Wrangler in the Cambridge Tripos examination in 1895.[13] The Senior Wrangler that year was Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich and Whittaker tied John Hilton Grace for second, all three along with three other participants, including Bertram Hopkinson, went on to be elected Fellows of the Royal Society.[1] He also received the Tyson Medal for Mathematics and Astronomy in 1896.[14]/nWhittaker was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge from 1896 to 1906 when took on the role of Royal Astronomer of Ireland. He held this post in Dublin until 1912, when he was appointed chair of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, a role he went on to hold for just over a third of a century. Throughout his career, he wrote papers on automorphic functions and special functions in pure mathematics as well as on electromagnetism, general relativity, numerical analysis and astronomy in applied mathematics and physics, and was also interested in topics in biography, history, philosophy and theology.[8] He also made several important innovations in Edinburgh that had a large impact on mathematical education and societies there.[15]/nIn 1896, Whittaker was elected as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and remained at Cambridge as a teacher until 1906. In 1897, Whittaker was awarded the Smith Prize for his work on the paper \"On the connexion of algebraic functions with automorphic functions\", published in 1888.[13]/nIn 1902, Whittaker found a general solution to Laplace's equation, which received popular news coverage as a \"remarkable discovery\", though the mathematician Horace Lamb noted that it did not offer any new features.[16] He also wrote several celebrated books in his early career, publishing A Course of Modern Analysis in 1902 and following it up with A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies just two years later in 1904. In September of that year, Whittaker was forced to sell six silver forks at an auction to pay back taxes which he had previously refused to pay due to the Education Act 1902 requiring citizens to pay taxes to fund local Christian schools, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England.[17]/nPrior to being compelled by a magistrate to repay the tax burden, Whittaker was one of several activists who engaged in passive resistance by refusing to pay the taxes.[17] In 1905, Whittaker was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his achievements.[2]/nIn 1906, Whittaker was appointed Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin, which came with the title Royal Astronomer of Ireland.[2] He succeeded Charles Jasper Joly at the post and was appointed upon recommendation from the astronomer Robert Stawell Ball.[18]/nBall's recommendation, which was published in a collection of his letters in 1915, stated that Whittaker was the only person he knew who could \"properly succeed Joly\" and that the role would \"suit him in every way\".[19][18] He then describes Whittaker as \"modest\" and \"charming\" and as \"a man who has infinite capacity for making things go\". Ball said Whittaker was a world leading expert in theoretical astronomy and that, in relation to Whittaker's discovery of a general solution to Laplace's equation, notes that he \"has already made one discovery which the greatest mathematician of the last two centuries would be proud to have placed to his credit\".[19][18]/nThe Royal Astronomers acted as directors for the Dunsink Observatory, which used outdated astronomy equipment; it was understood that the primary responsibility of the role was to teach mathematical physics at Trinity College.[2][20] During this time, the relative leisure of his post allowed him to complete the reading required to write his third major book A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, from the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century.[21] Also during this time, he wrote the book The Theory of Optical Instruments, published six astronomy papers, and published collected astronomical observations.[18]/nWhittaker became Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in January 1912, where he remained for the rest of his career.[2][20] The role was left vacant by the death of his predecessor, George Chrystal in 1911.[20] He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1912, after being nominated by Cargill Gilston Knott, Ralph Allan Sampson, James Gordon MacGregor and Sir William Turner. He served as Secretary to the Society from 1916 to 1922, the Vice President from 1925 to 1928 and 1937 to 1939, and was President of the Society from 1939 to 1944, through the war years.[3] Whittaker began holding \"research lectures\" in mathematics at the university, typically given twice a week.[22] He was said to be a great lecturer by one of his previous attendees, who stated that his \"clear diction, his felicity of language and his enthusiasm could not fail to evoke a response\" and that he was very good with illustrations.[23][24]/nFreeman Dyson commented on Whittaker's lecture style by saying that students were \"warmed, not only by the physical presence of a big crowd packed together, but by the mental vigour and enthusiasm of the old man\".[25] Whittaker's efforts helped transform the Edinburgh Mathematical Society from a teachers society to an academic research society and was a major driving force in introducing computational mathematics education to the UK and America.[15]/nShortly after coming to Edinburgh, Whittaker established the Edinburgh Mathematical Laboratory, one of the UK's first mathematical laboratories.[26] The laboratory was the first attempt of a systematic treatment of numerical analysis in Great Britain and friends of Whittaker have said he believes it his most notable contribution to the education of mathematics.[26] Subjects taught at the laboratory included interpolation, the method of least squares, systems of linear equations, determinants, roots of transcendental equations, practical Fourier analysis, definite integrals, and numerical solution of differential equations.[22] The laboratory program was so successful, it resulted in many requests for an extra summer course to allow others to attend who previously were unable, ultimately leading to the establishment of a colloquium through the Edinburgh Mathematical Society. In 1913, Whittaker established the Edinburgh Mathematical Society Colloquium and the first was held over five days in August of that year.[22]/nThe textbook The calculus of observations was compiled from courses given at the Laboratory over a ten-year period; the book was well received and ultimately went through four editions.[27]/nOutside of the Royal Astronomer of Ireland and his roles in the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Whittaker held several notable academic posts, including president of the Mathematical Association from 1920 through 1921, president of the Mathematical and Physical Section (Section A) of the British Science Association in 1927, and was president of the London Mathematical Society from 1828 through 1829.[28] Whittaker also held the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize Lectureship for \"his service to mathematics\" with the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1924 through 1928.[29]/nHe was elected either Honorary Fellow or Foreign Member in a number of academic organisations, including the Accademia dei Lincei in 1922, the Societa Reale di Napoli in 1936, the American Philosophical Society in 1944, the Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique in 1946, the Faculty of Actuaries in 1918, the Benares Mathematical Society in 1920, the Indian Mathematical Society in 1924, and the Mathematical Association in 1935. In 1956, he was elected as a corresponding member of the Geometry section of the French Academy of Sciences a few days before his death.[4] Whittaker was also awarded honorary doctorates from several universities, including two LLDs from the University of St Andrews in 1926 and the University of California in 1934, an ScD from the Trinity College Dublin in 1906, and two D.Sc.s from the National University of Ireland in 1939 and University of Manchester in 1944.[2]/nWhittaker published many works on philosophy and theism in the last years of his career and during his retirement in addition to his work on the second edition of A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity. He released two books on Christianity and published several books and papers on the philosophy of Arthur Eddington.[30]/nWhittaker was a Christian and became a convert to the Roman Catholic Church in 1930.[18] In relation to that, Pope Pius XI awarded him with the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice in 1935 and appointed him to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1936.[5] He was a member of the academy from 1936 onward and served as Honorary President of the Newman Society from 1943 to 1945.[4] Whittaker published two book-length works on the topic of Christianity, including The beginning and end of the world and Space and spirit.[31] The first of which was the result of the 1942 Riddell Memorial Lectures at Durham while the second is based on his 1946 Donnellan Lecture at Trinity College Dublin.[32] It has been remarked by physics historian Helge Kragh,[33] that in these books, Whittaker was \"the only physical scientist of the first rank\" who defended the strong entropic creation argument, which holds that as entropy always increases, the Universe must have started at a point of minimum entropy, which they argue implies the existence of a god.[31] Whittaker published several articles which draw connections between science, philosophy and theism between 1947 and 1952 in the BBC magazine The Listener, one of which Religion and the nature of the universe was republished in American Vogue, making him \"a rare, if not unique, example of a man whose published work not only crossed disciplinary boundaries, but was published everywhere from Nature to Vogue.\"[28]/nWhittaker retired from his position as chair of the mathematics department at the University of Edinburgh in September 1946, a role he held for over 33 years.[34] He was awarded emeritus professor status at the university which he retained until his death.[20] In retirement, Whittaker worked tirelessly the second edition of his A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, releasing The Classical Theories just a few years later.[5] He also continued publishing works in philosophy and theism. James Robert McConnell noted that Whittaker's research in the connection between physics and philosophy spanned nearly forty publications written over his last 15 years.[35] During the three years prior to the publication of second volume of his History, Whittaker had already determined that he was going to give priority for the discovery of special relativity to Henri Poincar\u00e9 and  Hendrik Lorentz in the new book.[36] Max Born, a friend of Whittaker's, wrote a letter to Einstein in September 1953 explaining that he had done all he could over the previous three years to convince Whittaker to change his mind about Einstein's role, but Whittaker was resolved in the idea and, according to Born, he \"cherished\" and \"loved to talk\" about it.[36] Born told Einstein that Whittaker insists that all the important features were developed by Poincar\u00e9 while Lorentz \"quite plainly had the physical interpretation\", which annoyed Born as Whittaker was a \"great authority in the English speaking countries\" and he was worried that Whittaker's view would influence others.[36]/nWhittaker died at his home, 48 George Square, Edinburgh, on 24 March 1956.[37] He was buried at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Edinburgh, with \"mathematical precision at a depth of 6 ft. 6 inches\", according to the cemetery register.[28] His entry in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society was written by George Frederick James Temple in November 1956.[2] He received published obituaries from Alexander Aitken,[38] Herbert Dingle,[39] Gerald James Whitrow,[32] and William Hunter McCrea,[40] among others.[41][23] His house was owned by the University of Edinburgh and was demolished in the 1960s to expand the campus and now holds the William Robertson Building.[42]/nIn 1901, while at Cambridge, he married Mary Ferguson Macnaghten Boyd, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and granddaughter of Thomas Jamieson Boyd.[2] They had five children, two daughters and three sons including the mathematician John Macnaghten Whittaker (1905\u20131984).[5] His elder daughter, Beatrice, married Edward Taylor Copson, who would later become Professor of Mathematics at the University of St Andrews.[43]/nGeorge Frederick James Temple noted that Whittaker's home in Edinburgh was \"a great centre of social and intellectual activity where liberal hospitality was dispensed to students of all ages\",[2] and went on to note that Whittaker had a happy home life and was well loved by his family.[2] Whittaker kept a piano in his home which he did not know how to play, but enjoyed listening to friends play when they would come to visit.[5] Whittaker was also known to take a personal interest in his students and would invite them to social gatherings at his house.[5][23] He also continued to keep track of his Honours students over the years.[5] His home was also the location of many unofficial interviews that would have a large impact on a student's future career.[23] After his death, William Hunter McCrea described Whittaker as having a \"quick wit\" with an \"ever-present sense of humour\" and being \"the most unselfish of men with a delicate sense of what would give help or pleasure to others\".[40] He notes that Whittaker had a \"vast number of friends\" and that he \"never missed an opportunity to do or say something on behalf of any one of them\".[40]/nIn addition to his textbooks and other works, several of which remain in print, Whittaker is remembered for his research in automorphic functions, numerical analysis, harmonic analysis, and general relativity. He has several theorems and functions named in his honour. In June 1958, two years after his death, an entire issue of the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society was dedicated to his life and works.[44] The volume included an article by Robert Alexander Rankin on Whittaker's work on automorphic functions,[45] an article on Whittaker's work on numerical analysis by Alexander Aitken,[20] his work on Harmonic functions was covered in an article by Temple,[46] John Lighton Synge wrote about his contributions to the theory of relativity,[47] and James Robert McConnell wrote about Whittaker's philosophy.[35] Among others, Whittaker coined the terms cardinal function and Mathieu function.[48] The School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh holds the annual Whittaker Colloquium in his honour.[6][49] Funded by a donation from his family in 1958, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society promotes an outstanding young Scottish mathematician once every four years with the Sir Edmund Whittaker Memorial Prize, also given in his honour.[50]/nWhittaker is the eponym of the Whittaker function or Whittaker integral, in the theory of confluent hypergeometric functions.[51] This makes him also the eponym of the Whittaker model in the local theory of automorphic representations.[52] He published also on algebraic functions, though they were typically limited to special cases.[20] Whittaker had a lifelong interest in automorphic functions and he published three papers on the topic throughout his career.[53] Among other contributions, he found the general expression for the Bessel functions as integrals involving Legendre functions.[51]/nWhittaker also made contributions to the theory of partial differential equations, harmonic functions and other special functions of mathematical physics, including finding a general solution to Laplace's equation that became a standard part of potential theory.[54] Whittaker developed a general solution of the Laplace equation in three dimensions and the solution of the wave equation.[55]/nWhittaker wrote three scientific treatises which were highly influential, A Course of Modern Analysis, Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, and The Calculus of Observations.[56] In 1956, Gerald James Whitrow stated that two of them not only were required reading for British mathematicians, but were regarded as fundamental components of their personal libraries.[32] Despite the success of these books and his other researchers and their influence in mathematics and physics, the second edition of Whittaker's A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity has been called his \"magnum opus\".[5][32][20] In reference to the title's popularity, William Hunter McCrea predicted that future readers would have a hard time acknowledging it was the result of just \"a few years at both ends of a career of the highest distinction in other pursuits.\"[57]/nWhittaker also wrote The theory of optical instruments during his time as Royal Astronomer of Ireland as well as several books on philosophy and theism.[56] Whittaker's bibliography in the Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society includes 11 books and monographs, 56 mathematics and physics articles, 35 philosophy and history articles, and 21 biographical articles, excluding popular and semi-popular articles published in magazines such as Scientific American.[48] In the bibliography compiled by McCrea in 1957, there are 13 books and monographs and the same journal articles, also excluding popular articles.[58] Among other topics, Whittaker wrote a total of ten papers on electromagnetism and general relativity.[47]/nWhittaker was the original author of the classic textbook A Course of Modern Analysis, first published in 1902.[59] There were three more editions of the book all in collaboration with George Neville Watson, resulting in the famous colloquial name Whittaker & Watson. The work is subtitled an introduction to the general theory of infinite processes and of analytic functions; with an account of the principal transcendental functions and is a classic textbook in mathematical analysis, remaining in print continuously since its release over a hundred years ago.[43] It covered topics previously unavailable in English, such as complex analysis, mathematical analysis, and the Special functions used in mathematical physics.[56] George Frederick James Temple noted that it was unmatched in these aspects \"for many years\".[56] The book was an edited set of lecture notes from the Cambridge Tripos courses Whittaker taught and contained results from mathematicians such as Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass which were relatively unknown to English speaking countries.[60] A. C. Aitken noted the books have been widely influential in the study of special functions and their associated differential equations as well as in the study of functions of complex variables.[20]/nWhittaker's second major work, A Treatise on the Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies was first published in 1904, and quickly became a classic textbook in mathematical physics and analytical dynamics, a branch of classical mechanics.[61] It has remained in print for most of its lifetime, over more than a hundred years, and has been said to have \"remarkable longevity\".[61] The book represented the forefront of development at the time of publication, where many reviewers noted it contained material otherwise non-existent in the English language.[61] The book was a landmark textbook, providing the first systematic treatment in English for the theory of Hamiltonian dynamics, which played a fundamental role in the development of quantum mechanics.[60] A. C. Aitken called the book \"epoch making in a very precise sense\", noting that just before the development of the theory of relativity, the book provided a detailed summary of classical dynamics and the progress that had been made in Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics, including work from Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Tullio Levi-Civita.[20] The book has received many recommendations, including from Victor Lenzen in 1952, nearly 50 years after its initial publication, who said the book was still the \"best exposition of the subject on the highest possible level\".[62] It was noted in a 2014 article covering the book's development, published in the Archive for History of Exact Sciences, that the book was used for more than just a historical book, where it was pointed out that of the 114 books and papers that cited the book between 2000 and 2012, \"only three are of a historical nature\".[61] In that same period, the book was said to be \"highly recommended to advanced readers\" in the 2006 engineering textbook Principles of Engineering Mechanics.[63]/nIn 1910, Whittaker wrote A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity,[64] which gave a detailed account of the aether theories from Ren\u00e9 Descartes to Hendrik Lorentz and Albert Einstein, including the contributions of Hermann Minkowski. The book was well received and established Whittaker as a respected historian of science.[65] A second, revised and extended edition was later released. The first volume, subtitled the classical theories, was published in 1951[66] and served as a revised and updated edition of the first book. The second volume, published in 1953,[67] extended this work covering the years 1900\u20131926. Notwithstanding a notorious controversy on Whittaker's views on the history of special relativity, covered in volume two of the second edition, the books are considered authoritative references on the history of classical electromagnetism[68] and are considered classic books in the history of physics.[69] Due to the book's role in the relativity priority dispute, however, the second volume is cited far less than the first volume and first edition, except in connection with the controversy.[70]/n/nWhittaker is also remembered for his role in the relativity priority dispute, a historic controversy over credit for the development of special relativity. In a chapter named \"The Relativity Theory of Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz\" in the second volume of the second edition of A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, Whittaker credited Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Hendrik Lorentz for developing the theory; he attributed to Einstein's special relativity paper relatively little importance, saying it \"set forth the relativity theory of Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz with some amplifications, and which attracted much attention\".[71] Max Born, a friend of Whittaker's, wrote to Einstein expressing his concern about the book's publication and wrote a rebuttal in his 1956 book.[36][72] The controversy was also mentioned in one of Whittaker's obituaries by Gerald James Whitrow, who said that he had written Whittaker a letter explaining how the latter's views \"did not do justice to the originality of Einstein's philosophy\", but remarked that he understood why Whittaker felt the need to correct the popular misconception that Einstein's contribution was unique.[32] Max Born's rebuttal, published in his 1956 book, also argues that while the contributions of Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 should not be overlooked, it was the postulates and philosophy of Einstein's theory that \"distinguishes Einstein\u2019s work from his predecessors and gives us the right to speak of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, in spite of Whittaker\u2019s different opinion\".[72] Though the dispute has lasted decades, most scholars have rejected Whittaker's arguments and scientific consensus has continued to hold that special relativity was Einstein's development.[73]/nWhittaker's views on philosophy was analysed by James Robert McConnell for the Whittaker Memorial Volume of the Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.[35] McConnell noted that Whittaker's research into the connections between physics and philosophy were spread across approximately forty publications.[74] Whittaker's worldview was classified as neo-Cartesianism in the volume, a philosophy described as being \"founded on the principle that the search for a universal science should be modelled on the procedure of physicomathematicians.\"[75] McConnell notes several of Whittaker's original contributions to Ren\u00e9 Descartes' philosophical system, but goes on to sum up the work by saying that while he admired Whittaker's attempt at the problem, he was not satisfied with the many transitions between mathematics, aesthetics, ethics. He stated that \"If the transitions from mathematics to moral values are not firmly established, Whittaker's attempt does not succeed in remedying the defects of Descartes' solution.\"[76] Whittaker published work in several other areas of philosophy, including research on Eddington's principle, a conjecture by Arthur Eddington that all quantitative propositions in physics can be derived from qualitative assertions.[30] In addition to publishing Eddington's Fundamental Theory, Whittaker wrote two other books pertaining to Eddington's philosophy.[30] Whittaker also wrote at length about the impacts of then-recent discoveries in astronomy on religion and theology,[77] determinism and free will,[78] and natural theology.[79] In the conclusion of his article, McConnell sums up Whittaker's philosophic works as appearing as though it came from \"that of the scholarly Christian layman\".[79] On metaphysics, he goes on to note that there are  few scholars who are competent in both physics and metaphysics and states that future work could benefit and draw inspiration from Whittaker's research in the area.[79]/nIn 1931, Whittaker received the Sylvester Medal from the Royal Society for \"his original contributions to both pure and applied mathematics\".[80] He then received the De Morgan Medal from the London Mathematical Society in 1935, an award given once every three years for outstanding contributions to mathematics.[81] He received several honours in his 70s, including being knighted in 1945 by King George VI,[82] and in 1954, receiving the Royal Society's Copley Medal, its highest award, \"for his distinguished contributions to both pure and applied mathematics and to theoretical physics\".[18][83] In the opening remarks of the 1954 address of President Edgar Adrian to the Royal Society, Adrian announces Whittaker as that years Copley medallist saying he is probably the most well-known British mathematician at the time, due to \"his numerous, varied and important contributions\" as well as the offices he had held.[84] Noting contributions to nearly all fields of applied mathematics and then-recent contributions to pure mathematics, relativity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics, Adrian goes on to say that the \"astonishing quantity and quality of his work is probably unparalleled in modern mathematics and it is most appropriate that the Royal Society should confer on Whittaker its most distinguished award.\"[84]/nWhittaker also gave several distinguished lectures, some of which formed the base of books he would later write.[2] He held the Rouse Ball lectureship at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1926, the Bruce-Preller lectureship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1931, and the Selby lectureship at the University of Cardiff in 1933. He also held the Hitchcock professorship at the University of California in 1934, the Riddell lectureship at the University at Durham (Newcastle) in 1942, the Guthrie lectureship of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh in 1943, and the Donnellan lectureship at the Trinity College Dublin in 1946.[2] He gave the Tarner Lecture at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1947 and held the Larmor lectureship of the Royal Irish Academy and the Herbert Spencer lectureship at the University of Oxford, both in 1948.[2]", "30666836": "James Gordon Gray FRSE (1876 \u2013 6 November 1934) was a Scottish mathematician and physicist./nGrey was born in Glasgow in 1876, the third of eight children of Annie Gordon and Andrew Gray.

Although the family was partially converted into Roman Catholicism, his parents were agnostic. His father Aleksander Rajchman was a journalist specialized in theatre and music critique, who in the period 1882-1904 was the publisher and editor-in-chief of the artistic weekly Echo Muzyczne, Teatralne i Artystyczne and was co-founder and first director of the National Philharmonic in Warsaw in the years 1901\u20131904.

He was mobilised on 4 August the same year. Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the British Army. However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front. French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised. They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war. It is remarkable that during his service in the war, he still managed to produce cutting edge mathematical papers frequently, despite having little time to devote to mathematics./nAfter the end of the war, Fr\u00e9chet was chosen to go to Strasbourg to help with the reestablishment of the university. He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute. Despite being burdened with administrative work, he was again able to produce a large amount of high-quality research./nIn 1928 Fr\u00e9chet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from Borel, who was then chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. Fr\u00e9chet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne's Rockefeller Foundation and from 1928 was a Professor (without a chair). Fr\u00e9chet was promoted to tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935. In 1941 Fr\u00e9chet succeeded Borel as chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fr\u00e9chet held until he retired in 1949. From 1928 to 1935 Fr\u00e9chet was also put in charge of lectures at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure; in this latter capacity Fr\u00e9chet was able to direct a significant number of young mathematicians toward research in probability, including Doeblin, Fortet, Lo\u00e8ve, and Jean Ville.[2]/nDespite his major achievements, Fr\u00e9chet was not overly appreciated in France. As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences until the age of 78.[citation needed] In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1950 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3]/nFr\u00e9chet was an Esperantist, publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language.[4] He also served as president of the Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista (\"International Scientific Esperantist Association\") from 1950 to 1953.[5]/nHis first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel, on the calculus of functionals. Here Fr\u00e9chet introduced the concept of a metric space, although the name is due to Hausdorff. Fr\u00e9chet's level of abstraction is similar to that in group theory, proving theorems within a carefully chosen axiomatic system that can then be applied to a large array of particular cases./nHere is a list of his most important works, in chronological order:/nFr\u00e9chet also developed[7] ideas from the article Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique[8] (1938; an English translation The Two Fundamental Types of Statistical Distribution) of Czech geographer, demographer and statistician Jarom\u00edr Kor\u010d\u00e1k./nFr\u00e9chet is sometimes credited with the introduction of what is now known as the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound, but Fr\u00e9chet's 1940s lecture notes on the topic appear to have been lost.[9]/nIn 1908 he married Suzanne Carrive.[10]", "8450166": "Anand Kumar (born 1 January 1973) is an Indian Mathematics educator, best known for his Super 30 programme, which he started with Abhayanand in Patna, Bihar in 2002, known for coaching underprivileged students for JEE- Main &  JEE-Advanced, the entrance examination for the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

Wold was known for his work in mathematical economics, in time series analysis, and in econometric statistics./nIn mathematical statistics, Wold contributed the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Wold theorem characterizing the normal distribution and developed the Wold decomposition in time series analysis. In microeconomics, Wold advanced utility theory and the theory of consumer demand. In multivariate statistics, Wold contributed the methods of partial least squares (PLS) and graphical models. Wold's work on causal inference from observational studies was decades ahead of its time, according to Judea Pearl.[1]/nHerman Wold was born in Skien, Southern Norway. He was the youngest in a family of six brothers and sisters. In 1912 the family moved to Sweden and became Swedish citizens. Herman's father had a small fur and hide business./nHerman Wold had a long and productive career, spanning six decades./nIn 1927 Wold enrolled at the University of Stockholm to study mathematics. It was an opportune time, for Harald Cram\u00e9r had been appointed Professor of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics. Wold would later write, \"To belong to Cram\u00e9r's first group of students was good luck, an advantage that simply cannot be exaggerated.\"/nAfter graduating in 1930 Wold worked for an insurance company; he also did  work on mortality data with Cram\u00e9r and later designed a tariff for the insurance companies. He started work on a PhD on stochastic processes with Cram\u00e9r as supervisor. Away from the thesis Wold and Cram\u00e9r did some joint work, their best known result being the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Wold theorem (1936)./nWold's thesis, A Study in the analysis of stationary time series, was an important contribution. The main result was the \"Wold decomposition\" by which a stationary series is expressed as a sum of a deterministic component and a stochastic component which can itself be expressed as an infinite moving average. Beyond this, the work brought together for the first time the work on individual processes by English statisticians, principally Udny Yule, and the theory of stationary stochastic processes created by Russian mathematicians, principally A. Ya. Khinchin. Wold's results on univariate time series were generalized to multivariate time series by his student Peter Whittle./nThe Wold decomposition and the related Wold's theorem inspired Beurling's factorization theorem in harmonic analysis and related work on invariant subspaces of linear operators./nIn 1938 a government committee appointed Wold to do an econometric study of consumer demand in Sweden. The results were published in 1940. In parallel, he worked on the theory of demand. His book Demand Analysis (1952) brought together his work on the theory of demand, the theory of stochastic processes, the theory of regression and his work on Swedish data.[2]/nIn 1943 and 1944, Trygve Haavelmo put forward his ideas on the simultaneous equations model, arguing that systems of simultaneous equations should be central in econometric research. Wold noted some limitation of the maximum-likelihood approach favoured by Haavelmo and the Cowles Commission; Wold cautioned that the literature contained some exaggerated claims for the superiority of maximum-likelihood estimation./nIn 1945 to 1965, Wold proposed and elaborated on his \"recursive causal chain\" model, which was more appropriate for many applications, according to Wold: For such \"recursive causal chain\" models, the least squares method was computationally efficient and enjoyed superior theoretical properties, which it lacked for general time-series models. Wold's writings on causality and recursive-chain models have been recognized[citation needed] as scientific inventions by recent work on causality and graphical models in statistics, especially by Judea Pearl and Nanny Wermuth./nAt the end of his career, Wold turned away from econometric modelling and developed multivariate techniques for what he called \"soft\" modelling. Some of these methods were developed through interactions with his student K. G. J\u00f6reskog, although the latter's focus was primarily on maximum likelihood methods./nThe story of Wold's academic appointments is briefly told. In 1942 he became professor of statistics at Uppsala University and he stayed there until 1970. He then moved to Gothenburg, retiring from there in 1975./nIn 1960 Wold became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He was born at Bagnols in Languedoc, France. According to Abraham Zacuto and others, he was the son of Gerson ben Solomon Catalan./nAs in the case of the other medieval Jewish philosophers little is known of his life. His family had been distinguished for piety and exegetical skill in Talmud, but though he was known in the Jewish community by commentaries on certain books of the Bible, he never seems to have accepted any rabbinical post. It has been suggested[by whom?] that the uniqueness of his opinions may have put obstacles in the way of his advancement to a higher position or office. He is known to have been at Avignon and Orange during his life, and is believed to have died in 1344, though Zacuto asserts that he died at Perpignan in 1370./nGersonides is known for his unorthodox views and rigid Aristotelianism, which eventually led him to rationalize many of the miracles in the Bible. His commentary on the Bible was sharply criticized by the most prominent scholars, such as Abarbanel, Chisdai Crescas, and Rivash, the latter accusing him of heresy and almost banning his works.[3]/nPart of his writings consist of commentaries on the portions of Aristotle then known, or rather of commentaries on the commentaries of Averroes. Some of these are printed in the early Latin editions of Aristotle's works. His most important treatise, that by which he has a place in the history of philosophy, is entitled Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem, (\"The Wars of the Lord\"), and occupied twelve years in composition (1317\u20131329). A portion of it, containing an elaborate survey of astronomy as known to the Arabs, was translated into Latin in 1342 at the request of Pope Clement VI./nThe Wars of the Lord is modeled after the plan of the great work of Jewish philosophy,  the Guide for the Perplexed of Maimonides.  It may be regarded as a criticism of some elements of Maimonides' syncretism of Aristotelianism and rabbinic Jewish thought.  Ralbag's treatise strictly adhered to Aristotelian thought.[4]  The Wars of the Lord review:/nGersonides was also the author of commentaries on the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, I & II Samuel, I & II Kings, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles. He makes reference to a commentary on Isaiah, but it is not extant./nIn contrast to the theology held by other Jewish thinkers, Jewish theologian Louis Jacobs argues, Gersonides held that God does not have complete foreknowledge of human acts. \"Gersonides, bothered by the old question of how God's foreknowledge is compatible with human freedom, holds that what God knows beforehand is all the choices open to each individual.  God does not know, however, which choice the individual, in his freedom, will make.\"[5]/nAnother neoclassical Jewish proponent of self-limited omniscience was Abraham ibn Daud. \"Whereas the earlier Jewish philosophers extended the omniscience of God to include the free acts of man, and had argued that human freedom of decision was not affected by God's foreknowledge of its results, Ibn Daud, evidently following Alexander of Aphrodisias, excludes human action from divine foreknowledge. God, he holds, limited his omniscience even as He limited His omnipotence in regard to human acts\".[6]/nRabbi Yeshayahu Horowitz explained the apparent paradox of his position by citing the old question, \"Can God create a rock so heavy that He cannot pick it up?\" He said that we cannot accept free choice as a creation of God's, and simultaneously question its logical compatibility with omnipotence./nSee further discussion in Free will in Jewish thought./nGersonides posits that people's souls are composed of two parts: a material, or human, intellect; and an acquired, or agent, intellect. The material intellect is inherent in every person, and gives people the capacity to understand and learn. This material intellect is mortal, and dies with the body. However, he also posits that the soul also has an acquired intellect. This survives death, and can contain the accumulated knowledge that the person acquired during his lifetime. For Gersonides, Seymour Feldman points out,/nMan is immortal insofar as he attains the intellectual perfection that is open to him. This means that man becomes immortal only if and to the extent that he acquires knowledge of what he can in principle know, e.g. mathematics and the natural sciences. This knowledge survives his bodily death and constitutes his immortality.[8]/nGersonides was the author of the following Talmudic and halakhic works:/nOnly the first work is extant.[9]/nGersonides was the first to make a number of major mathematical and scientific advances, though since he wrote only in Hebrew and few of his writings were translated to other languages, his influence on non-Jewish thought was limited.[10]/nGersonides wrote Maaseh Hoshev in 1321 dealing with arithmetical operations including extraction of square and cube roots, various algebraic identities, certain sums including sums of consecutive integers, squares, and cubes, binomial coefficients, and simple combinatorial identities. The work is notable for its early use of proof by mathematical induction, and pioneering work in combinatorics.[11]  The title Maaseh Hoshev literally means the Work of the thinker, but it is also a pun on a biblical phrase meaning \"clever work\".  Maaseh Hoshev is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Sefer Hamispar (The Book of Number), which is an earlier and less sophisticated work by Rabbi Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra (1090\u20131167).  In 1342, Gersonides wrote On Sines, Chords and Arcs, which examined trigonometry, in particular proving the sine law for plane triangles and giving five-figure sine tables.[10]/nOne year later, at the request of the bishop of Meaux, he wrote The Harmony of Numbers in which he considers a problem of Philippe de Vitry involving so-called harmonic numbers, which have the form 2m\u00b73n. The problem was to characterize all pairs of harmonic numbers differing by 1. Gersonides proved that there are only four such pairs: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) and (8,9).[12]/nHe is also credited to have invented the Jacob's staff,[13] an instrument to measure the angular distance between celestial objects. It is described as consisting/n\u2026of a staff of 4.5 feet (1.4 m) long and about one inch (2.5 cm) wide, with six or seven perforated tablets which could slide along the staff, each tablet being an integral fraction of the staff length to facilitate calculation, used to measure the distance between stars or planets, and the altitudes and diameters of the Sun, Moon and stars.[14]/nGersonides observed a solar eclipse on March 3, 1337. After he had observed this event he proposed a new theory of the sun which he proceeded to test by further observations. Another eclipse observed by Gersonides was the eclipse of the Moon on 3 October 1335. He described a geometrical model for the motion of the Moon and made other astronomical observations of the Moon, Sun and planets using a camera obscura. Some of his beliefs were well wide of the truth, such as his belief that the Milky Way was on the sphere of the fixed stars and shines by the reflected light of the Sun./nGersonides was also the earliest known mathematician to have used the technique of mathematical induction in a systematic and self-conscious fashion and anticipated Galileo's error theory.[11]/nThe lunar crater Rabbi Levi is named after him./nGersonides believed that astrology was real, and developed a naturalistic, non-supernatural explanation of how it works. Julius Guttman explained that for Gersonides, astrology was:/nfounded on the metaphysical doctrine of the dependence of all earthly occurrences upon the heavenly world. The general connection imparted to the prophet by the active intellect is the general order of the astrological constellation. The constellation under which a man is born determines his nature and fate, and constellations as well determine the life span of nations. \u2026The active intellect knows the astrological order, from the most general form of the constellations to their last specification, which in turn contains all of the conditions of occurrence of a particular event. Thus, when a prophet deals with the destiny of a particular person or human group, he receives from the active intellect a knowledge of the order of the constellations, and with sufficient precision to enable him to predict its fate in full detail. \u2026This astrological determinism has only one limitation. The free will of man could shatter the course of action ordained for him by the stars; prophecy could therefore predict the future on the basis of astrological determination only insofar as the free will of man does not break through the determined course of things.[15]/nGersonides appears to be the only astronomer before modern times to have surmised that the fixed stars are much further away than the planets. Whereas all other astronomers put the fixed stars on a rotating sphere just beyond the outer planets, Gersonides estimated the distance to the fixed stars to be no less than 159,651,513,380,944 earth radii,[16] or about 100,000 lightyears in modern units./nUsing data he collected from his own observations, Gersonides refuted Ptolemy's model in what the notable physicist Yuval Ne'eman has considered as \"one of the most important insights in the history of science, generally missed in telling the story of the transition from epicyclic corrections to the geocentric model to Copernicus' heliocentric model\". Ne'eman argued that after Gersonides reviewed Ptolemy's model with its epicycles he realized that it could be checked, by measuring the changes in the apparent brightnesses of Mars and looking for cyclical changes along the conjectured epicycles. These thus ceased being dogma, they were a theory that had to be experimentally verified, \"\u00e0 la Popper\". Gersonides developed tools for these measurements, essentially pinholes and the camera obscura./nThe results of his observations did not fit Ptolemy's model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve on it. That challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus and Kepler three centuries later, but Gersonides was the first to falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Gersonides also showed that Ptolemy's model for the lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon's position, fails completely in predicting the apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the findings influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides' writings were translated and available.[17]/nGersonides is an important character in the novel The Dream of Scipio by Iain Pears, where he is depicted as the mentor of the protagonist Olivier de Noyen, a non-Jewish poet and intellectual.

Milnor is a distinguished professor at Stony Brook University and the only mathematician to have won the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, the Abel Prize and all three Steele prizes./nMilnor was born on February 20, 1931, in Orange, New Jersey.[1] His father was J. Willard Milnor, an  engineer,[2] and his mother was Emily Cox Milnor.[3][4] As an undergraduate at Princeton University he was named a Putnam Fellow in 1949 and 1950[5] and also proved the F\u00e1ry\u2013Milnor theorem when he was only 19 years old. Milnor graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1951 after completing a senior thesis, titled \"Link groups\", under the supervision of Robert H. Fox.[6] He remained at Princeton to pursue graduate studies and received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1954 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Isotopy of links\", also under the supervision of Fox.[7] His dissertation concerned link groups (a generalization of the classical knot group) and their associated link structure, classifying Brunnian links up to link-homotopy and introduced new invariants of it, called Milnor invariants. Upon completing his doctorate, he went on to work at Princeton. He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study from 1970 to 1990./nHe was an editor of the Annals of Mathematics for a number of years after 1962. He has written a number of books which are famous for their clarity, presentation, and an inspiration for the research by many mathematicians in their areas even after many decades since their publication. He served as Vice President of the AMS in 1976\u201377 period./nHis students have included Tadatoshi Akiba, Jon Folkman, John Mather, Laurent C. Siebenmann, Michael Spivak, and Jonathan Sondow. His wife, Dusa McDuff, is a professor of mathematics at Barnard College and is known for her work in symplectic topology./nOne of Milnor's best-known works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of 7-dimensional spheres with nonstandard differentiable structure, which marked the beginning of a new field \u2013 differential topology. He coined the term exotic sphere, referring to any n-sphere with nonstandard differential structure. Kervaire and Milnor initiated the systematic study of exotic spheres, showing in particular that the 7-sphere has 15 distinct differentiable structures (28 if one considers orientation)./nEgbert Brieskorn found simple algebraic equations for 28 complex hypersurfaces in complex 5-space such that their intersection with a small sphere of dimension 9 around a singular point is diffeomorphic to these exotic spheres. Subsequently, Milnor worked on the topology of isolated singular points of complex hypersurfaces in general, developing the theory of the Milnor fibration whose fiber has the homotopy type of a bouquet of \u03bc spheres where \u03bc is known as the Milnor number. Milnor's 1968 book on his theory, Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces, inspired the growth of a huge and rich research area that continues to mature to this day./nIn 1961 Milnor disproved the Hauptvermutung by illustrating two simplicial complexes that are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct, using the concept of Reidemeister torsion. This led to a wave of advances in topology by Milnor and many other mathematicians which changed the perception of the field forever.[citation needed]/nIn 1984 Milnor introduced a definition of attractor.[8]  The objects generalize standard attractors, include so-called unstable attractors and are now known as Milnor attractors./nMilnor's current interest is dynamics, especially holomorphic dynamics. His work in dynamics is summarized by Peter Makienko in his review of Topological Methods in Modern Mathematics:/nIt is evident now that low-dimensional dynamics, to a large extent initiated by Milnor's work, is a fundamental part of general dynamical systems theory. Milnor cast his eye on dynamical systems theory in the mid-1970s. By that time the Smale program in dynamics had been completed. Milnor's approach was to start over from the very beginning, looking at the simplest nontrivial families of maps. The first choice, one-dimensional dynamics, became the subject of his joint paper with Thurston. Even the case of a unimodal map, that is, one with a single critical point, turns out to be extremely rich. This work may be compared with Poincar\u00e9's work on circle diffeomorphisms, which 100 years before had inaugurated the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. Milnor's work has opened several new directions in this field, and has given us many basic concepts, challenging problems and nice theorems.[9]/nHis other significant contributions include microbundles, influencing the usage of Hopf algebras, theory of quadratic forms and the related area of symmetric bilinear forms, higher algebraic K-theory, game theory, and three-dimensional Lie groups./nMilnor was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961.[10] In 1962 Milnor was awarded the Fields Medal for his work in differential topology.

Another example of this line of work is the Thom conjecture, versions of which have been investigated using gauge theory. From the mid 1950s he moved into singularity theory, of which catastrophe theory is just one aspect, and in a series of deep (and at the time obscure) papers between 1960 and 1969 developed the theory of stratified sets and stratified maps, proving a basic stratified isotopy theorem describing the local conical structure of Whitney stratified sets, now known as the Thom\u2013Mather isotopy theorem. Much of his work on stratified sets was developed so as to understand the notion of topologically stable maps, and to eventually prove the result that the set of topologically stable mappings between two smooth manifolds is a dense set./nThom's lectures on the stability of differentiable mappings, given at the University of Bonn in 1960, were written up by Harold Levine and published in the proceedings of a year long symposium on singularities at Liverpool University during 1969\u201370, edited by C. T. C. Wall. The proof of the density of topologically stable mappings was completed by John Mather in 1970, based on the ideas developed by Thom in the previous ten years. A coherent detailed account was published in 1976 by Christopher Gibson, Klaus Wirthm\u00fcller, Andrew du Plessis, and Eduard Looijenga.[20]/nDuring the last twenty years of his life Thom's published work was mainly in philosophy and epistemology, and he undertook a reevaluation of Aristotle's writings on science. In 1992, he was one of eighteen academics who sent a letter to Cambridge University protesting against plans to award Jacques Derrida an honorary doctorate.[21]/nBeyond Thom's contributions to algebraic topology, he studied differentiable mappings, through the study of generic properties. In his final years, he turned his attention to an effort to apply his ideas about structural topography to the questions of thought, language, and meaning in the form of a \"semiophysics\".", "61636": "Lars Valerian Ahlfors (18 April 1907 \u2013 11 October 1996) was a Finnish mathematician, remembered for his work in the field of Riemann surfaces and his textbook on complex analysis./nAhlfors was born in Helsinki, Finland.[1][2] His mother, Siev\u00e4 Helander, died at his birth.

In February 1932 he left Japan for an academic visit to G\u00f6ttingen, where he remained for two years. Upon his return from G\u00f6ttingen in March 1934, he was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the Imperial University of Osaka,[3] and was promoted to Associate Professor in September that year, becoming Professor in the Faculty of Science in March 1936. In March 1937 Nagumo received a Doctor of Science degree from the Imperial University of Tokyo. In the 1960s he made a number of academic visits abroad, spending time at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (where he visited Kurt Friedrichs and other old acquaintances from his time at G\u00f6ttingen) and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in 1960, followed by a visit to the National Tsing Hua University in 1963-64. He retired from Osaka University in December 1966, after which he was granted the title of Honorary Professor. He was subsequently appointed Professor at Sophia University, from which he retired in March 1976, having reached mandatory retirement age.[1]/nMuch of Nagumo's original work was published in Japanese and German,[1] however his research and teaching have influenced numerous mathematicians (especially in Japan) who have since made many of his results available in English.[4]", "48853299": "William Elwood Byerly (13 December 1849 \u2013 20 December 1935) was an American mathematician at Harvard University where he was the \"Perkins Professor of Mathematics\".

He was a peer of Alan Turing who mentioned Scholz when writing with regard to the reception of \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\":[1] \"I have had two letters asking for reprints, one from Braithwaite at King's and one from a professor [sic] in Germany... They seemed very much interested in the paper. [...] I was disappointed by its reception here.\"/nScholz had an extraordinary career (he was considered an outstanding scientist of national importance) but was not considered a brilliant logician, for example on the same level as Gottlob Frege or Rudolf Carnap. He provided a suitable academic environment for his students to thrive. He founded the Institute of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at the University of M\u00fcnster in 1936, which can be said enabled the study of logic at the highest international level after World War II up until the present day.[2]/nHerman Scholz father was a protestant minister at St. Mary's Church, Berlin.[3] From 1903 to 1907 he studied philosophy and theology at Erlangen University and Berlin University achieving a Licentiate in theology (Lic. theol.).  He was a student of Adolf von Harnack, in philosophy with peers Alois Riehl and Friedrich Paulsen. On 28 July 1910, Scholz habilitated in the subjects of religious philosophy and systematic theology in Berlin, and was promoted to full professor, therein working as a lecturer.[4] In 1913, at Erlangen, Heinrich Scholz took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil. with Richard Falckenberg, studying the work of Schleiermacher and Goethe with a thesis titled: Schleiermacher und Goethe. Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des deutschen Geistes.[5] In 1917 he was appointed to the chair  of Philosophy of Religion at the Breslau succeeding Rudolf Otto to teach religious philosophy and systematic theology. In the same year he married his fianc\u00e9e, Elisabeth Orth. Due to 8 years of continuous gastric trouble, he was exempted from military service. In 1919, he underwent an operation in which he believed to be a large part of his stomach was removed. That year he took the call to Kiel University, as the chair of philosophy. It was while at Kiel, in 1924, that Scholz's first wife, Elisabeth Orth died.[4]/nFrom October 1928 onwards, he taught in M\u00fcnster University, first as Professor of Philosophy. In 1938, this was changed to Professor of Philosophy of Mathematics and Science and again in 1943 to Chair of Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Questions in Mathematics working as head of the Institute for Mathematical Logic and Fundamental Research at M\u00fcnster[6] until he retired in 1952 as professor emeritus.[4]/nScholz was survived by his second wife, Erna.  Scholz grave is located on the Park Cemetery Eichhof near Kiel./nFrom his own account, in 1921, having by accident came across Principia Mathematica by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead he began studying logic, which he had abandoned in his youth to study theology, leading later to a study of mathematics and theoretical physics by taking an undergraduate degree at Kiel.[2]  However another factor in his change of focus was the mathematician Otto Toeplitz.[4] Toeplitz's broad research interests including Hilbert spaces and spectral theory encouraged Scholz interest in mathematics. Indeed, Segal[4][7] suggests that Scholz love of structure was also an important factor in his move into mathematical logic, describing it this:/nScholz's feeling for structure was no small thing. He apparently felt that when having guests for dinner: (1) no more than six people should be invited; (2) there must be an excellent menu; (3) a discussion theme must be planned; and (4) the guests should have prepared themselves as much as possible beforehand on this theme./nIn 1925, he was a peer of Karl Barth at M\u00fcnster University, in which he taught Protestant theology. Under the influence of conversations with Scholz,  Barth later wrote in 1930/31. his book about the Anselm of Canterbury proof of God  \"fides quaerens intellectum.\"/nIn the 1930s, he maintained contact[8][9] with Alan Turing who later \u2013 in a letter home dated 22 February 1937 \u2013 wrote with regard to the reception of his article \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\":[1]/nI have had two letters asking for reprints, one from Braithwaite at King's and one from a proffessor [sic] in Germany... They seemed very much interested in the paper. I think possibly it is making a certain amount of impression. I was disappointed by its reception here. I expected Weyl who had done some work connected quite closely with it some years ago at least to have made a few remarks about it.[10]/nAt the University of M\u00fcnster, his study into mathematical logic and basic research, provided many of the critical insights, that contributed to the foundations of theoretical computer science.[2] Right from the time he arrived at M\u00fcnster, Scholz worked towards building a school of mathematical logic.[4] By 1935, his research team at M\u00fcnster were being referred to as the M\u00fcnster school of mathematical logic.[4] Scholz names 1936, as the year the M\u00fcnster School was born.[3]  His professorship was rededicated in 1936 to a lectureship for mathematical logic and fundamental research  and in 1943 the first chair in Germany for mathematical logic and fundamental research. The M\u00fcnster Chair is still regarded as one of the best in Germany./nScholz was considered a Platonist, and in that sense, he regarded the mathematical logic as the foundation of knowledge. In 1936 he was awarded a grant from the DFG, for the production of three volumes of research in logic and for the editing of the Gottlob Frege papers. He is considered the discoverer of the estate of Gottlob Frege.[11]/nGisbert Hasenjaeger whose thesis had been supervised by Scholtz, produced a book Grundz\u00fcge der mathematischen Logik in 1961 which was jointly authored with Scholz despite being published five years after Scholz's death.[4]/nInitially Scholz was pleased with the rise of Nazi power in Germany. Describing himself a conservative nationalist, describing himself as such \"We felt like Prussians right to the bone,\"\"[3] and described by his friend Heinrich Behnke as a \"small-minded Prussian nationalist\".[4] Behnke found discussing political issues difficult. In the beginning the Nazi laws helped establish M\u00fcnster as an important centre for Logic as other university staff at G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin Universities were being obliterated./nOn 14 March 1940, Scholz sent a letter to the Education department of occupied Poland, seeking the release of Jan Salamucha,[4] who had been professor of theology at Krak\u00f3w University. Salamucha was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1940. In October 1940, Scholz received a reply for the education minister which stated he had \"injured the national honour\" and was forbidden to send further petitions.[12] Salamucha was later released but killed by the Nazis in 1944[4] However, Scholz persisted, first helping Alfred Tarski, who had fled Poland to the United States, to correspond with his wife who remained in Poland and later helping the Polish Logician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, who he had been corresponding since 1928, to leave Poland with his wife and hide in Germany.[4]/nAlthough Scholz recognized the true nature of the Nazis and abhorred them from mid-1942 onwards, he  remained on good terms with Nazi academics like Ludwig Bieberbach.[4] During the period of National Socialism, Max Steck, who championed the German Mathematics which rejected the formalist approach to mathematics, deeply opposed Hilbert's approach which he described as Jewish \u2013 the worst possible insult in Germany at this time.[4] Max Steck acknowledged the \"per se outstanding achievement of formalism\" (\"an sich betrachtet einmaligen Leistung des Formalismus\"), but criticized the \"missing epistemological component\" (\"Jede eigentliche Erkenntnistheorie fehlt im Formalismus\")[13] and on the only page of his main work where he connects formalism and Jews he mentions that \"Jews were the actual trendsetters of formalism\" (\"die eigentlichen Schrittmacher des Formalismus\").[14] In response to this, Bieberbach asked Scholz to write an article for Deutsche Mathematik,  to answer the attacks on mathematical formalism by Steck, which was surprising since Bieberbach led the Nazi mathematicians' attack on Jewish mathematics. Ensuring that Hilbert was not considered \"Jewish\", Scholz wrote \"What does formalised study of the foundations of mathematics aim at?.\"[4][15] Scholz had received funding from Bieberbach as early as 1937, which prompted an annoyed Steck to write in his 1942 book:/nWhat Scholz has understood is doubtless this, to obtain from the German State huge amounts of publication money for this logic production. We fundamentally reject this logic which praises the English empiricists and sensory philosophers such as the Englishmen Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and by now find it really time to speak for once about the \"Great Germans\".[4][16]/nThere were three other articles by Heinrich Scholz in the journal German Mathematics: Ein neuer Vollst\u00e4ndigkeitsbeweis f\u00fcr das reduzierte Fregesche Axiomensystem des Aussagenkalk\u00fcls (1936), a review of the Nazi philosopher Wolfgang Cramer's book Das Problem der reinen Anschauung (1938) and a review of Andreas Speiser's Ein Parmenideskommentar (1938)./nIn the late 2000s, Achim Clausing[17] was tasked with going through the remaining estate of Scholz at M\u00fcnster University, and while going through the archive papers in the basement of the Institute of Computer Science,  Clausing discovered two original prints of the most important publication of Alan Turing, which had been missing since 1945.[18] In this case, the work \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\" from 1936, which Scholz had requested, and a postcard from Turing.  Based on the work by Turing and conversations with Scholz,  Clausing stated \"[it was] the world's first seminar on computer science.\"  The second work, which was a Mind (journal) article,  dates from 1950 and is a treatise on the development of artificial intelligence, Turing provided them with a handwritten comment. This is probably my last copy.[19]   At Sotheby's recently, comparable prints of Turing, with no attached dedication, sold for 180,000 euros.", "9302327": "Amita Ramanujan, Ph.D., is a fictional character from the CBS crime drama Numb3rs, played by Navi Rawat.  Over the course of the series, she has become a professor at CalSci and has since become romantically involved with her former thesis advisor, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz). She was first introduced in \"Pilot\". She also works as an FBI consultant with Charlie and Larry./nDr. Amita Ramanujan is a newly appointed (as of the third season) professor of Indian origin at the California Institute of Science (CalSci). In the first season, she received a doctorate in computational mathematics with Charlie Eppes as her thesis adviser at CalSci, the same institution where she currently holds a faculty position. Because of this association with Charlie, she assists him with various mathematical problems offered through his connection to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and frequently helps him see cases in a new light. She is the best programmer Larry Fleinhardt and Charlie know and is an expert on asymptotic combinatorics. To her surprise, Amita won the 2006 Milton Prize for her dissertation on combinatorics, which Charlie, a previous recipient, presented to her. She decided to use the prize money to fund a trip to India with her grandmother in an attempt to become attuned with her heritage and help with the education costs of two Indian girls she met through one of Don's cases. In season five, she puts her skills to use on a new artificial intelligence, but is nearly killed./nAt the close of season one, in which she had completed her graduate work under the supervision of Charlie, she decided to pursue a second doctoral degree in astrophysics at CalSci with a new thesis adviser, Dr. Kepler. When Dr. Kepler became ill, she taught his course on the structure and dynamics of galaxies. She has also given a solar physics presentation. Amita is currently doing research with Dr. Mildred Finch, the new Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division and an experimental neutrino astrophysicist; Dr. Finch put her on tenure track and appointed her chair of the curriculum committee. She also works with Larry Fleinhardt on the D\u00d8 experiment search for the Higgs boson./nShe and Charlie have had a romantic relationship of sorts throughout the series. The relationship suffered several false starts in season 2. In season 3, the relationship seems to have stabilized. One obstacle to the relationship was Charlie's long-time obtuseness with regard to Amita's interests in him, a fact upon which she commented early in season 2. Her interest in Charlie wouldn't be so compounded if only he could not see everything in the world in mathematical categories. On the other hand, she deeply admires his work, and is filled with awe after touching a chalkboard full of his elegant equations. In Season 2, after Charlie became concerned with her association with Dr. Penfield, she stated she had no time for a serious relationship because of her graduate work on astrophysics. She assured Charlie that her interest in Penfield was only of the intellectual nature./nAt times, she has felt that her work has been subsumed by Charlie's research. Amita's professional career further created a conflict for her following an offer for a three-year assistant professorship at Harvard University. At the close of season two, she had not decided if she would accept the position, or remain in California and apply for a similar position through CalSci. With the start of season three, she decided to take the CalSci position and kindle a romance with Charlie. However, Amita said that it would be arrogant for Charlie to think that she only stayed for him./nShe is having problems accepting her role as a professor, especially in the view that she was a student only recently at the same university where she now holds a faculty position. Dr. Larry Fleinhardt advised her in recreating her image of herself, for only then would other professors accept her as a colleague. Dr. Finch said harsh words to Amita about her needing to act like a professor and be more than Charlie's assistant and even stated that she dresses like a kid. Mildred disapproved of her dating her former thesis adviser. This caused her to doubt her relationship with Charlie, but he took it to the next step in kissing her in his garage and she did not hesitate. When Dr. Finch saw this, Charlie and Amita were temporarily shocked. In \"End of Watch\", she nearly quit chairing the curriculum committee, as their colleagues remarked on their relationship./nAmita understood Charlie's sentiments over Larry's leave of absence to the International Space Station and could discern that Eppes had never been in a situation where he was not able to get what he wanted. In \"Killer Chat\", she stated that she could distinguish between \"Professor Eppes\" and \"Charlie Eppes\". Megan Reeves said it was nice that she worked well with Charlie. Also, the two women were proud to see Charlie help Larry accomplish his dream./nThough she said she loves Charlie, Amita did not want him to meet her father, as Mr. Ramanujan always had the expectation that she would only date men born in India. She joked that it would be fine once Charlie won the Fields Medal, which she believes he has the potential to earn. Despite this concern, Charlie has asked her to move in with him, and she is agreeable to the plan. Charlie's ideal situation would be for them to live together in his house and his father to move into a condo; however, the details of the arrangement are yet to be determined. When Charlie finally meets Amita's parents, Tapti and Sanjay Ramanujan, they are very rude to him, dismissing him, at times completely ignoring him, and talking about another man for their daughter. Eventually, though, they warm to Charlie and accept him./nIn the season 5 finale, \"Angels and Devils\", Charlie proposes to Amita at the end of the episode after she had been kidnapped at gunpoint in front of him by the leader of a cult.  After Don and the rest of team get her home safely, Charlie proposes to her saying that he has learned this past year (5th season) that life turns on a dime and he doesn't want the things that matter (Amita) to disappear because he waited to see what could happen. Her response is not heard as the episode ends, but it is implied in the first episode of season 6, Charlie and Amita announce to Alan and Don, Charlie's father and brother, that they have decided to get married.  Amita and Charlie attempt to find a wedding date that fits them and their families' schedules, finally accepting Alan's suggestion of using his and Margaret's anniversary date as Amita and Charlie's wedding date./nAs mentioned in the Season 6 episode, \"Hydra\", Amita would like to have three children with Charlie. They later admit that they are far too busy for children at this point in their lives, however./nAmita was born in California and her family was from South India, speaking Tamil. She mentioned in the pilot episode an arranged marriage (she described her would-be fianc\u00e9, a banker from Goa, as \"a total ass\") but it was unclear if she was serious or teasing Charlie and Alan. It is later revealed in \"Pay To Play\" that the Banker from Goa has married someone else./nAs revealed in \"Tabu\", she built her first computer at the age of 13.  Series writer Sean Crouch wrote \u201cFirst Law\u201d to explain Amita's interest in computers.[1]/nAmita has been a player of a MMORPG game called \"Primacy\" since she was an undergraduate (age 19), which allowed her to provide unique insights into a case involving a murderer who was a jealous gamer./nThe character of Amita Ramanujan was in the original pilot as an MIT graduate student.[2] Navi Rawat was cast in the role of Amita.[2]  Due to her commitment to North Shore, writers and producers were uncertain whether Rawat would return to Numb3rs.[3]  Rawat's character on North Shore got cut before the pilot even aired, enabling her to return to Numb3rs as a guest star during the first season.[4]  She became a regular during season two.[5]/nThe last name of the character is taken directly from the celebrated Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, whose impact on the mathematical field has been enormous. There is even a mathematical journal, The Ramanujan Journal, dedicated solely to the discoveries made by Ramanujan.

Later he became an assistant at the Gotha Observatory and studied under Franz Xaver von Zach.  On von Zach's recommendation he joined the observatory of the \u00c9cole militaire in Paris, then directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande.

Burckhardt's lunar tables appear to have been the first to be based on a least squares adjustment of the coefficients to selected lunar observations, of which about 4000 were used; and a committee of the Bureau des Longitudes (consisting of Laplace, Delambre, Bouvard, Arago and Poisson) concluded after an early form of sum-of-squares analysis that Burckhardt's tables improved on those of B\u00fcrg.[4]  Accordingly, they enjoyed for some decades a substantial reputation as the most accurate available.  They were officially used for computing the lunar ephemerides in the Nautical Almanac from 1821 to 1861 (but they were superseded in part, as from 1856, for computing the lunar horizontal parallax, by improved tables due to J C Adams).

Le\u015bniewski was also a radical nominalist: he rejected axiomatic set theory at a time when that theory was in full flower.

De Witt was elected Grand pensionary of Holland, and together with his uncle Cornelis de Graeff,[1] he controlled the Dutch political system from around 1650 until the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) of 1672.[2] This progressive cooperation between the two statesmen, and the consequent support of Amsterdam under the rule of De Graeff,[3] was an important political axis that organized the political system within the republic.[4]/nAs a leading republican of the Dutch States Party, De Witt opposed the House of Orange-Nassau and the Orangists and preferred a shift of power from the central government to the regenten. However, his neglect of the Dutch States Army (as the regents focused mainly on the navy, thinking they could avoid land wars) proved disastrous when the Dutch Republic suffered numerous early defeats in the Rampjaar. In the hysteria that followed the effortless invasion by an alliance of England, France and some German states he and his brother Cornelis de Witt were blamed and lynched in The Hague, with their corpses at least partially eaten by the rioters.[5][6] These cannibals were never prosecuted,[6] and some historians claim William of Orange may have incited them.[5]/nJohan de Witt was a member of the old Dutch De Witt family. His father was Jacob de Witt, an influential regent from the patrician class in the city of Dordrecht, which in the seventeenth century was one of the most important cities of the dominating province of Holland. De Witt's mother was Anna van den Corput (1599\u20131645), niece of Johannes Corputius, an influential Dutch military leader and cartographer.[9] Johan had an older brother, Cornelis de Witt, who had a steep career in the shadow of Johan de Witt. His uncle Andries de Witt held the position of Grand Pensionary of Holland between 1619 and 1621. Through the marriage of one of his other uncles to Margaretha of Nassau, daughter of Anna Johanna of Nassau-Siegen, De Witt was a distant relative of the later Dutch governor and English King William III of Orange-Nassau.[10] Another relationship connected him to the Tromps, Maarten and his son Cornelis Tromp, both admirals of the Netherlands.[11]/nJohan and his older brother Cornelis grew up in a privileged environment in terms of education, his father having as good acquaintances important scholars and scientists, such as Isaac Beeckman, Jacob Cats, Gerardus Vossius, and Andreas Colvius. Johan and Cornelis both attended the Latin school in Dordrecht, which imbued them with the values of the Roman Republic. After attending the Latin school in Dordrecht, Johan de Witt studied at the Leiden University, where he excelled at mathematics and law. He received his doctorate from the University of Angers in 1645. He practiced law in The Hague as an associate with the firm of Frans van Schooten./nIn 1655 Johan de Witt married Wendela Bicker, daughter of Johan Bicker and Agneta de Graeff van Polsbroek,[12] who belonged to the inner circle of the powerful Amsterdam oligarchy. Through his mariage De Witt became a relative of the ruling patrician families Bicker, De Graeff, Hooft, Witsen, Boelens Loen, and Reynst among others. His brothers-in-law also included Amsterdam patrician Pieter de Graeff (who was also his full cousin), high official Gerard Bicker (I) van Swieten, arms dealer Jacob Trip and banker and financier Jean Deutz, all important and loyal political allies of De Witt. Frans Banninck Cocq (captain of Rembrandt's famous painting The Night Watch) became his uncle-in-law and Joachim Irgens von Westervick (between 1666 and 1675 owner of the private Irgens Estate, which was a huge part of Northern Norway) his cousin-in-law as well. Johan and Wendela had four children, three daughters and one son:[13]/nAfter De Witt's death, Pieter de Graeff, husband of his wife Wendela's younger sister Jacoba Bicker, became the guardian of his children.[14]/nIn 1650 (the year that stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange died) he was appointed leader of the deputation of Dordrecht to the States of Holland and West Friesland. In December 1650, De Witt became the pensionary of Dordrecht as succeesor of Nicolaas Ruys. In 1652, at the age of 27, De Witt was faced with a mob of angry demonstrators of sailors and fishermen in the city of Vlissingen.[15] He held this position until July 1653 and was succeeded by Govert van Slingelandt,[16] a distant relative of his./nIn July 1653, the States of Holland elected De Witt Grand Pensionary. In making the appointment, De Witt relied on the express consent of Amsterdam headed by burgomaster and regent Cornelis de Graeff. The States of Holland chose him with the express intercession of his later uncle De Graeff.[17][3] Since Holland was the Republic's most powerful province, he was effectively the political leader of the United Provinces as a whole\u00a0\u2013 especially during periods when no stadholder had been elected by the States of most Provinces. The raadpensionaris of Holland was often referred to as the Grand Pensionary by foreigners as he represented the preponderant province in the Union of the Dutch Republic. He led the States of province by his experience, tenure, familiarity with the issues, and use of the staff at his disposal. He was in no manner equivalent to a modern Prime Minister.[18][19]/nRepresenting the province of Holland, De Witt tended to identify with the economic interests of the shipping and trading interests in the United Provinces. These interests were largely concentrated in the province of Holland, and to a lesser degree in the province of Zeeland.[20]/nAs leader of the state-oriented party, Johan de Witt pursued the interests of the Dutch patricians and merchants. He had his most important goals formulated in 1662 by his like-minded Pieter de la Court in the book The Interest of Holland. They were:[21]/nAt the height of the Dutch Golden Age, the First Stadtholderless Period from 1650 to 1672, political power within Holland rested primarily with two pro-state minded, republican, families. At Amsterdam this lay with the brothers Cornelis and Andries de Graeff, and at The Hague with the brothers Johan and Cornelis de Witt, leaders of the pro-state (republican) faction of Holland, reinforced by their close collaboration and mutual kinship.[22]/nDomestically, Johan de Witt relied on political cooperation with the Dutch cities, and above all with Amsterdam. In doing so, De Witt recognized the political power of his uncle burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, and did his best to accommodate Amsterdam's wishes. De Witt needed his political advice, the support of the Amsterdam government under De Graeff and his clientele, but he also enjoyed his clear mind and humane frankness. De Graeff combined a clear mind, extensive education and the ability to give and take. In one respect, however, he differed from his uncle, for although De Witt was a supporter of liberty like him, in contrast to him he clung to the extreme, which was to prove to be a fatal error in the Rampjaar 1672.[23] The relationship between these two distinct characters was a combination of close kinship and mutual respect. De Graeff was a political equal to De Witt like no other.[24][25] From then on, De Graeff was at his side as an experienced and trusted councilman. De Witt's letters to De Graeff testify to the great trust that the nephew had in his uncle in political and family matters[17] (a short exchange of letters from the year 1660 bears witness to this[26]). That didn't rule out a fight between the two. Nevertheless, the relationship remained excellent. De Witt understood the remark of Cornelis de Vlaming van Oudshoorn, another Amsterdam burgomaster, dat zonder den heer van Zuidpolsbroek [De Graeff] in niets iets te doen was (that without the Lord of Zuid-Polsbroek nothing could be done anywhere).[27]/nDe Witt's power base was the wealthy merchant and patrician class into which he was born. This class broadly coincided politically with the \"States faction\", stressing Protestant religious moderation and pragmatic foreign policy defending commercial interests. The \"Orange faction\", consisting of the middle class, preferred a strong leader from the Dutch House of Orange as a counterweight against the rich upper-classes in economic and religious matters. Although leaders that did emerge from the House of Orange rarely were strict Calvinists themselves, they tended to identify with Calvinism,[28] which was popular among the middle classes in the United Provinces during this time. William II of Orange was a prime example of this tendency among the leaders of the House of Orange to support Calvinism. William II was elected stadholder in 1647, and continued to serve until his death in November 1650.[29] Eight days after his death, William II's wife delivered a male heir\u00a0\u2013 William III of Orange. Many citizens of the United Provinces urged the election of the infant William III as stadholder under a regency until he came of age. However, the Provinces, under the dominance of the province of Holland[30] did not fill the office of stadholder./nWhen Johan de Witt became de facto leader of the Dutch Republic in 1653, the state was at war with England during the First Anglo-Dutch War. The superior English navy blocked the Dutch ports, which had triggered a severe economic crisis. De Witt's priority was therefore a speedy peace agreement with England. The English Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell demanded as a condition that the Princes of Orange should be permanently excluded from power in the Netherlands. Cromwell's motive was that the Orangens supported his opponents, the Stuart royal family. De Witt knew that the other six Dutch provinces would not agree to such a dictate. But that changed the exemplary collaboration between De Witt and his influential later uncle Cornelis de Graeff, which was an important factor in the success of De Witt's policies and the revival of economic progress after the First Anglo-Dutch War. Together with his De Graeff, De Witt brought about peace with England after the First Anglo-Dutch War with the Treaty of Westminster in May 1654.[31][32] As a result of the positive course of the war for the Netherlands, the Dutch leadership around De Witt, De Graeff, the army commander Johann Wolfart van Brederode and Lieutenant Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam urged the Dutch States General to position themselves as a whole behind the secret Act of Seclusion, which would exclude the young William III from the office of stadtholder.[33] This resolution was drafted by De Graeff in collaboration with De Witt and diplomat Hieronymus van Beverningh.[17]/nIn the period following the Treaty of Westminster, the Republic grew in wealth and influence under De Witt's leadership. In the years that followed, he consistently pursued the commercial interests of his country. In 1658/59 he sent large naval forces to the Baltic Sea to support Denmark against Sweden in the Second Northern War and to ensure free passage for Dutch merchant ships through the \u00d8resund. De Witt created a strong navy, appointing one of his political allies, Lieutenant Admiral Van Wassenaer Obdam, as supreme commander of the confederate fleet.[34] In these turbulent times of the first governorless period, his trusted councilman, Coenraad van Beuningen, had been a great support to him. One of his brothers-in-law, Jean Deutz, was a trusted advisor on economic matters[35] and financed the wars of the republic under his brother-in-law De Witt.[36]/nDespite all these quick political successes, De Witt always presented himself to the outside world as a humble civil servant who walked the streets of The Hague without an escort and with only one servant. According to the English ambassador Sir William Temple, he was outwardly \"indistinguishable from the common man\". He himself always emphasized that he had \"no decisive vote, authority or power\" in the Assembly of States of Holland. But the French ambassador reported to Paris that power in the Netherlands rested with \"Monsieur de Witt\".[37]/nIn 1657, De Witt and De Graeff mediated the \"Treaty of Raalte\", in which William III passed the stadholdership of Overijssel.[38]/nOn 25 September 1660, the States of Holland under the prime movers of De Witt, De Graeff, his younger brother Andries de Graeff, along with Gillis Valckenier, resolved to take charge of William's education to ensure he would acquire the skills to serve in a future \u2013 although undetermined \u2013 state function.[39] Influenced by the values of the Roman republic, De Witt did his utmost anyway to prevent any member of the House of Orange from gaining power, convincing many provinces to abolish the stadtholderate entirely. He bolstered his policy by publicly endorsing the theory of republicanism. He allegedly contributed personally to the Interest of Holland, a radical republican textbook published in 1662, by his supporter Pieter de la Court.[40] As a result, De Witt attracted the hatred of all supporters of the Oranges, who were mainly found among the common people./nAfter the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, the monarchy was restored in England in 1660 and the Stuarts in Person of Charles II returned to power. This further deteriorated relations between the two maritime and trading powers, and five years later the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665\u20131667) broke out. De Witt reformed the Dutch naval forces by building larger and more heavily armed warships based on the English model. After an initial defeat at the Battle of Lowestoft, he temporarily took command of the fleet himself. As a remedy for his seasickness, Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock, developed a special hammock that did not rock. At the end of 1665 Michiel de Ruyter took over command of the fleet at De Witt's instigation. Further fighting in 1666, the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London caused economic difficulties in England. In 1667 England was unable to equip a new fleet. De Witt took advantage of this situation by having the Dutch fleet sail up the Medway, a tributary of the Thames, under the command of his brother Cornelis de Witt. At Chatham, the Dutch destroyed most of the English warships anchored there (see Medway raid). The cannon fire was heard in London, causing panic to break out there. England was then ready for peace negotiations, in which De Witt was involved. The peace between the two states was sealed in 1667 with the Peace of Breda.[citation needed]/nIn 1667, with the support of Gaspar Fagel, Gillis Valckenier and his uncle Andries de Graeff, De Witt issued the Perpetual Edict, which abolished the governorship and thus the final overthrow of the House of Orange.[41][42] and the incompatibility of a stadtholdership with the Captain Generalship of the Republic of the United Netherlands.[43]/nTo resist the English trade rival, the States army was greatly neglected. This was not without danger because French politics at that time was characterized by unbridled expansionism, which was reinforced by the formidable economic competition of the Dutch Republic. Johan de Witt tried to guarantee the safety of the Republic with a pro-French policy, but did not want to agree with King Louis XIV's plan to divide the Spanish Netherlands. He preferred a Spanish-administered buffer zone on the southern border of the Republic to a border with powerful France./nThe Triple Alliance was concluded on 23 January 1668 with England and Sweden. It stipulated that the three countries would support each other militarily if France attacked one of them. De Witt nevertheless did not want a break with Louis XIV. It was therefore agreed to urge Spain to cede a number of cities in the Spanish Netherlands to him. Only if Louis XIV rejected this and prolonged the War of Devolution to take control of the whole area would the three countries take military force against France.[44] Especially at De Witt's request, that last appointment was included in a secret clause because he did not want to offend the French. What De Witt did not know was that Charles II had only entered into the treaty to sever all Dutch-French ties for good. A month after its conclusion, he divulged the details of the secret clause to Louis XIV, who then \u2013 eager for revenge \u2013 concluded the secret Treaty of Dover with the English, stipulating that the Dutch Republic would be attacked jointly.[45]/nDuring 1672, which the Dutch refer to as the disaster year, France and England attacked the Republic in the Franco-Dutch War. De Witt was severely wounded by a knife-wielding assassin on 21 June. He resigned as Grand Pensionary on 4 August, but this was not enough for his enemies. His brother Cornelis (who was deputy-in-the-field for de Ruyter at the Raid on the Medway), particularly hated by the Orangists, was arrested on trumped-up charges of treason. He was tortured (as was usual under Roman-Dutch law, which required a confession before a conviction was possible) but refused to confess. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to exile. When his brother went over to the jail (which was only a few steps from his house) to help him get started on his journey, both were attacked by members of The Hague's civic militia. The brothers were shot and then left to the mob. Their naked, mutilated bodies were strung up on the nearby public gibbet, while the Orangist mob ate their roasted livers in a cannibalistic frenzy. Throughout it all, a remarkable discipline was maintained by the mob, according to contemporary observers, lending doubt as to the spontaneity of the event.[46]/nDe Witt had in effect ruled the Republic for almost 20 years. His regime outlasted him only a few more days. Though no more people were killed, the lynching of the De Witts lent renewed impetus to the mob attacks, and to help restore public order the States of Holland empowered William on 27 August to purge the city councils in any way he would see fit to restore public order. The following purges in the early days of September were accompanied by large, but peaceful, Orangist demonstrations, that had a remarkable political character. The demonstrations delivered petitions that demanded certain additional reforms with a, in a sense, \"reactionary\" flavour: the \"ancient\" privileges of the guilds and civic militias\u00a0\u2013 who were traditionally seen as mouthpieces of the citizenry as a whole\u00a0\u2013 to curb the regent's powers were to be recognised again (as in pre-Burgundian times). The demonstrators also demanded more influence of the Calvinist preachers on the content of government policies and a roll-back of the toleration of Catholics and other dissenting denominations. The purges of the city governments were not everywhere equally thoroughgoing (and, of course, there was little mention of popular influence later on, as the new regents shared the abhorrence of the old ones of real democratic reforms). But as a whole, the new Orangist regime of the Stadtholder was well-entrenched during his following reign.[47]/nWhether William had a hand in the murder of the de Witt brothers remains unanswered, like his exact role in the later Massacre of Glencoe. That he ordered the withdrawal of a federal cavalry detachment that otherwise might have prevented the lynching has always raised eyebrows. He did not prosecute the well-known ringleaders like Johan van Banchem, Cornelis Tromp, and Johan Kievit, even advancing their careers. In any case, the political turmoil did not enable the allies an opportunity to finish the Republic off. The French were effectively stymied by the water defenses. Only when the inundations froze over in the following winter was there, briefly, a chance for Marshal Luxembourg, who had taken over command of the invading army from Louis, to make an incursion with 10,000 troops on skates. This almost ended in disaster, when they were ambushed. Meanwhile, the States General managed to conclude alliances with the German emperor and Brandenburg, which helped relieve the French pressure in the East.[48]/nThe kinematic description of ellipses dates from Archimedes and Proclus, as well as the contemporary Claude Mydorge. Johan de Witt describes the hyperbola with a rotating line and a sliding angle, and a parabola by means of a rotating angle and sliding line. In 1661, de Witt's work appeared in the second volume of von Schooten's Latin translation of La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie. Elementa Curvarum Linearum has been described as the first textbook in analytic geometry.[49]/nDe Witt contributed to financial mathematics: The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds. This work combined his roles as statesman and as mathematician, and was discussed in the correspondence between Leibniz and Bernoulli concerning the use of probabilities. Ever since the Middle Ages, a life annuity was a way to obtain a regular income from a reliable source. The state, for instance, could provide a widow with a regular income until her death, in exchange for a 'lump sum' up front. There were also redemption bonds that were more like a regular state loan. De Witt showed that for the same principal a bond paying 4% interest would result in the same profit as a life annuity of 6% (1 in 17). But the 'Staten' at the time were paying over 7% (1 in 14). The publication about life annuities is \"one of the first applications of probability in economics.\"[49]:\u200a1", "47640968": "Joan Rand Moschovakis is a logician and mathematician focusing on intuitionistic logic and mathematics.

They also said:/nOur main dissatisfaction concerned some of the practices the United States uses in gathering intelligence information ... deliberately violating the airspace of other nations ... intercepting and deciphering the secret communications of its own allies\u00a0.../nPerhaps United States hostility towards Communism arises out of a feeling of insecurity engendered by Communist achievements in science, culture and industry./nAs we know from our previous experience working at N.S.A., the United States successfully reads the secure communications of more than forty nations, including its own allies./nThey particularly attacked the views of General Thomas S. Power who had recently told a Congressional committee that the U.S. needed to maintain a nuclear first-strike capability and Senator Barry Goldwater's opposition to banning nuclear tests and negotiating a disarmament treaty. By contrast, they said: \"we would attempt to crawl to the moon if we thought it would lessen the threat of an atomic war.\" The U.S. had recently admitted sending reconnaissance flights over foreign countries in recent years, but Martin and Mitchell said they knew from their Navy service that such flights had occurred as early as 1952\u20131954. They detailed a U.S. C-130 flight over Soviet Armenia that the Soviets brought down. They contended that it was designed to gain an understanding of Soviet defenses, and that it therefore represented an American interest in attacking the Soviets rather than defending against them. They also complained of restrictions on freedom in the U.S., such as government confiscation of mail, particularly the freedom of those who are \"not theists\" or \"whose political convictions are unpopular\".[12][13] In an interview with the Soviet news agency Tass in December 1960, they expressed their belief that American espionage against Russia, U.S. allies, and neutral nations would continue unchanged despite the inauguration of a new American president in January 1961.[14]/nIn response, the American government called Mitchell and Martin's charges \"completely false\". The Department of Defense called them \"turncoats\" and \"tools of Soviet propaganda\", \"one mentally sick and both obviously confused\". It also characterized their positions at the NSA as \"junior mathematicians\"./nThe New York Times described them as \"long-time bachelor friends\" and reported they smiled at each other only when they described the social advantages they anticipated in the Soviet Union, where, their prepared statement said: \"The talents of women are encouraged and utilized to a much greater extent in the Soviet Union than in the United States. We feel that this enriches Soviet society and makes Soviet women more desirable as mates.\"[15]/nThe issue of the pair's sexuality was raised and dismissed by the government: \"Representative Francis E. Walter, Democrat of Pennsylvania [and chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee], denied that he had made an allegation, reported by a news agency, that one of the men had been described as a homosexual in a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\"[16] A Pentagon spokesman told reporters that there was nothing in Mitchell and Martin's personnel records to suggest homosexuality or sexual perversion.[17] The next day, Congressman Walter explicitly stated that a source he trusted had told him that the two defectors were \"known to their acquaintances as 'sex deviates'\".[7] That charge was promptly picked up by the press and resulted immediately in stories about homosexuals recruiting \"other sexual deviates\" for jobs in the federal government. Hearst newspapers referred to Martin and Mitchell as \"two defecting blackmailed homosexual specialists\" and a \"love team\".[3] Time reported that a review of security checks turned up a Mitchell visit to a psychiatrist \"presumably out of concern for homosexual tendencies\".[18]/nAccording to a later government report, Martin\u2014who was fluent in Russian\u2014studied at Leningrad University (now Saint Petersburg State University), and used the name Vladimir Sokolodsky. He married a Soviet citizen whom he divorced in 1963. He later told a Russian newspaper that his defection had been \"foolhardy\". He also expressed disappointment that the Russians did not trust him with important work. He occasionally sought the help of American visitors in arranging for repatriation, including Donald Duffy, vice president of the Kaiser Foundation, and bandleader Benny Goodman. On another occasion he told an American that before defecting he had believed the vision of Russia presented by propaganda publications like USSR and Soviet Life. By 1975, a source told the U.S. government Martin was \"totally on the skids.\" In 1979, he inquired at the American consulate about repatriation. As a result, his case was examined and he was stripped of his American citizenship. He was next denied permission to immigrate to the U.S. and then denied a tourist visa. Martin eventually left the Soviet Union and died of cancer in Mexico on January 17, 1987, at Tijuana's Hospital Del Mar. He was buried in the U.S.[1][19][b]/nLess is known of Mitchell. Having renounced his U.S. citizenship, he remained in the Soviet Union. He married Galina Vladimirovna Yakovleva, a member of the piano department faculty at the Leningrad Conservatory.[21] He became an alcoholic and regretted his decision to defect.[22] Mitchell died of a heart attack in November 2001, and was buried in St. Petersburg.[1]/nThe defections had another life inside the U.S. intelligence community. At a meeting of the National Security Council in October 1960, officials considered a response to the Martin-Mitchell affair. Attorney General William P. Rogers believed that the Soviets had a list of homosexuals to use in their recruiting and blackmail efforts, that Martin and Mitchell were part of \"an organized group\". Several at the meeting thought polygraph tests would help prevent the hiring of homosexuals. President Eisenhower himself wanted a central authority to coordinate all government lists of homosexuals.[3]/nIn order to prevent another occurrence, the NSA needed to understand what motivated the defectors. Their initial investigation turned up little of interest. Notes of psychological counseling sessions from the 1940s described Martin as \"brilliant but emotionally immature\" and offered a diagnosis of \"beginning character neurosis with schizoid tendencies\" and mentioned he was likely \"sadistic\".  Mitchell had told the NSA when questioned not long after starting work at the Agency that he had experimented sexually as a teenager with dogs and chickens.[1][23] The immediate NSA response focused on sexual issues. In July 1961 the Agency announced that it had purged 26 employees it identified as \"sexual deviates\" though it added the qualification that \"not all were homosexuals\".[24]/nYet a series of NSA investigations gave little credit to the role of sexuality in Mitchell and Martin's defection. In 1961, an NSA report called them \"close friends and somewhat anti-social\", \"egotistical, arrogant and insecure young men whose place in society was much lower than they believed they deserved\", with \"greatly inflated opinions concerning their intellectual attainments and talents\". In 1963, another NSA report found \"no clear motive\", that they had not been recruited by foreigners, and termed the defection \"impulsive\".[c] NSA files obtained by journalists at the Seattle Weekly in 2007 cited definitive testimony on the part of women acquaintances who attested to their heterosexuality. The only perversions recorded were Martin's \"all-controlling sadomasochism\". He had occasionally watched women having sex or had sex himself with multiple female partners.[1]/nIn 1962, Congressman Walters' House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) concluded its 13-month investigation and issued a report on the defections. Where Mitchell had told his psychiatrist that he had affairs with both men and women and was not troubled about his sexual identity,[26] the report referred to his \"homosexual problems\".[27] The report never identified a rationale for the Mitchell and Martin defections, but focused on the inadequacy of the investigations that granted them security clearances despite evidence of \"homosexuality or other sexual abnormality\", atheism, and Communist sympathies on the part of one or both of the men.[28] The report made a series of recommendations with respect to NSA hiring practices and security investigations that were promptly adopted by the Agency.[29]/nLater government analyses went beyond the characterizations in the HUAC account, unaware of the NSA's unpublished analysis. Despite the contrary evidence, a 1991 study by the Pentagon's Defense Security Service\u2014still in use in 2007\u2014called Martin and Mitchell \"publicly known homosexuals\".[1]", "30470545": "Noah Bridges (fl. 1661), was a stenographer and mathematician./nBridges was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and acted as clerk of the parliament which sat in that city in 1643 and 1644.

He was elected a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1973./nLike his namesake Srinivasa Ramanujan, Ramanujam also had a very short life.[1]/nAs David Mumford put it, Ramanujam felt that the spirit of mathematics demanded of him not merely routine developments but the right theorem on any given topic. \"He wanted mathematics to be beautiful and to be clear and simple. He was sometimes tormented by the difficulty of these high standards, but in retrospect, it is clear to us how often he succeeded in adding to our knowledge, results both new, beautiful and with a genuinely original stamp\".[2]/nRamanujam was born to a Tamil family on 9 January 1938 in Madras (now Chennai), India, as the eldest of seven, to Chakravarthi Srinivasa Padmanabhan. He finished his schooling in Town Higher Secondary School, Kumbakonam and joined Loyola College in Madras in 1952. He wanted to specialise in mathematics and he set out to master it with vigour and passion. He also enjoyed music and his favourite musician was M. D. Ramanathan, a maverick concert musician. His teacher and friend at this time was Father (Fr.) Charles Racine (1897-1976), Loyola College a missionary who had obtained his doctorate under the supervision of \u00c9lie Cartan. He had been taught mathematics by Father Charles Racine in his final honours years at Loyola College and he encouraged Ramanujam to apply for entry to the School of Mathematics at the Tata Institute in Bombay. In his letter of recommendation Father Charles Racine wrote:-/n\"He has certainly originality of mind and the type of curiosity which is likely to suggest that he will develop into a good research worker if given sufficient opportunity.\"/nWith Father Charles Racine's encouragement and recommendation, Ramanujam applied and was admitted to the graduate school at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay. His father had wanted him to join the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta as he had passed the entrance exam meritoriously.[3]/nRamanujam set out for Mumbai at the age of eighteen to pursue his interest in mathematics. He and his friend and schoolmate Raghavan Narasimhan, and S. Ramanan joined TIFR together in 1957. At the Tata Institute there was a stream of first-rate visiting mathematicians from all over the world. It was a tradition for some graduate student to write up the notes of each course of lectures. Accordingly, Ramanujam wrote up in his first year, the notes of Max Deuring's lectures on Algebraic functions of one variable. It was a nontrivial effort and the notes were written clearly and were well received. The analytical mind was much in evidence in this effort as he could simplify and extend the notes within a short time period. \"He could reduce difficult solutions to be simple and elegant due to his deep knowledge of the subject matter\" states Ramanan. \"Max Deuring's lectures gave him a taste for algebraic number theory. He studied not only algebraic geometry and analytic number theory of which he displayed a deep knowledge but he became an expert in several other allied subjects as well\"./nOn the suggestion of his doctoral advisor, K. G. Ramanathan, he began working on a problem relating to the work of the German number theorist Carl Ludwig Siegel. In the course of proving the main result to the effect that every cubic form in 54 variables over any algebraic number field K had a non-trivial zero over that field, he had also simplified the earlier method of Siegel. He took up Waring's problem in algebraic number fields and got interesting results. In recognition of his work and his contribution to Number Theory, the Institute promoted him to associate professor. He protested against this promotion as 'undeserved', and had to be persuaded to accept the position. He proceeded to write his thesis in 1966 and took his doctoral examination in 1967. Dr. Siegel, who was one of the examiners, was highly impressed with the young man's depth of knowledge and his great mathematical abilities./nRamanujam was a scribe for Igor Shafarevich's course of lectures in 1965 on minimal models and birational transformation of two-dimensional schemes. Professor Shafarevich subsequently wrote to say that Ramanujam not only corrected his mistakes but complemented the proofs of many results. The same was the case with Mumford's lectures on abelian varieties, which were delivered at TIFR around 1967. Mumford wrote in the preface to his book that the notes improved upon his work and that his current work on abelian varieties was a joint effort between him and Ramanujam. A little-known fact is that during this time he started teaching himself German, Italian, Russian and French so that he could study mathematical works in their original form. His personal library contained quite a few non-English mathematical works./nBetween 1964 and 1968, he was making great strides in number theory and his contacts with Shafarevich and Mumford led him on to algebraic geometry. According to Ramanathan and other colleagues, his progress and deep understanding of algebraic geometry was phenomenal. In 1964, based on his participation in the International Colloquium on Differential Analysis, he earned the respect of Alexander Grothendieck and of David Mumford, who invited him to Paris and Harvard. He accepted the invitation and was in Paris, but for a brief period. He was diagnosed in 1964 with schizophrenia with severe depression and left Paris for Chennai. He later decided to quit his position at TIFR./nHe quit his post at Mumbai in 1965 after a bout of illness and secured a tenured position as a professor in Chandigarh, Punjab. There he met the young student Chitikila Musili, who later went on to prove interesting results in the geometry connected with the theory of Lie groups and wrote good expository books. Ramanujam stayed in Chandigarh only eight months and he had to return to Chennai again for treatment. TIFR was his real home and he was back there again in June 1965. Around this time he accepted an invitation from Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, near Paris. He was barely there before he was flown back to Chennai. Unfortunately schizophrenia, a highly treatable condition today, was not properly diagnosed and treated at that time. Thus he continued until the end of his life to be highly creative for short periods before the recurrent illness overtook him. Again, in 1970, he sent his resignation letter to TIFR but the institute would not take it seriously. Around this time, Mumford invited him to Warwick as a visiting professor during the algebraic geometry year. Mumford writes that he spent many delightful evenings with Ramanujam and that his presence contributed importantly to the success of the algebraic geometry year. A famous paper written during this time, by Michael Artin and David Mumford acknowledges Ramanujam's suggestions and help. He also had a short tenure at Turin where he was widely appreciated and accepted. Just after his death a commemorative hall was named after him in the former Istituto di Matematica (Institute of Mathematics) of the university of Genoa./nBack in India after his year at the University of Warwick, Ramanujam requested for a professorship at the Tata Institute but to be made tenable in their Bangalore campus. The Tata Institute had an applied mathematics wing in Bangalore. Although Ramanjuam had nothing to do with this area, the Institute, wishing him to continue his research, made a special arrangement by which he could stay and work there. By this time, he was deeply affected and depressed by his illness. He was put in charge of a new branch dealing with applied mathematics. He settled down in Bangalore, but again in the depths of depression caused by his illness, he tried to leave the Institute and obtain a university teaching post. During one of the attacks, he tried to take his life, but was rescued in time. However, late one evening on 27 October 1974, after a lively discussion with a visiting foreign professor he took his life with an overdose of barbiturates.", "63041971": "Stephan Ramon Garcia is an American mathematician.

Inspired by the pionneering works of Louis Guttman and Chikio Hayashi as well as by the distributional methodology of Zellig Harris, he devised a geometric equivalence to these approaches by searching the principal axes of inertia of a weighted cloud of points. These algorithms were the primary building blocks of a method which he later called \"Correspondence analysis\". Developing correspondence analysis with the systematic supplement of clustering techniques, his interest went to analysing both large contingency and binary tables and some other kinds of data arrays after suitable transformation including lexical tables derived from raw texts.[5]/nFavouring induction over hypothesis testing, much of his approach lies in describing and understanding how a multidimensional dataset diverges from the hypothesis of independence of its rows and columns through the interpretation of patterns often revealed by point cloud graphic displays. But he was also opened to reintroduce a new statistical framework into this purely exploratory process by deriving an a posteriori projection of supplementary variables (i.e. rows) and individuals (i.e. rows). His early familiarity with computers and their programming languages lead him to adopt tensor notations and quasi ALGOL-like algorithmic formulas in his course texts as early as 1967.

To that purpose he also helped found a Computer Science program at his alma mater, Alabama A&M University, a historically black university, where he headed the Computer Science program while on loan from NASA.

He was assigned a position as a mathematician and instructor in the Computation Laboratory.[3] Around that time Foster was considering leaving, but President John F. Kennedy's announcement that the new administration would charge NASA to go to the Moon made him stay.[4] Foster worked regularly as a recruiter, trying to attract black workers to Marshall.[1] The problem, both for hiring new workers and promoting current workers at NASA, was that training was required, and while NASA itself, as a federal entity, did not segregate, its location in a segregated state meant that employees and future employees who were African-American could not attend the kinds of training programs they needed in order to be hired or promoted, since those were held in public facilities, which were segregated (such as ballrooms of hotels that allowed whites only).[5]/nSoon after he joined NASA he was asked to train a white colleague to become his boss, at a time when the Civil Rights Movement in Alabama was demanding change. Foster complained to his boss and refused the assignment, and then demanded that NASA start a program to train black workers. In the end, NASA agreed and started a training program in collaboration with Alabama A&M University.[1] That the program in a way continued segregation was of secondary concern to Foster.[6] At the end of the 1960s he persuaded Wernher von Braun, who had worked in Nazi Germany's rocket development program and later headed the Marshall Center, to support him in setting up a Computer Science program at Alabama A&M. The university initially was not interested, being more focused on more traditional training in nursing, education, and farming, besides civil engineering.

Eight years after moving there, he managed to sway a probate judge to revive the municipality, having discovered that its municipal charter had never actually been dissolved and that Alabama law allowed such still-chartered municipalities to be revived.[10] The judge subsequently named Foster mayor, and appointed a city council.[11] A feature article in Ebony credited Foster with reviving the town, which he hoped would share in the development book prompted in part by NASA.[12] He was mayor for twenty years, from 1964[13] until September 1984.[3] He also served on the state's Commission on Higher Education, on an appointment made in 1974 by Alabama Governor George C.

Under Communist rule in Czechoslovakia, Benda and his wife were rare in that they were devout Roman Catholics among the leadership of the anti-communist dissident organization Charter 77. After the Velvet Revolution, Benda became the head of an organization charged with investigating the former Czechoslovakian secret police and their many informants./nThe ideas expressed in Benda's iconic essay A Parallel Polis influenced the thought of other dissidents like Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa. In the 2010s and 2020s, American Paleoconservative writer Rod Dreher and Russian-American writer Masha Gessen have drawn on these events and ideas from Cold War-era eastern Europe in disparate works for popular audience. The first English translation of Benda's collected samizdat essays was published by St. Augustine's Press in 2017./nThe son of a lawyer, Benda was president of the Students' Academic Council and obtained a doctorate of Philosophy at Charles University in Prague at age 24.[1] His academic career ended when he refused to join the Communist Party in the early 1970s.[2] As a result of his political activities he experienced harassment from the government and economic exclusion, being forced to work for brief periods in a large number of different jobs.[1] With Benda and his wife Kamila's decision during the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968 not to flee the country, he remained at Charles University. Benda completed his doctorate in theoretical cybernetics in 1975, published works on philosophy and mathematics, and then worked as a computer programmer.[3] Benda was active in the dissident movement against the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, and in 1977 became a signatory to Charter 77.[1]/nIn 1977, he also wrote a short samizdat essay called \"Parallel Polis\" (Czech: paraleln\u00ed polis), calling for his fellow dissidents to abandon hope that the repressive social, economic and political institutions in Czechoslovakia could be changed by protest.[2] Instead, Benda called for new \"parallel institutions\" to be created, which would be more responsive to human needs and may someday replace the existing corrupt institutions. He argued that as the communist state would drain any efforts at reform, it was better to start new ones than expend energy fighting old ones. The essay was translated into English in 1978./nBenda's role as a spokesman for Charter 77 resulted in him being arrested in May 1979 and charged with subverting the state, for which he was imprisoned until 1983.[1][2] After his release he resumed his role as spokesman.[2] He was also a founder-member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS).[1] While Benda was imprisoned with Vaclav Havel in Ostrava, they co-wrote a text for the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1980.[1]/nA devout Roman  Catholic, Benda established the Christian Democratic Party in 1989, becoming chairman in 1990. The party later merged with the Civic Democratic Party. Benda's politics were distinct from his former dissident colleagues, and he became an increasingly isolated figure in Czech politics. He was a defender, with qualifications, of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a position widely shared in Czech liberal and conservative elite circles.[1][4] Benda stated that Pinochet had \"perhaps, his cruel traits, nevertheless they were answers to the extremely undemocratic and extremely cruel advance at the root of international communism.\"[5]/nFrom June 25 to December 31, 1992, Benda was Chairman of the Chamber of the Nations./nFrom 1991 to 1998, Benda served as head of the Bureau for Investigating the Crimes of Communist Party officials.[1]/nIn 1996, he was elected to the Czech Senate for the Prague 1 district, and held the seat until his death in 1999.[2]/nBenda's ideas about a Parallel Polis were later revived by a group of scholars at the University of Washington, and a four-story building called Parallel polis has opened in Prague, housing a bitcoin-only cafe, co-working space, makers lab, and \"Institute of cryptoanarchy\" in Hole\u0161ovice.[6][7]/nIn his 2017 book The Benedict Option, author Rod Dreher praised the ideas expressed in Benda's essays and recommended them to American Christians as an example of how to preserve and live their faith in a culture increasingly hostile to it.[8]", "5239250": "Alexander (Smbat) Abian (January 1, 1923 \u2013 July 24, 1999)[1] was an Iranian-born Armenian-American mathematician who taught for over 25 years at Iowa State University and became notable for his frequent posts to various Usenet newsgroups, and his advocacy for the destruction of the moon./nAbian was born in Tabriz, Iran, and was of Armenian ethnicity.

He is noted for ministering in Belfast amidst growing sectarian tension, taking a moderate and non-confrontational stance, to the annoyance of his pro-Catholic followers.[1] He was also a professor at Maynooth College as well as Down and Connor Diocesan College, and was active in the local scientific community./nCornelius Denvir was born on 13 August 1791 in Ballyculter, County Down.  He was educated at Dr. Nelson's Classical School in Downpatrick, being described by peers as an enthusiastic child with a love for sight-seeing.  According to one biographer, young Denvir also showed interest in the Catechism by attending local visits from the then Bishop of Down and Connor Patrick MacMullan who was resident in Downpatrick.[2] In September 1808, Denvir enrolled at Maynooth College, and was appointed chair of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics there in August 1813./nDenvir was ordained first as deacon in June 1813, then a priest in May 1814, performing his liturgical duties in conjunction with his academic ones.  In 1826, Denvir left Maynooth College to become the Parish priest of Downpatrick.[2] In 1833 he became a professor at the newly founded St. Malachy's College, teaching classes in Latin, Greek and Mathematics.  He continued his duties as parish priest and professor until 1835, when he was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor in succession to William Crolly.[2]/nAs 22nd Lord Bishop of Down and Connor, Denvir emphasised the teaching of the Catechism to youth as well as emphasising the importance of scripture to the diocese.[2][3]  In 1841 he helped fund the start of construction of St Malachy's Church in Belfast, which was completed in 1845.[2][3] In his later years, Denvir fell under criticism by other Belfast Catholics, who claimed Denvir was neglectful of his duties, especially those relating to expanding and defending Catholicism in the face of growing Protestant influence.  Some accounts attribute Denvir's shortcomings to poor health and temperament,[3] while others suggest that Denvir backed away from expansion to avoid conflict with Protestant groups.[1][2][4]/nDenvir suffered from personal finance problems during his time as Bishop.  The construction of St Malachy's Church put him into deep personal debt, which he was apparently arrested for some time after 1844.  Denvir was also criticised for selling seats in the newly constructed church to offset costs.  He was also described as reluctant in asking for funds from parishioners, severely limiting his resources with which to care for the church.[2]/nAfter years of illness compounded by age, in 1860 Denvir was assigned Patrick Dorrian as a coadjutor to assist in his episcopal duties.[1][2]    While ill health may have been the predominant reason for the appointment of a coadjutor, contemporary newspaper accounts suggest there may also have been an ideological reason for the appointment.  In The Spectator it was noted in December 1859 'it may be, because he (Denvir) is too liberal for the Cullen epoch.' [5]/nIn May 1865, Denvir resigned as Bishop and was succeeded by Dorrian.[2] Denvir died one year later on 10 July 1866, in his residence on Donegall St, after suffering from fainting fits a few days prior.  He was buried in Ballycruttle Church.[2]/nDenvir was appointed Commissioner of National Education in 1853.  He is noted for being supportive of non-denominational education and investigating reports of proselytism in public primary education.  He later resigned this position in 1857 on request of the Holy See to focus on expanding the local Catholic school system.[3]/nAs chair of mathematics and natural philosophy at Maynooth, Denvir is noted for changing the style of education at the college from pure logic-based reasoning in Mathematics to a more holistic, topical approach.  He is also noted for emphasising experimentation and the importance of the scientific method in teaching natural philosophy, with several sources noting his well-stocked labs.[6]/nAside from his duties as a professor, Denvir owned a large galvanised battery, which he loaned out for experimentation and public spectacle.  He was also active in the local scientific community, becoming a member of the Natural History and Philosophical Society and the Chemico-Agricultural society of Ulster.  One notable feature about Denvir's scientific activity is that it led him to meet frequently with other ministers from different denominations, an irregularity at the time.[4]/nWhile at Maynooth College Denvir taught both Nicholas Callan, the inventor and physicist, and Dominic Corrigan, the noted Irish physician.[7][8] According to several accounts, both spoke fondly of their old professor, to the point of Callan gifting Denvir one of his induction coils in thanks.[9]", "94721": "Robert Grosseteste[n 1] (/\u02c8\u0261ro\u028ast\u025bst/ GROHS-test; Latin: Robertus Grosseteste; c.\u20091168\u00a0\u2013 8 or 9 October 1253),[11] also known as Robert Greathead or Robert of Lincoln, was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents in Suffolk (according to the early 14th-century chronicler Nicholas Trevet), but the associations with the village of Stradbroke is a post-medieval tradition.[12] Upon his death, he was revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonisation failed. A.\u00a0C. Crombie called him \"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\"./nThere is very little direct evidence about Grosseteste's education. He may have received a liberal arts education at Lincoln and appears as a witness for the bishop of Lincoln at in the late 1180s or early 1190s, where he is identified as a Master. From about 1195 he was active in the household of the Bishop of Hereford William de Vere; a letter from Gerald of Wales to William extolling Grosseteste's skills survives. Grosseteste appears not to have received any form of benefice from Bishop William, and on the latter's death in 1198, the household dissolved. There is no evidence that Grosseteste held any position in the households of William's successors, but it is possible that he was supported by Hugh Foliot, Archdeacon of Shropshire in the north of Hereford diocese. Grosseteste's movements are not clear in the next two decades or so, but he seems to have spent some time in France during the years of the interdict over England (1208\u201314), and acted as a papal judge-delegate, in company with Hugh Foliot, in or around 1216./nBy 1225, he had gained the benefice of Abbotsley in the diocese of Lincoln, by which time he was a deacon. On that period in his life, scholarship is divided. Some historians argue that he began his teaching career in theology at Oxford in this year, whereas others have more recently argued that he used the income of his ecclesiastical post to support studies in theology at the University of Paris. However, there is clear evidence that by 1229/30 he was teaching at Oxford, but on the periphery as the lector in theology to the Franciscans, who had established a convent in Oxford about 1224. He remained in this post until March 1235./nGrosseteste may also have been appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford. However, the evidence for this comes from a late thirteenth century anecdote whose main claim is that Grosseteste was in fact entitled the master of students (magister scholarium)./nAt the same time he began lecturing in theology at Oxford, Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, appointed him as Archdeacon of Leicester,[14] and he also gained a prebend that made him a canon in Lincoln Cathedral. However, after a severe illness in 1232, he resigned all his benefices (Abbotsley and Leicester), but retained his prebend. His reasons were due to changing attitudes about the plurality of benefices (holding more than one ecclesiastical position simultaneously), and after seeking advice from the papal court, he tendered his resignations. The angry response of his friends and colleagues to his resignations took him by surprise and he complained to his sister and to his closest friend, the Franciscan Adam Marsh, that his intentions had been misunderstood./nAs a master of the sacred page (manuscripts of theology in Latin), Grosseteste trained the Franciscans in the standard curriculum of university theology. The Franciscan Roger Bacon was his most famous disciple, and acquired an interest in the scientific method from him.[15] Grosseteste lectured on the Psalter, the Pauline epistles, Genesis (at least the creation account), and possibly on Isaiah, Daniel and Sirach. He also led disputations on such subjects as the theological nature of truth and the efficacy of the Mosaic Law. Grosseteste also preached at the university and appears to have been called to preach within the diocese as well. He collected some of those sermons, along with some short notes and reflections, not long after he left Oxford; this is now known as his Dicta. His theological writings reveal a continual interest in the natural world as a major resource for theological reflection and an ability to read Greek sources (if he ever learned Hebrew, it would be not until he became bishop of Lincoln). His theological index (tabula distinctionum) reveals the breadth of his learning and his desire to communicate it in a systematic manner.[16] However, Grosseteste's own style was far more unstructured than many of his scholastic contemporaries, and his writings reverberate with his own personal views and outlooks./nIn February 1235, Hugh of Wells died, and the canons of Lincoln cathedral met to elect his successor. They soon were at a deadlock and could not reach a majority. Fearing that the election would be taken out of their hands, they settled on a compromise candidate, Grosseteste. He was consecrated in June of that same year[17] at Reading.[18] He instituted an innovative programme of visitation, a procedure normally reserved for the inspection of monasteries. Grosseteste expanded it to include all the deaneries in each archdeaconry of his vast diocese. The scheme brought him into conflict with more than one privileged corporation, in particular with his own chapter, who disputed his claim to exercise the right of visitation over their community. The dispute raged hotly from 1239 to 1245,[19] with the chapter launching an appeal to the papacy. In 1245, whilst attending the First Council of Lyon, the papal court ruled in favour of Grosseteste. Dean William de Thornaco is recorded as being suspended by Bishop Grosseteste in 1239, together with precentor and subdean in relation to the aforementioned matter./nIn ecclesiastical politics the bishop belonged to the school of Thomas Becket. His zeal for reform led him to advance, on behalf of the courts, Christian claims which it was impossible that the secular power should admit. He twice incurred a rebuke from Henry III upon this subject although it was left for Edward I to settle the question of principle in favour of the state. The devotion of Grosseteste to the hierarchical theories of his age is attested by his correspondence with his chapter and the king. Against the former he upheld the prerogative of the bishops; against the latter he asserted that it was impossible for a bishop to disregard the commands of the Holy See. Where the liberties of the national church came into conflict with the assertions of Rome he stood by his own countrymen.[19]/nThus in 1238 he demanded that the King should release certain Oxford scholars who had assaulted the legate Otto Candidus. But at least up to the year 1247 he submitted patiently to papal encroachments, contenting himself with the protection (by a special papal privilege) of his own diocese from alien clerks. Of royal exactions he was more impatient; and, after the retirement of Archbishop (Saint) Edmund, constituted himself the spokesman of the clerical estate in the Great Council.[19]/nIn 1244 he sat on a committee which was empanelled to consider a demand for a subsidy. The committee rejected the demand, and Grosseteste foiled an attempt on the king's part to separate the clergy from the baronage. \"It is written\", the bishop said, \"that united we stand and divided we fall.\"[19]/nThe last years of Grosseteste's life and episcopacy were embroiled in a conflict with the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy. In 1250, he travelled to the papal court, where one of the cardinals read his complaints at an audience with Innocent IV. He claimed not only that Boniface was threatening the health of the church but also that the pope was just as guilty for not reining him in and that that was symptomatic of the current malaise of the entire church. Most observers noted the personal animus between the bishop of Lincoln and the pope, but it did not stop the pope from agreeing to most of Grosseteste's demands about the way the English church ought to function./nGrosseteste continued to keep a watchful eye on ecclesiastical events. In 1251 he protested against a papal mandate enjoining the English clergy to pay Henry III one-tenth of their revenues for a crusade; and called attention to the fact that, under the system of provisions, a sum of 70,000 marks was annually drawn from England by the alien nominees of Rome. In 1253, upon being commanded to provide in his own diocese for a papal nephew, he wrote a letter of expostulation and refusal, not to the pope himself but to the commissioner, Master Innocent, through whom he received the mandate. The text of the remonstrance, as given in the Burton Annals and in Matthew Paris, has possibly been altered by a forger who had less respect than Grosseteste for the papacy. The language is more violent than that which the bishop elsewhere employs. But the general argument, that the papacy may command obedience only so far as its commands are consonant with the teaching of Christ and the apostles, is only what should be expected from an ecclesiastical reformer of Grosseteste's time. There is much more reason for suspecting the letter addressed \"to the nobles of England, the citizens of London, and the community of the whole realm\", in which Grosseteste is represented as denouncing in unmeasured terms papal finance in all its branches. But even in this case allowance must be made for the difference between modern and medieval standards of decorum.[19]/nGrosseteste numbered among his most intimate friends the Franciscan teacher, Adam Marsh. Through Adam he came into close relations with Simon de Montfort. From the Franciscan's letters it appears that the earl had studied a political tract by Grosseteste on the difference between a monarchy and a tyranny and that he embraced with enthusiasm the bishop's projects of ecclesiastical reform. Their alliance began as early as 1239, when Grosseteste exerted himself to bring about a reconciliation between the king and the earl. But there is no reason to suppose that the political ideas of Montfort had matured before the death of Grosseteste; nor did Grosseteste busy himself overmuch with secular politics, except insofar as they touched the interest of the Church. Grosseteste realised that the misrule of Henry III and his unprincipled compact with the papacy largely accounted for the degeneracy of the English hierarchy and the laxity of ecclesiastical discipline. But he can hardly be termed a constitutionalist.[19]/nGrosseteste died on 9 October 1253.[17][20] He was aged between seventy and eighty./nHe is buried in a tomb within his memorial chapel within Lincoln Cathedral. Its dedicatory plaque reads as follows:/nIn this place lies the body of ROBERT GROSSETESTE who was born at Stradbroke in Suffolk, studied in the University of Paris\u00a0\u2013 and in 1224 became the Chancellor of Oxford University where he befriended and taught the newly founded orders of Friars\u00a0: In 1229 he became Archdeacon of Leicester and a Canon of this Cathedral\u00a0\u2013 reigning as Bishop of Lincoln from 17th. June 1235 until his death./n/nHe was a man of learning and an inspiration to scholars a wise administrator whilst a true shepherd of his flock, ever concerned to lead them to Christ in whose service he strove to temper justice with mercy, hating the sin while loving the sinner, not sparing the rod though cherishing the weak\u00a0\u2013 He died on 8 October 1253./nAfter his death, an anecdote of Pope Innocent's death by Matthew Paris, is often mentioned well into the 16th century to the effect that the ghost of Grosseteste visited the Pope in the night and gave him a blow to the heart which killed.[21]/nGrosseteste was already an elderly man, with an established reputation, when he became a bishop. As an ecclesiastical statesman, he showed the same fiery zeal and versatility of which he had given proof in his academic career; but the general tendency of modern writers has been to exaggerate his political and ecclesiastical services, and to neglect his performance as a scientist, an astrologer, and scholar. The opinion of his own age, as expressed by Matthew Paris and Roger Bacon, was very different. His contemporaries, while admitting the excellence of his intentions as a statesman, lay stress upon his defects of temper and discretion. Grosseteste was known to be somewhat critical towards everyone, and was known to often express his opinions regardless of status. Some of these conflicts involve the King, Abbot of Westminster and Pope Innocent. His morals were high and he recognised that even those of the church could be corrupt and worked to fight against that corruption.[22]  But they see in him the pioneer of a literary and scientific movement; not merely a great ecclesiastic who patronised learning in his leisure hours, but the first mathematician and physicist of his age. He anticipated, in these fields of thought, some of the striking ideas to which Roger Bacon subsequently gave a wider currency.[19]/nBishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln is named after Robert Grosseteste. The university provides Initial Teacher Training and academic degrees at all levels. In 2003, it hosted an international conference on Grosseteste in honour of the 750th anniversary of his death./nGrosseteste has been recognised in many ways for his knowledge and contributions to the sciences. He was entered under the section \"Scholars and Divines\" in John Evelyn's Numismata: A discourse of Medals, entered under the name \"Grosthed\" listed among others that Evelyn describes as \"famous and illustrious\".[23][24] In 2014, The Robert Grosseteste Society has called for a statue to be erected so that he may be recognised for his achievements.[25]/nGrosseteste wrote a number of early works in Latin and French whilst he was a clerk, including one called Chateau d'amour, an allegorical poem on the creation of the world and Christian redemption, as well as several other poems and texts on household management and courtly etiquette. He also wrote a number of theological works including the influential Hexa\u00ebmeron in the 1230s.  He was also a highly regarded author of manuals on pastoral care and produced treatises that dealt with a variety of penitential contexts, including monasteries, the parish and a bishop's household./nFrom about 1220 to 1235 he wrote a host of scientific treatises including:/nIn 1242, having been introduced to the Greek work by John of Basingstoke, Grosseteste had the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs brought from Greece and translated it with help of a clerk of St Albans:/nfor the strengthening of the christian  [sic] faith and the confusion of the Jews [who were said to have deliberately hidden the book away] ... on account of the manifest prophecies of Christ contained therein.[26]/nHe also wrote a number of commentaries on Aristotle, including the first in the West of Posterior Analytics, and one on Aristotle's Physics, which has survived as a loose collection of notes or glosses on the text. Moreover, he did a lot of very interesting work on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy: he translated both the text and the scholia from Greek into Latin and wrote a commentary [27]/nGrosseteste is best known as an original thinker for his work concerning what would today be called science or the scientific method./nIt has been argued that Grosseteste played a key role in the development of the scientific method. Grosseteste did introduce to the Latin West the notion of controlled experiment and related it to demonstrative science, as one among many ways of arriving at such knowledge.[28] Although Grosseteste did not always follow his own advice during his investigations, his work is seen as instrumental in the history of the development of the Western scientific tradition./nGrosseteste was the first of the Scholastics to fully understand Aristotle's vision of the dual path of scientific reasoning: generalising from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Therefore, scientific knowledge was demonstrative knowledge of things through their causes.[29] Grosseteste called this \"resolution and composition\". So, for example, looking at the particulars of the moon, it is possible to arrive at universal laws about nature. Conversely once these universal laws are understood, it is possible to make predictions and observations about other objects besides the moon. Grosseteste said further that both paths should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles involved. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to Padua and Galileo Galilei in the 17th century./nAs important as \"resolution and composition\" would become to the future of Western scientific tradition, more important to his own time was his idea of the subordination of the sciences. For example, when looking at geometry and optics, optics is subordinate to geometry because optics depends on geometry, and so optics was a prime example of a subalternate science. Thus Grosseteste concluded, following much of what Boethius had argued, that mathematics was the highest of all sciences, and the basis for all others, since every natural science ultimately depended on mathematics. He supported this conclusion by looking at light, which he believed to be the \"first form\" of all things, the source of all generation and motion (approximately what is now known as biology and physics). Hence, since light could be reduced to lines and points, and thus fully explained in the realm of mathematics, mathematics was the highest order of the sciences./nGrosseteste had read several important works translated from Greek via Arabic, including De Speculis by Euclid (and likely also De Visu), Meteorologica and De Generatione Animalium by Aristotle, and directly from Arabic, such as Liber Canonis by Avicenna. He likely also read al-Kindi's De Aspectibus.[30] Drawing on these sources, Grosseteste produced important work in optics, which would be continued by Roger Bacon, who often mentioned his indebtedness to him although there is no proof that the two ever met. In De Iride Grosseteste writes:/nThis part of optics, when well understood, shows us how we may make things a very long distance off appear as if placed very close, and large near things appear very small, and how we may make small things placed at a distance appear any size we want, so that it may be possible for us to read the smallest letters at incredible distances, or to count sand, or seed, or any sort of minute objects./nEditions of the original Latin text may be found in: Die Philosophischen Werke des Robert Grosseteste, Bischofs von Lincoln (M\u00fcnster i. W., Aschendorff, 1912.), p.\u00a075.[31]/nGrosseteste is now believed to have had a very modern understanding of light and colour, which is shown by his scientific treatises De Luce (On Light) and De Colore (On Colour). De Luce explores the nature of light, matter, and the cosmos. He argued that light is an infinitely small particle which was the first form of everything within the universe that multiplied itself indefinitely that resulted in a finite magnitude which was physical matter. Grosseteste described the birth of the Universe in an explosion and the crystallisation of light into matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. He also came to the conclusion that, as light dragged the matter of the universe outward and expanded the universe, the density must decrease as the radius increases. Thus, invoking a conservation law centuries before conservation laws became fundamental in modern science.[32] De Luce is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws, four centuries before Isaac Newton proposed gravity and seven centuries before the Big Bang theory. In his treatise, De Colore, Robert Grosseteste had defined colour as light incorporated in a diaphanous material. Meaning that colour is associated with the interaction of light and materials and that it is a product of variations in the qualities of both the light and the medium. De Colore was Grosseteste's replacement of Aristotle's linear colour arrangement between black and white to a three dimensional one based on the aforementioned aspects with 7 different directions of colour from white to black with infinite variations in intensity.[33]/nThe 'Ordered Universe' collaboration of scientists and historians at Durham University studying medieval science regard him as a key figure in showing that pre-Renaissance science was far more advanced than previously thought./nSupposed errors in his account have been found to be based on corrupt late copies of his essay on the nature of light, written in about 1225 (De Luce). In 2014 Grosseteste's 1225 treatise De Luce was translated from Latin and interpreted by an interdisciplinary project led by Durham University, that included Latinists, philologists, medieval historians, physicists and cosmologists./nUpon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, with miracles reported at his shrine and pilgrims to it granted an indulgence by the bishop of Lincoln.[34] However, attempts by successive Bishops of  Lincoln, the University of Oxford, and Edward\u00a0I to secure a formal papal canonisation failed.[34] The attempts to have him canonised were unsuccessful because of his opposition to Pope Innocent IV. The reason for this also seems to be because it was rumoured that Grosseteste's ghost was responsible for the death of the Pope.[35]/nIn most of the modern Anglican Communion, Robert Grosseteste is considered beatified and commemorated on 9 October.[36]  Grosseteste is honoured in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 9 October.[37][38]", "49934850": "Anna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m (1847\u20131920) was a Swedish educator. She was a local pioneer of female education in Lund, and the founder of the secondary education school H\u00f6gre Elementarskolan i Lund (Higher Elementary School in Lund) for girls, also customarily known as R\u00f6nstr\u00f6mska skolan (R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m School).[1]/nAnna R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was a student of the H\u00f6gre l\u00e4rarinneseminariet in Stockholm 1864\u20131867, and worked as a governess in Lund before she founded her own school for girls in 1871. The school was originally referred to as R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m School (R\u00f6nstr\u00f6mska skolan) after its founder, and became the first school in Lund to provide secondary education to females in preparation for university studies. \nIn this, R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m and her school was a typical representative of other female pioneers who opened the first secondary education schools for girls in different Swedish cities, comparable to other local pioneers such as Maria Henschen in Uppsala, Maria Stenkula in Malm\u00f6 and Elsa Borg in G\u00e4vle.[1][2]/nIn theory, R\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was a conservative anti-feminist and in fact had a conservative view of women's education. She stated that women should be educated at home for a life in the home; that a school for women should be more of a second home rather than a school, training their students as parents raise their children rather than educating them; and that the education of females should be guided by religion: this was in fact typical of the conservative view in the contemporary debate of women's education. In practice, however, the school she created was in fact radical and adjusted to the modern views of equal education of men and women: the school provided its students all the education necessary to prepare for university studies. Also, unlike many other girls' schools of the same kind, it also provided the same mathematics level as secondary school did for boys; furthermore, it did not teach the French language, as schools for females normally did, but rather the German language, which was the language preferred in boys' secondary schools at the time. She also introduced home economics, which was a radical innovation at the time (1892). Her school was successful, granted state support in 1879 and communal support in 1882.[1]/nR\u00f6nstr\u00f6m was also an influential participator in the flickskolm\u00f6te, the annual national girls' school conferences. She introduced a teacher exchange between Denmark and Sweden in 1898, which became popular and functioned for many years. \nIn 1905, she also founded a women's teachers' seminary with Anna Heurlin, which was incorporated in her school. She is described as a skillful mathematician and became a member of the International Congress of Mathematicians at the meeting held in Rome in 1908.[1][3]/nThe fate of her school was also typical: in 1933, it was united with its prime rival, the Lunds fullst\u00e4ndiga l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor from 1880, to form Lunds kommunala flickskola ('Lund Communal Girls' School'), which was in turn later made a co-educational school.[4]/nShe was awarded the Swedish royal medal Illis Quorum Meruere Labores (commonly known as Illis quorum) in 1913.[5]", "1372680": "Francesco Fa\u00e0 di Bruno (7 March 1825 \u2013 25 March 1888) was an Italian priest and advocate of the poor, a leading mathematician of his era and a noted religious musician. In 1988 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II.[1] He is the eponym of Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula./nFa\u00e0 di Bruno was born in Alessandria, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, on 7 March 1825. He was of noble birth, being the twelfth and youngest child of the Marchese Luigi Fa\u00e0 di Bruno and the Lady Carolina Sappa de' Milanesi. He was raised in a home marked by happiness, the arts and a concern for the poor arising from the parents' strong Catholic faith.[2]/nAs a young man, he entered the Royal Army and held, at one time, the rank of Staff Officer. He resigned from his commission and went to Paris, where he did doctoral studies in mathematics under Augustin Cauchy, and Urbain Le Verrier, who both shared in the discovery of the planet Neptune.[3] He was in close contact with the mathematicians Fran\u00e7ois-Napol\u00e9on-Marie Moigno and Charles Hermite./nOn his return to Turin, he took up the position of Professor of Mathematics at the local university. In recognition of his achievements as a mathematician, the degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on him by the Universities of Paris and Turin.[3]/nWhile carrying out his career responsibilities, Fa\u00e0 di Bruno also became actively involved in the social outreach to the poor being developed by leading figures of the Catholic Church in Turin. He became a close friend of John Bosco,[4] and helped establish refuges for the elderly and the poor. He oversaw the construction of a church in Turin, Our Lady of Suffrage.[5]/nSomewhat late in his life, Fa\u00e0 di Bruno came to feel that pursuing Holy Orders would help him in his religious activities and commenced the necessary studies in theology. What he found, however, was that the Archbishop of Turin at that time would not accept an older man for ordination, Fa\u00e0 di Bruno being in his late 40s at that time. For centuries, the traditional route for this profession began in a boy's mid-teens./nFa\u00e0 di Bruno appealed to Pope Pius IX and received his support, finally being ordained at age 51. He founded the Minim Sisters of St. Zita in 1881 to provide help for maids and domestic servants, later expanding its outreach to include others, such as unmarried mothers. With their help, he also established another refuge, one dedicated to taking in prostitutes./nFa\u00e0 di Bruno died in Turin on 25 March 1888./nThe cause for the canonization of Fa\u00e0 di Bruno opened in the early 20th century by the Archdiocese of Turin and he was declared a Servant of God. His spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 22 May 1935.[6] He was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI in 1971, and beatified by Pope John Paul II on the centennial of his death in 1988.[1]/nIn an address to the Minim Sisters in 2002, Pope John Paul II said, \"\"Francesco Fa\u00e0 di Bruno\", I said, is \"a giant of faith and charity\", for his message of light and love, \"far from being exhausted, seems timelier than ever, urging all those who have Gospel values at heart to action\"\" (Homily, 25 September, n. 4; ORE, 24 October 1988, p. 15).[5]/nIn addition to some ascetical writings, the composition of some sacred melodies, and the invention of some scientific apparatus, Fa\u00e0 di Bruno made numerous and important contributions to mathematics.  Today, he is best known for Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula on derivatives of composite functions although it is now certain Louis Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Arbogast had priority for its discovery and use. Fa\u00e0 di Bruno should be credited only for the formula's determinant form.[7] However, his work is mainly related to elimination theory and to the theory of elliptic functions.[8]/nHe was the author of about 40 original articles published in the \"Journal de Math\u00e9matiques\" (edited by Joseph Liouville), Crelle's Journal, \"American Journal of Mathematics\" (Johns Hopkins University), \"Annali di Tortolini\", \"Les Mondes\", \"Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\", etc.; the first half of an exhaustive treatise on the theory and applications of elliptic functions which he planned to complete in three volumes; \"Th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'\u00e9limination\" (Paris, 1859); \"Calcolo degli errori\" (Turin, 1867), translated into French under the title of \"Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire du calcul des erreurs\" (Paris, 1869); and most important of all, \"Th\u00e9orie des formes binaires\" (Paris, 1876), translated into German (Leipzig, 1881).

Roger Bacon, his pupil, speaks highly of his attainments in theology and mathematics.[2] According to Salimbene, in the 1240s, Marsh attended the lectures of Humilis of Milan on the Book of Isaiah and the Gospel of Mark. A lector named Stephen, in turn, used Marsh's Oxford lectione on Genesis, in his assignments.[3] Marsh was a close acquaintance and correspondent of French theologian Thomas Gallus.[4]/nHis fame, however, rests upon the influence which he exercised over the statesmen of his day. As Bishop of Lincoln, Grosseteste relied on his friend's opinion regarding ecclesiastical appointments in the diocese, since \"Marsh knew everybody\".[5] Consulted as a spiritual director by Simon de Montfort, the countess of Leicester and the queen, as an expert lawyer and theologian by the primate, Boniface of Savoy, he did much to guide the policy both of the opposition and of the court party in all matters affecting the interests of the Church. He shrank from office, and never became provincial minister of the English Franciscans, though constantly charged with responsible commissions.

Loyd was born in Philadelphia but raised in New York City./nAs a chess composer, he authored a number of chess problems, often with interesting themes.  At his peak, Loyd was one of the best chess players in the US, and was ranked 15th in the world, according to chessmetrics.com./nHe played in the strong Paris 1867 chess tournament (won by Ignatz von Kolisch) with little success, placing near the bottom of the field./nFollowing his death, his book Cyclopedia of 5000 Puzzles[2] was published (1914) by his son, Samuel Loyd Jr.[3][4] His son, named after his father, dropped the \"Jr\" from his name and started publishing reprints of his father's puzzles.[4]\nLoyd (senior) was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame in 1987.[5]/nLoyd is widely acknowledged as one of America's great puzzle writers and popularizers, often mentioned as the greatest. Martin Gardner featured Loyd in his August 1957 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American and called him \"America's greatest puzzler\". In 1898, The Strand dubbed him \"the prince of puzzlers\". As a chess problemist, his composing style is distinguished by wit and humour./nHe is also known for lies and self-promotion, however, and criticized on these grounds\u2014Martin Gardner's assessment continues \"but also obviously a hustler\". Canadian puzzler Mel Stover called Loyd \"an old reprobate\", and Matthew Costello called him \"puzzledom's greatest celebrity... popularizer, genius\", but also a \"huckster\" and \"fast-talking snake oil salesman\".[6]/nHe collaborated with puzzler Henry Dudeney for a while, but Dudeney broke off the correspondence and accused Loyd of stealing his puzzles and publishing them under his own name. Dudeney despised Loyd so intensely that he equated him with the Devil.[7]/nLoyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented the fifteen tiles in the box and one space puzzle.[8] This is false, as Loyd had nothing to do with the invention or popularity of the puzzle, and the craze was in the early 1880s, not the early 1870s.[9] The craze had ended by July 1880 and Loyd's first article on the subject was not published until 1896.[9] Loyd first claimed in 1891 that he had invented the puzzle, and he continued to do so until his death.[9] The actual inventor was Noyes Chapman, who applied for a patent in March 1880.[9]/nAn enthusiast of Tangram puzzles, Loyd popularized them with The Eighth Book Of Tan, a book of seven hundred unique Tangram designs and a fanciful history of the origin of the Tangram, claiming that the puzzle was invented 4,000 years ago by a god named Tan. This was presented as true and has been described as \"Sam Loyd's Most Successful Hoax\".[8]/nOne of his best-known chess problems is the following, called \"Excelsior\" by Loyd after the poem[10] by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.  White is to move and checkmate Black in five moves against any defense:/nLoyd bet a friend that he could not pick a piece that didn't give mate in the main line, and when it was published in 1861 it was with the stipulation that White mates with \"the least likely piece or pawn\"./nOne of the most famous chess problems by Loyd. He wrote on this problem: \"The originality of the problem is due to the White King being placed in absolute safety, and yet coming out on a reckless career, with no immediate threat and in the face of innumerable checks.\"[11]/nThis problem was originally published in 1859. The story involves a chess incident during the siege of Charles XII of Sweden by the Turks at Bender in 1713. \"Charles beguiled this period by means of drills and chess, and used frequently to play with his minister, Christian Albert Grosthusen, some of the contests being mentioned by Voltaire. One day while so engaged, the game had been played to this stage, and Charles (White) had just announced checkmate in three.\"/n\"Scarcely had he uttered the words, when a (Turkish) bullet, shattering the window, dashed the White knight off of the board in fragments. Grothusen started violently, but Charles, with utmost coolness, begged him to put back the other knight and work out the mate, observing that it was pretty enough. But another glance at the board made Charles smile. We do not need the knight. I can give it to you and still mate in four!\"/nWho would believe it, he had scarcely spoken when another bullet flew across the room, and the pawn at h2 shared the fate of the knight. Grothusen turned pale. \"You have our good friends the Turks with you,\" said the king unconcerned, \"it can scarcely be expected that I should contend against such odds; but let me see if I can dispense with that pawn. I have it!\" he shouted with a laugh, \"I have great pleasure in informing you that there is undoubtedly a mate in 5.\"/nIn 1900, Friedrich Amelung pointed out that in the original position, if the first bullet had struck the rook instead of the knight, Charles would still have a mate in six./nIn 2003, ChessBase posted a fifth variation, attributed to Brian Stewart. After the first bullet took out the knight, if the second had removed the g-pawn rather than the h-pawn, Charles would be able to mate in ten./nOne of Loyd's notable puzzles was the \"Trick Donkeys\". It was based on a similar puzzle involving dogs published in 1857. In the problem, the solver must cut the drawing along the dotted lines and rearrange the three pieces so that the riders appear to be riding the donkeys./nA vanishing puzzle is a mechanical optical illusion showing different numbers of a certain object when parts of the puzzle are moved around.[12]/nLoyd patented rotary vanishing puzzles in 1896 and published versions named Get Off the Earth, Teddy and the Lion and The Disappearing Bicyclist (pictured). Each had a circular card connected to a cardboard backdrop with a pin, letting it rotate.[13][14][15] In the Disappearing Bicyclist, when the disc is rotated such that the arrow points to A, 13 boys can be seen. When rotated so that the arrow points to B, only 12 boys appear.[16]/nA square with a side length of 8 units (\"chessboard\") is dissected into four pieces, which can be assembled into a 5x13 rectangle. Since the area of the square is 64 units but the area of the rectangle is 65 units, this seems paradoxical at first. However, it is just an optical illusion as the pieces don't fit exactly to form a rectangle, but leave a small barely visible gap along the diagonal. This puzzle is also known as the Chessboard paradox or paradox of Loyd and Schl\u00f6milch./nThis is one of Sam Loyd's most famous puzzles, first printed in the New York Journal and Advertiser, April 24, 1898 (as far as available evidence indicates). Loyd's original instructions were to:/nStart from that heart in the center and go three steps in a straight line in any one of the eight directions, north, south, east or west, or on the bias, as the ladies say, northeast, northwest, southeast or southwest. When you have gone three steps in a straight line, you will reach a square with a number on it, which indicates the second day's journey, as many steps as it tells, in a straight line in any of the eight directions. From this new point when reached, march on again according to the number indicated, and continue on, following the requirements of the numbers reached, until you come upon a square with a number which will carry you just one step beyond the border, when you are supposed to be out of the woods and can holler all you want, as you will have solved the puzzle./nThe Association for Games & Puzzles International (previously the Association of Game & Puzzle Collectors, and prior to 1999, the American Game Collectors Association, AGCA), gives the Sam Loyd Award for promoting interest in mechanical puzzles through design, development, or manufacture.

Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o took over the leadership of both the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance, as well as the Prime Ministership, but lacking S\u00e1 Carneiro's charisma, he was unable to rally popular support./nThe Democratic Alliance was dissolved in 1983, and in parliamentary elections that year, the PSD lost to the Socialist Party (PS). Falling short of a majority, however, the Socialists formed a grand coalition, known as the Central Bloc, with the PSD. Many right-wingers in the PSD, including An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, opposed participation in the PS-led government, and so, when Cavaco Silva was elected leader of the party on 2 June 1985, the coalition was doomed./nThe PSD won a plurality (but not a majority) in the general election of 1985, and Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister. Economic liberalization and tax cuts ushered in several years of economic growth. After a motion of no confidence was approved, early elections were called for July 1987, which resulted in a landslide victory for the PSD, who captured 50.2 percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 parliamentary seats \u2013 the first time that any political party in Portugal had mustered an absolute majority in a free election. While the PSD had been very popular going into the election, the size of its victory far exceeded the party's most optimistic projections. A strong economy, growing above 7% in 1988, ushered a big convergence between Portugal and other EU countries./nThe PSD won a historic third term in the 1991 election, with a slightly higher vote share than four years earlier. However, continuing high levels of unemployment and a lower economy, after 1993, eroded the popularity of the Cavaco Silva government./nCavaco Silva stepped down as leader in January 1995. In the following month, in the PSD congress, the party elected Fernando Nogueira as leader. The PSD lost the 1995 election to the PS. In 1996, Cavaco Silva ran for the presidency of the republic, but he failed to defeat former Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio. Sampaio won 53.9% to Cavaco's 46.1%. The party, for the first time in 16 years, was out of government. The party was again defeated in the 1999 elections. The party, however, made a big comeback in the 2001 local elections by winning several cities, like Lisbon, Porto and Sintra, from the PS and, some, against all odds and predictions.[12] This PSD result led the then Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (PS) to resign and the country was led to snap general elections on March 2002.[13]/nAt the time, the party reviewed its membership database, resulting in a correction from 183,000 in 1996 to 77,000 in 1999.[14]/nThe PSD made a comeback in 2002 by defeating the PS by 40% to 38% margin, however, despite falling short of a majority, the PSD won enough seats to form a coalition with the CDS-PP, and the PSD leader, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, became Prime Minister. Dur\u00e3o Barroso later resigned his post to become President of the European Commission, leaving the way for Pedro Santana Lopes, a man with whom he was frequently at odds, to become leader of the party and Prime Minister./nIn the parliamentary election held on 20 February 2005, Santana Lopes led the PSD to its worst defeat since 1983. With a negative swing of more than 12% percent, the party won only 75 seats, a loss of 30. The rival Socialist Party had won an absolute majority, and remained in government after the 2009 parliamentary election, albeit without an absolute majority, leaving the PSD in opposition./nThe PSD-supported candidate An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva won the Portuguese presidential elections in 2006 and again in 2011. After the 2005 elections, Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes was elected leader of the party. Internal infighting weakened Marques Mendes and, in September 2007, Marques Mendes was defeated by Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes by a 54% to 42% margin. Menezes was also incapable of dealing with his internal opposition and, after just six months in the job, Menezes resigned. On 31 May 2008, Manuela Ferreira Leite became the first female leader of a Portuguese major party. She won 38% of the votes, against the 31% of Pedro Passos Coelho and the 30% of Pedro Santana Lopes./nIn the European Parliament election held on 7 June 2009, the PSD defeated the governing socialists, capturing 31.7% of the popular vote and electing eight MEPs, while the Socialist Party only won 26.5% of the popular vote and elected seven MEPs./nAlthough this was expected to be a \"redrawing of the electoral map\", the PSD has still defeated later that year, though the PS lost its majority. Pedro Passos Coelho was elected leader in March 2010, with 61% of the votes./nGrowing popular disenchantment with the government's handling of the economic crisis coupled with the government's inability to secure the support of other parties to implement the necessary reforms to address the crisis, forced the Socialist Party Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates to resign, leading to a fresh election on 5 June 2011. This resulted in a non-absolute majority for the PSD, leading to a coalition government with the CDS-PP, which served a full term until the 2015 general election. During this term, many austerity policies were put into practice to reduce the budget deficit but, ultimately, created unemployment and a recession that lasted until mid 2013. Since that date, the economy recovered starting to grow between 1 and 2% per trimester./nIn the 2015 general election, the PSD and CDS-PP ran in a joint coalition, called Portugal Ahead, led by Pedro Passos Coelho and Paulo Portas. The coalition won the elections by a wide margin over the Socialists, capturing 38.6% of the votes while the Socialists captured only 32%, although the coalition lost 25 MPs and a more than 11% of the votes, thus falling well short of an absolute majority. The PSD/CDS-PP coalition was asked by the then President of the Republic, An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, to form a government with Passos Coelho as Prime Minister./nThe 2nd PSD/CDS government was duly formed and took the oath of office on 30 October 2015, but fell after a no-confidence motion was approved two weeks later. Its 11 days of rule make it the shortest-lived government since Portugal has been a democracy holding free elections. After that, the PSD returned to the opposition benches, and the Socialist Party was able to form an agreement with BE and CDU to support a PS minority government led by Ant\u00f3nio Costa. Pedro Passos Coelho continued as party leader, but a weak opposition strategy led to bad polling numbers for the PSD. All of this culminated with the results of the 2017 local elections. In these elections, the PSD achieved their worst results ever, winning just 98 mayors and 30% of the votes. Passos Coelho announced he would not run for another term as PSD leader. On 13 January 2018, Rui Rio defeated Pedro Santana Lopes by a 54% to 46% margin and became the new party leader./nIn order to avoid bankruptcy due to mounting debt, in 2017, the party, alongside the Portuguese Socialist Party, the Portuguese Communist Party, BE and the ecologist party PEV, voted in favour of abolishing party fundraising limits, thereby opening all Portuguese parties to private political donorship, that they are not obligated to disclose.[15][16][17][18] The new proposal was reluctantly approved by the Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.[19]/nDuring his first year in the leadership, Rio faced big internal opposition and, in January 2019, Rio won a motion of confidence presented by Lu\u00eds Montenegro. In the EP 2019 elections, the PSD achieved their worst result ever in a national election, winning just 22% of the votes. However, the party recovered a lot of ground in the October 2019 general elections, achieving 28% of the votes, against the 36% of the PS. Nonetheless, Rio's leadership was, once again, challenged and he faced, in a two round leadership contest in January 2020, Lu\u00eds Montenegro and Miguel Pinto Luz. Rio won the 1st round with 49% of the votes and defeated Lu\u00eds Montenegro in the 2nd round by 53% to 47% margin, thus being re-elected as party leader./nIn the Azores 2020 regional elections, the PSD was able to return to power, after 24 years in opposition, by forging a controversial deal with CHEGA, plus CDS, PPM and IL.[20] The PSD won almost 34% of the votes, while the PS fell more than 7\u00a0pp, compared with 2016, to 39%, an unexpected result, and overall the right wing parties had a 1-seat majority over all the left.[21] After 2020, the PSD controls the governments of Portugal's only two autonomous regions./nThe 2021 local elections were quite positive for the PSD, despite not winning the most mayors in the country as a whole.[22] The party, and its led-coalitions, won a combined 32% of the votes and were able to win, from the PS, several cities like Coimbra, Funchal and Barcelos. The main gain of the PSD was the victory in Lisbon, where Carlos Moedas defeated, against all odds and predictions, the PS incumbent mayor Fernando Medina.[23] In October 2021, disagreements between the PS and BE-CDU led to the rejection of the 2022 budget and the calling of a snap general election for 30 January 2022.[24] Despite a close race predicted by polls, the PSD suffered a big setback by winning just 29% of the votes and seeing the PS gaining a surprise absolute majority, with 41% of the votes.[25] After the election, PSD leader Rui Rio opened the process to elect a new party leader.[26] On 28 May 2022, Lu\u00eds Montenegro was elected party leader by a landslide, gathering more than 72% of the votes.[27]/nThe party was founded based on classical social democracy[7] and was a centre[28][29] to centre-left[30] party, but later it evolved into catch-all centre-right party. The party has been described as liberal-conservative,[5][6] conservative,[7][31] or conservative-liberal,[32] with Christian democratic, liberal and economically liberal elements.[30][33][34]/nThe PSD is frequently referred to as a party that is not ideology-based, but rather a power party (partido do poder).[35] It frequently adopts a functional big tent party strategy to win elections.[35] Due to this strategy, which most trace to Cavaco Silva's leadership,[36] the party is made up of many factions, mostly centre-right (including liberal democrats, Christian democrats and neoconservatives) as well as quasi-social-democrats and former communists:/nThe main faction when the party was created, throughout the party's history rightist politicians joined them to have a greater chance of gaining power and influencing the country's politics (see liberals, conservatives, right-wing populists and neoliberals). They do not follow traditional social democracy, but Portuguese social democracy as defined by Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro's actions and writings, which includes a degree of centrist and leftist populism. They followed a kind of anti-class struggle party/cross-class party strategy. All the other members of the party claim to follow this line. Among its representatives were most of the leaders between Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro and Cavaco Silva, Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim (also a founding member and an anti-neoliberal) and to an extent Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes (who called the PSD the \"moderate left party\")[37] identified himself with a centre-left matrix and a united left strategy and defended a more open party on issues like abortion.[38] Jos\u00e9 Mendes Bota is another left-wing populist.[39] The Portuguese social-democrats are centered around the Grupo da Boavista (Boavista Group)./nFollow traditional social democracy. They share with the Portuguese social democrats their presence at the creation of the party and \"a non-Marxist progressivist line\".[40] Many of them (former party leader Ant\u00f3nio Sousa Franco, party co-founder Magalh\u00e3es Mota, writer and feminist Nat\u00e1lia Correia) supported the Op\u00e7\u00f5es Inadi\u00e1veis (Pressing Options) manifesto,[41] and then left to create the Independent Social Democrat Association (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Social Democrata Independente, ASDI)[42] and the Social Democrat Movement (Movimento Social Democrata, MSD),[43] forming electoral coalitions (later merging with) the Socialist Party during the 1970s\u20131980s. Some took part in the Democratic Renovator Party. A later example of a European-style Social democrat leaving the party for the Socialists is activist and politician Helena Roseta. The ones still in the party adapted to its current right-wing outlook or Portuguese social democracy. They today include former communists-turned centre-leftists, like Zita Seabra. Dur\u00e3o Barroso might have moved from Thatcherism to social democracy.[44] Ironically, both Social Democrat factions were represented in the 2008 party elections by Manuela Ferreira Leite, economically neoliberal and socially conservative (often compared to Thatcher)./nThe other main faction at creation. The PSD was always more successful in the Northern and rural areas of the country. When Sousa Franco and his SPD-inspired social democrats started their break with the rest of the party he referred to a division between \"a rural wing, led by S\u00e1 Carneiro, and an urban wing, more moderate and truly social democratic, close to the positions of Helmut Schmidt\"[45] Due to the electoral influence of ruralism on the PSD's politics they may be seen inside of or influencing most factions./nDue to the Salazarist connotation of the term right-wing[46] and all terms connected (liberal and conservative) after the Carnation Revolution, the little attractiveness of economic liberalism in European politics,[47] no specific liberal or conservative party was formed in post-1974 Portugal, except the experiences of the Catholic Action-monarchist Liberal Party in 1974[48] and the centrist liberal Democratic Renovator Party, so they started working inside the PSD. This strategy of joining \"socialism and liberalism under the same hat\"[35] was especially successful during Cavaco Silva's leadership, when the party gave up its candidacy to the Socialist International and became member of the Liberal International and European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group, leaving the international and the European party and group in 1996 to join the Christian Democrat International (today Centrist Democrat International), the European People's Party and the European People's Party-European Democrats. Since then, the liberal-social democrat rift (or even the liberal-conservative-populist-social democrat rift) has plagued the party's cohesion and actions.[49][50] Dur\u00e3o Barroso (a former revolutionary Maoist who switched sides in the 1980s) is sometimes referred to as the most pure liberal of the party.[51] In terms of social liberals, some try to link both social democracy and social liberalism to the PSD,[52] to refer to the early PSD as liberal[53] or partly social liberal[54] party and social liberalism is sometimes identified with the social market economy tradition the party traditionally supported.[55] Even members of the Portuguese Social Liberal Movement admit the traditional and current presence of social liberals (and other liberals) on the PSD.[56]/nSome claim the PSD as the party from Christian democracy and social Christianity from the beginning,[57] or having these currents as part of its legacy.[54] Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is one of the main preachers of Social Christianity inside the PSD. As is Paulo Rangel.[58]/nDistinct from radical right-wing populists, the populist centre and centre-left social democrats (like Jo\u00e3o Jardim and S\u00e1 Carneiro), the populist overlappers (like Cavaco Silva), and the Eurosceptic populists of the Democratic and Social Centre\u2013People's Party (CDS-PP). They are social-economic liberal conservative/conservative liberal and moderate culturally religious conservatives and internationalist national conservatives. Their main representative is Pedro Santana Lopes. Though the main right-wing populists were present at the founding of the party (like Santana Lopes), they were clearly right-wing, recruited when their abilities were noticed in educated circles and universities,[59] with minor agreements with S\u00e1 Carneiro's philosophy. Frequently as the PSD is a bipartisanship party, right-wing populists from the CDS-PP join the party. Lu\u00eds Filipe Meneses is frequently described as a populist but he tried to lead the party back to a left line,[60] and does not identify or act like the liberal conservative/conservative liberal populists./nWith the post-revolutionary opposition to the right (see above in liberal) no specific conservative party was founded in Portugal; conservatives acted inside the CDS-PP and the PSD. Frequently linked with the neoliberals, pure conservatives are rare in the party as the usual partisan or politician of the party is economically moderate, but socially conservative. One of the rare exceptions of a pure conservative in this party was former party member and MP Vasco Pulido Valente, who is highly elitist and a cultural purist (unlike most of the party's partisans, who have various degrees of populism or meritocracy), highly conservative and traditionalist.[61]/nMostly former communists and leftists who supported the policies of the Bush administration and defend similar views in Portuguese politics. The main example is Jos\u00e9 Pacheco Pereira[62][63] (though his support of the Bush doctrine on the invasion of Iraq is sometimes challenged.[64] They are frequently referred to as \"Cavaco-ists\" due to their support of cavacoism's legacy and candidates representative of it, like Cavaco Silva himself and Ferreira Leite, defending the position that they should take a hard stance on the left and its social liberalism).[65]/nNeoliberal tendencies were introduced in Portuguese economy by Cavaco Silva, removing socialism from the constitution and finishing the de-collectivization of the economy started with S\u00e1 Carneiro. Cavaco (a self-described neo-Keynesian) never employed a totally Reaganite or Thatcherite strategy, maintaining a social democrat matrix and many (right and left-wing) populist and neo-Keynesian policies. Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim described the inconsistent neoliberalism of the PSD as \"those Chicago Boys have some funny ideas, but when election time arrives the old Keynesianism is still what counts\".[66] Cavaco Silva and Dur\u00e3o Barroso are both sometimes referred to as the closest to neo-liberal leaders of the party.[67] The main pure representative of the streak is Manuela Ferreira Leite, but even she called herself a social democrat and explained \"I'm not certainly liberal, I'm also not populist\"[68] and lead the social democratic factions during internal party rifts, though she accepts the nickname \"Portuguese iron lady\" and comparisons to Thatcher if \"[it] means [...] an enormous intransigence on values and in principles, of not abdicating from these values and from these principles and of continuing my way independently of the popularity of my actions and the effects on my image\".[68] The main group (officially non-partisan) associated with the neoliberal faction of the PSD is the Projecto Farol (Lighthouse Project).[69]/nThe average PSD voter and partisan since Cavaco Silva's leadership. Cavaco himself, though a self-described Neo-Keynesian, an early member of the party since its centre-left days and a man with social-liberal and centrist populist economic policy tendencies, he is personally a social conservative (opposing same-sex marriage[70] and abortion) and a practicing Catholic.[71] As such, Cavacoism should be considered a \"hybrid\" or a political syncretism.[72] A similar case is Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura, who claims to be an economic social democrat but opposes gay people serving in the military and is a self-described \"centre-left reactionary\".[73] The overlappers are mainly represented in the forums gathered by the District of Oporto section of the party, which during the 2009 European elections tried to gather the ideas of all factions./nNot to be confused with overlappers. Still indecisive between (traditional or Portuguese) social democracy, social liberalism or any other kind of centrism./nAre pragmatic although open to privatization and civil society alternatives to the social state, in speech they move closer to the centre-left origins of the party and are generally proud of them.[74] The main representative of this faction is Pedro Passos Coelho, who claims to be neither left nor right, but that \"the real issues are between old and new\",[75] though his opponents identified him as a liberal (in the conservative-liberal or neoliberal European sense) since the 2008 party election, though he recalled the many meanings of liberal and recalled the left liberalism of the United States Democratic Party,[76] being even called \"PSD's Obama\" by supporters. Centrists and transversalists inside the party share the think tank Construir Ideias (Building Ideas), which Passos Coelho founded and leads.[69] They mix (like the closely allied centrists) calls to privatization with others to more social justice, government regulation and arbitration and strategic governmental involvement in the economy. This faction is in constant rift with the more socially right-wing ones (who have been leading the party for a long time) and also with the overlappers whose hybrid approach they refuse, over the future of the party and its future ideological and philosophical alignments./n/nSeat share in the Portuguese legislative elections/nSource:[77]/nThe orange color is dominant in the PSD symbols since 1974 and the logo is characterized by three arrows, inspired in the Three Arrows political symbol from the German Social Democratic Party during the 1930's against Nazism.

A partial and refined case of this conjecture for elliptic curves over rationals is called the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture or the modularity theorem whose statement he subsequently refined in collaboration with Goro Shimura. The names Taniyama, Shimura and Weil have all been attached to this conjecture, but the idea is essentially due to Taniyama./n\u201cTaniyama's interests were in algebraic number theory and his fame is mainly due to two problems posed by him at the symposium on algebraic number theory held in Tokyo and Nikko in 1955. His meeting with Andr\u00e9 Weil at this symposium was to have a major influence on Taniyama's work. These problems form the basis of a conjecture: every elliptic curve defined over the rational field is a factor of the Jacobian of a modular function field. This conjecture proved to be a major component in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles.\u201d[2]/nIn 1986 Ken Ribet proved that if the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture held, then so would Fermat's Last Theorem, which inspired Andrew Wiles to work for a number of years in secrecy on it, and to prove enough of it to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Owing to the pioneering contribution of Wiles and the efforts of a number of mathematicians, the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture was finally proven in 1999. The original Taniyama conjecture for elliptic curves over arbitrary number fields remains open./nGoro Shimura stated:/nTaniyama was not a very careful person as a mathematician. He made a lot of mistakes. But he made mistakes in a good direction and so eventually he got right answers. I tried to imitate him, but I found out that it is very difficult to make good mistakes.[3] [4]/nIn 1958, Taniyama worked for University of Tokyo as an assistant (joshu), was engaged to be married, and was offered a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. On 17 November 1958, Taniyama committed suicide. He left a note explaining how far he had progressed with his teaching duties, and apologizing to his colleagues for the trouble he was causing them. His suicide note read:/nUntil yesterday I had no definite intention of killing myself. But more than a few must have noticed that lately I have been tired both physically and mentally. As to the cause of my suicide, I don't quite understand it myself, but it is not the result of a particular incident, nor of a specific matter. Merely may I say, I am in the frame of mind that I lost confidence in my future. There may be someone to whom my suicide will be troubling or a blow to a certain degree. I sincerely hope that this incident will cast no dark shadow over the future of that person. At any rate, I cannot deny that this is a kind of betrayal, but please excuse it as my last act in my own way, as I have been doing my own way all my life./nAlthough his note is mostly enigmatic it does mention tiredness and a loss of confidence in his future. Taniyama's ideas had been criticized as unsubstantiated and his behavior had occasionally been deemed peculiar. Goro Shimura mentioned that he suffered from depression. Taniyama also mentioned in the note his concern that some might be harmed by his suicide and his hope that the act would not cast \"a dark shadow over that person.\"/nAbout a month later, Misako Suzuki, the woman whom he was planning to marry, also committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, leaving a note reading:\n\"We promised each other that no matter where we went, we would never be separated. Now that he is gone, I must go too in order to join him.\"/nAfter Taniyama's death, Goro Shimura stated that:/nHe was always kind to his colleagues, especially to his juniors, and he genuinely cared about their welfare. He was the moral support of many of those who came into mathematical contact with him, including of course myself. Probably he was never conscious of this role he was playing. But I feel his noble generosity in this respect even more strongly now than when he was alive. And yet nobody was able to give him any support when he desperately needed it.

He was the first Black person in history to receive a PhD in mathematics, which he earned at Cornell University in 1925./nCox was born in Evansville, Indiana to Johnson D. Cox, a Kentucky-born teacher active in the church, and Eugenia Talbot Cox. He grew up with his parents, maternal grandmother and two brothers in a racially mixed neighborhood; in 1900, in his block, there were three Black and five white families./nCox went to a segregated college with inadequate resources. Cox was offered a scholarship to study violin at the Prague Conservatory of Music, but chose to pursue his interest in mathematics instead.[1]/nCox studied at Indiana University Bloomington. Besides mathematics, Cox also took courses in German, English, Latin, history, hygiene, chemistry, education, philosophy and physics. Cox's brother Avalon went to Indiana University as well. There were three other Black students in his class. He received his bachelor's degree in 1917, at a time when the transcript of every Black student had the word \"Colored\" printed across it. He received A's on all his exams while at Indiana.[1]/nAfter he graduated in 1917, Cox joined the U.S. Army to fight  in France during World War I from 1918 to 1919.[1] After he was discharged from the Army, he began his career as a high school math tutor./nCox returned to pursue a career in teaching, as an instructor of mathematics at a high school in Henderson, Kentucky. In the autumn of 1919, he was appointed as a professor in physics, chemistry and biology at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina where he also became chairman of the Department of Natural Sciences.[1] He would continue there until 1922.[2]/nIn December 1921, he applied for a graduate scholarship at Cornell University, one of seven American universities with a doctoral program in mathematics. One of his references wrote a positive letter followed by another letter anticipating difficulties for him because he was a \"colored man\".[3] Because Cornell's founder, Ezra Cornell, had been an early opponent of slavery, Cornell University was an appropriate place to study for an African American at the time.[citation needed] Cox was approved May 5, 1922, and enrolled in the autumn of the same year./nCox was very successful at Cornell. Important to him was a young instructor, William Lloyd Garrison Williams, a co-founder of the Canadian Mathematical Congress who became chair of Cox's \"special committee\" in March 1923, and was his supervisor. Cox received the Erastus Brooks fellowship in Mathematics ($400 per year) in autumn 1924 and followed Williams to McGill University in Montreal.[citation needed] He moved back to Cornell in the spring semester of 1925, and finished his dissertation, The polynomial solutions of the difference equation of(x+1) + bf(x) = \u03c6(x), in the summer of the same year.[4] On September 26, 1925, he received his Ph.D. He was certainly the first African American to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics, and most likely the first black man in the world to do so. He did not publish a paper until 1934.[citation needed]/nAt Cornell, Cox had had to endure different difficulties while pursuing his doctorate; the Ku Klux Klan was active in his area which killed 31 African Americans across the country in 1926.[1]/nOn 16 September 1925, Cox began teaching mathematics and physics at the then all-black, poorly funded West Virginia State College. Professors with a PhD were rare there, and his international connections made him stand out as well. He received a salary of $1,800 (equivalent to $30,000 in 2022). His influence can be seen in the large number of changes in the curriculum between 1925 and 1928. In 1927, he married Beulah Kaufman, the daughter of a former slave. She was a teacher at an elementary school, and worked with Cox's brother Avalon. He and Beulah had met in 1921 and had courted for six years. Their first child, James, was born in 1928. In 1929, Cox joined the faculty of Howard University and moved to Washington, D.C./nCox started to teach at Howard University in September 1930. Despite his credentials, he was outranked by other professors such as William Bauduit and Charles Syphax. Both had published multiple papers; it was only now that Cox published his graduation paper. Williams, his supervisor, tried to pursue recognition for Cox from a university in another country but had difficulties in doing so. Different universities in England and Germany refused to consider his thesis, but the Tohoku Imperial University in Sendai, Japan did recognize it. It was published in the T\u00f4hoku Mathematical Journal in 1934.[1] He was, however, very active in teaching: the university's president, James M. Nabrit, remarked that Cox had directed more Master's Degree students than any other professor at Howard University. His students also performed better than those of other professors, and he was a popular professor. Among his students was his son Elbert Lucien Cox, and William Schieffelin Claytor, the third African-American to get a Ph.D. in mathematics. Cox was promoted to professor in 1947.[1] In 1957, he became head of the Department of Mathematics, a position which he held until 1961.[2] He retired in 1965 at the age of 70, three years before his death.[2] His portrait hangs in Howard University's common room.[2]/nDuring World War II, Cox taught engineering science and war management from 1942 to 1944.[1]/nDuring his life, Cox published two articles. He expanded on the work Niels N\u00f6rlund had done on Euler polynomials as a solution to a particular difference equation.[2] Cox used generalized Euler polynomials and the generalized Boole summation formula to expand on the Boole summation formula. He also studied a number of specialized polynomials as solutions for certain differential equations. In his other paper, published in 1947, he mathematically compared three systems of grading.[3]/nWhile Cox did not live to see the inauguration of Howard's mathematics PhD, he significantly contributed to its launching, as detailed in his obituary:/n\"While Cox did not live to see the inauguration of the Ph.D. program at Howard, it is believed by many that Cox did much to make it possible. Cox helped to build up the department to the point that the Ph.D. program became a practical next step. He gave the department a great deal of credibility; primarily because of this personal prestige as a mathematician, as being the first black to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics, because of the nature and kinds of appointments to the faculty that were made while he chaired the Department, and because of the kinds of students that he attracted to Howard to study mathematics at both the undergraduate and master's levels.\"[1]/nThe National Association of Mathematicians established the Cox\u2013Talbot Address in his honor, which is annually delivered at the NAM's national meetings.

Royen came to prominence in the spring of 2017 for a relatively simple proof for the Gaussian Correlation Inequality (GCI), a conjecture that originated in the 1950s, which he had published three years earlier without much recognition.[1] A proof of this conjecture, which lies at the intersection of geometry, probability theory and statistics, had eluded top experts for decades.[2]/nRoyen was born in 1947 to Paul Royen, a professor with the institute for inorganic chemistry at the Goethe University Frankfurt and Elisabeth Royen, also a chemist. From 1966 to 1971, he studied mathematics and physics at his father's university and the University of Freiburg. After graduating, he worked as a tutor at the University of Freiburg, before transferring to the Technical University of Dortmund for his doctoral thesis.

Starting in 1985 until becoming an emeritus in 2010, he taught statistics and mathematics at the University of Applied Sciences Bingen in Rhineland-Palatinate.[3]/nRoyen worked mainly on probability distributions, in particular multivariate chi-squares and gamma distributions, to improve some frequently used statistical test procedures. Nearly half of his circa 30 publications were written when he was aged over sixty. Because he was annoyed over some contradictory reviews and in a few cases also over the incompetence of a referee, he decided in his later years, when his actions had no influence anymore on his further career, to publish his papers on the online platform arXiv.org and sometimes in a less renowned Indian journal to fulfill, at least formally, the condition of a peer review.[4]/nOn 17 July 2014, a few years after his retirement, when brushing his teeth, Royen had a flash of insight: how to use the Laplace transform of the multivariate gamma distribution to achieve a relatively simple proof for the Gaussian correlation inequality, a conjecture on the intersection of geometry, probability theory and statistics, formulated after work by Dunnett and Sobel (1955) and the American statistician Olive Jean Dunn (1958),[5] that had remained unsolved since then. He sent a copy of his proof to Donald Richards, an acquainted American mathematician, who had worked on a proof of the GCI for 30 years. Richards immediately saw the validity of Royen's proof and subsequently helped him to transform the mathematical formulas into LaTeX. When Royen contacted other reputed mathematicians, though, they didn't bother to investigate his proof, because Royen was relatively unknown, and these mathematicians therefore estimated the chance that Royen's proof would be false as very high.[2]/nRoyen published this proof in an article with the title A simple proof of the Gaussian correlation conjecture extended to multivariate gamma distributions on arXiv[6] and subsequently in the Far East Journal of Theoretical Statistics,[7] a relatively unknown periodical based in Allahabad, India, for which Royen was at the time voluntarily working as a referee himself. Due to this, his proof went at first largely unnoticed by the scientific community,[8] until in late 2015 two Polish mathematicians, Rafa\u0142 Lata\u0142a and Dariusz Matlak, wrote a paper in which they reorganized Royen's proof in a way that was intended to be easier to follow.[1] In July 2015, Royen supplemented his proof with a further paper in arXiv Some probability inequalities for multivariate gamma and normal distributions.[9]/nA 2017 article by Natalie Wolchover about Royen's proof in Quanta Magazine resulted in greater academic and public recognition for his achievement.[10][11]", "70415001": "Peter Sz\u00fcsz (11 November 1924 \u2013 16 February 2008)[1] was a Serbian-Hungarian-American mathematician known[2] for his proof (1961) of the Gauss-Kuzmin Theorem, his work in probabilistic number theory, and his book with Andrew M.

The Birmingham University Mid-term Mathematical Puzzles were a take-home competition for 11- to 15-year-olds and 16- to 18-year-olds, reaching figures of 3,500 and 1,200 participants respectively./nEstablished by Gardiner under the name of the United Kingdom Mathematics Foundation, the National Mathematics Teachers' Summer School ran for three years, from 2007 to 2009. These were intensive six-day events for 60\u201390 teachers, with the first aimed at more experienced teachers with the intention that they would pass the skills to others at their schools, and later courses aimed at newer teachers at the beginning of their careers.[19] The first summer school was sponsored by the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics with additional sponsorship from Trinity College, Cambridge, the TDA and the Nuffield Foundation, and was held at Robinson College, Cambridge. Speakers included Simon Singh, Robin Wilson, Colin Wright, and Rob Eastaway./nGardiner has authored or coauthored 15 books on mathematics education:/nGardiner has also contributed to School Mathematics Project writing groups since 1978.[20]", "3011234": "Gilbert Ames Bliss, (9 May 1876 \u2013 8 May 1951), was an American mathematician, known for his work on the calculus of variations./nBliss grew up in a Chicago family that eventually became affluent; in 1907, his father became president of the company supplying all of Chicago's electricity. The family was not affluent, however, when Bliss entered the University of Chicago in 1893 (its second year of operation). Hence he had to support himself while a student by winning a scholarship, and by playing in a student professional mandolin quartet./nAfter obtaining the B.Sc. in 1897, he began graduate studies at Chicago in mathematical astronomy (his first publication was in that field), switching in 1898 to mathematics. He discovered his life's work, the calculus of variations, via the lecture notes of Weierstrass's 1879 course, and Bolza's teaching. Bolza went on to supervise Bliss's Ph.D. thesis, The Geodesic Lines on the Anchor Ring, completed in 1900 and published in the Annals of Mathematics in 1902. After two years as an instructor at the University of Minnesota, Bliss spent the 1902\u201303 academic year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, interacting with Felix Klein, David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, Ernst Zermelo, Erhard Schmidt, Max Abraham, and Constantin Carath\u00e9odory./nUpon returning to the United States, Bliss taught one year each at the University of Chicago and the University of Missouri. In 1904, he published two more papers on the calculus of variations in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. Bliss was a Preceptor at Princeton University, 1905\u201308, joining a strong group of young mathematicians that included Luther P. Eisenhart, Oswald Veblen, and Robert Lee Moore. While at Princeton he was also an associate editor of the Annals of Mathematics./nIn 1908, Chicago's Maschke died and Bliss was hired to replace him; Bliss remained at Chicago until his 1941 retirement. While at Chicago, he was an editor of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 1908\u201316, and chaired the Mathematics Department, 1927\u201341. That Department was less distinguished under Bliss than it had been under E. H. Moore's previous leadership, and than it would become under Marshall Stone's and Saunders MacLane's direction after World War II. A near-contemporary of Bliss's at Chicago was the algebraist Leonard Dickson./nDuring World War I, he worked on ballistics, designing new firing tables for artillery, and lectured on navigation. In 1918, he and Oswald Veblen worked together in the Range Firing Section at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, applying the calculus of variations to correct shell trajectories for the effects of wind, changes in air density, the rotation of the Earth, and other perturbations./nBliss married Helen Hurd in 1912, who died in the 1918 influenza pandemic; their two children survived. Bliss married Olive Hunter in 1920; they had no children./nBliss was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1916.[1] He was the American Mathematical Society's Colloquium Lecturer (1909), Vice President (1911), and President (1921\u201322). He received the Mathematical Association of America's first Chauvenet Prize, in 1925, for his article \"Algebraic functions and their divisors,\"[2] which culminated in his 1933 book Algebraic functions. He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[3][4]/nBliss once headed a government commission that devised rules for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the several states./nBliss's work on the calculus of variations culminated in his classic 1946 monograph, Lectures on the Calculus of Variations, which treated the subject as an end in itself and not as an adjunct of mechanics. Here Bliss achieved a substantial simplification of the transformation theories of Clebsch and Weierstrass. Bliss also strengthened the necessary conditions of Euler, Weierstrass, Legendre, and Jacobi into sufficient conditions. Bliss set out the canonical formulation and solution of the problem of Bolza with side conditions and variable end-points. Bliss's Lectures more or less constitutes the culmination of the classic calculus of variations of Weierstrass, Hilbert, and Bolza. Subsequent work on variational problems would strike out in new directions, such as Morse theory, optimal control, and dynamic programming./nBliss also studied singularities of real transformations in the plane.", "69857957": "Marcus Junius Nipsus (or Nypsus) was a second-century Roman gromatic writer,[1][2][3] who also dealt with various mathematical questions. His surviving writings are preserved in the Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum, a compilation of Latin works on land surveying made in the 4th or 5th centuries AD.[4]/nA work in the Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum is introduced with the words incipit Marci Iuni Nipsi liber II feliciter (\"Here begins Marcus Junius Nipsus' second book, well\"). Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about this individual. In his work, he gives no information on himself and no other references to him have survived. The text often addresses the reader directly, e.g. cum in agro assignato veneris (\"when you come to an assigned piece of land\", Nipsius La 286.12) which suggests that it was intended as a practical handbook and it is generally agreed that it was written in the 2nd century AD.[5]/nThe work is only transmitted in a fragmentary state. Scholars differ on exactly which texts should be ascribed to Nipsius. Some ascribe texts attributed to him to another gromatic writer, Agennius Urbicus, instead, others ascribe additional texts to Nipsius.[6] In general, the opinion of Karl lachmann is accepted, which attributes the following three texts to him:/nThese works are included in the oldest manuscript of the Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum, the Codex Arcerianus in Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Other works are only found in more recent manuscripts. Jelle Bouma has edited the first two works with English translation and thorough explanatory notes./nNipsus explains how to measure the width of a river when the other bank is not accessible (e.g., because a hostile force has occupied it). He seeks out a clear landmark on the other bank, like a tall tree. This forms one corner of a right-angled triangle which he constructs. One cathetus (short side) goes in a straight line from the landmark to the surveyor's position. The second cathetus is drawn from the surveyor's position along a path approximately parallel to the riverbank. Halfway along this path, a measuring instrument (ferramentum, groma) is placed, and the hypotenuse (long side) of the triangle runs from this instrument to the landmark on the other side of the river. Then the surveyor constructs a second right-angled triangle, which is the same size as the first one. The hypotenuse of the second triangle continues the hypotenuse of the first triangle and is recorded with a mark on the land. One cathetus is the continuation of the path along the riverbank, the second cathetus goes inland, joining up with the hypotenuse of the second triangle. The length of this second cathetus will be equal to the width of the river./nBecause of the requirement to form the long path along the river bank and the marking lines, this method is quite time consuming. No attempt is made to apply the mathematically \"sophisticated\" intercept theorem, which had been known since the first century AD. The task of measuring the width of a river is also referred to by the surveyor Balbus (Ca 204.24), without providing a solution, and by Frontinus (Ca 14.12)./nIn the first part of this text (Nipsus, La 286.12-288.17), Nipsus describes how a surveyor restores boundaries and boundary stones in an area that was surveyed long ago and has subsequently fallen into disrepair, with the boundary lines obscured and the stones lost. Using the few remaining boundary stones, he attempts to extend the boundary lines using the orientation of the stones. In the following part (Nipsius, La 288.18-289.17), it is explained how plots of land are formed between different long limites (\"boundary lines\"). It is possible to produce plots that are not rectangular. Attached drawings clarify the situation.[8] In the third part (Nipsus, La 289.18-295.15), Nipsus describes the division of land into square plots based on a decumanus and a cardo.[9] He goes into various special cases and also explains the subseciva\u00a0[de], the plots of wasteland left over in the surveying process./nAfter some basic definitions of Euclidean geometry and units of volume, this work focusses on trigonometry. The information might be sourced mainly from the Metrica or Geometrica of Hero of Alexandria.[10] However, the excerpts are fragmentary and marred by many reduplications. While Hero discusses the underlying mathematical theory, like the Pythagorean theorem, Nipsus provides only numerical \"recipies\".[11] In particular, he uses Pythagorean triples (sets of three whole numbers, which form the sides of right-angled triangles). To demonstrate a formula for how one can construct a right-angled triangle using any odd whole number as the length of the shortest cathetus, he naturally uses the 3-4-5 triple:/n\u2014Nipsus, La, p. 300.1\u20135/nHero of Alexander treated the same calculation of the 3-4-5 triple,[12] but he gives the actual Pythagorean theorem:/na\u00b2+ b\u00b2=c\u00b2\na\u00b2 + ((a\u00b2 - 1)/2)\u00b2 = ((a\u00b2 - 1)/2 + 1)\u00b2/nNipsus' text never mentions Pythagoras or Euclid by name. Nipsus' calculations have little practical use and are more practice exercises for scholars. Thus, for two Pythagorean triples Nipsus also calculates how further values might be determined, if the sum of the catheti, the hypotenuse and the area are known.[13]", "59536038": "Charles Tweedie FRSE (27 June 1868\u201314 September 1925) was a Scottish mathematician and mathematical historian./nTweedie was born in Swinton on 27 June 1868, the son of Charlotte Lugton (1836\u20131909) and George Tweedie (1837\u20131905) a schoolmaster originally from Cleish.

He attended Hymers College and from there he won an open scholarship in mathematics and natural science to study at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1914, gaining the largest number of marks which had ever been awarded in the examination.[citation needed] In 1916 he joined a group of mathematicians led by A. V. Hill for the Ministry of munitions working on the ballistics of anti-aircraft gunnery, they became known as \u2032Hill's Brigands\u2032.  Later Milne became an expert on sound localisation.[7]  In 1917 he became a lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve.  He was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1919\u20131925, being assistant director of the solar physics observatory, 1920\u20131924, mathematical lecturer at Trinity, 1924\u20131925, and university lecturer in astrophysics, 1922\u20131925. He was Beyer professor of applied mathematics, Victoria University of Manchester, 1924\u20131928, before his appointment as Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics and to a fellowship at Wadham College, Oxford, in 1928. Milne's earlier work was in mathematical astrophysics. Much of his research in the 1930s was concerned with the theory of relativity and cosmology. His later work, concerned with the interior structure of stars, aroused controversy. Milne was President of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1943\u20131945.  During World War II he again worked on ballistics./nMilne married Margaret Scott Campbell on 26\u00a0June 1928 at Withington, Manchester. Campbell, from Dornoch, Sutherland, Scotland, was the daughter of Hugh Fraser Campbell, an advocate in Aberdeen. Milne's brother, Geoffrey, then a lecturer in agricultural chemistry at the University of Leeds, was best man.[8] Margaret Scott Milne died on the 5\u00a0October 1938 at Oxford.[9] He married secondly, Beatrice Brevoort Renwick, the third daughter of William Whetten Renwick, on 22\u00a0June 1940 at St Andrew's Church, Oxford.[10][11] William Whetten was the nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., and designed Saints Peter and Paul, a Roman Catholic cathedral in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States.[12] Beatrice Brevoort Milne died at Oxford on 28\u00a0August 1945, aged just 32 years.[13] Milne died of a heart attack in Dublin, Ireland, while preparing to give a set of lectures. These can be found written down in one of his last published books: Modern Cosmology and the Christian Idea of God (1952)./nIn the 1920s much of Milne's research was concerned with stars, particularly the outer layers known as stellar atmospheres that produce the radiation observed from the Earth. He considered a grey atmosphere, a simplifying approximation in which the strength of the absorption of light by the hot ionized gas is the same at all wavelengths. This produced predictions of how temperature varies through the atmosphere, including the mathematical expression now known as the Milne Equation. He also calculated how the intensity of light from a star varies with wavelength on the basis of this model.[14][15]/nMilne moved on to consider the more realistic case where the strength of the absorption of light by gas within stars (expressed by the absorption coefficient) does vary with wavelength. Using simplifying assumptions he calculated how for the Sun\nthe strength of the absorption depends on wavelength. His results could not be explained adequately at the time, but later\nnegatively-charged hydrogen ions (H\u2212) were shown to be a major contributor to Milne's results.[15]/nMilne, working with Ralph H. Fowler, studied how the strengths of spectral lines of stars depend on their spectral type. In doing this they applied the work of Meghnad Saha about the ionization of gases to stellar atmospheres.[15]/nMilne worked on the structures and interiors of stars in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He often took opinions opposed to those of Arthur Eddington.[15]/nFrom the early 1930s, Milne's interests focused increasingly on relativity theory and cosmology.[16]/nFrom 1932 he worked on the problem of the \"expanding universe\" and in Relativity, Gravitation, and World-Structure (1935), proposed an alternative to Albert Einstein's general relativity theory. With McCrea (1934) he also showed that the 3 models which form the foundations of modern cosmology first proposed by Friedmann (1922) using the general theory of relativity, can also be derived using only Newtonian mechanics.[17]/nMilne's alternative to general relativity theory based on kinematics was known as Kinematic Relativity. His theory was built on the special but not general theory of relativity. Because of this it has been described as a \"nonrelativistic cosmology\".[18] Milne\u2019s theory met with opposition from others but inspired the steady-state theorists.[19]/nThe main difference between the Milne model of an expanding universe, and the current (Einstein's) model of an expanding universe was that Milne did not assume a priori that the universe has a homogeneous matter distribution.  He did not include the gravitation interaction into the model either./nMilne argued that under the context of Einstein's special relativity, and the relativity of simultaneity, that it is impossible for a nonstatic universe to be homogeneous.  Namely, if the universe is spreading out, its density is decreasing over time, and that if two regions appeared to be at the same density at the same time to one observer, they would not appear to be the same density at the same time to another observer.  However, if each observer measures its local density at the same agreed-upon proper time, the measured density should be the same.  In Minkowskian coordinates, this constant proper time forms a hyperbolic surface which extends infinitely to the light-cone of the event of creation. This is true even when proper time approaches 0, the time of the creation.  The universe is already infinite at the creation time!/nMilne's model is, therefore, that of a sphere, with an approximately homogeneous matter distribution within several billion light years of the center which then increases to an infinite density.  It can be shown that this infinite density is actually the density of the universe when at the time of the big bang.  The spherical distribution is unique in that it is essentially the same after a Lorentz transformation, except that a different stationary particle is at the center.  As it is the only distribution that has this property, it is the only distribution which could satisfy the cosmological principle of \"no preferred reference frame.\" Based on this cosmological principle Milne created a model that can be described entirely within Euclidean geometry./nAs of 1935, using this model, Milne published a prediction of the cosmic background radiation which appears to be of a much different character than that predicted by Eddington.  In fact, many passages in Relativity, Gravitation and World Structure are devoted to attacking Eddington's preconceptions./nMilne was a Christian theist.[20][21] In 1950, Milne gave ten lectures on Christianity and cosmology for the Edward Cadbury lectures which he was invited to give at the University of Birmingham. The lectures were published in the book Modern Cosmology and the Christian Idea of God, edited by Gerald James Whitrow and published in 1952.[20]/nMilne was a theistic evolutionist who held the view that God intervenes with \"deft touches\" to steer mutations in the right direction.[22]", "58913527": "Roland Speicher (born 12 June 1960) is a German mathematician, known for his work on free probability theory.

Later, over beers with friends from other disciplines, Deakin found the name for the new journal, Function.[11] The journal was published from 1977 to 2004, and Deakin became a founding member of its editorial board, its most frequent contributor, and, for much of its existence, its editor-in-chief.[7]/nDeakin published the first of his several articles on Hypatia in 1992 in Function.[7]\nIn 2007, he published the book Hypatia of Alexandria: Mathematician and Martyr (Prometheus Books).[12][13][14] Aimed at a popular audience, the book is \"at least in part, a response to Maria Dzielska's Hypatia of Alexandria\", which had focused on the historical and literary legacy of Hypatia at the expense of her mathematics, and which Deakin had previously reviewed for the American Mathematical Monthly.[15] In his book, Deakin organizes the work of other scholars on Hypatia's mathematics, particularly relying on the earlier work of Wilbur Knorr, rather than formulating new theories on this aspect of Hypatia's work.[12][13] He argues that, unlike some other neoplatonists of her time, Hypatia was not opposed to Christianity, and that the Christian mob that killed her likely misunderstood her philosophical position.[13] However, his book has been criticized for treating Hypatia more as an idealized icon, or a caricature of a female mathematician, than as a realistic person of her times.[15]", "488196": "Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand (French pronunciation: [\u0292oz\u025bf lwi f\u0281\u0251\u0303swa b\u025b\u0281t\u0281\u0251\u0303]; 11 March 1822 \u2013 5 April 1900) was a French mathematician who worked in the fields of number theory, differential geometry, probability theory, economics and thermodynamics.[1]/nJoseph Bertrand was the son of physician Alexandre Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand and the brother of archaeologist Alexandre Bertrand. His father died when Joseph was only nine years old, but that did not stand in his way of learning and understanding algebraic and elementary geometric concepts, and he also could speak Latin fluently, all when he was of the same age of nine.\nAt eleven years old he attended the course of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as an auditor (open courses). From age eleven to seventeen, he obtained two bachelor's degrees, a license and a PhD with a thesis on the mathematical theory of electricity and is admitted first to the 1839 entrance examination of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. Bertrand was a professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and Coll\u00e8ge de France, and was a member of the Paris Academy of Sciences where he was its permanent secretary for twenty-six years./nHe conjectured, in 1845, that there is at least one prime between n and 2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 for every n\u00a0>\u00a03. Chebyshev proved this conjecture, now called Bertrand's postulate, in 1850. He was also famous for a paradox in the field of probability, now known as Bertrand's Paradox. There is another paradox in game theory that is named after him, called the Bertrand Paradox. In 1849, he was the first to define real numbers using what is now called a Dedekind cut.[2][3]/nBertrand translated into French Carl Friedrich Gauss's work on the theory of errors and the method of least squares./nIn the field of economics, he reviewed the work on oligopoly theory, specifically the Cournot Competition Model (1838) of French mathematician Antoine Augustin Cournot. His Bertrand Competition Model (1883) argued that Cournot had reached a very misleading conclusion, and he reworked it using prices rather than quantities as the strategic variables, thus showing that the equilibrium price was simply the competitive price./nHis book Thermodynamique points out in Chapter XII, that thermodynamic entropy and temperature are only defined for reversible processes. He was one of the first people to point this out./nIn 1858 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.", "6583046": "Ronald Paul \"Ron\" Fedkiw (born February 27, 1968) is a full professor in the Stanford University department of computer science and a leading researcher in the field of computer graphics, focusing on topics relating to physically based simulation of natural phenomena and machine learning.  His techniques have been employed in many motion pictures. He has earned recognition at the 80th Academy Awards and the 87th Academy Awards as well as from the National Academy of Sciences./nHis first Academy Award was awarded for developing techniques that enabled many technically sophisticated adaptations including the visual effects in 21st century movies in the Star Wars, Harry Potter, Terminator, and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises.  Fedkiw has designed a platform that has been used to create many of the movie world's most advanced special effects since it was first used on the T-X character in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. His second Academy Award was awarded for computer graphics techniques for special effects for large scale destruction. Although he has won an Oscar for his work, he does not design the visual effects that use his technique.  Instead, he has developed a system that other award-winning technicians and engineers have used to create visual effects for some of the world's most expensive and highest-grossing movies./nFedkiw was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1968.[1] He received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from UCLA in 1996.[2]  His dissertation was chaired by Stanley Osher.[1]  He completed postdoctoral studies both at UCLA in Mathematics and at Caltech in Aeronautics before joining the Stanford Computer Science Department.[2]  Fedkiw has two daughters: Brittany and Briana.[2]/nFedkiw began working in the movie industry in 1998, working for a company that produced 3-D water simulations. The algorithms they used were known as Navier-Stokes equations.[3]/nFedkiw is now a full professor in the department of computer science at Stanford where he researches computational physics.[3][4] Fedkiw serves on the editorial boards of Journal of Computational Physics and the Journal of Scientific Computing.  He has published Level Set Methods and Dynamic Implicit Surfaces (Springer 2002, ISBN\u00a00-387-95482-1) along with Stanley Osher./nSince 2000, Fedkiw has been a consultant with Industrial Light & Magic receiving screen credits for work on Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith and Poseidon.[5]  In addition, he has worked on all three Pirates of the Caribbean and some Harry Potter movies.[6] Fedkiw's techniques have made possible the renderings of the sea in the Pirates movies and the dragon's flaming breath in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.[7] They have also made possible the rushing floodwaters in Evan Almighty and were first used with T-X in Terminator 3.[8] Fedkiw feels the best result of the use of his techniques was the sinking ship shots in Poseidon.[9] Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest won the Academy Award for Visual Effects at the 79th Academy Awards awarded on February 25, 2007, and Poseidon was also nominated that year in that category.[10]  Among the applications that Fedkiw's math engine is responsible for is the tentacles of Davy Jones (pictured left) in the Academy Award-winning Dead Man's Chest.[5]/nOn February 9, 2008, in the Academy Scientific and Technical Award ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, Fedkiw was awarded an 80th Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the development of the Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) fluid simulation system.[11][12] He shared the award with Nick Rasmussen and Frank Losasso Petterson.[3] Fedkiw does physics-based simulation that enable better water effects. Previous representations had varying levels of success. They often did well at surface representation, but were less efficient at smaller particles such as breaking waves. Fedkiw's team's innovative \"particle level set method\" allows both smooth surfaces and water breakdown renderings including water spray.[9] Fedkiw has worked with Industrial Light & Magic, Pixar Animation Studios, Intel Corporation, Honda and Sony Pictures Imageworks.[5]  Fedkiw commented that when he was informed that he would be presented his award by Jessica Alba he was quoted by the Associated Press as follows: \"They said I got 60 seconds so I might just spend the last 15 realizing I'm 10 feet away from the most beautiful woman on the planet . . . and no restraining order this time.\".[12] On February 7, 2015, he received a second Academy Scientific and Technical Award for the development of the ILM PhysBAM Destruction System.[13]/nFedkiw and his colleagues have designed a C++ code library for Physics Based Modelling (PhysBAM http://physbam.stanford.edu) that facilitates the creation of better special effects for movies, including water, smoke, fire, cloth, rigid bodies and deformable bodies.  Fedkiw often receives screen credit for consulting with special effects engineers, technicians and movie executives.  His research has focused on the design of new computational algorithms that can be used for many purposes, including computational fluid dynamics and soft-body dynamics, computer graphics, computer vision and computational biomechanics.  In fact, the system can also be used for a range of applications from motion capture to rendering, but Fedkiw's main emphasis is on physics-based simulation.[9]/nFedkiw has described his work as follows:/nIt is an exhaustive task to prescribe the motion of every degree of freedom in a piece of clothing or a crashing wave. . .Since these motions are governed by physical processes, it can be difficult to make these phenomena appear natural. Thus, physically based simulation has become quite popular in the special effects industry. The same class of tools useful for computational fluid dynamics is also useful for sinking a ship on the big screen.[5]", "70349581": "Sofiya Ostrovska (born 1958) is a Ukrainian mathematician interested in probability theory and approximation theory, and known for her research on q-Bernstein polynomials, the q-analogs of the Bernstein polynomials.

She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in hysteresis control systems; such applications include guidance systems, electronics, fire-control systems, and temperature regulation. She became the first female engineering professor at Stanford University in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics./nLotz was born in Hamelin, Germany on 16 July 1903.[1] She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films.[2] After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist,[3] was drafted for military service in World War I, the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls' Gymnasium in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family.[4] She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the Leibniz University Hannover to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:[5]/nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.[6]/nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes.[2] In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction./nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in G\u00f6ttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe.[2] She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use.[3] She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally.[7] Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.[2]/nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Fl\u00fcgge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz's career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics.[4] However, Fl\u00fcgge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at G\u00f6ttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Fl\u00fcgge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\".[2] The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt f\u00fcr Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Fl\u00fcgge was appointed Chief of Structures Research.[2] Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann G\u00f6ring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.[8]/nAt DVL Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems.[3] These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application.[9] She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.[2]/nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz and Fl\u00fcgge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany.[10] After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz and Fl\u00fcgge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.[3]/nAlthough Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz's reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.[10]/nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory.[9] At Stanford, Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers.[4] In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.[4]/nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:/nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.[4]/nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.[9]/nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant.[9] The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.[9]/nFl\u00fcgge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag.[3] During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:/nProfessor Fl\u00fcgge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman's intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems.

But in nearly every case Dr. Priestley's interest in the problem ceased when he had solved it to his own satisfaction. The fate of the criminal was a matter of complete unconcern to him. He treated detection much as he would have treated a game of chess. The pieces in the game had no more than a passing interest to him. Not that he was unsympathetic by nature, as many people had good cause to know. But, in the problems which Hanslet set before him, he purposely took a detached and impersonal attitude. Only in this way, as he more than once remarked, was it possible to maintain an impartial judgment\"[4]/nIn the early books, Dr. Priestley assists mainly his friend Chief Inspector Hanslet. In later books, Dr. Priestley becomes an armchair detective and the bulk of the legwork is done by Superintendent Jimmy Waghorn of Scotland Yard and Priestley's secretary and companion, Harold Merefield. Merefield, whom Dr. Priestley cleared of a murder charge in the first book, The Paddington Mystery, is engaged to Dr. Priestley's daughter April. Superintendent Hanslet (now retired) appears in several later works as a dinner guest of Dr. Priestley, passing on his professional wisdom to Waghorn.  Lastly, an old friend of Priestley's, Dr. Oldland, in later novels frequently joins the conclave at the professor's Saturday evening dinners and provides the medical viewpoint attendant on the various cases./n/nThis article about a fictional character from a novel is a stub.

She was a leader of the Mathematical Tables Project in New York from its beginning. She worked later as the assistant director and leader of the Numerical Analysis at UCLA computing division and was head of mathematical research for the Aerospace Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio./nBlanch was born on 2 February 1897 as Gittel Kaimowitz in Kolno to Wolfe Kaimowitz and Dora Blanc.[1] Kolno was historically a part of Poland, but was part of the Russian Empire at the time. Blanch was the youngest of seven[1] or nine[2] children.[1] Wolfe Kaimowitz emigrated to the United States, and in 1907, Dora Blanc, ten-year-old Blanch, and one other daughter joined him in New York.[3][4]/nBlanch attended schools within Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Eastern District High School in 1914.[5] Later that year, Kaimowitz died, so Blanch decided to take a job to support her family. Blanch worked clerical positions for fourteen years (1914-1928), saving money for school along the way.[1][5] She became an American citizen in 1921.[4][5] After her mother died in 1927, Blanch started taking evening classes at Washington Square College, part of New York University. In 1932, Blanch received her Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with a minor in Physics from New York University.[1] She graduated with summa cum laude and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a prestigious academic honor society.[1] That same year, she changed her name from Kaimowitz to Blanch, an Americanized version of her mother's name.[5] After writing her thesis titled \"Properties of the Veneroni Transformation in S4\", she received her Ph.D. from Cornell University in algebraic geometry in 1935.[3]  The results from her thesis were published in the American Journal of Mathematics in 1936.[3][6]/nBlanch was unable to find a job in her area of study after she graduated with her PhD, due to the Great Depression.[1] For a year (1935-1936), she worked in place of a colleague on leave at Hunter College. Afterwards, she worked a clerical position.[1]/nBlanch enrolled in an evening course on relativity at Brooklyn College, instructed by Arnold Lowan.[4]  Upon learning of Blanch's PhD in mathematics, Lowan extended an invitation to Blanch to join the Works Progress Administration project, where she was assigned to a supervisory position.[1][4] In February 1938, she began work on the Mathematical Tables Project of the WPA, for which she was mathematical director and Chair of the Planning Committee.[1] As a member of the Planning Committee, Blanch decided which mathematical functions were to be calculated, and constructed the computing plans used by the computers.[7]  While the Planning Committee was in operation, it included women other than Blanch such as Ida Rhodes, Jenny Rosenthal, and Irene Stegun.[1] The Planning Committee was in charge of 450 human computers with varying knowledge of mathematics.[1][7]/nBlanch's duties entailed designing algorithms that were executed by teams of human computers under her direction. Many of these computers possessed only rudimentary mathematical skills, but the algorithms and error checking in the Mathematical Tables Project were sufficiently well designed that their output defined the standard for transcendental function solutions for decades. This project later became the Computation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards. During her last two years at the WPA, she worked as an evening tutor at Brooklyn College.[4]/nThe Mathematical Tables Project became an independent organization following the termination of the WPA at the end of 1942.  During World War II, it operated as a major computing office for the US government and did calculations for the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Army's map grid, the Navy's LORAN radio navigation system, the Manhattan Project and other institutions.[1][7]  The project also performed important calculations for Operation Overlord.  Using a mathematical model developed by Jerzy Neyman, the group helped evaluate strategies designed to bomb the Normandy beaches.[7] Blanch led the group throughout the war./nAfter the war, Blanch's career was hampered by FBI suspicions that she was secretly a communist.[1][4][5] During this time the National Bureau of Standards was investigated by the loyalty board of the Department of Commerce.[4]  Their evidence for her communist ties was scarce and included, for example, the observation that she had never married or had children, as well as the fact that her sister was affiliated with the Communist Party.[3][4] In a May 1952 hearing, all charges were resolved.[4][8]  With her name cleared, she was able to resume her work./nSubsequently, she worked for the Institute for Numerical Analysis at UCLA until it was closed in June 1954.[1] While at UCLA, she interviewed Grace Hopper for a position there, though Hopper instead took a position at UNIVAC.[2] Blanch then became a mathematician for the computer division of Consolidated Engineering in Pasadena, California for a couple of months until a friend she had made at the Mathematical Tables Project, Chief mathematician Knox Millsaps, recruited her to be a senior mathematician for the Aerospace Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.[1][4][5] The Air Force hired her to work on computations dealing with turbulence, air flow, and transonic and supersonic flight.[1] In 1962, Blanch was promoted to government senior scientist.[1] She was an early member of the ACM./nBlanch published over 30 articles on functional approximation, numerical analysis and Mathieu functions. Between 1940 and 1942, while at the Mathematical Tables Project, several important papers were jointly published with Lowan, including a project with physicist Hans Bethe which involved complex calculations to determine various properties of stars.[1][5][7]/nIn 1963, she was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.[11]  In 1964, she received the Federal Woman's Award, an award for women who had exemplary professional service in the United States Government./nBlanch retired in 1967 at the age of 69, but through Ohio State University continued working as a consultant for the Air Force until 1970 when Ohio State canceled all military funded contracts.[1][4] Thereafter she moved to San Diego, California where she worked on her book about functional approximations until it was completed in 1982 but never published.[1][5] Blanch then continued to work on numerical solutions of Mathieu functions, specifically concentrating on the use of continued fractions to achieve highly accurate results in a small number of computational steps to which she completed an unpublished manuscript.[1] She continued this research until her death in January 1996.[1]/nThe Gertrude Blanch Papers, 1932\u20131996 are accessible at the Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.", "49083204": "Panagiota Daskalopoulos is a professor of mathematics at Columbia University[1] whose research involves partial differential equations and differential geometry.[2] At Columbia, she also serves as director of undergraduate studies for mathematics.[1]/nDaskalopoulos earned a degree from the University of Athens in 1986,[2]\nand completed her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1992, under the supervision of Carlos Kenig.[3] After a visiting position at the Institute for Advanced Study, she joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1993, moved to the University of California, Irvine in 1995, and moved again to Columbia in 2001.[2] She was a Guggenheim Fellow in 2004,[4] and an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2014.[5] She is a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California for the term 2013\u20132017.[2] She was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2022.[6] She was awarded the 2023 AMS Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize.[7]/n/nThis article about a mathematician is a stub.

He has been co-credited, along with John William Stubbs, with introducing the geometric concept of inversion in a circle.[1][2]/nIngram was born on 7 July 1823, at the Rectory of Templecarne (Aghnahoo), just south of Pettigo, a village in south-east County Donegal, Ireland into an Ulster Scots family.[3]/nAlthough his ancestry was Scottish Presbyterian, Ingram's grandparents had converted to Anglicanism. His grandfather Captain John Ingram ran a linen mill and had a business as a linen bleacher in Glennane (Lisdrumhure). He was active in the Volunteer Movement and financed in 1782 a volunteer corps in the County Armagh, known as Lisdrumhure Volunteers or Mountnorris Volunteers.[3]/nIngram's father, Rev. William Ingram, a scholar at Trinity College Dublin, rector of the Church of Ireland and curate of Templecarne Parish (Diocese of Clogher), married Elizabeth Cooke in 1817.[3]/nIngram's father died in 1829 and his mother then moved with the family to Newry, to guarantee the best possible education for her five children. Ingram first went to Mr. Lyons' School in Newry from 1829 to 1837. He also attended Drogheda Grammar School./nIn 1840, at the age of sixteen, Ingram published sonnets in the Dublin University Magazine.[3]/nOn 13 October 1837, he matriculated at Trinity College Dublin. He was elected a Scholar of the College in 1840, graduated with a BA in mathematics in 1842, and was awarded an MA in 1850.  He was a member of the College Historical Society.[4]  His early scholarly publications (1842-1847) were in mathematics.[5]  He had a distinguished career at Trinity, spanning over fifty-five years, as a student, fellow and professor, successively of Oratory, English Literature, Jurisprudence and Greek, LL.D, FTCD), subsequently becoming the College Librarian and ultimately its Vice Provost.[3][6]/nDuring his life, Ingram was President of the Library Association of Great Britain, co-founder of the National Library of Ireland, National Library trustee,[5] Vice-president of the Library Association of Ireland, a member of the Royal Irish Academy, co-founder of the Dublin Statistical Society, honorary member of the American Economic Association, member of the English historical school of economics and co-founder of the Hermathena publication.[5]/nOne evening in March 1843 Ingram wrote the poem for which he is best remembered, a political ballad called \"The Memory of the Dead\" (better known as \"Who Fears to Speak of '98\"; or \"Ninety Eight\"), in honour of the Irish Rebellion of 1798 led by the United Irishmen. On that evening, he was in company of his like-minded friends John O'Regan, Thomas O'Regan and George Ferdinand Shaw, all fellow Protestant students at TCD. They spent the evening discussing the 1798 Rebellion when briefly Catholics and Protestants (mainly Presbyterians and Methodists) united to try to overturn the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland from which all of them were excluded. They were stirred by the lack of regard shown for the Irish rebels of 1798 by the contemporary nationalist movement, led by Daniel O'Connell.[6]/nThe poem was published anonymously on 1 April 1843 in Thomas Davis's The Nation Newspaper although in fact its authorship was an open secret in Dublin.[5] The Nation was the publication of the radical and bourgeois-radical wing of \u00d3 Conaill's movement for \"repeal\" of the Act of Union between Ireland and Great Britain. Despite this poem, Ingram showed no nationalist sympathies at any time, maintaining that Ireland was not ready for self-government. \"'The Memory of the Dead' was my only contribution to the 'Nation',\" commented Ingram later.[7] Nevertheless, before he died, Ingram made a manuscript copy of \"Ninety Eight\", proclaiming that he would always defend brave men who opposed tyranny.[8]/nIt was set to music for voice and piano in 1845 by John Edward Pigot.[6] Ingram's ballad was translated into Latin by Robert Yelverton Tyrrell and into Irish by Dr. Douglas Hyde. The song became a popular Irish nationalist anthem. It is one of the best-known of Irish Republican songs and often played by the piper at Republican funerals.[citation needed]/nIngram was one of the writers selected to write \"scholars\" entries for the ninth edition, the tenth edition and the eleventh editions of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. He wrote the entries in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica[6] on Pierre Leroux, Cliffe Leslie, John Ramsay McCulloch,[9] Georg Ludwig von Maurer, William Petty, Francois Quesnay,[9] and Karl Heinrich Rau./nIn his later career Ingram became interested in the nascent disciplines of sociology and economics. He was not a trained economist but rather a sociologist and his early economic writings dealt mainly with the Poor Law. He was a spokesman for historical economics in Britain and influenced many contemporary social and economic thinkers at that time in Great Britain, the United States, and continental Europe.[citation needed]  His attack on classical economics encompassed its methodology and its conclusions.[citation needed] Ingram played an important role in the English Methodenstreit (Battle of methods), (closely associated with the Werturteilsstreit). In his 1888 History of Political Economy he used the term \"economic man\" as a critical description of the human being as conceived by economic theory, and he may have coined the term. From 1891 to 1896 Ingram wrote entries in Palgrave's Dictionary of Economics. He was president of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland between 1878 and 1880 and took over as President of the Royal Irish Academy when William Reeves died in 1892.[10]/nHe also wrote on labour and trade issues, and connecting these to slavery, including domestic slavery in Europe from ancient times onward. His book, A History of Slavery and Serfdom was extremely successful, being translated into eleven languages and serving as a textbook till the 1920s.[citation needed] He also wrote the entries on sumptuary laws and slavery in the 9th,[9] 10th[9] and 11th editions of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Paul O'Higgins attributes the phrase \"labour is not a commodity\" to Ingram, who used it in 1880 during a Dublin meeting of the British Trades Union Congress. It appears as a principle in the preamble to the International Labour Organization's founding documents.[11]/nIngram was active in the fields of mathematics, archaeology, the classics, economics, etymology, law, literature, medieval manuscripts, poetry, religious speculation and Shakespearean criticism.  He wrote extensively on Shakespearean syntax.[citation needed] He worked on advancing the science of classical etymology, notably in his Greek and Latin Etymology in England./nHe also wrote papers on Mexican antiques and contributed papers to mathematical societies on differential calculus and geometrical analysis.[citation needed]/nIngram published several books of poetry and fiction:/nIngram was an advocate of Home Rule for Ireland, though within the context of a more general devolution within the United Kingdom.[citation needed]/nIngram was a firm adherent of Auguste Comte and was also a positivist.
